The last data of Large Sample Survey on Household Consumer Expenditure has been collected by NSSO in its 68th round conducted in 2011-12. Based on this data, the erstwhile Planning Commission estimated poverty lines and poverty ratio in 2011-12 following the extant Tendulkar Committee methodology and released through a Press Note issued on 22nd July 2013. According to this Press Note, the number of persons living below poverty line in India has been estimated as 27 crore in 2011-12. The poverty line was defined on the basis of Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure (MPCE) as the criterion. For the year 2011-12, the poverty line at all India level has been estimated as Monthly Per-capita Consumption Expenditure of Rs. 816 for rural areas and Rs. 1000 for urban areas. The State/UT-wise details of population living below poverty line in 2011-12 are given at Annexure.*****    AnnexureNumber and Percentage of Population below poverty line by states - 2011-12 (Tendulkar Methodology)Sl.No.\\tStates\\tRural\\tUrban\\tTotal\\t\\t% of Persons\\tNo. of Persons (in lakhs)\\t% of Persons\\tNo. of Persons (in lakhs)\\t% of Persons\\tNo. of Persons ( in lakhs)1\\tAndhra Pradesh\\t10.96\\t61.80\\t5.81\\t16.98\\t9.20\\t78.782\\tArunachal Pradesh\\t38.93\\t4.25\\t20.33\\t0.66\\t34.67\\t4.913\\tAssam\\t33.89\\t92.06\\t20.49\\t9.21\\t31.98\\t101.274\\tBihar\\t34.06\\t320.40\\t31.23\\t37.75\\t33.74\\t358.155\\tChhattisgarh\\t44.61\\t88.90\\t24.75\\t15.22\\t39.93\\t104.116\\tDelhi\\t12.92\\t0.50\\t9.84\\t16.46\\t9.91\\t16.967\\tGoa\\t6.81\\t0.37\\t4.09\\t0.38\\t5.09\\t0.758\\tGujarat\\t21.54\\t75.35\\t10.14\\t26.88\\t16.63\\t102.239\\tHaryana\\t11.64\\t19.42\\t10.28\\t9.41\\t11.16\\t28.8310\\tHimachal Pradesh\\t8.48\\t5.29\\t4.33\\t0.30\\t8.06\\t5.5911\\tJammu & Kashmir\\t11.54\\t10.73\\t7.20\\t2.53\\t10.35\\t13.2712\\tJharkhand\\t40.84\\t104.09\\t24.83\\t20.24\\t36.96\\t124.3313\\tKarnataka\\t24.53\\t92.80\\t15.25\\t36.96\\t20.91\\t129.7614\\tKerala\\t9.14\\t15.48\\t4.97\\t8.46\\t7.05\\t23.9515\\tMadhya Pradesh\\t35.74\\t190.95\\t21.00\\t43.10\\t31.65\\t234.0616\\tMaharashtra\\t24.22\\t150.56\\t9.12\\t47.36\\t17.35\\t197.9217\\tManipur\\t38.80\\t7.45\\t32.59\\t2.78\\t36.89\\t10.2218\\tMeghalaya\\t12.53\\t3.04\\t9.26\\t0.57\\t11.87\\t3.6119\\tMizoram\\t35.43\\t1.91\\t6.36\\t0.37\\t20.40\\t2.2720\\tNagaland\\t19.93\\t2.76\\t16.48\\t1.00\\t18.88\\t3.7621\\tOdisha\\t35.69\\t126.14\\t17.29\\t12.39\\t32.59\\t138.5322\\tPunjab\\t7.66\\t13.35\\t9.24\\t9.82\\t8.26\\t23.1823\\tRajasthan\\t16.05\\t84.19\\t10.69\\t18.73\\t14.71\\t102.9224\\tSikkim\\t9.85\\t0.45\\t3.66\\t0.06\\t8.19\\t0.5125\\tTamil Nadu\\t15.83\\t59.23\\t6.54\\t23.40\\t11.28\\t82.6326\\tTripura\\t16.53\\t4.49\\t7.42\\t0.75\\t14.05\\t5.2427\\tUttarakhand\\t11.62\\t8.25\\t10.48\\t3.35\\t11.26\\t11.6028\\tUttar Pradesh\\t30.40\\t479.35\\t26.06\\t118.84\\t29.43\\t598.1929\\tWest Bengal\\t22.52\\t141.14\\t14.66\\t43.83\\t19.98\\t184.9830\\tPuducherry\\t17.06\\t0.69\\t6.30\\t0.55\\t9.69\\t1.2431\\tAndaman & Nicobar Islands\\t1.57\\t0.04\\t0.00\\t0.00\\t1.00\\t0.0432\\tChandigarh\\t1.64\\t0.004\\t22.31\\t2.34\\t21.81\\t2.3533\\tDadra & Nagar Haveli\\t62.59\\t1.15\\t15.38\\t0.28\\t39.31\\t1.4334\\tDaman & Diu\\t0.00\\t0.00\\t12.62\\t0.26\\t9.86\\t0.2635\\tLakshadweep\\t0.00\\t0.00\\t3.44\\t0.02\\t2.77\\t0.02 \\tAll India\\t25.70\\t2166.58\\t13.70\\t531.25\\t21.92\\t2697.83Notes:\\t1.
