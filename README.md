The text_files folder contains the question has been asked to Ministers and respective answer


## The scope of current data
1. current dataset is not clean. it is just a dumpfrom loksabha website
2. The is text dump (ex:http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Questions/QResult15.aspx?qref=58&lsno=16) of this
3. This is only from current loksabha session (Session - 17)

## Plans 

1. going forward I plan to regularly update this
2. get all the older loksabha session
3. write some basic wrapper around text to get a cleaner text

## Where this can be used
1. Know your MP and Ministers better(?)

3. Exploratory analysis around text
