A number of higher educational institutions including Central Universities have already been established. Following the 12th Plan (2012-17), as approved by the National Development Council, the thrust is on consolidation of higher education system. Expansion is to be done mainly by scaling up capacity of the existing institutions in place of setting up new institutions. Further, ‘Education’ being a concurrent subject, the State Governments are also taking various initiatives. *****
