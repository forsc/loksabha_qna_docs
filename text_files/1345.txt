ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE  IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO) (a)	& (b)   Yes, Sir.   The Government is aware that there are large number of Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers in Jharkhand who are dependent on forests. Forest Survey of India, Dehradun, a  subordinate  organization  under  the  Ministry carries out the assessment of forest cover of the country biennially and the findings are published in India State of Forest Report (ISFR). As per the latest report i.e. ISFR- 2017, the total forest and tree cover in the State of Jharkhand is 26,475 square kilometer (forest cover 23,553 square kilometer, tree cover 2922 square kilometer) which is 33.21 percent of the total geographical area of the State.  However, for conservation, development and enrichment of forest cover in the country including State of Jharkhand, afforestation programmes are being taken up under various Centrally Sponsored Schemes such as National Afforestation Programme (NAP) and Green India Mission (GIM) being implemented by Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. Afforestation activities are also taken up under various programmes/funding sources such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) and Compensatory Afforestation Fund.       (c) to (e) There is no proposal to establish any specialized institute for conducting studies and research on forests and for management of forest resources in the State of Jharkhand. However, Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE), Dehradun an autonomous organization under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) is undertaking holistic research on forestry through its nine research institutes and five Regional Centres situated in the different agro-climatic zones of the country. Institute of Forest Productivity, Ranchi is one of the research institute of ICFRE in the State of Jharkhand with mandate to undertake and promote forestry research, education and extension, leading to scientific and sustainable management of forest resources.  ********
