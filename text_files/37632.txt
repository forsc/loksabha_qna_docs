ANSWER




                                                              MINISTER OF STATE					(SHRI AJAY BHATT)      IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE(a):  Yes, Sir.  (b) to (e): No, Sir.(i)	Army Public Schools are established under aegis of Army Welfare and Education Society to cater to education requirements for wards of Indian Army Personnel who hail from diverse backgrounds and regions of India with different mother tongues. (ii)	Unlike other schools with students from the immediate and extended locality, all 136 Army Public Schools are enrolled primarily with wards of Indian Army Personnel, who have been transferred-in from another location. (iii)	Due to the nature of service, Indian Army Personnel are transferred frequently, at short notice, and mostly in the midst of the academic calendar and at times in field locations away from their families.  (iv)	The relatively limited period of stay of families with serving personnel in station and frequent transfer necessitated standardisation of the languages i.e. English, Hindi and Sanskrit which was undertaken since inception of the schools in 1950.(v)	The change of regional language in the middle of an academic session will place unnecessary educational burden, in addition to emotional turmoil due to academic instability that Army wards have to endure when transferred into a new environment every few years. ********
