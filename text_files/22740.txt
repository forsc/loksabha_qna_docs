                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) 	Development of reliable drinking water sources and/ or augmentation of existing sources to provide assured water supply system in villages is an integral part of Jal Jeevan Mission. Provision has been made for the preparation of Village Action Plan (VAP) by village community, which inter alia includes strengthening of drinking water sources in convergence with other schemes such as MGNREGS, 15thFinance Commission tied grants to rural local bodies/ PRIs, MP& MLA’s Local Area Development Fund, District Mineral Development Fund, CSR fund, etc.In 2019, Government of India also launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), an intensive water conservation campaign with five targeted interventions i.e. water conservation and rainwater harvesting; renovation of traditional and other water bodies; reuse and recharge of borewells; watershed development and intensive afforestation, to improve water availability including ground water in 1,592 water–stressed blocks of 256 districts of the country. This year, Jal Shakti Abhiyan is likely to be launched on World Water Day i.e. March 22, 2021. (b) 	JJM, being implemented in partnership with States, aims at universal coverage of every rural household through tap water connection by 2024. Government of India supplements the efforts of States/ UTs by providing them with financial and technical assistance. So far, an amount of around Rs. 20,000 Crore has been made available to the States as Central fund under JJM. Further, to ensure the successful implementation of time-bound mission-mode programme, Govt. of India has been regularly reviewing the implementation of the Mission with the State governments. Several meetings including conferences, workshops, review meetings through video conferences, field visits, etc. are being held from time to time,wherein States are advised to plan and expedite the implementation to achieve the goal in time-bound manner. (c) 	Under JJM, States/ UTs can utilize upto 2% of their annual allocation for taking up water quality monitoring & surveillance activities. States/ UTs have been advised to upgrade different level of laboratories i.e. State, district, sub-division and/ or block level and get NABL accreditation and/ or recognition. As reported, States/ UTs are upgrading water quality testing laboratories and opening them to public for enabling them to get their water samples tested at nominal rates. Recently in the ‘Conference of States/ UT’s Ministers on Jal Jeevan Mission’ held on March 13, 2021, ‘Drinking Water Quality Monitoring & Surveillance Framework’ has been released to help the States/ UTs to carry out water quality testing, online reporting, monitoring and surveillance of drinking water sources, etc. To bring in transparency and facilitate water quality testing and reporting by following the aforesaid framework, JJM – Water Quality Management Information System (WQMIS) has also been launched.   ****
