The ASI data covers number of units, number of persons engaged in such units and other parameters including fixed capital etc. However, data for annual turnover is not reported in the ASI. The latest state-wise data under ASI is available up to the year 2017-18. The state-wise number of registered food processing units during 3 years since 2015-16 including in the state of Bihar, as reported in ASI, is placed at Annexure.                Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) has been implementing a central sector umbrella scheme- Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) for overall growth and development of food processing sector of the country including of Bihar. Under component schemes of PMKSY, MoFPI provides mostly credit linked financial assistance (capital subsidy) in the form of grants-in-aid to entrepreneurs for setting up of food processing / preservation industries. PMKSY is not any region or state specific but demand driven and is implemented across the country including Bihar. Since 2018-19, a total of 521 infrastructure projects have been approved across the country under different component schemes of PMKSY. *****
