ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d) No, Sir. It is estimated that Indian Railways would need Capital investment of around ? 50 lakh crore upto 2030 for network expansion and capacity augmentation, rolling stock induction and other modernization works to enable better delivery of passenger and freight services and to improve its modal share in transport. To bridge the gap in capital funding and to induct modern technologies and improve efficiencies, it is being planned to use Public Private Partnership (PPP) model for few initiatives. One of the PPP initiatives is to invite applications to invest and induct modern rakes over select routes to provide world class services to the passengers. As part of this initiative, Ministry of Railways have issued 12 Requests for Qualification (RFQs) on 1st July, 2020 for operation of passenger trains over approximately 109 origin-destination pairs (divided into 12 clusters) through PPP on Design, Build, Finance and Operate (“DBFO”) basis.  The routes are spread across the entire Indian Railway network and the list is available in the public domain namely,  http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/IndicativeRoutesfor12clusters.pdf. The details of the participants will be known after the application due date, i.e. 07.10.2020. The selection of the operators will be done through a transparent bidding process and so far, no passenger train service has been allocated to any private company. The revenue which shall be generated under this initiative can be estimated upon the completion of the bidding process.(e) & (f) Electrification of Kollam – Punalur Section is already sanctioned and planned for commissioning during 2021-22. ? 20 crores have been allocated for this work during 2020-21.(g) In view of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Indian Railways are presently operating limited special trains, taking into consideration the concerns and suggestions of the State Governments. At present, there is no immediate proposal to re-introduce train services between Kollam and Madurai. However, re-introduction of services is a gradual process keeping in view the suggestions and requests of State Governments.*****
