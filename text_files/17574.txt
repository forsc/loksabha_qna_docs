                                                        (a) to (c):	To attract application of Chapter V-B of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, an establishment shall fulfill the conditions specified by Section 25K of Chapter V-B of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 that reads “25K Application of Chapter VB.-- The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to an industrial establishment (not being an establishment of a seasonal character or in which work is performed only intermittently) Contd..2/-:: 2 ::in which not less than [one hundred] workmen were employed on an average per working day for the preceding twelve months”.The Ministry receives suggestions from time to time from various stakeholders for changes in labour laws.(d): 		Reforms in labour laws are a continuous process, therefore, Central Government strives on regular basis in consultation with all the stakeholders to update the legislative system as per the need of the hour so as to further strengthen the labour protection in terms of job security, wages, occupational safety, health, working conditions, social security and welfare. Central Government has taken steps to codify the existing Labour Laws into 4 Labour Codes. Consultations were also carried out with Central Trade Unions, Employers’ Associations and State Governments on four Labour Codes. Out of the 4 Labour Codes, the Code on Wages, 2019, was notified on 8th August, 2019 in the Gazette of India. The rest 3 Codes i.e. the Occupational Safety Health & Working Conditions Code, 2019, the Industrial Relations Code, 2019 and the Code on Social Security, 2019 had been introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2019 and referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour for examination. After receipt of the reports of the Standing Committee, the requisite steps have been taken for reintroduction of all these Codes.******
