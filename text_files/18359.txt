ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) & (b)	Yes Sir. The Ministry has issued guideline dated 17th October, 2019 in consultation with the Ministry of Coal that non-forest mined out lands which have been reclaimed technically and restored biologically which are available with the Coal India Limited and its subsidiaries, can be used for raising Compensatory Afforestation (CA), in lieu of their proposals submitted for prior approval of the Central Government under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.(c) & (d)	Yes Sir. Following initiatives have been taken by the Government of India to implement Compensatory Afforestation in other areas too in view of the changes in environment:(i)	States/UTs with more than 75% of forest cover of their respective geographical areas may take up CA in any other state/UT having deficient forest land/cover.(ii)	Normally, a patch of minimum size of 5.0 ha patches is considered for raising CA. However, patches irrespective of size, including smaller in size than 5.0 ha are also considered if they are located contiguous to Reserve Forest (RF)/Protected Forest (PF).(iii)	In case, non-forest land for CA is not available in the same district, it can be identified anywhere else in the concerned/State/Union territory, near to the site of diversion as far as possible, so as to minimize adverse impact on the micro-ecology of the area.(iv)	In exceptional cases where non-forest land for CA is not available in the same State/UT in which the diversion of forest land is proposed, land for CA can be identified in any other State/UTs, preferably in neighbouring State/UTs. (v)	Any non-forest land for the purpose of Compensatory afforestation (CA), selected by the State Government, in lieu of forest land to be diverted, is accepted by MoEF&CC irrespective of crown density. ***
