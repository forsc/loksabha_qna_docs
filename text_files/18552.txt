These are (i) COVID Care Center with isolation beds for mild or pre-symptomatic cases; (ii) Dedicated COVID Health Centre (DCHC) with oxygen supported isolation beds for moderate cases and (iii) Dedicated COVID Hospital (DCH) with ICU beds for severe cases. These DCHCs or DCH may be a full hospital or a separate block in a hospital with preferably separate entry/exit/zoning. In addition, Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) has set up large dedicated COVID-19 field hospitals with capacities ranging from 1000 to 10,000 isolation beds. These temporary hospitals have been set up in Delhi, Bihar (Patna and Muzaffarpur). All States including Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have accordingly taken action to create such infrastructure.Hospital infrastructure in the country for managing COVID-19 cases is being continuously monitored by Government of India. States have been advised to prepare for requisite surge capacities to manage cases, in accordance with existing and projected growth rates.States/UTs are being provided required technical and financial assistance for managing the COVID-19 public health challenge. Public Health & Hospitals being a State subject, the primary responsibility of strengthening of healthcare system lies with respective State Government.All the States/UTs are provided with necessary financial support under India COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Package. During FY 2020-21, funds of Rs 4256.81 crore have been released to the States/ UTs.  In addition, States are being supported in terms of supply of logistics. So far 1.42 Crore of PPE Kits, 3.45 crores N-95 masks, 10.84 crore tablets of Hydroxychloroquine, 30,841 ventilators and 1,02,400 oxygen cylinders have been supplied to States/UTs/ Central Government hospitals so far (as reported on 20th September, 2020).Pandemics caused by a new virus have the propensity to infect human population in multiple waves, each time affecting a cohort of susceptible population. Some countries, which had initially successfully contained the COVID-19 outbreak earlier are now reporting a resurgence of cases. Government of India has advised States accordingly to upgrade health infrastructure based on the case growth trajectory in respective States/districts, besides taking stringent containment measures.
