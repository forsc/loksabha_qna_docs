ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) 	The trees are removed only when it is absolutely necessary. Moreover, as per the Government policy, more trees are planted than number of trees approved for removal under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Because of this policy, India’s forest cover is increasing. As per the provisions of Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, Government of India accords prior permission for use of forest land for non-forest purposes. Such permissions are accorded with the recommendation of the concerned State/UT and for inescapable projects/purposes. While according permission under the provisions of the Act, the Central Government allows removal of minimum number trees. Moreover, conditions regarding translocation of trees and phase wise removal of trees under the strict supervision of State/UT Forest Department are invariably stipulated to minimize the number of trees to be removed. (b)	There is no harmful effect of fertilizers applied in a balanced and judicious manner. Government recommends soil health test based use of chemical fertilizers, bio-fertilizers and locally available organic manures like Farm Yard Manure, compost, vermi-compost and green manure etc. to maintain soil health and its productivity. Pesticides are toxic substances but they do not pose any adverse effect on human beings, animals and the environment if they are used as per the label and leaflet approved by the Registration Committee. Pesticides are registered for use in the country by the Registration Committee only after satisfying about their efficacy and safety to human health, animal and environment.However, with regard to the safety and efficacy, registered pesticides are periodically reviewed. On receipt of new studies / reports/ references/ information by government from time to time, the review is done by appointing expert committees. Based on the recommendations of such expert committees and after due consultation with Registration Committee, the Ministry of Agriculture takes appropriate action for import, manufacture or sale of pesticides in the country.(c)	The Central Government implements a scheme namely, “Flood Management and Border Areas Programme (FMBAP)", which has components such as river management, anti-erosion, restoration of damaged flood management works, anti-sea erosion, flood proofing, etc.Further, the Central Government has launched a Centrally Sponsored Scheme namely, “Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana” for the development of rainfed/degraded lands. The activities undertaken, inter-alia, include ridge area treatment, drainage line treatment, soil & moisture conservation, rain water harvesting, nursery raising, afforestation, horticulture, pasture development, livelihood for asset less persons, etc. Under this scheme an amount of Rs.19,709.29 crore has been released as Central share to the States as on 31.01.2021. Since 2014-15 to 2020-21, approximately 32.44 lakh farmers are benefited from the scheme by undertaking construction/rejuvenation of approximately 7.093 lakh water harvesting structures and covering additional area of 15.17 lakh under protective irrigation.***
