ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) to (f):	The Central Government has adopted a multi-pronged approach to ensure effective surveillance and domination of international borders to check infiltration of illegal migrants.  Physical infrastructure like border fencing, floodlighting, construction of border roads and establishment of border outposts has been created.  Vulnerable border outposts are regularly reviewed and strengthened by -2-L.S.US.Q.NO.1744 FOR 02.07.2019deploying additional manpower, special surveillance equipments and other force multipliers. A technological solution in the form of Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS) has been implemented in some vulnerable border areas.  	Border guarding forces conduct regular patrolling, lay nakas and establish observation posts and carry out anti-tunnelling exercises to stop illegal infiltration.  However, some illegal migrants are able to enter in a clandestine and surreptitious manner, mainly due to difficult  riverine   terrain in parts of the long international borders with Bangladesh.  There is no accurate central data regarding exact number of such illegal immigrants and any demographic change in North Eastern states.	Ministry of Home Affairs has issued instructions to State Govts./UTs advising them to ensure that no Aadhaar card is issued to illegal migrants. State Governments have been further advised to cancel other state level identification documents fraudulently obtained by illegal migrants vizS. voter card, driving license, ration card etc. and initiate deportation proceedings as per provisions of law. The States/UTs have also been advised to share with the UIDAI the particulars of those illegal migrants who have wrongfully obtained Aadhaar Cards for appropriate legal action. ******
