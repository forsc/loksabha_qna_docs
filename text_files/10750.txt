                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a) to (f):  A statement is laid on the Table of the HouseSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 371* FOR 13TH DECEMBER, 2019(a) & (b) As per National Cancer Registry Program data of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the estimated number of incidence of Breast and Cervical cancer for the country during the last three year is given below:Year	2016	2017	2018Estimated Breast cancer cases	1,42,283	1,50,842	1,59,924Estimated Cervical cancer cases	99,099	1,00,306	1,01,536	The estimated number of incidence of such cases reported during the last three years, State/UT wise is at Annexure-I and II.(c) & (d): Health is a State subject and the Central Government supplements the efforts of the State Governments to prevent and control cancer. The objectives of National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), being implemented by Central Government under National Health Mission(NHM) for interventions upto the district level, includes awareness generation for Cancer prevention, screening, early detection and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. For cancer the focus is on three cancers, namely breast, cervical and oral.  A population level initiative for prevention, control and screening for common Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) i.e. diabetes, hypertension and common cancers viz. oral, breast and cervical cancer, has been rolled out in over 215 districts of the country under NHM, as a part of comprehensive primary healthcare. Under the initiative persons more than 30 years of age are targeted for their screening for common NCDs. Screening of common NCDs including three common cancers i.e. oral, breast and cervical is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres.(e):	Under the NPCDCS, Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA) is used as the screening tool for cervical cancer. (f): 	To tackle the challenge of Non Communicable Diseases (NCD), including cancers, 599 NCD Clinics at District level and 3,274 NCD Clinics at Community Health Centre level have been set up under NPCDCS.  Under NHM support is provided to States/UTs to provide free essential medicines and diagnostic services for primary and secondary health care needs. 		To enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer, the Central Government is implementing Strengthening of Tertiary Care for Cancer Scheme, under which setting up of 18 State Cancer Institutes and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres have been approved.  Further, Oncology is also one of the focus areas in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar in Haryana and strengthening of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, are also steps in the same direction. 	Cancer is diagnosed and treated at various levels in the health care system. In Government hospitals, treatment is either free or highly subsidized. Treatment of cancers is also available under Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY). Besides this, Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment (AMRIT) Deendayal outlets have been opened at 169 Institutions/Hospitals with an objective to make available Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases drugs and implants at discounted prices to the patients. Under the umbrella scheme of Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi, financial assistance is provided to families living below threshold poverty line for their treatment, including treatment of cancer, in Government hospitals.
