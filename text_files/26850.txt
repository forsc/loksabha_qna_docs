THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI SOM PARKASH)(a) to (c):      	‘Make in India’ is an initiative which was launched on 25th September  2014 to facilitate investment, foster innovation, building best in class infrastructure, and making India a hub for manufacturing, design, and innovation. The development of a robust manufacturing sector continues to be a key priority of the Indian Government. It is one of the first ‘Vocal for Local’ initiatives that exposed India’s manufacturing domain to the world. The sector has the potential to not only take economic growth to a higher trajectory but also to provide employment to a large pool of our young labour force. The ‘Make in India’ initiative is not a State/ district/ cities/ area specific initiative rather it is being implemented all over the country. The Government of India is making continuous efforts under Investment Facilitation, including financial assistance to Invest India and implementation of Make in India action plans to identify and handhold potential investors. Support is being provided to Indian Missions abroad and State Governments for organising events, summits, road-shows and other promotional activities to attract investment in the country under the Make in India banner. Investment Outreach activities are being carried out for enhancing International  co-operation for promoting FDI and improve Ease of Doing Business in the country.  Steps have been taken to improve Ease of Doing Business, including simplification and rationalisation of existing processes. As a result of the measures taken to improve the country’s investment climate, India jumped to 63rd place in World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business ranking as per World Bank’s Doing Business Report (DBR) 2020. This is driven by reforms in the areas of Starting a Business, Paying Taxes, Trading Across Borders, and Resolving Insolvency, etc.Activities under the initiative are also undertaken through schemes/ programmes, by several Central Government Ministries/ Departments and various State Governments from time to time. The details of these measures are not centrally maintained. *****
