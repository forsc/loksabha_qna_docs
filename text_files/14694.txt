                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b)As per Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1.5 Degree Special Report (2018), climate related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, etc. are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5 °Cor more, and disadvantaged and vulnerable populations including children are at higher risk of adverse consequences.The reports of IPCC, WHO and others indicate health implications due to various climate variables including extreme weather events affecting vector-borne and water-borne illnesses or non-communicable diseases. The vulnerable population including children are more prone to experience adverse effects of these exposures.(c) and (d) Under the Paris Agreement, India has submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to reduce the GHG emissions intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level. It has envisaged achieving about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030 and create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion ton of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. As per India’s second Biennial Update Report (BUR) submitted to the UNFCCC in December 2018, India’s emissions intensity of its GDP has decreased by 21% in 2014 as compared to 2005 levels.Further, the Government is implementing National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which provides an overarching policy framework for climate actionsin the country with eight Missions-(i) National Solar Mission (ii) National Mission on Enhanced Energy Efficiency (iii) National Water Mission (iv) National Mission on Sustainable Habitat (v) National Mission on Sustaining Himalayan Ecosystem (vi) National Green India Mission (vii) National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture and (viii) National Mission on Strategic Knowledge on Climate Change. To support the objectives of NAPCC, 33 States and Union Territories have already prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) to address State specific actions. In addition, the Government has also established   the National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC) to support climate adaptation actions of the States and Union Territories in the country.* * * * *
