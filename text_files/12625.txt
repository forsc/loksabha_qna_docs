ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????  (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d):	Under the Rythu Bharosa scheme Government of Andhra Pradesh proposed to give Rs.12,500 per year to each farmer family inclusive of benefit of Rs.6000 per year given under PM-KISAN by Government of India. The Scheme of the State also aimed to cover the tenant farmers. State Government had requested to release the payments under PM-KISAN Scheme as a lumpsum amount instead of payments in installments. The above request of Government of Andhra Pradesh was not accepted since income support under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme to all land holding farmers’ families in the country, subject to certain exclusions, paid in three equal installments of Rs. 2000/- each, to enable them to take care of expenses related to agriculture and allied activities as well as domestic needs so as to protect them from falling in the clutches of moneylenders for meeting such expenses and ensure their continuance in the farming activities is uniformly applicable to all State/UTs.********
