The number of passengers in operational metro rail projects across the country have increased from 127.78 crore in 2015 to 262.68 crore in 2019 due to expansion of metro rail network, route rationalization with other modes of transport, provision of parking facility at metro stations, first and last mile connectivity, use of social media to outreach more commuters, other promotional attractions for commuters such as discount on journeys performed using smart cards, discounted parking fees for daily commuters etc.(d), (e) & (f)	No proposal has been received in this Ministry from concerned State Governments for implementation of metro rail in North-Eastern region including Tripura. The details of metro rail proposals received from Governments of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, along with the action taken by this Ministry, are given in Annexure I.                                     *****
