                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI DANVE RAOSAHEB DADARAO)(a) & (b) :  Government has taken various measures from time to time to stabilize prices of essential food items including onions which, inter-alia, include appropriately utilizing trade and fiscal policy instruments like import duty and export management through instruments like Minimum Export Price, export restrictions, etc., to regulate domestic availability and moderate prices; imposition of stock limits and advising States/UTs for effective action against hoarders & black marketers. The benefits to exporters of onions under Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) was withdrawn through notification dated 11.06.2019. Government, on 29 September 2019, imposed stock limits on traders across the country – 100 quintals on retail traders and 500 quintals on wholesale traders under the Essential Commodities Act, to address the rise in price of Onion. Also, initially, Minimum Export Price (MEP) of $850 was imposed on 13.11.2019 and subsequently export of onions was banned on 29 September, 2019 to improve its domestic availability. The Government has also decided to import up to 1 LMT of onion through MMTC and procure surplus onion from Rajasthan for distribution in deficit States/UTs. Government is also implementing Price Stabilization Fund (PSF) to help moderate the volatility in prices of agri-horticultural commodities like pulses, onion, and potato. Also, appropriate Minimum Support Prices are promulgated to incentivize farmers for increasing production. Government is also implementing Schemes which, inter alia, include Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), National Food Security Mission (NFSM), etc. for increasing agricultural production and productivity through appropriate interventions. Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) is implementing scheme “Operation Greens” for integrated development of Tomato, Onion and Potato (TOP) value chain which, inter alia, has the objective of price stabilization for producers and consumers through production planning in the TOP clusters and introduction of dual use varieties.*****
