ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF MINES, COAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a) to (d): Before execution of mining lease under the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, every mine is required to obtain statutory clearances from various departments of the Central Government and respective State Governments, including Environmental Clearance and Forest Clearance. Environmental Clearance is issued based on the Environment Impact Assessment of the mine.To reduce the environmental impact and carbon footprint associated with mining, Chapter V of the Mineral Conservation and Development Rules (MCDR) 2017, prescribes rules for sustainable mining; removal and utilisation of top soil; storage of overburden, waste rock etc.; precaution against ground vibrations; control of surface subsidence; precaution against air pollution; discharge of toxic liquid; precaution against noise; permissible limits and standards; and, restoration of flora.Ministry of Mines through Indian Bureau of Mines has instituted the system of Star Rating for evaluation of sustainability footprints while conducting prospecting, mining, beneficiation or metallurgical operations in an area. Under Rule 35 of MCDR 2017, every lessee is mandated to obtain at least three star rating within four years from 28.02.2017 or date of commencement of mining operations and thereafter maintain the same on year on year basis.Further, Rule 22 to 25 of MCDR 2017 deal with the Mine Closure Plan, Reclamation and Rehabilitation activities. As per Rule 26 of MCDR 2017, every holder of a mining lease has the responsibility to ensure that the protective measures, including reclamation and rehabilitation works, have been carried out in accordance with the approved mine closure plan or with such modifications as approved by the competent authority.Mining leases/sites are encouraged to generate and use green energy. In this regard Indian Bureau of Mines has taken up a sample survey of 293 mines to map the installation of renewable energy plants and electricity consumption at the mine sites across the country. It was noted in the survey that total installed renewable energy plant capacity at these mine sites is approx. 583 Megawatts (Wind and Solar).*****
