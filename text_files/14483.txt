                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b)	The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component and 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). The Pre-feasibility reports (PFRs) of all the 30 links have been completed and circulated to party States. The Feasibility Reports (FRs) of 14 links under Peninsular Component and 2 links of Himalayan Component have been prepared. The draft FRs of 7 links under Himalayan Component have also been completed.Under the NPP, four priority links have been identified for preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPR) under the Peninsular Rivers Component viz; Ken-Betwa link project (KBLP), Damanganga-Pinjal link project, Par-Tapi-Narmada link project and Godavari-Cauvery link project. The DPRs of KBLP, Damanganga-Pinjal link project and Par-Tapi-Narmada link project have been sent to the concerned States.Further, draft DPR of Godavari-Cauvery link project consisting of three links viz; Godavari (Inchampalli/Janampet) – Krishna (Nagarjunasagar), Krishna (Nagarjunasagar) – Pennar (Somasila), Pennar (Somasila)-Cauvery (Grand Anicut) link projects has been completed and circulated to party States in March 2019.Contd…P/2//2//The implementation of Inter linking of Rivers (ILR) projects under NPP envisage benefit of 25 million ha of irrigation from surface water, 10 million ha by increased use of ground water, raising the ultimate irrigation potential from 140 million ha to 175 million ha.(c) & (d)	Under the ILR programme of NPP, the following two link projects are concerned with Tungabhadra sub-basin, namely:i)	Krishna (Almatti) - Pennar link projectii)	Bedti-Varada link project  NWDA has prepared a FR of Krishna (Almatti) - Pennar link project under NPP. The link project envisages diversion of 1980 MCM of waters from Krishna River for enroute utilisation in Krishna and Pennar basins. According to the FR, the link canal has been aligned to pass through the Tungabhadra sub-basin which would finally outfall into Maddileru River, a tributary of Pennar River. Also, the link canal is crossing Tungabhadra River in the downstream of Tungabhadra dam.The Bedti-Varada link project has been proposed to divert 242 MCM of surplus waters of Bedti basin to Varada River, a tributary of Tungabhadra River to meet the water shortage under the LBC command of Tungabhadra project. The PFR of this link project was completed by NWDA and sent to Government of Karnataka.Subsequently, the Government of Karnataka has also proposed an intra-State link proposal for Bedti- Dharma-Varada link project for which the Pre-feasibility report was also prepared by NWDA and sent to Government of Karnataka. This link project envisages diversion of 551 MCM of waters by lifting from the proposed Surename dam across Bedti river and let into a tributary of Dharma river (ultimately joining Tungbhadra river) through a feeder canal. From the Dharma reservoir, a link canal has been proposed to transfer the water for irrigation in Haveri, Gadag districts of Karnataka State.One more intra-state link proposal viz., Aghanashini-Varada link project has been received from Government of Karnataka for which also the pre-feasibility report was prepared by NWDA and sent to Government of Karnataka. The proposal envisages to divert 177 MCM of surplus waters by lifting from the proposed Hemagini dam site on river Aghanashini to Varada river for utilisation under Tungabhadra project command.*****
