                                                        MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) The functioning of the Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) is reviewed by the KendriyaVidyalaya Sangathan (KVS), an autonomous organization under the Ministry of HumanResource Development which is responsible for establishment and management ofKendriya Vidyalayas.The functioning of KVS is being regularly reviewed and monitoredby the Ministry of Human Resource Development. Annual action plan and medium termstrategic plans are drawn up along with key result areas for monitoring theperformance.The performance of the KVS is also reported to the Parliament through itsAnnual reports and Audited statements of accounts every year.As on date, there are 1225 KVs (including 59 in the State of Maharashtra)functioning in the country. State /UT-wise details are at Annexure I.(b) 104 KVs (including 02 in Maharashtra and 07 in Jharkhand) have been openedduring last 3 years i.e. 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 and current year. The State/UT - wisedetails are at Annexure-II.The Government of India had sanctioned 13 new KVs in August, 2018 andanother 50 new KVs in March, 2019. Out of these, 36 KVs have been opened and madefunctional so far. In the remaining 27 cases, the sponsoring authorities concerned haveto transfer the identified / demarcated land in favour of KendriyaVidyalaya Sangathan(KVS) and also handover possession of the temporary building before administrativeorders for opening of the KVs can be issued. The State/UT-wise details are at Annexure-III.(c) 79 KV buildings have been constructed in different states (including Maharashtra)during the last three yearsand the current year. State / UT wise details are at Annexure –IV.<pre>Funds allocated to Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan for construction relatedactivities during the last three years and the current year are as under:(Rs. in Crore)Year Budget Allocation2016-17 476.732017-18 674.242018-19 231.35B.E. 2019-20 143.90</pre>The allocation of funds is not made State/UT wise.(d) For opening of new Kendriya Vidyalayas, one of the mandatory requirements isthe availability of free of cost suitable landwhich is to be provided by the SponsoringAuthorities by furnishing proposals in the prescribed proformae.KVS has informed that118 proposals have been received from various sponsoring authorities in the prescribedproformae, out of which, only 18 proposals has been found to be fulfilling the necessarypre-requisites as per norms of KVS. The remaining proposals have been referred backto the concerned sponsoring authorities for removal of discrepancies.(e) & (f): The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme provides for opening of one JNV ineach district of the country. All the districts of the State of Maharashtra are coveredunder Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme (except Mumbai City and Mumbai Suburban whichare urban districts). Opening of new JNVs is a continuous process which depends onthe willingness of the concerned State Government/UT Administration to make availablerequisite suitable land free of cost and making available required temporary building,free of rent to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However,actual sanction and opening of new JNV depends on availability of funds and approvalby the competent authority.The Kendriya Vidyalayas are opened primarily to cater to the educational needsof the wards of transferable Central Government Employees including Defencepersonnel on receipt of the proposal in the prescribed proformae from Ministries /Departments of Government of India / State Governments / Union TerritoryAdministration committing thereby availability of requisite resources for setting up a newKV as well as on availability of necessary sanction of the Government. The proposalsreceived from various sponsoring authorities for opening of new KVs also have tocompete among other proposals under the “Challenge Method”.
