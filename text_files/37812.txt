                                                        THE MINISTER OF AYUSH(SHRI SARBANANDA SONOWAL)(a) To assure safety and quality of Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Homeopathy medicines, the manufacturing of these medicines has been brought under the scope of Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and rules made thereunder. As per the provisions of the Drugs rules, 1945, manufacturing license is granted by the concerned State Licensing Authority only after ensuring that the requirements specified under Schedule T for Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani medicines and Schedule M1 for Homoeopathy medicines.The Ministry of Ayush has also implemented a Central Sector Scheme of Pharmacovigilance of Ayurveda, Siddha Unani& Homeopathy drugs since June 2018 for inculcating the culture of Adverse Drug Events (ADE) reporting, documentation and analysis for further regulatory action. The Scheme has an established three tier network. All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA), New Delhi has been designated as the National Pharmacovigilance Coordination Centre (NPvCC). At present, there are 5 Intermediary Pharmacovigilance Centres (IPvC’s) and 74 Peripheral Pharmacovigilance Centres (PPvC’s). International standards for AYUSH products are governed by WHO-GMP, EU-GMP or any other standards that are laid down by the importing countries and to comply with other requirements of importing countries. The WHO certification scheme, which is a scheme of Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (COPP) is issued by National Regulatory Authority (NRA) for the purpose of international commerce i.e. for registration of products in foreign countries. Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) issues Certification of Pharmaceutical Product (COPP) to Ayurvedic, Siddha or Unani products after examination of such applications in consultation with the Ministry of Ayush.In addition to the above, for facilitating export, the Ministry of Ayush encourages following certifications of AYUSH products as per details below:-(i) Certification of Pharmaceutical Products (CoPP) as per WHO Guidelines for herbal products.(ii) Quality Certifications Scheme implemented by the Quality Council of India (QCI) for grant of AYUSH Premium mark to Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani products on the basis of third party evaluation of quality in accordance with the status of compliance to international standards.	Further, on 25th March, 2022 a Host Country agreement has been signed between the Government of India and the World Health Organization (WHO) at Geneva for establishment of the WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine (WHO GCTM) in Jamnagar, Gujarat.

In order to provide maximum benefit of Ayush systems of medicine, a Nation-wide campaign for distribution of AYUSH-64 and KabasuraKudineer (Siddha Medicine) was taken up across the country. CCRAS has transferred AYUSH-64 manufacturing technology through National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) to 46 manufacturing units for manufacturing of AYUSH-64.•	During COVID-19/Omicron surge the Ministry promoted the use of Ayuraksha Kit, BalRaksha Kit and Ayur care Kit for the health promotion of the masses. In this regard all the State licensing authorities were informed that requirement of separate Licence for making kits with the specified components of Ayuraksha Kit, BalRaksha Kit and Ayur care Kit for the manufacturers having valid license of the individual component of the kit is not required.iii.
