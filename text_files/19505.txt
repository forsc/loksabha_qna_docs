ANSWER




 MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a) to (c): 	Department of School Education and Literacy (DoSEL), Ministry of Education is implementing Samagra Shiksha - an  Integrated Scheme for School Education (ISSE). Under Samagra Shiksha, there is a provision of flexible funds for innovation for States and UTs which, inter-alia, can be used for transport and escort facility to children in Classes IX-XII in form of bus passes, cycles etc. Many of the States/UTs have implemented this option as an incentive to increase enrolment especially for girls. Under Samagra Shiksha, there is also a provision of annual stipend for girls belonging to CWSN(Chidren with Special Needs) @ Rs. 200 per month for 10 months.Further, DoSEL, Ministry of Education is implementing a Central Sector Scheme ‘National Means-cum-Merit Scholarship Scheme (NMMSS)’ since 2008 with the objective to award scholarships to meritorious students, including girls, of Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) to arrest their drop-out at class VIII and encourage them to continue the study at Secondary Stage.  The scholarships are awarded to meritorious students, whose parental income from all sources is not more than Rs. 1,50,000/- per annum. Under the scheme, one lakh fresh scholarships of Rs.12000/- per annum per student are awarded to selected students of class IX  every year and are  continued/renewed  in classes X to XII for study in a State Government, Government-aided and Local body schools under the scheme. The scheme has helped in reducing the drop-out rate at the secondary and senior secondary classes. Moreover, the Central Sector Scheme of Scholarship for College and University Students is being implemented since 2008 with the objective to provide financial assistance to the meritorious students having family income of less than Rs. 8 lakh per annum, to meet a part of their day-to-day expenses while pursuing higher studies. The scholarships are awarded on the basis of the results of Senior Secondary Examination. 50% of the scholarship is earmarked for girls. The rate of the Scholarship is Rs. 10000/- per annum at Graduation level for the first three years of College and University courses and Rs. 20000/- per annum at Post Graduation level. Students pursuing professional course, in case, where the duration of course is five years/integrated course  would get Rs. 20000/- per annum in the 4th and 5th year.   *****
