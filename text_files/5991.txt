Most of the labs in these networks are testing and carrying out surveillance for seasonal influenza A (H3N2) in addition to Influenza A H1N1.The laboratories send their data to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and IDSP, where the data is compiled and analysed for cases confirmed in the laboratories’ network.
