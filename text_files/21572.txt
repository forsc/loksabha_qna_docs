As regards, connectivity of Bareilly with stations like Chennai, Bangaluru & Pune, passengers may avail changeover at Delhi. Introduction of direct train from Bareilly to Chennai,  Bangaluru and Pune is not feasible, at present, due to operational and resource constraints. However, introduction of trains is an ongoing process on Indian Railways, subject to operational feasibility and commercial justification.        *****
