                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a): 	The National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) provides for food and nutritional security in human life cycle approach, by ensuing access to adequate quantity of quality food at affordable prices to people to live a life with dignity. It marks a paradigm shift in the approach to food security from welfare to rights based approach. The Act provides for coverage upto 75% of rural population and upto 50% of urban population for receiving highly subsidized foodgrains under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), thus covering about two-thirds of the total population which at Census 2011 comes to 81.35 crore. Households covered under Antyodaya Anna Yojana are entitled to receive 35 kg of foodgrains per household per month at Rs. 1/2/3 per kg for coarsegrains/ wheat/ rice respectively, under the Act. The priority households are entitled to receive 5 kg of foodgrains per person per month at the above prices.…..2/--2-(b): 	Rajasthan is a Non-DCP States and receives funds directly from Food Corporation of India (FCI). The Department of Food and Public Distribution does not releases funds to the State Government of Rajasthan. The details of fund released by FCI to State Government of Rajasthan on foodgrains issued under the NFSA, Other Welfare Scheme (OWS) and Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana is as follows:Financial Year	Fund released (In Crore)2019-20	7074.532020-21	12578.252021-22(Till October, 2021)	7010.87         Central Government also provides Central assistance to States/UTs under NFSA for meeting expenditure on intra-State movement and handling of foodgrains and fair price shop dealers’ margin under the National Food Security Act, 2013 (Including Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana and Atma Nirbhar Bharat Package) as per approved norms. The details of fund released to State Government of Rajasthan under this scheme during the last three years is as follows:Financial Year	Fund released (In Crore)2019-20	95.862020-21	374.022021-22(As on 30.11.2021)	225.92(c): 	The National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) is being implemented in all the States/ Union Territories including Rajasthan covering about 79.53 crore beneficiaries at an all India level. The Act provides for coverage of beneficiaries upto the State level only and not at the district level. Coverage of beneficiaries in Rajasthan under the National Food Security Act is 446.62 lakh. The coverage of beneficiaries in Rajasthan for the last three years is as follows:Year	Coverage (In lakh)January, 2019	446.62January, 2020	446.62January, 2021	440.01As on 30.11.2021	440.01......3/--3-(d) & (e): 	The Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and the State/UT Governments, wherein the operational responsibilities pertain with the State/UT. Hence, as and when complaints for NFSA or any State/UT are received in the Department from individuals, organizations, through media reports etc. regarding any irregularities in the functioning of the NFSA/TPDS i.e. leakage/diversion of subsidized foodgrains, regarding issuance of ration cards, complaints regarding fair price shop functioning etc. they are forwarded to the concerned State/UT Governments for inquiry and appropriate action. An offence committed in violation of the provisions of Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2015 is liable for penal action under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Thus, the Order empowers State/UT Governments to take punitive action in case of contravention of relevant provisions of these Orders.****
