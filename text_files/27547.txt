ANSWER




ANSWER MINISTRY OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) to (c)  Anganwadi Centres are closed due to Covid-19 pandemic. No survey has been planned on ground, as human interaction has been minimised to control the spread of virus.  However, to ensure continuous nutritional support to Anganwadi beneficiaries, Anganwadi Workers and Helpers are distributing Supplementary Nutrition at the doorsteps of beneficiaries once in 15 days. This Ministry has launched "Poshan Tracker” in March, 2021,  a robust ICT enabled digital platform,  to ensure real time monitoring of supplementary nutrition by use of data analytics for prompt supervision and management of services, tracking of all AWCs, AWWs and beneficiaries on defined indicators.  The Poshan tracker has provision for an integrated helpline for taking feedback of beneficiaries, frontline functionaries & from States/UTs. More than 50,000 feedback /queries have been received on Poshan Tracker since March 2021, which have been resolved. Support System has been established at National Level to facilitate adoption challenges faced by States.  Further, Ministry has sent a communication to States/UTs regarding appointment of nodal person for provide technical support to States/UTs and resolution of issues of downloading/functioning of the new Poshan Tracker.   *******
