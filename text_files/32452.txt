ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)      A total of 41,72,720 number of households were enlisted in Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC) list of 2011 in Odisha. Out of this, a total of 18,75,631 number of beneficiaries have been verified as eligible by the State under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G), as on 16.12.2021. (b)    Out of the 18,75,631 number of verified beneficiaries available in SECC list, houses have been sanctioned to 18,36,451 beneficiaries by the State. Out of this, houses of 16,75,749 beneficiaries have been completed. The State is yet to sanction houses to 39,180 beneficiaries and 1,99,882 houses are yet to be completed from the beneficiaries made available through SECC 2011. (c)    Under PMAY-G, the target is the construction of 2.95 crore houses to achieve the objective of “Housing for All” in rural areas. The beneficiaries have been identified based on the housing deprivation parameters prescribed under Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011. After due verification by the Gram Sabha and completion of Appellate Process Gram panchayat-wise Permanent Wait List (PWL) is prepared. The auto generated priority list of households from SECC, 2011 database was provided to the States/Union Territories (UTs) for conducting Gram Sabha meetings to finalize the PWL. As on 16.12.2021, a total of 2.15 crore households have been identified and included in PWL from SECC, 2011.  Further, the details of such households who, though eligible for inclusion in PWL, but were left out from the SECC 2011 based PWL, have been captured in the Awaas+ Mobile App based Survey. The Survey was conducted during January, 2018 and 7th March 2019. In this exercise, the States/UTs have uploaded details of additional households. The beneficiaries from Awaas+ lists are also being granted benefits under PMAY-G as per the approved guidelines, within a ceiling of 2.95 crore houses under PMAY-G. No applications from households are required under this scheme as beneficiaries are identified from the PWL of PMAY-G based on SECC 2011 and finalised Awaas+ list. The State had registered 13,20,945 households under Awaas+ Survey, out of which 7,46,422 households remain eligible  after due verification by the State.   The procedure of hearing by the Appellate Authority is determined by the State Government and this Appellate Committee is constituted at the District Level to consider the complaints of those who have challenged their exclusion. Therefore, the data regarding number of beneficiaries who have challenged their exclusion is not maintained by the Central Government. (d) & (e)  The State Government of Odisha vide letter dated 20.07.2021 had submitted compliance of the advisories/findings of Central Team sent by the Ministry for physical verification on 9th to 11th February, 2021. The compliance report submitted by the State is at Annexure. *****
