                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):	There is limited evidence that thyroid disease enhances the risk of cancer.  However, there are reports of occurrence of thyroid cancers in the patient suffering from hyperthyroidism (a type of thyroid disease). Hashimoto''s thyroiditis (HT) (or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis) may also increase the risk of thyroid cancer development.  (b) & (c):	Air pollution has been known as a risk factor, impacting thyroid hormone level in body. The most common cause of thyroid disorders is iodine deficiency. Viral infections are important environmental factors in the pathogenesis of autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD). Many chemical containments variably disrupt thyroid function.  (d) & (e):	Government has been implementing National Goitre Control Programme (NGCP) since 1962 (renamed as National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme (NIDDCP) in 1992) to manage Iodine deficiency in all States/Union Territories. Under this programme, iodated salt is provided in place of common salt, with regular surveys of iodine deficiency at district level. Health education and publicity of this programme is ensured.
