                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a) to (d) : The India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), established by the Department of Commerce, supports efforts to promote and create awareness in international markets about Indian products and services, through branding related inputs and efforts.  IBEF has been working closely with different Departments, Export Promotion Councils, commodity boards and Industry Associations in support of various sectoral branding efforts, including as part of promotional events. Some of these initiatives include a branding campaign to promote products with Geographical Indicators of India, with a special focus on handicraft, handlooms and agri- based GI Products, and design of an e-brochure showcasing state-wise GI Products. A campaign to promote Indian Handmade Carpets across International markets, which has led to significant interest in the Indian Carpet Expo 20-21, was undertaken.  Branding support is also provided to implementation of annual plans, based on proposals submitted by the Export Promotion Councils / Trade Promotion Organizations, related to participation of exporters in various international fairs and expos supported under the Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme.                                                           ******
