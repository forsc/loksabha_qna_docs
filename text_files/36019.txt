ANSWER




MINISTER OF COAL, MINES & PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a)   Government of India has adopted a fair and transparent process for auction of coal blocks in the country. Auction process is being conducted through an online platform provided by Metal Scrap Trade Corporation Limited (MSTC), a Public Sector Undertaking under the Ministry of Steel.  Coal block auctions are conducted in two-stage online bidding process, which involves technical screening and submission of competitive initial offer in the first stage and in second stage better offers are intended to be received. Also, all the bidders who want to participate in the auction can bid for any of the coal mine as per their requirement and analysis and the latest final offer quoted by the last bidder is visible to all so that all the bidders are able to see the current and final bid for the coal mine.  (b)        The share of coal in power generation in the country, state-wise, is enclosed as Annexure.  (c) & (d)       Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change while granting prior Environment Clearance under the provisions of Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006, considers various environmental and social aspects related to coal based thermal power projects such as impacts on the air, water and soil quality, fly ash generation and its management, displacement of population etc. The EIA Notification, 2006, as amended prescribes preparation of Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report & Environment Management Plan (EMP) by the project authorities through accredited EIA consultants after collection of baseline data about air quality, water quality, soil quality and socio-economic status of local population. After assessment and prediction of possible impact of project based on baseline data and scientific deliberation by the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC), the coal based thermal power projects are granted Environmental Clearance subject to compliance of suitable site specific environmental safeguard conditions considering nearby habitation/villages and other features of environment sensitivity so as to minimize the possible environmental concerns associated with such projects.  The projects which are not liable to obtain prior environmental clearance under the provisions of the EIA Notification, 2006 as amended, are regulated through grant of Consent to Establish and Consent to Operate by respective State Pollution Control Boards. The compliance of environmental safeguard conditions/norms are regularly monitored by the Regional Offices of the MoEF&CC and respective State Pollution Control Boards.  Apart from the above, the MoEF&CC has issued specified norms for environmental pollutants like SOx, NOx, Mercury (Hg) and Particulate matter (PM) in case of coal based thermal power plants for compliance by individual project.********
