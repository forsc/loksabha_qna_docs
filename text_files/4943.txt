The Act does not provide for pre-censorship of any programme or advertisement telecast on such TV channels. However, it provides that all programmes and advertisements telecast on such TV channels should be in conformity with the prescribed Programme Code and Advertising Code enshrined in the said Act and the rules framed thereunder, which contain a wide range of parameters to regulate programmes and advertisements on TV channels including the content which is likely to give rise to obscenity or which is likely to lead to violence.

IMC has representatives from the Ministry of Home Affairs, Defence, External Affairs, Law, Women and Child Development, Health and Family Welfare, Consumer Affairs and Information & Broadcasting and a representative from the industry in Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI). The IMC meets periodically and recommends action in respect of violation of Programme and Advertising Codes by private TV channels.  Apart from this, the Ministry has also issued directions to States to set up District level and State level Monitoring Committees to regulate content telecast on cable TV channels.Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF) has also set up a mechanism for self-regulation through Broadcasting Content Complaints Council (BCCC) in case of non-news channels. As part of this, IBF has laid down Content Code & Certification Rules 2011 covering an entire gamut of content-related principles ad criteria for television broadcast.The Press Council of India constituted under the Press Council Act of 1978, has issued a compendium titled ‘Norms of Journalistic Conduct’ to specifically promote the standard of the media to act as a reference guide in varying circumstances for the journalists. Complaints regarding violations of publishing content are considered and adjudicated by the Press Council of India under its mandate of preserving the freedom of the press and of maintaining and improving the standards of press in India. ***
