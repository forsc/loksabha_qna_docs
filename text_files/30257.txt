At the time of construction of station, Minimum Essential Amenities (MEA) is provided as per norms based on the category of station.

It was also emphasized that lights specifically provided for illumination of the station name board are kept glowing during the night.(d) to (f): Installation of Global Positioning System (GPS) based Passenger Announcement cum Passenger Information System (PAPIS) in Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) & Kolkata Metro has already been installed. This Passenger Information System informs the passengers regarding the next approaching station through audio announcement on speakers as well as through video display on LED screens simultaneously. Further, newly manufactured EMU/MEMU rakes are already equipped with such technology/system.  Passenger announcement/ information system are also available in premium trains like Vande Bharat, Humsafar, Tejas and UDAY Express.  (g): At present, modernisation/upgradation of Railway stations is undertaken under Adarsh Station scheme, based on identified need of providing better enhanced passenger amenities at stations. 1253 stations have been identified for development under this scheme. Based on the respective category of the station, passenger amenities such as improvement to façade of the station building, retiring room, waiting room (with bathing facilities), separate waiting room for ladies, computer based public address system, landscaping of circulating area, signages, Pay & Use toilets, water coolers, ramps at entry to station for Divyangjan and Senior Citizens etc. are provided at Railway stations identified and developed under this scheme.
