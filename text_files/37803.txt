ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AYURVEDA, YOGA & NATUROPATHY, UNANI, SIDDHA AND HOMOEOPATHY(AYUSH)(SHRI SARBANANDA SONOWAL)(a)	to (c) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 433* FOR 1ST APRIL, 2022(a)	: Yes Sir, Ayurvedic system of medicine is an existing ancient traditional system of medicine of India. Its role has significantly been boosted with the establishment of Ministry of Ayush, which has resulted into focused growth of the sector in terms of medical education, practice, manufacturing, research and International cooperation. Further, the significance and usage of Ayurvedic medicines has been further noticed during the wake of Covid -19.(b)	: In order to assess the usage of AYUSH advisories & measures in the prevention of COVID-19, “AYUSH Sanjivani” mobile app was developed by Ministry of Ayush in 2020 which has documented the impact assessment of effectiveness, acceptance of AYUSH through population based study in around 1.35 crores respondents. Analysis of 7.24 lakh public data revealed that 85.1% of the respondents reported use of AYUSH measures for prevention of COVID-19, among which 89.8% respondents agreed to have benefitted from the practice of AYUSH advisory. This shows increasing trust of people in AYUSH Medicines including Ayurveda. Further, Guidelines for extending insurance coverage to AYUSH interventions have been evolved for AYUSH hospitals and Day care centre and accordingly incorporated in the IRDAI regulations. Based on these regulations, about 27 insurance companies are offering health insurance policies for AYUSH treatment of the beneficiaries which is a reflection of acceptance and demand of AYUSH treatment amongst the masses. 	(c)	: Ayush Ministry has taken various steps to increase the manufacturing of Ayurvedic medicines at different levels: i. Ease out licensing process: This Ministry has issued Gazette notification no. GSR 716 E for Amendment in the Drugs Rules, 1945 related to licensing process of ASU drugs on 1.10.2021. The amendments have been done with a view to reduce the compliance burden and facilitate ease of doing business. The process to grant license to manufacture Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani (ASU) drugs swift, paperless and more transparent the license application system has been made online through e-aushadhi.gov.in portal. The license of the ASU drugs have been made perpetual i.e. with one time registration fee the license of the product will be valid lifetime with no further retention or renewal fees thereafter.The maximum time in granting the license to manufacture ASU drugs has been reduced from three months to two months.ii. Promotion of Ayushproducts for Covid-19: •	In the wake of COVID-19 outbreak, the Ministry of Ayush has issued direction to All State Government/UT’s to give permission for issue of license to the Ayurvedic drug manufactures to manufacture and sell in Generic name as ‘AyushKwath’ in accordance with the provisions of Drugs and Cosmetics Rules 1945.  •	The medicines which emerged out to be useful and mentioned in the National Guidelines issued by the Ministry of Ayush, are being manufactured by most of the Ayurvedic drugs manufacturers. •	Research and Transfer of technology: During the second wave of this pandemic, the scientists of reputed research institutions of the country have found that AYUSH 64, a poly herbal formulation developed by the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) is useful in the treatment of asymptomatic, mild and moderate COVID-19 infection as an adjunct to standard care. In order to provide maximum benefit of Ayush systems of medicine, a Nation-wide campaign for distribution of AYUSH-64 and KabasuraKudineer(Siddha Medicine) was taken up across the country. CCRAS has transferred AYUSH-64 manufacturing technology through National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) to 46 manufacturing units for manufacturing of AYUSH-64.•	During COVID-19/Omicron surge the Ministry promoted the use of Ayuraksha Kit, BalRaksha Kit and Ayur care Kit for the health promotion of the masses. In this regard all the State licensing authorities were informed that requirement of separate Licence for making kits with the specified components of Ayuraksha Kit, BalRaksha Kit and Ayur care Kit for the manufacturers having valid license of the individual component of the kit is not required.iii. Schemes to support Ayurvedic medicines production: Under National Ayush Mission (NAM) from 2014-2021, apart from other services Grant-in-aid were also provided for Strengthening of State Government ASU&H Pharmacies.At present, Central Sector Scheme for Ayush Oushadhi Gunavattaevam Uttpadan Samvardhan Yojana (AOGUSY)has been implemented for the year 2021-2026. One of the components of the scheme is Strengthening and up-gradation of Ayush Pharmacies to achieve higher standards. 	iv. In addition to the above, for facilitating exports, Ministry of Ayush encourages following certifications of AYUSH products as per details below:-•	Certification of Pharmaceutical Products (CoPP) as per WHO Guidelines for herbal products.•	Quality Certifications Scheme implemented by the Quality Council of India (QCI) for grant of AYUSH Premium mark to Ayurvedic, Siddha and Unani products on the basis ofthird party evaluation of quality in accordance with the status of compliance to international standards.v. Further, on 25th March, 2022 a Host Country agreement has been signed between the Government of India and the World Health Organization (WHO) at Geneva for establishment of the WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine (WHO GCTM) in Jamnagar, Gujarat. This would be the first and only global outposted Centre (office) for traditional medicine across the globe. It shows the support offered by Government of India to this cause and its recognition globally, which will further give boost to the manufacturers of Ayurvedic medicines and more investment in the sector. *******
