                                                                     THE MINISTER OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                 (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a) to (b): Local self-government is a State subject and Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has only an advisory role. This Ministry has issued an Addendum to Model Building Bye-laws (MBBL), 2016 for indoor air quality management laying down a regulatory framework to abate air pollution and maintain Indoor Air Quality within the premises of any built space.With regard to urban flooding, Ministry has issued Standard Operating Procedures for Urban Flooding in 2017. The SOP lays down, in a comprehensive manner, the specific actions to be undertaken by the Urban Local Bodies, District Administration and the State Government. This Ministry has also published a Manual on Storm Water Drainage Systems, 2019 to provide guidance on sustainable design, planning & management of storm water drainage systems and emergency plan for flood response in urban areas. Urban Regional Development Plans Formulation and Implementation (URDPFI) Guidelines, 2014, inter-alia, provides guidelines on mitigation, prevention and preparedness for urban flooding issued by the National Disaster Management Authority.  Further, Government has launched Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) 2.0 on 01 October, 2021 aimed to create water secure cities, providing universal coverage of tap water in all statutory towns and 100% coverage of sewerage/ septage management in 500 AMRUT cities. Rejuvenation of water bodies to augment water and enhance amenity value and development of green spaces are amongst the admissible projects that can be undertaken by the States/ UTs under the Mission. Urban governance is one of the reform agenda under the Mission.NITI Aayog also in its report titled ‘Reforms in urban planning capacity in India’ in September, 2021 has recommended the constitution of a high-powered committee to re-engineer the present urban-planning governance structure. This Ministry has issued advisory to all the States/ UTs to constitute a High Powered Committee to deliberate on the issue. (c): Question does not arise.                                    *****
