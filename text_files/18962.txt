ANSWER




MINISTER OF COAL, MINES & PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) a.	Yes, Sir. b.	A methodology for auction of coal and lignite mines / blocks for sale of coal / lignite on revenue sharing basis has been approved in May, 2020 with features such as incentives for early production and for gasification or liquefaction of coal, bid for a percentage share of revenue which would be payable to the State Government, Exploitation of Coal Bed Methane (CBM) is allowed, no restriction on the sale and/or utilisation of coal from the coal mine, relinquishment of coal block by the successful bidder of partially explored coal mine etc. Ministry of Coal launched the auction of 41 coal mines for commercial mining on June 18, 2020 under CM(SP) Act, 2015 and MMDR Act, 1957. The coal mines were from 5 coal bearing states viz. Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Odisha.  Out of these mines, 19 coal mines are successfully auctioned. List of these mines may be found in Annexure. The commercial coal mine auction is an attempt to attract more private investment into the coal mining sector. The purpose of commercial mining is to encourage transparent pricing of coal based on market forces as well as to create a market place for coal with multiple producers to drive competition & adopt best practices in mining as well as environment management. It will bring in new investments and create employment, both direct and in-direct. The opening of coal sector would help in creating a market-based coal economy in the country. It enables adequate competition which will allow discovery of market prices for the blocks and faster development of coal blocks.The entire revenue from the auctions would be allocated to the coal bearing State Governments, thus it is expected to bring in immense socio-economic benefits to coal-bearing states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Odisha. c.	14 coal mines have been Allotted under Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 for Sale of Coal to Central/State PSUs. Further, 19 coal mines are successfully auctioned in recently completed first tranche of Commercial Coal Mining. On 11.01.2021, agreements were executed with successful bidders of these 19 coal mines. d. & e.             Coal Mining operations have some impact on environment in terms of change in land use pattern, air, water and noise pollution. However, it is mandatory to get the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) approved by Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change [MoEF&CC] before commencing / expanding the mining operations.  A detailed environment impact assessment (EIA) is carried out considering pre and post mining operations for preparing EMPs which are discussed in detail by the Environmental Appraisal Committee (EAC) of experts under MoEF&CC. On the basis of the discussions, EAC recommends the case and accordingly Environment Clearance (EC) is granted by the MoEF&CC.  It is to mention that in projects involving forest land, for grant of EC, Stage I Forest Clearance (FC) needs to be obtained prior to obtaining EC. MoEF&CC while according EC, imposes conditions / mitigation measures for implementation which project proponents have to comply. On obtaining EC, the project proponent, statutorily has to secure Consent to Establish and Consent to Operate under the provisions of Water and Air Act’s from the concerned State Pollution Control Boards (SPCB).  During the course of implementation of the project, the compliance of the conditions laid in the EC is being monitored through Regional offices of MoEF&C and concerned SPCBs. Measurements of environmental quality attributes are carried as prescribed in the EP Rules and EC conditions.  The report so generated is sent to regional offices of MoEF&CC and SPCB once in 6 months.   ANNEXURE Sl.
