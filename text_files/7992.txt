BHARATIBEN DHIRUBHAI SHIYAL REGARDING “CARGO HANDLING CAPACITY OF PORTS”. (a) to(c)	Yes, Sir. Infrastructure development and capacity augmentation of major ports is an ongoing process. The process inter-alia involves construction of new berths and terminals, mechanization of existing berths and terminals, capital dredging for deepening of drafts for attracting larger vessels in ports, development of road and rail connectivity etc. As a result, the cargo handling capacity of the major ports has been steadily going up. As on 31.03.2019 the cargo handling capacity of major ports was 1514.09 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) and that of non-major ports was 863.50 MTPA. The details of cargo handling capacity of major ports during the last five years are at annexure - I. (d)	A number of projects on upgradation of the major ports have been awarded in the last 3 years with total project cost of Rs. 13308.41 Cr. The details of funds/investment and capacity on the major port projects during the last three years port-wise are at annexure – II. (e)	Minor ports are under the jurisdiction of respective State Governments. As per information received from the Gujarat Maritime Board, there is a plan to add 6 MTPA of cargo handling capacity by developing CNG Terminal and other terminals at Bhavnagar port.
