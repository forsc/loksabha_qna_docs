                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (c)  Floods are natural calamity and is attributed to various factors like wide variation in rainfall both in time and space with frequent departure from normal pattern, inadequate carrying capacities of rivers, river bank erosion, silting of river beds, landslides, poor natural drainage, snow melts and glacial lake out bursts. The flood management schemes are formulated and implemented by concerned State Governments as per their priority. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. Government of India launched Flood Management Programme (FMP) during XI Plan for providing central assistance to the State Governments for taking up works related to river management, flood control, anti-erosion, drainage development, flood proofing works, restoration of damaged flood management works and anti-sea erosion works which was continued during XII Plan and beyond for a period 2017-18 to 2019-20 as a component of "Flood Management and Border Areas Programme" (FMBAP) for the three year period from 2017-18 to 2019-20. So far till March, 2019, Central Assistance amounting to Rs. 924.41 Crores has been released to State Government of Bihar under FMP. In order to formulate the strategy for flood management works in the entire country and river management activities and works in the border areas for period 2020-2023, a Committee has been constituted by NITI Aayog under the chairmanship of Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog. Besides, Officials from Government of India, Experts from the field, Principal Secretaries from States of Jammu & Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Punjab, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala are also the members of  the Committee constituted by NITI Aayog.*****
