ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c): Godda-Mahagama (30 Km) and Mahagama-Pirpainti (32 Km) New Line sections are part of Godda-Pirpainti leg of Pirpainti-Jasidih (97 Km) New Line project which was sanctioned in the year 2013-14 on 50:50 cost sharing basis with the State Govt. of Jharkhand. However, execution of Godda-Pirpainti (60 km) section has been stopped by the State Govt. due to notification issued by Ministry of Coal, notifying that land falling between km 58.42 to km 77.47 of the alignment coming under coal bearing notified area.Further, in this regard Ministry of Coal has been requested for granting permission to Railway for going ahead with original alignment of the project to avoid time and cost overruns. Completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site, due to climatic conditions, etc. and all these factors differ from project to project and affect the completion time of the project. As such, firm completion time of the project cannot be indicated at this stage. *****
