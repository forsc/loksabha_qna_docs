ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) and (b) The Ministry has not been intimated of any instances of improper utilisation of funds/ unsatisfactory progress of works during last five years and current year under Central Road Fund (CRF) and Economic Importance and Inter State Connectivity (EI&ISC) schemes taken up as per the provisions of the CRF Act, 2000 amended by the Finance Act from time to time. (c) and (d) The Ministry releases funds for the road works under CRF Scheme based on the Utilisation Certificates (UCs) received from State Governments / UTs, duly ensuring that adequate fund is available with States/ UTs at all the times. The Ministry reviews the progress of projects and expenditure incurred while releasing funds based on such UCs.The funds for State Roads under EI & ISC Schemes are allocated keeping in view the committed liabilities, progress of works, inter-se priority, etc. For EI & ISC works, the direct payment procedure applicable for National Highway (NH) works is followed; the funds are released directly to the contractors by the Ministry’s Regional Offices (ROs)/ Engineering Liaisons Offices (ELOs)/ Regional Pay and Accounts Offices (RPAOs) based on the works done and bills received/ processed.	With the amendment of CRF Act, 2000 through Finance Act, 2018 and replacement of the earlier Act by the Central Road and Infrastructure Fund Act (CRIF), 2000, sanction of schemes for State Road is no longer a function of the Central Government.The details of State Roads constructed under CRF and EI&ISC schemes during the last three years are as follows:-Length in km	CRF	EI&ISCYear	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19Length (in km)	4,288.38	4,813.00	7,715.85	312.24	521.80	252.15*****
