                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                      (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)& (b): The official poverty estimates are based on Large Sample Surveys on Household Consumer Expenditure carried out by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). The latest data of Large Sample Survey on Household Consumer Expenditure has been collected by NSSO in its 68th round conducted in 2011-12. Based on the data, the erstwhile Planning Commission estimated poverty lines and poverty ratio in 2011-12 following the extant Tendulkar Committee methodology and released through a Press Note issued on 22nd July 2013. According to this Press Note, the number of persons living below poverty line in urban area has been estimated as 5.31 crore (13.7%) in 2011-12. A statement showing number of people living below poverty line in urban areas, State/UT-wise, in 2011-12 is at Annexure.(c) & (d): No such information is available in this Ministry.(e) : The Government is implementing “Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM)” to reduce poverty and vulnerability of urban poor households, on sustainable basis. Also, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) addresses the housing requirements of urban population including the urban poor. Other important schemes being implemented by the Government, inter alia, targeting urban poor, include Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), Ayuashman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) etc. These schemes complement the schemes of the State/UT Governments being implemented to alleviate urban poverty.                          *****
