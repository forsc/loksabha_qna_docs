SINGH (RETD))(a) to (c): Utkela airport figures in the tentative list of unserved airports in the UDAN  scheme document. Airports Authority of India (AAI), the Implementing Agency, had awarded routes to the Selected Airline Operator (SAO) connecting Utkela airport in the first round of bidding under UDAN. However, the said UDAN routes connecting Utkela airport were cancelled due to the non-compliance of agreement by the SAO subsequently. AAI has now awarded routes connecting Utkela to Bhubaneshwar and Raipur, to SAO of bidding under UDAN 4.1.
