ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a) The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation compiles data on time and cost overruns of on-going Central Sector Infrastructure Projects costing Rs. 150 crore and above, on the basis of information provided by the project implementing agencies on the On-line Computerized Monitoring System (OCMS). The number of infrastructure projects, above Rs. 150 Crs, undertaken by the Government during each of the last three years and the current year, as reported by project implementing agencies on On-line Computerized Monitoring System (OCMS) are 1315(March 2018), 1405(March 2019), 1686(March 2020) and 1683(June 2020) respectively. The details of these projects are available in the flash report at www. cspm.gov.in/publications. (b) Yes Sir. As on 01.05.2020, 403 projects out of 1682 on-going Central Sector Infrastructure Projects costing Rs. 150 crore and above were facing cost overruns with respect to original project implementation cost. The details of these projects are available in the flash report at www.cspm.gov.in/publications. The reasons for cost overruns are project-specific, depend on a variety of technical, financial and administrative factors, and differ from project to project. However, as reported by the project implementing agencies on the OCMS of this ministry, the main reasons for increase in cost of the projects are: Under-estimation of original cost; Changes in rates of foreign exchange and statutory duties; High cost of environmental safeguards & rehabilitation measures; Spiraling land acquisition costs; Shortage of skilled manpower/ labour; Changes in Project scope; Monopolistic pricing by vendors of equipment services; General Price rise / inflation and Time Overruns. Delay in land acquisition and forest clearance has been one of the reasons for time overrun leading to cost overrun as reported by implementing agencies. (c) to (e) Yes. Government had set up a Task Force under the chairmanship of Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) to draw up the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) for the period between Financial Year (FY) 2020-25. The Terms of Reference of the Task Force on NIP were to identify technically feasible and financially/ economically viable infrastructure projects including those based on Public Private Partnerships mode that can be initiated in the period FY2019-20 to FY 2024-25; to estimate annual infrastructure investments/capital costs; to guide the ministries in identifying appropriate sources of financing; and to suggest measures to monitor the projects so that cost and time overruns can be minimized.  The Final Report has been released on 29.4.2020 and the National Infrastructure Pipeline is under implementation with a projected investment of about Rs 111 lakh crore in around 6835 projects. However, this number is not fixed and it can change as per requirements of the Centre and States Ministries/ Departments and Implementing agencies. The NIP Task force has given recommendations on changes required to several key sectoral policies and other reform initiatives to scale up and propel infrastructure investments in various sectors across the country. Action on identified reforms are being taken up by concerned Ministries/Departments.(f)    The steps taken by the Government to control the cost escalation and timely completion of projects are: Periodic review of projects under PRAGATI through video conferencing ; rigorous project appraisal; On-line Computerized Monitoring System (OCMS) for better monitoring; setting up of Revised Cost Committees in the Ministries for fixation of responsibility for time and cost overruns; regular review of infrastructure projects by the concerned administrative Ministries; and setting up of Central Sector Projects Coordination Committees (CSPCCs) in the States under the Chief Secretaries for removal of bottlenecks and for facilitating the speedy implementation of major projects. (g) As on 01.07.2020 there are 1683 on-going Central Sector Infrastructure Projects costing Rs. 150 crore & above with anticipated completion cost of Rs.24,77,167.67 crore and original cost of Rs.20,65,335.20 crore with total cost overrun of Rs.411832.47 crore in figures and 19.94 in percentage.                                            ***
