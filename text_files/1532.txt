ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ''Nishank'')(a) to (c) 	The Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014 provides for the establishment of one Tribal University each in the State of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. A Central Tribal University has already been established by the name of Indira Gandhi National Tribal University at Amarkantak in the State of Madhya Pradesh. There is no decision on establishment of a Tribal University in the district of Wayanad in Kerala State. However, there is Central University of Kerala in the State which also fulfils the aspirations of higher education of tribal youth of the region. During 12th Plan (2012-17) as approved by National Development Council (NDC) the thrust is on consolidation of the higher education system. Expansion would be mainly done by scaling up capacity of the existing institutions in place of setting up new institutions. Further, since ‘Education’ is a concurrent subject, State Governments are also taking various initiatives to encourage the access to higher education in the respective States along with other Private Universities/Institutions. *****
