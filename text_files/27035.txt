                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (d) 	India and the United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland (UK) have signed an MoU on ‘Migration and Mobility Partnership’ on 4 May 2021 to promote opportunities for each other''s students (for higher education, internship and post study work), academics, researchers and skilled professionals and facilitate the issuance of appropriate visas as per applicable national laws and regulations. In addition to this, the MoU also provides for a new Young Professional Scheme under which every year up to 3000 young professionals from India can avail employment opportunities for a period of two years in the UK, on a reciprocal basis. The MoU also aims to improve cooperation between India and the UK on illegal migration and facilitate the return of each other''s nationals who do not meet or no longer meet the provisions for legal entry into or legal residence to remain in the territory of the other country through the setting up of streamlined procedures for nationality verification and readmission. ***
