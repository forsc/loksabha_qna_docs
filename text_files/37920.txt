ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SHRIMATI ANNPURNA DEVI)(a)Para 1.6 of the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020 states that prior to the age of 5 every child will move to a “Preparatory Class” or “Balavatika” (that is, before Class 1). The learning in the Preparatory Class shall be based primarily on play-based learning with a focus on developing cognitive, affective, and psychomotor abilities and early literacy and numeracy. The PM POSHAN programme shall also be extended to the Preparatory Classes in primary schools. Health check-ups and growth monitoring that are available in the Anganwadi system shall also be made available to Preparatory Class students of Anganwadi as well as of primary schools. Children who enter Grade-I come from diverse background and have diverse learning abilities, therefore, to support the learning and smooth transition of children entering Grade-I, NCERT has developed a three-month play based programme called Vidya Pravesh. Vidya Pravesh is an integral part of the NIPUN Bharat Mission which focuses on Foundational Literacy and Numeracy. The programme suggests play-based and developmentally appropriate learning experiences in the form of activities, illustrations, and worksheets designed in accordance with the skills and concepts of NIPUN Bharat Mission.(b)The State/UT-wise data of total number of schools with pre-primary classes is at Annexure-I.(c)& (d)For ensuring coordination and convergence with the different ministries, the Ministry of Education has constituted a special Joint Task Force (JTF) including representatives of different Ministries to oversee the implementation of ECCE as per NEP 2020. JTF has representatives from the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, Ministry of Defence, Department of Social Justice and Empowerment, Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities and Department of Sports.*****
