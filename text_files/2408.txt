ANSWER




MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a)& (b) Yes, Sir. The government during the last five years has provided 3.18 crores scholarships to students from amongst the six centrally notified Minorities namely, Jain, Buddhist, Sikh, Parsi, Muslim and Christian. Out of these, girls constitute more than 50% of the beneficiaries. During the next five years, the Ministry of Minority Affairs (MoMA) proposes to provide Pre-Matric, Post-Matric and Merit-cum-Means scholarships to five crore economically Weaker-section students from the six centrally notified Minority communities. This will include more than 50% of girl students. The three scholarship schemes are now being implemented through the National Scholarship Portal and since 2015, the scholarships schemes are being implemented under direct benefit transfer (DBT) mode to improve the efficiency and bring transparency by removing duplicity and stopping pilferages.

Also, this Ministry is providing financial assistance to Jamia Millia Islamia Delhi & Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh for running Bridge course for Madarsa students as well as school dropouts under the pilot project of Nai Manzil.  Bridge course is being provided to Madarsa students/dropouts for helping them to continue mainstream education. After completion of the bridge course, these students become eligible for admission in various regular courses of Universities at graduate level.  (d)  To narrow down the gap between mainstream school education and the Madarsa school system, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MoHRD) is implementing an Umbrella Scheme for Providing Education to Madarsas/Minorities (SPEMM), which comprises two Schemes namely Scheme for Providing Quality Education in Madarsas (SPQEM) & Infrastructure Development in Minority Institutions (IDMIs). These Centrally Sponsored Schemes are being implemented at National level & are voluntary in nature.		The objective of SPQEM is to encourage traditional institutions like Madarsas and Maktabs by giving financial assistance to introduce Science, Mathematics, Social Studies, Hindi and English in their curriculum; to provide opportunities to students of these institutions to acquire education comparable to the National Education System especially for secondary and senior secondary levels; to strengthen State Madrasa Boards opting for assistance and to provide for in-service training of teachers appointed under the scheme, for teaching modern subjects of Science, Mathematics, Social Studies, Hindi, and English.		The objective of IDMI is to facilitate education of minorities by augmenting and strengthening school infrastructure in Minority Institutions (Elementary/Secondary/Senior Secondary Schools)and to encourage educational facilities for girls, children with special needs.*****
