ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BHUPENDER YADAV)(a) to (d) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. ***STATEMENT REFFERED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 72 BY DR. SHRIKANT EKNATH SHINDE AND DR. HEENA GAVIT REGARDING ‘CLIMATE INDUCED MIGRATION’DUE FOR REPLY ON 07.02.2022(a) and (b) Migration/displacement of affected people may be due to economic, social, political and other factors. It may be temporary or permanent, short term or long term depending on the underlying cause(s) of displacement. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5degree C (2018), the social, economic and environmental factors underlying displacement of people by climate change are complex and varied; therefore, attributing it to the effect of observed climate change or assessing its possible magnitude with any degree of confidence is challenging. There is no established study for India providing a quantified attribution of climate change triggering migration/displacement of people. While many studies monitor extreme events in the environment, the science of attribution of these changes particularly to climate change is far more complex and currently an evolving subject. Most studies of attribution so far have relied generally on mathematical modelling of climate change impacts.According to information received from the National Disaster Management Authority, disasters such as seasonal floods in flood prone States cause temporary displacement of people due to flooding. Such displacement may range from a few weeks to two or three months.  After the flood season, displaced people tend to return to their original locations. It is difficult to attribute such displacement to climate change. In some locations, such as river islands affected by erosion, people are displaced locally due to erosion.(c) and (d) Relief, recovery, and rehabilitation are governed, inter alia, by the relevant provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and the guidelines, directives, and orders of the National Disaster Management Authority and the State Disaster Management Authorities. The constitutional, legal and administrative provisions relevant to disaster management and disaster risk reduction adequately address the management of disasters in the country.The State Governments undertake relief measures in the wake of natural disasters from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) already placed at their disposal in accordance with the extant norms. Additional assistance is extended from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) as per established procedure. The assistance approved under SDRF/NDRF norms is provided in the form of relief. *****
