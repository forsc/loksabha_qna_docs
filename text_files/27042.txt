                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a)	The External Affairs Minister (EAM) met State Councilor and Foreign Minister of China H.E. Mr. Wang Yi on 14th July 2021 in Dushanbe, Tajikistan on the sidelines of the SCO Foreign Ministers’ meeting. The two Ministers had a detailed exchange of views on the current situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh and also on other issues related to the overall India-China relations.EAM emphasized the need to follow through on the agreement reached in their last meeting in September 2020 in Moscow, and complete the disengagement, resolving the remaining issues along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh at the earliest. EAM recalled that both sides had agreed that a prolongation of the existing situation was not in the interest of either side. EAM further emphasized that it was in mutual interest that the two sides work towards early resolution of the remaining issues along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh, while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols. The two Ministers agreed that another round of the Meeting of Senior Military Commanders should be convened at the earliest, to discuss all remaining issues and seek a mutually acceptable solution. The two Ministers also agreed that both sides will continue to ensure stability on the ground and neither side will take any unilateral action that could increase tension.***
