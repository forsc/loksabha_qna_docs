                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)	Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) is a demand driven wage employment programme which provide for the enhancement of livelihood security of the households in rural areas of the country by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. The responsibility of implementation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGA is vested with the Government of States/UTs (including Karnataka and Tamil Nadu). The Ministry has a comprehensive system of monitoring and review mechanism for Mahatma Gandhi NREGS. The Ministry regularly reviews the performance of the implementation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS in States/UTs through various media viz., Mid-Term Review, Labour Budget meetings, Labour Budget Revision meetings, programme review meetings. Central Employment Guarantee Council and State Employment Guarantee Councils periodically monitor implementation of the programme.  National Level Monitors, Common Review Missions and Officers of the Ministry visit States/UTs at regular interval to review implementation of the programme. After the field visits, the findings/shortcomings and recommendations are shared with the States/UTs for appropriate action at their end. Auditing Standards have been issued and States/UTs have been advised to establish independent Social Audit Units, conduct Social Audit as per Audit of Scheme Rules and training of Village resource persons for conducting Social Audit etc. Internal Audit Teams of the Department also conduct regular audit. All grievances/ complaints received in the Ministry are forwarded to the concerned States/UTs for taking appropriate action including investigation, as per law. Steps have been taken to strengthen transparency and accountability which include geo-tagging of assets, Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), National electronic Fund Management System (NeFMS), Aadhar Based Payment System (ABPS), Software for Estimate Calculation using Rural rates for Employment (SECURE) and appointment of Ombudsperson in every district of States/UTs. (b)	The Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is a demand driven wage employment programme and fund release to the States/UTs (including Karnataka and Tamil Nadu) is a continuous process and Central Government is committed to making funds available keeping in view the demand for work as per the Scheme guidelines. During the previous FY 2020-21, Central Government released Rs 6317.64 crore to State of Tamil Nadu and Rs. 3993.80 crore to State of Karnataka for the wage component. During the current FY 2021-22 (as on 30.06.2021), Central Government released Rs. 1169.38 crore to State of Tamil Nadu and Rs.1276.03  crore to State of Karnataka for the wage component under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS. *****
