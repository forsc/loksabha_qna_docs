THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI SOM PARKASH)(a): 	Yes, Sir. In the latest Doing Business Report, 2019 released by the World Bank on 31st October, 2018, India stands at 77th position out of 190 countries, registering a jump of 23 places from its last year’s rank. Though no direct relationship can be established, improved business environment leads to greater investment in the country and improved efficiency of the existing investment.(b): 	With an intent to take the agenda of business reforms to the grass root level, a District Level Business Reform Action Plan has been prepared by Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and shared with all the States and Union Territories. The District Reform Plan requires States/UTs to create web portals, online systems, mandate timelines for service delivery and eliminate touch points between the applicant and the Department/Agency. The Districts are required to use online systems and follow timelines mandated by the State. A suggested questionnaire has also been prepared and forwarded to the States for the purpose of getting feedback for ranking of the districts in the State. (c):	 DPIIT handholds all the States and UTs, including Madhya Pradesh, in implementation of business reforms through continuous engagement at various levels. Several Video Conferences and Regional Workshops have been organized with the States/UTs to discuss the action plan and to resolve specific queries of States/UTs. Western & Central Regional Workshop was organized on 8th January, 2019 in Mumbai, Maharashtra wherein the States of Goa, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra had participated.******
