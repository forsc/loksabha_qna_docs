There is a provision for mid term and end term external evaluation and appraisal to assess the working and impact of the eCourts Project. The draft mid term appraisal report has been received from National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and the salient observations include:•	90-100% of sample courts have provision of computers hardware and have installed Case Information System (CIS).•	Services like Case Information System (CIS), JustIS mobile app and The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) website are used very often and have an easy user interface. •	Majority of judges and court official feels that eCourts project has reduced pendency of cases because of easy access to cases laws resulting in better research. •	The pendency of cases over 5 years have displayed slow but steady decline over the years.•	Since 2017, a sharp increase in the clearance rate of district courts is also noticed. (c):  Does not arise in view of (a & b) above.------
