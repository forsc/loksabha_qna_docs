ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) and (b)	Speed limits for different categories of motor vehicles on Delhi roads are notified by Delhi Traffic Police from time to time. Speed limit on a road depends on specific conditions such as volume of traffic, road infrastructure/designing, sharp curves, number of pedestrian crossing zones and road safety issues. Speed limit signages for various categories of motor vehicles are also displayed at the stretches well before the start of speed limit road as well as on the stretch at appropriate places for information of road users. (c) and (d) The maximum speed limit for different categories of motor vehicles on Delhi roads have been fixed considering the volume of traffic, road infrastructure/designing, sharp curves, number of pedestrian crossing zones and road safety issues. In the past years there have been a number of changes/ improvements in the road infrastructure in the city like construction of flyovers/ underpasses, high speed/signal free corridors as well as improvement in vehicle technology, therefore revision of the existing speed limits is felt necessary. A committee has been constituted by the Commissioner of Police, Delhi vide order No. 9580-9590/TE (DE-II)/Traffic dated 29.10.2019 under the Chairmanship of Spl.CP/Traffic comprising officers from Delhi Traffic Police as well as expert members/ officials from WRI (World Resources Institute of India), CRRI (Central Road Research Institute), SPA (School of Planning and Architecture), IIT Delhi and Transport Department, GNCT of Delhi to examine the existing speed limits notified by Delhi Traffic Police for various  roads/road  stretches  in the NCT of Delhi in conjunction with the maximum speed limits notified by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Govt. of India under sub - section (1) of section 112 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 through a notification issued vide S.O. 1522(E) dated 06.04.2018.*****
