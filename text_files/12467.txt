ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b): Yes Sir, 05 newly constructed buildings of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas(JNVs) at Kanshiram Nagar and Sitapur-II in Uttar Pradesh, Dang and Navasari inGujarat, Malkangiri-II in Odisha and of 01 Navodaya Leadership Institute at Puri inOdisha were inaugurated recently. Foundation stones were laid for the permanentbuildings of JNVs at Sefaijala and South Tripura in Tripura, South West Khasi Hills inMeghalaya, Jalpaiguri in West Bengal, Kalaburgi-I andKolar in Karnataka, Khunti inJharkhand &Mahisagar in Gujarat.(c) & (d): The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme provides for opening of one JNV in eachdistrict of the country. All the districts of pre-bifurcated Andhra Pradesh were coveredunder Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme (except Hyderabad which is an urban district).After bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, 9 of its districts came under the jurisdiction ofnewly formed state of Telangana. The remaining newly carved districts ofTelangana do not have any JNVs. Opening of new JNVs is a continuous processwhich depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government/UTAdministration to make available requisite suitable land free of cost and makingavailable required temporary building, free of rent to run the Vidyalaya till thepermanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of newJNV depends on availability of funds and approval by the competent authority.*****
