ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE; MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MINISTER OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)?????????  ??  ??????  ??????  ??????, ??????? ?? ????????????  ?????? ??  ?????? ???????  ??????(??. ???? ?????) (a) & (b):  Yes, Sir. Ministry of Science and Technology is implementing several scheme/programmes for development of Science and Technology (S&T) in various States/UTs of the country involving Non-Governmental Organisations/Voluntary Organisations viz. Science and Society Programme (SSP), Tribal Sub Plan (TSP) and Development Action Plan for Scheduled Caste (DAPSC), Science and Technology for Women including Women Technology Parks (WTPs), Technology Missions and Biotechnology Programme for Societal Development etc. Most of the above mentioned schemes and programmes of the Ministry, promote development, adaptation and deployment of S&T, through various field-based activities for sustainable development at community level by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). These programs also help in capturing field level problems, traditional knowledge and mapping of resources to facilitate development of relevant S&T solutions and updating knowledge through R&D organizations and academia. The details of the Non-Governmental Organizations/Voluntary Organizations and funds released under various schemes State/UT-wise in last three years and current year is given as Annexure I. (c) Ministry of Science and Technology as a knowledge Ministry through the above mentioned schemes and programmes improves the employ-ability and creates gainful employment opportunities to various cross sections of society especially women. A total of 96,173 women benefited and gained employment through the above mentioned schemes/programmes in last three years including current year including the states of Maharashtra and Bihar.  State-wise details of number of persons benefited and got employment is given in Annexure II. Apart from socio-economic benefit to the women in rural areas, a large number of women in India are highly qualified in science and are unable to pursue a career in science due to social and family reasons. India cannot afford to miss out the skills and talent of such highly educated women. The Women Scientists Scheme (WOS-C) of DST provides opportunities to women scientists in the area of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and train women having qualifications in science/engineering / medicine or allied areas in IPR and its management for a period of one year. The training allows them to work from their homes and maintain an appropriate work life balance. Technology Information, Forecasting & Assessment Council (TIFAC), an autonomous institution of DST, is implementing the WOS-C scheme  on behalf of DST. In last three years including current year, 437 women were trained under this scheme and 180 have got gainful employment after completion of training.   Year-wise distribution of women beneficiaries under WOS-C is given in Annexure III.
