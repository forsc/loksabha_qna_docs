ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	Productivity of crops (yield per hectare)  is one of the major factors that affect farmers’ income. There are inter-state variations in case of productivity of major crops on account of difference in the levels of irrigation, weather and temperature conditions, resource endowment, farm mechanization, land-holding size, etc. A statement indicating State/UT-wise variation in productivity level of major crops is placed in the Annexure. (c) & (d):	Yes Sir, crop productivity is a key determinant of gross value added in agriculture sector. Timely availability and correct method of application of farm inputs is vital for improving crop productivity. Government is implementing various schemes for supply of farm inputs, like seeds, fertilizers, agricultural machinery and equipments, irrigation facilities, institutional credit, etc., at subsidized rates to the farmers in the country. Further, Government has recently taken several steps for increasing investment in agriculture sector which include creation of Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF), Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF), Micro Irrigation Fund for water use efficiency, promotion of commercial organic farming, etc. Moreover, under the revamped Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) namely RKVY-RAFTAAR (Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied sector Rejuvenation), 50 per cent of the regular outlay has been earmarked for infrastructure and assets.
