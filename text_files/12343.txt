ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TOURISM (INDEPENDENT CHARGE)(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) and (b):		The Ministry of Tourism is aware that safety and security is one of the important factors that can impact tourism to the country and has taken various steps to ensure the safety and security of tourists, including foreign tourists. The steps taken include the following:(i)	Security of tourists is essentially a State Government subject. However, the Ministry of Tourism has taken up the matter with all State Governments/ Union Territory (UT) Administrations for setting up of dedicated Tourism Police. With the efforts of Ministry of Tourism, the State Governments/UT Administrations of Delhi, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh have deployed tourists police in one form or the other. (ii)	The Ministry of Tourism has set up a 24x7 Multi-Lingual Tourist Info-Helpline on the toll free number 1800111363 or on a short code 1363 in 12 Languages including 10 international languages, Hindi & English for domestic and foreign tourists to provide support service in terms of information relating to Travel in India and also offers appropriate guidance to tourists in distress while travelling in India. (iii)	The Ministry of Tourism along with all stakeholders, including the Tourism Departments of all States and UTs, have adopted the ''Code of Conduct for Safe & Honourable Tourism'' which is a set of guidelines to encourage tourism activities to be undertaken with respect for basic right like dignity, safety and freedom from exploitation of both tourists and local residents in particular, women and children. (iv)	The Ministry of Tourism has issued Guidelines on Safety and Security of Tourists for State Governments/Union Territories to stress on the importance of safety and risk management, assist in identifying best practices and encourage closer cooperation for ensuring a pleasant experience to the tourists. (v) 	The Ministry of Tourism conducts constant dialogue with Ministry of Home Affairs, State Governments/UT Administrations and various tourism related organisations/institutions for   development and promotion of tourism in the country including safe and honourable Tourism.(c) and (d): Complaints regarding deficiency in services or other issues from foreign as well as domestic travellers are received in the Ministry either directly from the complainants or through the CPGRAMS portal. On receipt of such complaints, the matter is taken up with the concerned departments/service providers seeking clarification to facilitate resolution of the issues. In case instances of exploitation of tourists are brought to the notice of the Ministry of Tourism, the grievance is taken up with the concerned State Government/UT Administration since service providers are required to be registered/licensed under local rules / acts of the concerned State/UT. The complainant is also advised to approach the appropriate forum for redressal such as consumer court, on case to case basis.To ensure standardized services for tourists, the Ministry of Tourism Government of India gives approval to different categories of service providers in the Travel and Hospitality industries, which is purely a voluntary scheme and it is not mandatory for the service providers to seek approval of the Ministry for conducting business. In case of complaints of serious nature against the approved service providers, the Ministry of Tourism may take action against them, which may include withdrawal of the approval/re-approval granted.*******
