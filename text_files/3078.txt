ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES & PENSIONS AND PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR.JITENDRA SINGH):    (a)&(b) No, Sir.  During the last three years (2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19), the Kudankulam Unit-1 reactor was shutdown on eight occasions. Two of these outages were for planned refueling.	(c)	A major maintenance and overhaul of the Turbogenerator of Unit-1 was carried out indigenously by Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited  (NPCIL) through Indian contractors and the unit is now operating at its rated power. Further, NPCIL is closely working with Russian experts to address the issues in the conventional areas to ensure long continuous operation of the units.(d)	NPCIL has taken up an exhaustive structured public outreach programme at Kudankulam and its surrounding areas to reach out to all sections of the society and allay the apprehensions about the safety of nuclear power, the project and all related issues in a credible manner. The initiatives taken in this regard, include distribution of single sheets in simple local language addressing each of the issues concerning the local people, arranging visits to nuclear power plants, holding exhibitions, briefing local press and media and addressing community leaders and people’s representatives. An information center is also being setup at the entrance of the site to disseminate information about nuclear energy and the plant to the locals and general public.*****
