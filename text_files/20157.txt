ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d): Aadhaar number issued to an individual under Section 2(a) & 3 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 is a twelve-digit number.To check the authenticity of Aadhaar card, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has already created a mechanism to get the Aadhaar verified in both online and offline modes.To check whether the given Aadhaar number is issued by UIDAI or not, a service on official website of UIDAI (https://resident.uidai.gov.in/verify) is available in public domain.The authenticity of the Aadhaar number can be verified through authentication. Section 4(3) of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, lays down that “Every Aadhaar number holder to establish his identity, may voluntarily use his Aadhaar number in physical or electronic form by way of authentication or offline verification…”.The offline verification includes scanning of QR code printed on Aadhaar letter/ eAadhaar/ Aadhaar PVC Card. The online verification includes OTP based authentication and Biometrics based authentication.Accordingly, the authenticity of fake Aadhaar card (if any) can be verified by the user in above mentioned ways.******
