ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a) to (d): A statement is laid on the table     Statement referred to in reply to parts (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No.59 for answer on 01.12.2021 asked by SHRI CHANDESHWAR PRASAD. (a) & (b): The receipt of coal in the power plants and generation of electricity during the period April-September of 2021-22 as compared to same period last year are as under:Period	Receipt of Coal (Million Tonne)	Coal based Generation (Billion Units)2020-21 (April-September)	265.3	429.22021-22 (April-September)	324.2	510.9The receipt of coal by the power plants was more during Apr-Sep, 2021 as compared to same period last year and the coal based generation was also commensurate with the coal receipt. However, coal availability is also impacted by the carry-over of stocks from the previous year. These stocks were lower at thermal power plants on 31st March, 2021 than on the same date last year. The stocks at CIL mines were, however, at a record high. Thermal power plants stock up coal on the basis of their expectation of likely power demand and other reasons. The coal based generation has not been affected during Apr-Sept, 2021 period.(c) & (d): In view of the above, this does not arise.****
