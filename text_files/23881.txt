ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                                           (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) to (d): Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) has reported that they have proposed to construct a Multi-Level Car Parking at Kacheripady, Ernakulam under the Smart Cities Mission (SCM). For this, CSML had tendered the project thrice in February 2018, March 2019 and January 2021. However, this tender could not be awarded in view of inadequate number of qualified bidders. CSML now proposes to retender this project with revised scope of work. In order to improve parking infrastructure in the city, different parking facilities have been planned at various locations in Kochi, and the Multi-Level Car Parking facility under SCM is one among them.  Kochi Metro Rail Limited has proposed to provide parking facilities at three different locations in the city.                                                   *****
