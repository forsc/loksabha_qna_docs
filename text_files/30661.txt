THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) and (b):  As per Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) cancer registry data on "National Cancer Registry Program, 2020", the estimated number of incidence and mortality of cervical cancer cases in the country during 2015 to 2020 is given below. Estimated cancer cases in India (2015-2020) - Cervical CancerYear	2015	2016	2017	2018	2019	2020Estimated Incidence of cancer Cases	65978	67756	69567	71415	73289	75209Estimated Mortality of cancer Cases	29029	29813	30609	31425	32246	33095(c) and (d): A study by Falcaro et al., 2021 is published in the Lancet, which showed that the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine decreases cervical cancer cases by nearly 90%. National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) is India’s apex technical advisory body, has recommended “the inclusion of specific HPV vaccines in the programme subject to the outcome of the pending Supreme Court judgement”. The court case is still pending in the Hon’ble Supreme Court.(e)  Health is a state subject. A population-based initiative for prevention, control and screening for common Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) i.e. diabetes, hypertension and common cancers has been rolled out in the country under NHM and also as a part of Comprehensive Primary Health Care. Under the initiative, persons more than 30 years of age are targeted for their screening for the three common cancers i.e oral, breast and cervical. Screening of these common cancers is an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres. Under NPCDCS, visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) is used as screening tool for cervical cancer.
