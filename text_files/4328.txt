ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) & (b): Yes, Sir. However, no complaints have been received about passenger coaches being ill fitted and uninsulated to prevent extreme temperatures. The coaches of Indian Railways (IR) are not uninsulated as non-AC coaches are properly painted with heat reflecting paint on the roof.  Thermal  insulation alongwith composite natural fibre ceiling is also provided in non-AC coaches. Modernization of coaches is a continual endeavour of Indian Railways. New specifications have been developed for infrared heat reflective coating on the roof exterior surface. Around 100 coaches have been turned out by Production Units with this specification. This is being done with a view to further minimize heat infiltration from the exterior of the coach in order to provide more comfort to passengers.(c) & (d): No ex-gratia or compensation has been paid by Railways as the incident is not covered under untoward incidents as laid down in Section 124A read with Section 123 (c) of Railways Act, 1989.*****
