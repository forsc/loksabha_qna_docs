ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (d) No specific instance has been reported wherein a hydro-power project, that was required to obtain Environmental Clearance (EC), has not done so. However, cases of non-compliance of conditions stipulated in the EC are identified based on site inspection or six-monthly compliance report filed by the respective hydro- power project. Para 10 of the EIA Notification, 2006 mandates the project proponent to submit half-yearly compliance reports in respect of the stipulated Environmental Clearance (EC) conditions to the Ministry and its Integrated Regional Offices (IROs). IROs analyze these six monthly progress reports, undertake inspection of the unit, if required; and take further action, which inter-alia include, identifying minor and major non-compliance, seeking Action Taken Report (ATR), closure of ATR etc. Based on the inspection reports received from the IROs, Ministry may issue Show Cause notice, if required, and final directions with or without closure of the Unit. MoEF&CC may also take action under Section 15 and Section 19 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986; as amended. *****
