ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (d) Opening of Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) is a continuous process. KVs areopened primarily to cater to the educational needs of the wards of transferable CentralGovernment Employees including Defence personnel by providing a commonprogramme of education. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only ifsponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India/State Governments /Union Territories Administrations thereby committing resources for setting up a new KVas well as the availability of necessary sanction of the Government. The proposalsreceived from various sponsoring authorities for opening of new KVs also have tocompete among other proposals under the “Challenge Method”. 50 new KVs, including 2in Jharkhand and 3 in West Bengal were sanctioned in the country in March, 2019.National Institutes of Technology (NIT) are already functioning at Jamshedpur(Jharkhand) and Durgapur (West Bengal) and Indian Institutes of Managements (IIMs)are functioning at Ranchi (Jharkhand) and Kolkata (West Bengal). There is no proposalat present to open new NITs and IIMs in the States of Jharkhand and West Bengal.*****
