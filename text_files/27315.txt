(ii) In case of Non-Banking Finance Company (NBFC), NBFC-Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs) etc., it is as per RBI guidelines for respective lender category.(iii) In respect of MFIs (non NBFC) & other lender categories not covered under the RBI guidelines, itis applicable as per the extant RBI guidelines for NBFC-MFIs.        An interest subsidy of 7% is paid by Ministry on a quarterly basison timely repayment of the loan instalments. The interest above the subsidy is borne by the beneficiary.
