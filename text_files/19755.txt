(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR(a) to (c): 	Government has taken several steps to create substantial awareness amongst all stakeholders including farmers on key features of Prdhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY).   The Government has actively supported the awareness activities being carried out by the States, implementing Insurance Companies, financial institutions and CSC network to disseminate key features of PMFBY amongst farmers and members of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). All the grass root level organisations responsible to implement PMFBY are actively involved in building capacity of farmers to take informed decisions.  Since, the Revamped PMFBY is being implemented from Kharif 2020, and has been made voluntary for all the farmers, the behavioral change communication activities were conducted through various media tools viz Print, electronic, Digital and Social Media etc.  As enshrined in the operational guidelines of the PMFBY, the Insurance companies have been asked to utilize 0.5% fund of the gross premium collected by them on Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities at Gram panchayat level to build overall insurance literacy of farmers. Contd…..2/-- 2 -Apart from this, other activities for awareness generation involve the publicity of key features and benefits of the scheme through advertisements in leading National and local newspapers, airing of audio-visual spots on regional / local channels, distribution of IEC material in local language, dissemination of SMS through Kisan / National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP) and organisation of online workshops of all stakeholders including farmers and other key stakeholders.The new feature on Crop Insurance App viz. integration of crop loss intimation feature in Crop Insurance App is being widely promoted through Social and Digital Media as the feature has been facilitating farmers to intimate their crop loss due to localised calamity within the prescribed time limit.   The Government has also produced a series of audio-visual materials on key features of PMFBY and promoted through a dynamic social and digital media campaign during the Covid-19 lockdown period.     Dedicated awareness programmes have been made at Gram Panchyat level in the districts selected under Krishi Kalyan Abhiyan-I, II and III.*******
