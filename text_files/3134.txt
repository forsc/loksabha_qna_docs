ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)	 No.(c) & (d) 	Government of India has closely consulted all stakeholders and engaged with the U.S. Administration and Congress on issues related to the movement of Indian professionals, including those pertaining to the H-1B programme. In our engagements, we have emphasized that this has been a mutually-beneficial partnership which should be nurtured. Indian skilled professionals have contributed to the growth and development of the U.S. economy and have helped the U.S. retain its competitive edge and innovation advantage. They are a big stakeholder in India-U.S. relations and their backward linkages to India have helped U.S. businesses. Most recently, issues of H-1B visa were raised during the visit of the U.S. Secretary of State, Michael R. Pompeo, to India on 26 June 2019.  We have conveyed our expectation to the U.S. Administration for a non-discriminatory and predictable H-1B visa regime.***
