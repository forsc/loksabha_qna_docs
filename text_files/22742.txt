In the 500 AMRUT cities, 101 lakh households have been provided tap water connections and 67 lakh sewer connections in convergence with other schemes. A new scheme has also been proposed with an objective to provide sustainable cost-effective drinking water supply to citizens in all 4,372 statutory towns and universal coverage of sewage and septage management in 500 AMRUT cities.(d) & (e) 	To ensure potable drinking water by testing the quality of tap water in villages and at household level, an innovation challenge has been launched to develop ‘portable water quality testing devices. ’This will help in testing the quality of tap water supplied easily and instantaneously. ****
