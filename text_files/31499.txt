(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	Government of India supplements the efforts of States through appropriate policy measures and budgetary support and various schemes/ programmes.

A list of various initiatives taken by the Government is at Annexure. The Government has adopted several developmental programmes, schemes, reforms and policies that focus on higher incomes for the farmers. All these policies & programmes are being supported by higher budgetary allocations, non-budgetary financial resources by way of creating Corpus Funds, and supplementary income transfers under PM-KISAN. The latest major intervention includes the ‘Atma Nirbhar Bharat – Agriculture package’ which includes comprehensive market reforms and creation of ‘Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF)’ worth Rs. 1 lakh crore.(b) to (d):	During the last three years, the growth rate of Gross Value Added (GVA) of agriculture and allied sector (as per the figures released by National Statistics office) from 2018-19 to 2020-21 are as follows:Year	Growth rate of GVA of agriculture & allied sector (at 2011-12 prices)2018-19#	2.62019-20@	4.32020-21**	3.6#Second revised estimate.@First revised estimates released on 29th January, 2021.**As per provisional estimates of Annual National Income, 2020-21 released on 31st May, 2021.The prices of agricultural produce are determined by supply and demand conditions in the market on a day-to-day basis. Apart from demand and supply conditions, quality of produce, weather condition, seasonality, availability of stocks and international prices are also affecting the prices of agricultural produce. The Government has taken a number of steps to improve post harvest infrastructure such as cold storages, warehouses, efficient supply chains etc. under various schemes such as Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana - Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied sector Rejuvenation (RKVY - RAFTAAR), Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF), Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) and Pradhan Mantri Krishi SAMPADA Yojana (PMKSY). Further, in order to prevent farmers from distress sales a 2% interest subvention has been extended to small and marginal formers having Kisan Credit Card (KCC) on post harvest loans against negotiable warehouses receipts (NWRs) at the same rate as applicable to crop loans for a period upto 6 months post harvest.
