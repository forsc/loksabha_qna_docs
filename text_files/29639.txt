                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) to (c):	Labour Bureau, under the Ministry of Labour & Employment, has been entrusted with the task of conducting the Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) as a component of All India Quarterly Establishment based Employment Survey (AQEES). Quarterly Employment Survey conducted during the first quarter (April-May-June, 2021) was also designed to collect the information on the Covid-19 pandemic impact on the operational status and employment status of the establishments in the selected 9 sectors.The impact on number of employees during lockdown period is given at Annexure. Contd..2/-:: 2 ::(d) & (e):	The steps initiated by the Government to provide incentives to the Industries are as under:- (i) The Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) was announced as part of the Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Package in 2020 with the objective to help MSMEs/small businesses under distress caused by the COVID-19 crisis, by providing 100 per cent guarantee against any losses suffered by them due to non-repayment of the ECLGS funding by borrowers. An overall ceiling of Rs. 3 lakh crore of guarantees was approved.(ii) Since its launch, ECLGS has undergone extensions and changes keeping in view of the impact of Covid on various sectors of the economy and emerging needs. All these changes were made within the overall ceiling of Rs. 3 lakh guarantee cover. The design of ECGLS provides flexibility to quickly respond to emerging needs, as has been evidenced by the introduction of ECLGS 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 as well as changes from time to time, all of which were within available headroom of Rs 3 lakh crore. Keeping in view the changes announced in the scheme and the continuing adverse impact of COVID on businesses, it has been decided to enhance the existing overall guarantee limit of Rs. 3 lakh crore to Rs. 5.50 lakh crore.(iii) Further, with a view to support businesses impacted by the second wave of COVID 19 pandemic, modifications have been made in the Scheme, which inter-alia include, additional credit support of upto 10% of total credit outstanding as on 29.02.2020 or 31.03.2021, whichever is higher, to existing borrowers under ECLGS 1.0 & 2.0 with moratorium period of 2 years for Principal repayment on such additional loan; credit support of upto 30% of their credit outstanding as on 31.03.2021 to businesses who have not availed assistance under ECLGS (ECLGS 1.0 or 2.0) with a moratorium period of 2 years for Principal repayment; credit support up to 40% of their credit outstanding as on 31.03.2021, subject to the maximum of Rs. 200 crore per borrower, to businesses in sectors specified under ECLGS 3.0, who have previously not availed ECLGS and incremental credit can be availed within these limits by existing ECLGS borrowers whose eligibility increased because of change in cut-off date to 31.03.2021 from 29.02.2020. The repayment period excluding moratorium for ECLGS-1.0 is 3 years and that for ECLGS-2.0 and 3.0 is 4 years.Contd..3/-:: 3 ::(iv) In addition, Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rojgar Yojana (ABRY) which was launched with effect from 1st October, 2020 as part of Atmanirbhar Bharat package 3.0 to incentivize  employers for creation of new employment along with social security benefits and restoration of loss of employment during Covid-19 pandemic. This scheme being implemented through Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), seeks to reduce the financial burden of the employers and encourages them to hire more workers. The terminal date for registration of beneficiaries has been extended from 30.06.2021 to 31.03.2022. As on 20.11.2021, benefit has been provided to 39.43 lakh beneficiaries through 1.15 lakh establishments.It has been reported that the support provided as per details above has helped businesses restart operations after the lockdown and contributed to economic revival in the country.  *                                                            *************
