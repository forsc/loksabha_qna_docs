ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI KRISHANPAL GURJAR)(a)  There were seven categories of disabilities namely, low vision, blindness, hearing impairment, locomotor disability, leprosy cured, mental illness and mental retardation under the repealed Act i.e. The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 (PwD Act, 1995). The Union Ministry of Rural Development implements Indira Gandhi National Disability Pension Scheme (IGNDPS). The benefit of this scheme is applicable to a person with severe (80% or more disability) or multiple disabilities as defined under the PwD Act, 1995 and the National Trust for the Welfare of Persons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation and Multiple Disabilities Act, 1999. However, in the new Act namely, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016, a total of 21 categories of disabilities have been included. (b) & (c) As per information available with this Ministry, under Indira Gandhi National Disability Pension Scheme (IGNDPS), central assistance is provided to all States/UTs @ Rs. 300/- per month per person with disabilities (PwD) aged 18-79 years with severe or multiple disabilities (disability of 80% or more) and belonging to families living below poverty line as per the criteria prescribed by the Govt. of India. On reaching the age of 80 years, the beneficiaries are paid enhanced central assistance of Rs. 500/- per month. The States/UTs are also topping-up on central assistance. Only four States namely Assam, Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland provide no additional top-up over & above central assistance. The State-wise details of top-up by States are at Annexure. (d) The Central Advisory Board on Disability (CAB) in its meeting held on 19.09.2019 deliberated on the issue of providing a minimal level of disability pension by States/UTs and urged the States/UTs to review their pension scheme and enhance the quantum of pension to all PwDs. Further, relief to persons with disabilities is a State subject by virtue of Entry 9 of the State list of the Constitution of India and accordingly, it is the responsibility of the State Governments to frame schemes and programmes to help PwDs live a productive and independent life. The Central Government, however, supplements the efforts of the State Governments through its following major schemes: (i) 	Assistance to Disabled Persons for Purchase/Fitting of Aids and Appliances (ADIP): Under ADIP Scheme assistance is provided to persons with disabilities in procuring durable, sophisticated and scientifically manufactured, modern, standard aids and appliances that can promote their physical, social and psychological rehabilitation by reducing the effects of disabilities and enhancing their economic potential. The scheme also has a provision to support cochlear implant surgery to hearing impaired children upto 5 years of age at a cost of up to Rs.6.00 lakh per child. (ii)   	Scheme for Implementation of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (SIPDA): Under this scheme, assistance is provided to State Governments and to autonomous organizations/Institutions under Central or State Governments, for various activities relating to implementation of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mainly for creation of barrier free environment including Accessible India Campaign and skill development of persons with disabilities (PwDs). (iii)  Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS): Under the scheme   grant-in-aid is provided to Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)   for their projects relating to rehabilitation of persons with disabilities aimed at enabling persons with disabilities to reach and maintain their optimal, physical, sensory, intellectual, psychiatric or social functional levels.(iv) Scholarship schemes under which the Government provides scholarships for students with disabilities such as Pre-matric (for classes IX & X), Post-matric (from class XI up to Post Graduate degree/diploma level),  Top Class Education (Post graduate degree/diploma in notified Institutes), National Fellowship (M.Phil and Ph.D courses), National Overseas Scholarship (for Overseas education at P.G./Doctorate level) and Free Coaching for Students with Disabilities (SwDs).*****
