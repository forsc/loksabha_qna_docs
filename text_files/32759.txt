ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) to (c): Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) in coordination with Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW) and Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is implementing the COVID-19 related guidelines for international passengers arriving at Indian Airports. To facilitate the movement of passengers, airport operators extend the services of testing facilities at airports through accredited Laboratories. ;;The rates for RT-PCR / Rapid RT-PCR are mostly decided and notified by the respective State/UT Governments, which are adhered to by the laboratories operating at the airports.Based on the time taken for COVID test reports, waiting time and requirement of the destination countries, passengers may choose standard RT-PCR or Rapid RT-PCR testing facilities. The charges for Standard RT-PCR is around Rs. 500/-. The charges for Rapid RT-PCR range from Rs. 1975-3000/-. This variation is mainly due to the different technologies used for testing.
