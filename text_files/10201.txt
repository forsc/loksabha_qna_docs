ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) to (d):	The benefits under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme are not linked to crop losses of farmers or possession of cattle by them or disaster affected areas. It is an income support scheme for landholding farmers’ families in the country, to enable them to take care of expenses related to agriculture and allied activities as well as domestic needs.   Farmers falling within the following exclusion criteria relating to higher income status are not eligible for the benefit under the Scheme:(A)	All Institutional Land holders; and(B)	Farmer families in which one or more of its members belong to following             categories :Contd…2/--2-i)	Former and present holders of constitutional postsii)	Former and present Ministers/ State Ministers and former/present  Members of Lok Sabha/ Rajya Sabha/ State Legislative Assemblies/ State Legislative Councils,former and present Mayors of Municipal Corporations, former and present Chairpersons of District Panchayats. iii)	All serving or retired officers and employees of Central/ State Government Ministries /Offices/Departments and its field units Central or State PSEs and Attached offices /Autonomous Institutions under Government as well as regular employees of the Local Bodies (Excluding Multi Tasking Staff / Class IV/Group D employees)iv)	All superannuated/retired pensioners whose monthly pension is Rs.10,000/-or more (Excluding Multi Tasking Staff / Class IV/Group D employees)v)	All Persons who paid Income Tax in last assessment year.vi)	Professionals like Doctors, Engineers, Lawyers, Chartered Accountants, and Architects registered with Professional bodies and carrying out profession by undertaking practices.Further, the entire responsibility of identification of beneficiaries for this Scheme rests with the State / UT Governments. Registration of farmers for this scheme and subsequent installment-wise transfer of benefits to them is a continuous and ongoing process. The financial benefit is transferred to the bank accounts of the identified eligible beneficiaries as and when their correct and verified data are uploaded by the concerned State / UT Governments on PM-Kisan web-portal www.pmkisan.gov.in. The data of beneficiaries so uploaded by the State / UT Governments undergoes a multi-level verification and validation by various concerned agencies, including the banks, which includes rejection of data for errors at various levels and re-uploading of error-free data by the State / UT Governments. Thereafter only the amount is successfully transferred into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. This entire process is replicated for transfer of every installment. To further facilitate registration of farmers, an exclusive ‘Farmers Corner’ has been provided in the PM-KISAN Web-portal through which the farmers can do their self-registration.  Farmers can also edit their names in PM-Kisan database as per their Aadhaar Card through the Farmers Corner.  Farmers can also know the status of their payment through the Farmers Corner.  The village-wise names of the beneficiaries are also available in the Farmers Corner.  Common Service Centres (CSCs) have also been authorized to assist the farmers in performing the above tasks.	On the instructions of the Union Government, the States have organized Publicity/Awareness Camps to ensure expeditious Aadhaar authentication of the data of the beneficiaries along with new registrations and correction of already registered data.*******
