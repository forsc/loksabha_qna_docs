                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a):       Mahatma Gandhi NREGA is a demand driven wage employment programme and funds are released to the States/UTs on the basis of "agreed to" Labour Budget (LB) and performance of the States during the financial year. There is no State/UT-wise allocation of funds.  The funds release under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA is based on the provision of the Act and Guidelines, issued thereunder. First tranche is released in the first half of April after adjusting unspent balance available with the States and considering the pending liabilities, if any. The 2nd Tranche is released on submission of proposal in the prescribed format by the State and subject to fulfillment of all the prescribed conditions. The proposal can be submitted after a State has utilized 75% of the total funds this year. If the proposal for 2nd Tranche is submitted after 1st October, then the Audit Report and Audited UC of the previous financial year is also required. Quantum of funds to be released as part of second tranche depends upon the performance of the State/UT.(b):       Fund release towards wage and material is a continuous process. There has been increase of more than 18% of funds allocation for the current financial year in comparison to previous financial year as Budget Estimate (BE). During the current financial year so far more than Rs.68,171 crore funds have been released to the States/UTs for the implementation of the scheme.Whenever, additional fund is required, Ministry of Finance is requested to provide the funds. In the previous financial year, Ministry of Finance allocated Rs.50,000 crore additional funds for the scheme over and above that of BE.Recently, Ministry of Finance allocated additional funds of Rs.10,000 crore for Mahatma Gandhi NREGA as an interim measure. Further, allocation may be made upon assessment of demand during the Revised Estimate (RE) stage.(c):       State/UTs wise release of funds for wage, material and administrative components under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA in the current financial year 2021-22 is given at Annexure.*******
