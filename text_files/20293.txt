The major recommendations of the Task Force are given below:(i)	For estimation of poverty an expert committee may be set up to arrive at an informed decision on the level at which the poverty line should be set.(ii)	The strategy for combating poverty must rest on two legs: sustained rapid growth that is also employment intensive and making anti-poverty programs more effective.(iii)	Steps towards making anti-poverty programmes such as the ‘Public Distribution System’ (PDS), ‘Mid Day Meal Scheme’, MGNREGA and ‘Housing for All’ are more effective to eliminate abject poverty.(c)&(d) During the preparation of the Task Force report detailed consultation were held with Ministries, States/UTs and subject experts. After incorporating the major suggestions/inputs on the report received from different stakeholders a final draft of the report was submitted by Task Force on 11th July, 2016.  No further consultations were done by NITI Aayog on the Report.(e)	A decision is yet to be taken on constituting an Expert Committee to recommend the level at which the poverty line should be set.*****
