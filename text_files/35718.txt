ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI AJAY KUMAR MISHRA)(a): National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) compiles prison statistics reported to it by the States and Union Territories (UTs) and publishes the same in its annual publication “Prison Statistics India”. The latest published report is of the year 2020. State/UT-wise number of undertrial prisoners in the jails of the country as on 31st December, 2020 are given in Annexure.(b) and (c): Undertrial prisoners are detained in the prisons as per the order of the Courts by following due process of law. ‘Prisons’/‘persons detained therein’ is a ‘State’ subject under Entry 4 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. Administration and management of prison inmates is the responsibility of respective State Governments, who are competent to devise and implement appropriate policies for ensuring social justice to inmates in prisons, including socially backward inmates. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has taken various initiatives to address the issue of undertrial prisoners lodged in the jails of the country. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has issued several advisories to States and UTs for adopting appropriate measures to provide legal assistance to undertrial prisoners. The Model Prison Manual 2016 circulated to all States and UTs has a Chapter on ‘Legal Aid’ which provides the details of facilities which may be provided to undertrial inmates, viz. legal defence, interview with lawyer, application to Courts for legal aid at Government cost etc. Section 436A has been inserted in the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides for release of an under-trial prisoner on bail after undergoing detention for a period extending up to one-half of the maximum period of imprisonment specified for an offence under any law (not being an offence for which the punishment of death has been specified as one of the punishments under that law). The concept of plea bargaining has also been introduced by inserting  a  new  “Chapter XXIA” on “Plea Bargaining” (Sections 265A to 265L of CrPC), which enables pre-trial negotiation between the defendant and the prosecution. E-prisons Software, which is a Prison Management Application integrated with Interoperable Criminal Justice System provides facility to State Jail authorities to access the data of undertrial inmates in a quick manner and helps them in identifying undertrial inmates whose cases are due for consideration by the Under Trial Review Committee. On directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) had prepared a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Under-Trial Review Committees. This SOP has been circulated by MHA to all States and UTs. State Legal Services Authorities have established Legal Service Clinics in jails for providing free legal aid to persons in need. About 1091 Legal Service Clinics have been established in jails which are operated by Empanelled Legal Services Advocates and trained Para-Legal Volunteers. ******
