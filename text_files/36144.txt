ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FORMINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYAND EARTH SCIENCES(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a)	Meteorological Centre (MC) Patna caters to the needs of weather forecast services, severe weather warning and sectoral services including agromet advisory services for the State of Bihar. There is a Flood Meteorological Office (FMO) at Patna to provide Quantitative precipitation forecast to Central Water Commission for flood forecasting. IMD has an Aeronautical Meteorological Office (AMO) also at Patna for aviation weather forecasting.(b)	Currently there are no plans to further increase the number of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) in the State. The details of the existing Automated Weather Stations (AWS) network and Automatic Rainguage (ARG) Network of Bihar is given in the Table below. Their location-wise details are given in Annexure-I.AGRO AWS 	AWS	ARG	TOTAL14	29	28	71The enhancement of observational network is a continuous process in the Department and while doing so, the requirement s of Bihar also will be taken into consideration.(c)	Flood forecasting is being dealt by Central Water Commission (CWC), Ministry of Water Resources.IMD supports flood warning services of CWC by providing observed and forecasted rainfall. Heavy rainfall events lead to floods over different river basins of the country.CWC is working in close association with IMD and State Governments for timely flood forecast whenever the river water level rises above warning level. In order to meet specific requirements of flood forecasting by CWC, IMD operates Flood Meteorological Offices (FMOs) at fourteen locations viz., Agra, Ahmedabad, Asansol, Bhubaneshwar, Bengaluru, Chennai, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Jalpaiguri, Lucknow, New Delhi, Patna, Srinagar and Thiruvananthapuram. 	IMD provides Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (QPF) for all river catchments including Damodar river basin areas for their flood forecasting activities. Flood Meteorological Offices (FMO) operated by IMD provide meteorological support including QPF of everyday valid for next five days over different river catchments to the CWC for issuing flood warnings well in advance in respect of 153 river basins. CWC issues flood forecasts 6 hrs. to 30 hrs. in advance using QPF received from FMOs of IMD and in-situ hydrometeorological data. In order to cater the services of hydro-meteorological events occurring in short duration of time, IMD is issuing Flash Flood Guidance (FFG) by which a diagnostic value within a watershed required to produce flooding at the outlet of the catchment is estimated, to support the flood warning services. Also IMD provides actual rainfall information in different spatial and temporal scale like districts, States & meteorological subdivisions level and daily, weekly & seasonal scale to support flood monitoring. As mentioned before, the Flood forecast support services for Bihar is taken care by FMO Patna.(d)-(e)	There are 03 numbers of Agromet Field Units (AMFUs) located in State Agricultural Universities and 14 numbers of District Agromet Units (DAMUs) situated at Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) under ICAR network in Bihar state. Details of AMFUs and DAMUs for the State of Bihar are given in Annexure-II.As mentioned earlier, flood forecasting is not the responsibility of IMD. However, the weather monitoring & meteorological information sharing carried out by AMFUs and DAMUs are beneficial to all users including general public.
