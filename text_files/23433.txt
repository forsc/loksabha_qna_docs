The domestic production of edible oils is not adequate to meet their demand in the country. The gap between demand and production of edible oils is met through imports. The prices of edible oils are rising internationally and since domestic production is inadequate, domestic prices of edible oils have risen during the last year. However, there is no commensurate increase in the domestic wholesale and retail prices of edible oils as compared with the international prices which have been ruling very high over the year.  (c)& (d): 	An Inter-Ministerial Committee on Agri Commodities chaired by Secretary (Food) and comprising of Secretaries of D/o Commerce, D/o Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, D/o Revenue, D/o Consumer Affairs and Directorate General of Foreign Trade is in place to closely monitor the duty structure of edible oils and other commodities in addition to their price and availability keeping in view the interests of farmer, industry and consumer.To reduce the dependency on the import of edible oils through increase in production and productivity of oilseeds in the country, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, National Food Security Mission (Oilseeds and Oilpalm) has been implemented in the country with effect from 2018-19 by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare. This mission comprises of three sub-mission namely, NFSM-Oilseeds (25 States and 3 UTs), NFSM-Oilpalm (12 States) and NFSM-TBOs (7 States and 1 UTs) and it is being implemented through the State Department of Agriculture and Horticulture. A Special Programme on Rapeseed/Mustard has also been initiated in 10 States to increase the production.*****
