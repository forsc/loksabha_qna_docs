ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(DR. SUBHAS SARKAR)(a) & (b) There is no such proposal under consideration of the Government to call-off the special dispensation quota of the Hon’ble Members of Parliament for the admission to the Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) for the academic year 2022-23. (c) No such proposal is under consideration of the Government at present to enhance admission quota in KVs for the Hon’ble Members of Parliament.(d) Opening of new KVs is a continuous process. KVs are opened primarily to cater to the educational needs of the wards of transferable Central Government Employees including Defence & Para-Military personnel, Central Autonomous Bodies, Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and Central Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) by providing a common programme of education throughout the country. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations and committing resources for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities found fulfilling the mandatory pre-requisites for opening of new KVs have to compete with other such proposals under the “Challenge Method” and subject to approval of the competent authority. At present, 122 KVs (including 01KVs in Mati Akbarpur, Kanpur Dehat district) are functioning in the State of Uttar Pradesh. Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan has not received any proposal in the prescribed proforma for opening of a new KV in the rural areas of Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. *****
