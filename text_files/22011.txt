ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (c) Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) has informed that due to COVID-19 Pandemic, no fresh recruitment of teachers took place during the last year. There are 40662 teachers in the Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs). Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) has informed that 572 teachers recruited in during the last year. There are 11808 teachers in the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs). State/UT-wise details of recruitment of teachers during the last year are annexed.  No such data is maintained in respect of Sarvodaya Vidyalayas in this Ministry.(d)	Opening of new KVs is a continuous process. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations, committing resources, including land, temporary accommodation etc. as per prescribed norms of KVS for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities for opening of new KVs complete in all respects have to compete with other proposals under the “Challenge Method”.   The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages for opening of one JNV in each district of the country. Opening of new JNVs is a continuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of school buildings and the required temporary accommodation (free of rent) to start the Vidyalaya. However, actual sanction and opening of the JNV depends on the availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority. One JNV each has been sanctioned in all the districts of the country as on 31st May 2014, excluding Tamil Nadu which has not yet accepted the Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme.*****
