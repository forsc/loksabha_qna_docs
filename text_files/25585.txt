ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND     ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) To meet the requirement of movement of essential staff including Track Maintainers for emergency maintenance works due to non-availability of passenger carrying trains (owing to discontinuation of regular passenger services in view of the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic)  MEMU rakes were operated for three days from 02.06.2021 to 04.06.2021. (b) to (e) Requests, including from the Hon’ble Member of Parliament, have been received inter alia regarding introduction of MEMU services between Kannur and Mangaluru. Owing to operational constraints, including inadequate infrastructural facilities at Palakkad, MEMU car shed, and resource constraints, introduction of MEMU train service between Kannur and Mangaluru is not feasible at present. However, introduction of trains, including MEMU trains, is an ongoing process on Indian Railways subject to operational feasibility, traffic pattern, availability of resources, etc.*****
