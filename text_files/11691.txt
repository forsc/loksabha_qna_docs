Running time of train services depends upon various factors including maximum permissible speeds on the section, type of rolling stock, sectional utilization and type of traction. At present, there is no proposal to provide additional stoppages to trains running on Jabalpur-Itarsi section. However, after completion of electrification between Katni & Satna section, running time shall reduce due to elimination of traction change & diesel fueling.******
