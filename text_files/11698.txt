ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTERY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (c)	India’s engagement with China is multifaceted. In recent years, in areas where we have commonality of views we have expanded our engagement. At the same time, the two sides have agreed to prudently manage their differences and not allow differences on any issue to become disputes. Prime Minister and Chinese President Xi Jinping have held two Informal Summits, first in April 2018 in Wuhan, China and the second in October 2019 in Chennai, India. In these Informal Summits, the two leaders have forged a consensus that the relationship between India and China, as two major countries in the world, has significance that transcends bilateral dimension. The two leaders have also reached a common understanding of the future direction of India-China relations built upon mutual respect for each other''s developmental aspirations and prudent management of differences bearing in mind the importance of respecting each other’s sensitivities, concerns and aspirations.Government of India will continue to work towards development of our bilateral relations with China on the basis of the consensus reached between Prime Minister and President Xi Jinping.
