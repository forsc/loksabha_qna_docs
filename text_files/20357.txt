No funds for creation of artificial recharge structures (for recharge of Palaeochannels) have been allocated as no such scheme is being implemented by the Ministry.(c) & (d)  There is no proposal in CGWB for the creation of a separate cell for palaeochannels activities and development of groundwater resources at present.(e)  Activities related to palaeochannels and groundwater development are being carried out through the respective Regional Offices of CGWB with existing officers/staffs.*****
