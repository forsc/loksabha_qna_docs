ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) and (b):	Education is a subject in the Concurrent List of the Constitution and majority of schools are under the jurisdiction of the State Governments. Thus, the matter relating to fees and its components in schools are regulated in terms of Rules and Instructions of the State Government concerned. It is for the respective State Government concerned to take necessary action against such schools which violate the Rules and Instructions of the State Government in the matter.(c) and (d):	No, Sir.  Zero Academic Year will impact the entire life of children as they will be one year late for future including progress in academics and career. Moreover, schools are continuing their teaching learning through alternative modes and will ensure the learning outcomes through remedial measures. The Government has also released an SOP for the partial reopening of schools so that the students of classes IX onwards can consult their teachers from September 21, 2020. (e):	The Central Board of Secondary Education has advised its affiliated schools to follow the Alternative Academic Calendar and Guidelines on Student Learning Enhancement developed by NCERT to continue education during the lockdown. These guidelines incorporate some suggestions on conducting practicals also.	In addition to measures being taken by schools regarding the conduct of practical work, Board has also shared the details of a platform titled OLabs that has been jointly developed by the Ministry of Electronics and Telecommunications, Government of India, Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC) and Amrita University to facilitate a virtual experience of CBSE syllabus aligned experiments for classes IX to XII.*****
