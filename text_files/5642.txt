ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a): As per Central Electricity Authority (CEA), total domestic coal receipt to the power plants in 2018-19 has been 582.1 Million Tonne (MT) registering a growth of 8.1% over the receipt of 538.6 MT in 2017-18. Dispatch of coal to long distance power plants is mainly catered through rail mode. As on 17.07.2019, the coal stock at power plants end is 25.59 MT which is equivalent to 15 days consumption requirement. (b) & (c): There have been sporadic instances of resistance from local population for movement of coal through road mode due to various issues including environmental concerns. Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change vide notification  dated 02.01.2014 has specified norms for use of coal  with ash content not exceeding 34% for certain distances (beyond 500 km with effect from 05.06.2016) and sensitive locations such as urban area, ecologically sensitive area or critically polluted industrial area irrespective of its distances from pithead. In addition to the above, it is mandatory to obtain consent under Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 from the concerned State Pollution Board. (d) & (e): Coal companies have planned to minimize movement of coal through road mode in a phased manner and substitute the same by conveyor belts, ropeways etc. Ministry of Power in a meeting on 25.01.2018 has directed for use of captive mode of transport for coal movement like elevated closed belt conveyors for Power plants within 20 kilometers from pithead, Merry-Go-Round (MGR) for plants located within 40 Kms from pithead and the option of MGR based on financial viability for power plants upto 100 Kms.    ******
