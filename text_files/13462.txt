ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a)    Development cooperation is the key instrument in India''s foreign policy. The scope and reach of India’s development cooperation has seen considerable expansion in the past few years. Developmental cooperation with the partner countries is mainly being executed through instruments such as Grant assistance, Lines of Credit (LOCs) and Concessional Financing Scheme. LOCs are governed by the Indian Development and Economic Assistance Scheme (IDEAS) which is revised every five years. The IDEAS guidelines currently in use were notified on 07 December 2015. These guidelines may be accessed from the website of Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance. Grant assistance initiatives are undertaken in compliance with the General Financial Rules (GFR) of Government of India and CVC Guidelines issued from time to time. Concessional Financing Scheme is governed by the ‘Guidelines on Concessional Financing Scheme (CFS) to support Indian Entities bidding for strategically important infrastructure projects abroad’ as revised in August 2018. These guidelines also are available on the website of Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance.  (b) 	The focus of development cooperation has been the countries in India’s neighbourhood and in Africa, though India is also expanding its development cooperation reach to South East Asia, East and Central Asia, the Caribbean.  A list of Line of Credit projects undertaken in the last three years country-wise has been attached as Annexure-A. In the year 2018, Project Preparation Facility (PPF) was set up to assist partner countries in coming up with viable projects that can be considered under LOCs since many countries need support in identifying, conceiving and preparing a proper project proposal. PPF provides a quick access and demand driven mechanism in this context. Expenditure for preparing the reports for project proposed under PPF are covered by the Government. In addition to this the Government also conducts training courses for the participants from about 161 countries under its Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme (ITEC) scheme which is a flagship capacity building programme. In the recently concluded comprehensive review of ITEC program significant systemic and policy level modifications have been made in the ITEC scheme. Various new initiatives including introduction of new modalities like e-ITEC, ITEC-Onsite and ITEC Executive, enhancement of facilities to participants and inclusion of new premier institutes like IITs & IIMs have been undertaken.***
