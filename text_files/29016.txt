ANSWER




                                                        (a)	To promote Inland Water Transport in the country 111 waterways (including 5 existing and 106 new) have been declared as National Waterways (NWs) under the National Waterways Act, 2016 which came into effect from 12th April, 2016.  Based on the outcome of techno-economic feasibility and Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) of NWs, 25 NWs have been found viable by Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) for cargo/ passenger movement.   The list of the 25 NWs is at Annex-I.  Developmental activities have been initiated in 13 NWs.(b) 	Rs. 96.00 crore has been sanctioned for development of the stretch between Vijayawada to Muktayala in Krishna River of NW-4 in Andhra Pradesh for following works: - (a) Establishment of four Floating Pontoons, (b) Dredging as per requirement(c) Land acquisition for construction of 3 Nos. of fixed Ro-Ro terminals at Muktyala, Harichandrapuram and Ibrahimpatnam. During the last two years i.e. 2019-20 and 2020-21 Rs. 18.87 crore and Rs. 7.66 crore respectively has been allocated to Andhra Pradesh.(c)		Bulk cargo like coal, fly-ash and iron ore are found economical & cost-effective for movement through Inland Water Transport (IWT) which is environment friendly and less pollutant mode of transport than Rail & Road.  The cargo through Inland Ship is transported in barges and there is no direct contact of the cargo with water and therefore no ecological impacts.   (d)		Yes Sir, operation of Ferries is a State subject.  Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) established through IWAI Act, 1985 for the regulation and development of National Waterways for purposes of shipping and navigation has notified (with the prior approval of the Central Govt.)  following regulations for safety considerations-	(i)  Prevention of Collision on National Waterways Regulations, 2002 and	(ii) National waterway, Safety of Navigation and Shipping Regulations, 2002	 Further Government has enacted the Inland Vessels (I.V.) Act, 2021 replacing I.V. Act 1917 for uniformity of rules and regulation for inland navigation in the country covering safety considerations.
