                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a)Quality of education in Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) is ensured through recruitment of qualified teachers, regular supervision by Principals and periodical supervision by the officers of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) Head quarter and Regional Offices. Further, training programmes and workshops are also organized for updating and empowering teachers to ensure quality of education and efficiency.       (b)The functioning of KVS is regularly reviewed and monitored by the Ministry of Education. The performance of the organization is periodically appraised by the Board of Governors and the General Body of the KVS. Annual action plan and medium terms strategic plans are drawn up along with key result areas for monitoring the performance. The performance of the KVS is also reported to the Parliament through its Annual reports and Audited statements of accounts every year.(c) to (e) Opening of new KVs is a continuous process. KVs are opened primarily to cater to the educational needs of the wards of transferable Central Government Employees including Defence & Para-Military personnel, Central Autonomous Bodies, Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and Central Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) by providing a common programme of education. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations and committing resources for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities found fulfilling the mandatory pre-requisite for opening of new KVs have to compete with other such proposals under the “Challenge Method” and also subject to approval of the competent authority.  At present, out of 112 Aspirational Districts, 160 KVs including 01 KV in district Washim, Maharashtra are functioning in 96 districts across the country. KVs are not opened on the criteria of State / UT / District / Aspirational district-wise etc. *****
