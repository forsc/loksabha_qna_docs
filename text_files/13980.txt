                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) : National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) maintains district-wise data on Human Trafficking which also includes districts of Assam. Latest published data is available upto the year 2018. The district-wise data of human trafficking (under section 370 and 370A) in Assam for the year 2018 is at Annexure-I. (b) to (d): There are Nineteen (19) Ujjwala Homes in the State of Assam. These homes are meant for both trafficked women and children. Many meetings and Video Conferences were held with concerned officials and State government for sending proposals for new Ujjawala Homes in their States/UTs. Besides, food, clothing, medical care etc., school education is provided to children admitted in these Homes.As per Section 2(14)(ix) of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act), a child who is found vulnerable and is likely to be inducted into drug abuse or trafficking is included as a “child in need of care and protection”. The JJ Act, 2015 mandates a security net of service delivery structures to provide institutional and non-institutional care to these children. The primary responsibility of execution of the Act lies with States/Union Territories (UTs). The Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing a centrally sponsored Child Protection Services (CPS) Scheme (erstwhile Integrated Child Protection Scheme) for supporting the children in difficult circumstances.The primary responsibility of implementation of the scheme lies with the States/UT Administrations. The scheme inter-alia provides for setting up of Child Care Institutions (CCIs) by the States/UTs either by themselves or in association with voluntary organizations. The scheme also provides for non-institutional care wherein support is extended for adoptions, foster care and sponsorship. The scheme supports 24x7 outreach helpline service for children in distress. This service is available through a dedicated toll free number 1098 which can be accessed by children in crisis or by adults on their behalf from any place in India. The details of CCIs along with the children residing in them under CPS scheme as informed by States/UTs including the State of Assam is at Annexure-II.
