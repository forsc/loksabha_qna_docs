ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a):  As per Foreign Trade Policy, export of wheat is under ‘Free’ category and therefore no licence / Authorisation is required from Government for its export. The exporters from India have exported wheat in view of the rising global demand. The Government does not export wheat except as humanitarian aid-in-grant form to the deserving countries.  (b):  Export of wheat during 2020-21 and 2021-22 ( till 21st March, 2022) is given below in a tabular statement:                                                 Qty in Lakh Metric Tonne and Value in USD million2020-21	2021-22 ( till 21st March, 2022) Qty	Value	Qty	Value21.55	567.93	70.35	2035.09 (c) :  Export of all items including wheat would depend on various factors such as domestic production / consumption, surplus for exports, global scenario and competitive pricing.  Therefore, it is difficult to quantify the surplus for exports in the ensuing Rabi season.*****
