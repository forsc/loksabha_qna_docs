                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a):	The number of revenue villages in Bhilwara district of Rajasthan is 1939 and the number of revenue villages in which financial benefit under PM-KISAN Scheme has been transferred to the farmers is 1851.(b) to (d):	Financial benefit under PM-KISAN Scheme has been transferred to the farmers whose details have been provided by the State Government.  The details of farmers in 88 villages of Bhilwara District of  Rajasthan have not been uploaded by the State Government on the portal.  In this connection, it may be stated that the entire responsibility of identification of eligible beneficiary farmer families and uploading their correct details on the PM-KISAN portal rests with the concerned State/UT Governments.  The data of beneficiaries uploaded by them undergoes a multi-level verification and validation by various concerned agencies, including the banks, which includes rejection of data for errors at various levels and re-uploading of error-free data by the State / UT Governments. Thereafter only the amount is successfully transferred into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. Accordingly, as on 11.3.2020, payments have been made to 53,25,486 beneficiaries in Rajasthan including 2,80,027 beneficiaries in Bhilwada District. However, beneficiaries are entitled to their benefit from the 4-monthly period in which their names are registered for the first time on the PM-KISAN portal by the State Governments.********
