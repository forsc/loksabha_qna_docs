ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) to (c): No, Sir. With a view to providing a greater measure of protection to depositors in banks, the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) raised the limit of insurance cover for depositors in insured banks from the earlier level of ?1 lakh to ?5 lakh per depositor with effect from 04.02.2020 under Section 16 (1) of the DICGC Act, 1961. Thus, the limit of the deposit insurance amount payable by DICGC to any one depositor in respect of deposits held by him/ her in the same right and same capacity at all the branches of an insured bank taken together, is ?5 lakh. The deposit insurance cover is applicable uniformly to all insured banks and their depositors. ***
