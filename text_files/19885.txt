ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) & (b):  	As per provisions of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), there is no need to file the crop loss/ claims intimation in case of wide spread natural calamities such as drought, flood etc. as the claims are calculated on the basis of shortfall in yield of the notified insurance unit at the end of season. The end season, prevented sowing and midseason adversity claims are settled on the basis of Area Approach for which yield data/crop damage report are provided by concerned State Government.  However, the risk impacting very few areas/land such as losses due to localized risks of hailstorm, landslide, inundation, cloud burst, natural fire and post-harvest losses due to unseasonal rains/cyclone/hailstorms are calculated on the basis of crop loss assessment at individual insured farm level.   Hence, farmers have to intimate the loss of their crops to the concerned insurance company/State Government/ financial institutions.  Such crop losses are assessed by a joint committee comprising representatives of State Government and concerned insurance company.  Contd…2/--2-District-wise details of partial claims paid during Kharif 2020 season in Uttar Pradesh are annexed.  Coverage for Rabi 2020-21 season has been completed recently and claims may be known after harvesting and receipt of requisite yield data from State Government for calculation of admissible claims. (c): 	It has been observed that certain district-crop combinations have recurring claim experience resulting in higher premium rates under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY).  State Governments have been requested to examine the  reasons/causes of high premium rates for few crops/areas due to adverse selection, inconsistencies in the cultivation of crops as per the suitability of the climate, inconsistencies in collection of yield data etc. and make suitable corrective measures in collection of yield data, issue weather advisory, advise crop diversification to the farmers etc.    Further, National Rainfed Area Authority (NRAA) has also been requested to Study on Operational issues in implementation of PMFBY to recommend effective implementation strategies for most vulnerable districts.
