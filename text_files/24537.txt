ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE  ???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????	 (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	As per the publication on Land Use Statistics for 2017-18 (latest available), the state-wise details of percentage of agricultural land out of the geographical area in the country is given at Annexure-I. (b) & (c):	As per Census 2011, conducted by the Registrar General of India, the total number of agricultural workers in the country have increased from 234.1 million (127.3 million cultivators and 106.8 million agricultural labourers) in 2001 to 263.1 million (118.8 million cultivators and 144.3 million agricultural labourers) in 2011. However, the share of workforce engaged in the agriculture sector (comprising of cultivators and agricultural labourers) has come down from 58.2 per cent in 2001 to 54.6 per cent in 2011.  State/UT-wise details of agricultural workers in India are given in Annexure-II. Migration of agricultural labour  from  rural to  urban  areas is a  general  phenomenon  and a natural part of   the development process.  The reasons for this shift include, inter alia, better employment opportunities in industry and services, increasing urbanization. In a market economy like India, movement of the people for better economic opportunities is natural. (d): 	As per the Seventh Schedule of Constitution of India, land comes under the purview of State Governments and, therefore, it is for the State Governments to make efforts to increase cultivable land. However, Government of India supplements the efforts of the State Governments through various crop development Schemes/Programmes. Also, the foodgrain production in the country has continued its upward trend and during 2020-21 the production is estimated at 305.44 million Tonnes (As Per Third Advance Estimate, 2020-21). Government has been implementing various schemes viz. National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern Indian (BGREI), Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY), etc to attain the production target.To increase production, acreage of agricultural crops in the country, and encourage farmers, Government of India is implementing through State Governments, several Schemes/Programmes such as National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India (BGREI), National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, Soil Health Card, Scheme for formation of 10,000 Farmers Producers Organisations (FPOs), better insurance coverage to crops for risk mitigation through Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and e-NAM initiative to provide farmers an electronic transparent and competitive online trading platform. Further, the latest major intervention includes the launch of Kisan rail and the ‘Atma Nirbhar Bharat – Agriculture’ which includes comprehensive market reforms and creation of Financing facility under ‘Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF)’ worth Rs. 1 lakh crores.
