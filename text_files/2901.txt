ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) & (b): There have been complaints about irregularities and cropping up of blackmarketing in the functioning of the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) in some States/regions in the country. TPDS is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and the State/Union Territory (UT) Governments wherein the operational responsibilities for implementation of TPDS within the State/UT rest with the State/UT Governments concerned. Therefore, as and when complaints are received by the Government, they are sent to State/UT Governments concerned for inquiry and appropriate action. 	An offence committed in violation of the provisions of TPDS (Control) Order, 2015 is liable for penal action under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Thus, the Order empowers State/UT Governments to take punitive action in case of contravention of relevant provisions of these Orders.  Also, the institutional mechanism for the monitoring and grievance redressal under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) provides setting up of Vigilance Committees, District Grievance Redressal Officers and independent State Food Commission for making the system more efficient and transparent.	Further, to bring reforms in the functioning of the Public Distribution System (PDS), this Department in collaboration with all States/UTs is implementing a scheme on ‘End-to-End Computerization of PDS Operations’. The scheme comprises of digitization of ration cards/beneficiaries, computerization of supply-chain management, setting up of transparency portals and grievance redressal mechanisms in all States/UTs. The Scheme also includes automation of Fair Price Shops (FPSs) by installation of electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices at all FPSs.***
