ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) to (c)  The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 is an Act to provide for the enhancement of livelihood security of the household in rural areas of the country by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. It is a demand driven programme and the types of works are mentioned in the Schedule-I of the Act. The Scheme is not a regular employment Scheme but a fall back option. The skilled workers are engaged as per the requirement of the work. However, there is no plan to give work opportunity to the skilled artisans like handloom weavers, handicrafts artisans, potters, metal and wood or stone carving and weaving artisans.*****
