The Week culminated on 28th February 2022,  the National Science Day, which is celebrated nationally to mark the Nobel Prize winning discovery of ‘Raman Effect’ of   light scattering,   of great Indian Scientist Sir CV Raman. Science exhibitions with models, book fairs, lectures, competitions, science literature festivals, etc. were organised at 75 locations across the country in collaboration with local academic partners. A mega exposition was arranged in New Delhi, along with a national science book fair associated with the National Book Trust and Federation of Indian Publishers.

National Council for Science & Technology Communication (NCSTC) of DST is the nodal agency to support, catalyze and coordinate celebration of the NSD throughout the country, particularly in scientific institutions & research laboratories and offers a variety of fora where discussions of such themes are organized in the States including Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
