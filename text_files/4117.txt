(d): ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and State Governments are responsible for prevention, detection, registration and investigation of crime and for prosecuting the criminals through their law enforcement agencies. However, in order to facilitate police in States/UTs to effectively deal with the crimes, Government of India has inter alia taken following measures: (i)	The Ministry of Home Affairs has prepared “Witness Protection Scheme, 2018” in consultation with the National Legal Service Authority, Bureau of Police Research & Development and the State Governments.

(vi)	In order to improve investigation, steps have been taken to strengthen DNA analysis units in Central and State Forensic Science Laboratories. This includes setting up of a State-of-the-Art DNA Analysis Unit in Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Chandigarh. MHA has also sanctioned setting-up and upgrading of DNA Analysis units in State Forensic Science Laboratories in 13 States/ UTs.(vii)	The Ministry of Home Affairs has also been providing funds to the State Governments for modernization of their Police Forces. ******
