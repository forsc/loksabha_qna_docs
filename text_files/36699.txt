                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL) (a) & (b) Since August, 2019, Government of India in partnership with States is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) to make provision of potable water to every rural household through tap water connection of the country, including those in tribal dominated areas of Banswara-Dungarpur and nearby areas in the State of Rajasthan, by 2024. Drinking Water being a State subject, it is States, who plan, design, approve and implement drinking water supply schemes. Government of India supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical and financial assistance. As such details of individual rural water supply projects are not maintained at Government of India level, however, State reports day to day physical and financial progress under JJM in the Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) of the Department as per the Operational Guidelines for the implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission. The State/ UT, district & village-wise status of tap water connection in rural households, schools and anganwadi centres etc. as reported by States/ UTs is in public domain and available on JJM dashboard at: https://ejalshakti.gov.in/jjmreport/JJMIndia.aspx(c) Under the mission, 30% weightage is assigned for difficult terrains which inter alia include areas under Desert Development Programme (DDP) and Drought Prone Area Programme (DPAP) and 10% weightage is assigned for population residing in SC/ ST dominated areas, while allocating the fund, to prioritize the coverage in these areas. Further, priority has been given to water quality-affected habitations, villages falling in drought prone & desert areas, SC/ST majority villages, villages in Aspirational and JE–AES affected districts, and Sansad Aadarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) villages to provide tap water connections for tap water supply.Further, for ensuring tap water supply in drought-prone & water-scarce areas/ areas with inadequate rainfall or dependable ground water sources, provisions have been made under JJM for planning and implementation of bulk water transfer from long distances and regional water supply schemes. In addition, provisions have been made for source recharging, viz. dedicated bore well recharge structures, rain water recharge, rejuvenation of existing water bodies, etc., in convergence with other schemes such as MGNREGS, Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP), 15th Finance Commission tied grants to RLBs/ PRIs, State schemes, CSR funds, etc.(d) & (e) Important measures taken by the Central Government for conservation, management of ground water and effective implementation of rain water harvesting in the country are available in public domain at:http://jalshakti-dowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Feb2021.pdf*****
