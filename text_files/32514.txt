ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a): The position of India in terms of coal production in the world was 2nd in the year 2020.(b): Total raw coal production and offtake of Coal India Limited during the last five years is given below:(Figures in Million Tonnes) Year	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21Production	554.14	567.37	606.89	602.14	596.22Offtake	543.22	580.29	608.14	581.92	574.48 (c): The details of coal production of South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL) during the last five years is as under:(Figures in Million Tonnes)Year	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21Production	140.003	144.709	157.349	150.546	150.605 (d) & (e): In SECL, there are 69 Mines (46 Underground + 23 Opencast). The total assessed capacity for FY 2020-21 of these mines is 179.98 MT, against which 150.605 MT has been produced, which is about 84% of assessed capacity. All efforts are made for working the mines at their full capacity. Out of the 23 Opencast Mines, 8 Mines viz. Gevra, Kusmunda, Chhal, Ambika, Batura, Jagannathpur, Saraipali & Amadand are under different stages of construction/ development like possession of land and forest clearance. Two Projects viz. Amera and Amgaon are at present stalled due to villagers’ resistance.Following action has been taken to improve the capacity utilization:1.	Close liaising, regular meeting and co-ordination with state government officials and Project affected Families (PAF’s) to obtain the possession of land.2.	Preventive/scheduled maintenance of Heavy Earth Moving Machinery (HEMM) to ensure availability.3.	Production incentive scheme for motivation of work force.4.	Steps being taken for optimum utilization of HEMMs.In some underground mines there has been less utilization due to exhaustion of reserve, adverse geo-mining conditions like encountering thinning of coal seams, presence of faults, waterlogged strata and involvement of long and arduous traveling of work force and difficulties faced in de-pillaring. The names of such mines are as under:Kapildhara, Bijuri, Kumda New, Balrampur,Jamuna 9&10, Navapara, Gayatri, NCPH New, Rajnagar RO, Bhadra, Meera, Bartarai, Pipariya, Rajgamar, Surakachar 3&4, Surakachar Main, Bagdewa, Dhelwadih, Singhali, Rajendra etc.Action has been taken for deployment of Continuous Miner technologies in the Underground mines such Behraband, Kurja-Sheetaldhara etc and Man-Riding system has also been installed to avoid arduous traveling by work force. ****
