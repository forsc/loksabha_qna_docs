ANSWER




                                                        (a)	There are 12 major ports and around 200 non-major ports in the country. While the major ports are under the administrative control of Ministry of Shipping, the non-major ports are under the jurisdiction of respective State Government. The details of traffic handled by major ports and non-major ports during the last three years are at Annexure - I.(b) to (f) Infrastructure development and capacity augmentation of major ports is an ongoing process. The process inter-alia involves construction of new berths and terminals, mechanization of existing berths and terminals, capital dredging for deepening of drafts for attracting large vessels in port channels, development of road and rail connectivity etc. The details of Major Ports Performance and Profit (Operating and Net Surplus) earned during the last three years and the current years are given at Annexure – II. In order to empower major ports in the country to perform with greater efficiency, Government has taken the following steps:(i)	  With a view to improve the efficiency and productivity of the major ports and make it comparable internationally, a benchmarking study of major ports to international standards has been conducted which has recommended 116 initiatives  out of which 95 have already been implemented. (ii)  Ministry of Shipping has introduced many other policy initiatives to attain more efficiency like Stevedoring and Shore Handling Policy, Berthing Policy, Captive Policy, revised guidelines on security clearance and revised Model Concession Agreement (MCA) for Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects.
