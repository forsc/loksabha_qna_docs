For providing relief in case of 12 notified natural disasters including cyclone, State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) is placed at the disposal of the State Government.

Further, in the case of Cyclone Nivar, IMCT visited the affected areas of the State from 17th to 19th December 2020 for on-the-spot assessment of damages and submitted its report. Additional financial assistance from NDRF will be extended after appraisal of the report by the Sub-Committee of the National Executive Committee (NEC) and approval by HLC as per laid down procedure.  	Further, Central Government has already released its central share of Rs. 1119 crore  in SDRF to the State of Andhra Pradesh. -3-L.S.US.Q.NO.2369 FOR 09.03.2021(c):	There are well established institutional mechanisms at the National, State & District levels in the country to develop appropriate preparedness and prompt response mechanisms for effective management of natural disasters including cyclones.
