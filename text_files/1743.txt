ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):     Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is engaged in developing modern agricultural techniques using geo-informatics including GIS & Remote Sensing, Information Technology (IT), simulation modeling, nano science,  biotechnology etc. in effective monitoring, conservation and management of natural resources viz. soil and water.                  Soil Health Card Scheme has been introduced in year 2014-15 to assist State Governments to issue soil health cards to all farmers in the country. Soil health cards   provide information to farmers on nutrient status of their soil along with recommendation on appropriate dosage of nutrients to be applied for improving soil health and  fertility. Soil status is assessed every 2 years so that nutrient deficiencies are identified and corrective steps taken.               Government is implementing Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna (PMKSY) which is operational in the country from 2015-16.  The PMKSY-PDMC focuses on water use efficiency at farm level through precision/ Micro Irrigation technologies viz.  drip and sprinkler Irrigation.  Micro irrigation technology not only helps in water saving, but also in reducing fertilizer usage thereby improving soil health, labour expenses, and other inputs and increasing productivity. Under PMKSY-PDMC, an area of 36.20 lakh has been covered under Micro Irrigation in the country from 2015-16 to     2018-19.                  Contd…2/--2-(c):	Government has already declared fertilisers as an essential commodity under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and has promulgated the Fertiliser (Control) Order, 1985 to regulate the trade, price, quality and distribution of fertilizers. Specifications of fertilizers are prescribed in the said Order. No person shall sell, sale, offer for sale or distribute any fertiliser which is not of prescribed standard. Clause 19 of the FCO strictly prohibits the sale of fertilizers which are not of prescribed standards. Samples of fertilizers are drawn periodically by the fertiliser inspectors of the State Governments from retailers/wholesalers and manufacturing units etc. for testing in the notified laboratories to check their quality in respect of the quality parameters prescribed in the FCO, 1985. State Governments are empowered under the FCO / Essential Commodities Act, 1955 to take appropriate administrative and legal action against those dealers/manufactures/importers who do not comply with the provisions prescribed in the Order. There are 85 fertiliser testing laboratories in the country for testing fertilizer samples.             Government has enacted the Insecticides Act, 1968 to regulate the import, manufacture, sale, transport, distribution and use of insecticides. As per the Insecticides Act, 1968, the monitoring of quality of pesticides is a shared responsibility between the Central and State Governments. Central Government and State Governments have notified Insecticides Inspectors to check sale of misbranded pesticides. Insecticide samples are drawn on regular basis and analyzed in State Pesticides Testing Laboratories (SPTLs) and at the two Regional Pesticides Testing Laboratories at Chandigarh and Kanpur. Action is initiated under the provisions of the Insecticides Act, 1968 against those samples which are found misbranded.(d):	 In order to prevent burning of crop residues,  Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) recommended certain technological interventions namely in-situ incorporation of crop residue through conservation agriculture practices, rapid composting of crop residue using microbial consortia, production of bio gas,  mushroom cultivation,  preparation of feed for livestock,  production of bio-fuel and biochar. The ICAR also imparts training to educate farmers on all these aspects.               To support the efforts of the Governments of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and the NCT of Delhi to address air pollution due to stubble burning and to subsidize machinery for the farmers for in-situ management of crop residue, a new Central Sector Scheme on  Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi for the period from 2018-19 to 2019-20 has been launched with a total outgo from Central funds of Rs.1191.62 (Rs.591.62 crore in 2018-19 and Rs.600.00 crore in 2019-20).  Funds released are as follows:Year wise Funds released in Crores	Punjab	Haryana 	Uttar Pradesh2018-19	269.38	137.84	148.602019-20 (till date)	248	173	96.95 ********
