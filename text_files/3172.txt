ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	The total production of Natural Rubber (NR) during 2018-19 is provisionally estimated at 648000 tonnes.  The production of NR during April-May 2019 is provisionally estimated at 74000 tonnes.  State-wise production of NR upto 2018-19 is given in the Annexure.(b) & (c): The Natural Rubber prices have been at relatively low levels during the past few years in domestic and international markets.  However, the rubber prices started increasing during the recent weeks and the average price for the RSS4 grade in June, 2019 was 150.29 per kg.  The Natural Rubber prices are determined by market forces and a range of factors which inter-alia include trends in economic growth in major consuming countries, oil/synthetic rubber prices, weather conditions and developments in future markets. The domestic NR market generally follows the trend in world market with occasional divergences due to region specific and seasonal factors.  No quantitative restrictions can be imposed on the import of NR under WTO commitments.  The domestic NR price is sensitive to import of NR.  Therefore, to regulate the import of NR, the Government has increased the duty on import of dry rubber from “20% or Rs. 30 per kg whichever is lower” to “25% or Rs. 30 per kg whichever is lower” w.e.f 30.4.2015. The Government has also reduced the period of utilization of imported dry rubber in January 2015 under advance licensing scheme from 18 months to 6 months. The Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) has imposed port restriction on the import of Natural Rubber by restricting the port of entry to Chennai and Nhava Sheva (Jawaharlal Nehru Port) since 20th January, 2016.***** AnnexureAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 2798 for 10.7.2019State-wise production of NR (Tonne)	State	2015-16	2016-17	2017-18 (P)	2018-19 (P)Kerala	438630	540400	540775	490460Tamil Nadu	19495	21140	21110	21500Traditional Total	458125	561540	561885	511960Tripura	44245	50985	50500	53050Assam	14560	19970	23300	24300Meghalaya	7360	8950	9050	9100Nagaland	3020	4320	4820	4930Manipur	1660	2090	1790	1850Mizoram	595	742	742	750Arunachal Pradesh	360	478	428	450North East Total	71800	87535	90630	94430Karnataka	29400	38800	38300	38200A&N    Islands	240	240	240	275Goa	640	645	575	625Maharashtra	925	1185	1185	1250Odisha	315	400	450	480West Bengal	325	335	335	380Andhra Pradesh	230	320	400	400Others Total	32075	41925	41485	41610Non Traditional Total	103875	129460	132115	136040Grand Total	562000	691000	694000	648000Source:  Rubber BoardP: Provisional***
