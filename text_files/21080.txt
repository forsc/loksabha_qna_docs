MNRE is also implementing a Central Sector Scheme, the New National Biogas and Organic Manure Programme (NNBOMP) for setting up small biogas plants, based on cattle dung and other mixed wastes for water pumping and meeting small farm power needs. In both the Schemes, central financial assistance is provided, as per the Scheme guidelines.
