ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d)    Central Pollution Control Board(CPCB) in association with Pollution Control Boards/Committees in different States/Union Territories (UTs) have been monitoring water quality of rivers and other water bodies across the country through a network of monitoring stations under the National Water Quality Monitoring Programme. As per the last report published by CPCB in September 2018, 351 polluted stretches have been identified on 323 rivers based on monitoring results of 521 rivers in the country in terms of Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), an indicator of organic pollution. State-wise details of polluted river stretches are given at Annexure.Cleaning of rivers is an ongoing process. It is the responsibility of the States/UTs and local bodies to ensure required degree of treatment of sewage and industrial effluents to the prescribed norms before discharging into water bodies or land to prevent and control of pollution therein. For conservation of rivers, this Ministry has been supplementing the efforts of the States/UTs by providing financial and technical assistance for abatement of pollution in identified stretches of rivers in the country through the Central Sector Scheme of NamamiGange for rivers in Ganga basin, and Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) for other rivers.Project proposals for pollution abatement in the towns/cities along polluted river stretches are received from the States/UTs from time to time for consideration under NRCP and sanctioned based on their prioritization,  conformity  with  NRCP  guidelines,  availability of plan funds, etc. NRCP has so far covered Contd…P/2polluted stretches on 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country with the project sanctioned cost of Rs.5961.75 crore, and inter-alia, a sewage treatment capacity of 2677 mld (million litres per day) has been created. Under the Namami Gange programme, a total of 353 projects, including 157 projects for sewage treatment of 4952 mld and a sewer network of 5212 kms, have been sanctioned at a cost of Rs.30458 crore.Under NRCP, for conservation of rivers Brahmini, Mahanadi and coastal area, pollution abatement projects were sanctioned in 5 towns, namely Chandbali, Cuttack, Dharamshala, Talcher and Puri in Odisha under NRCP at a cost of Rs.92.74 crores and sewage treatment capacity of 50 mld has been created in these towns. Government of Odisha has installed  sewage treatment capacity of 216 mld to treat domestic/municipal wastewater in addition to the NRCP programme.Also, in compliance of the orders of National Green Tribunal (NGT) in Original Application No.673/2018 regarding rejuvenation of polluted river stretches in the country, States/UTs are required to implement approved action plans for restoration of the polluted stretches in their jurisdiction as identified by CPCB and published in their report of 2018, within the stipulated timelines. As per the orders of NGT, regular review on implementation of action plans is undertaken in the States/UTs and also at Central level.As per the provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution), Act 1974, industrial units are required to install effluent treatment plants (ETPs) and treat their effluents to comply with stipulated environmental standards before discharging into river and water bodies. Accordingly, CPCB, State Pollution Control Boards and Pollution Control Committees monitor industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under provisions of these Acts.***** ANNEXURE Annexure referred to in reply to parts (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. †917 to be answered on the 02.12.2021 regarding “Survey of Polluted Rivers”.
