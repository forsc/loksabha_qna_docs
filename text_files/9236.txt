                                                        THE MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a) to (d)   A statement is laid on the table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF STARRED QUESTION NO *246 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 05.12.2019 REGARDING “SHORTAGE OF WATER”.(a) & (b) The average annual water availability of any region or country is largely dependent upon hydro-meteorological and geological factors. However, water availability per person is dependent on population of the country and for India, per capita water availability in the country is reducing due to increase in population. The average annual per capita water availability in the year 2011 has been assessed as 1545 cubic meters which may further reduce to 1486 cubic meters, 1367 cubic meters, 1282 cubic meters and 1228 cubic meters in the years 2021, 2031, 2041 and 2051 respectively. Annual per-capita water availability of less than 1700 cubic meters is considered as water stressed condition, whereas annual per-capita water availability below 1000 cubic meters is considered as a water scarcity condition. Due to high temporal and spatial variation of precipitation, the water availability in many regions of the country is below the national average and may be facing water stress / scarce conditions.(c) & (d)  The country is facing a number of challenges in water management such as huge temporal and spatial variability in respect of availability of water resources, declining per-capita water resources availability due to rapid increase in population, inadequate surface water storage for meeting future water demands, over-exploitation of ground water resources, droughts, low water use efficiency, etc.Water being a State subject, measures for management of water resources is primarily taken by respective State Governments. Central Government supplements the efforts of the State Governments by providing technical and financial assistance through various schemes and programmes.

This Mission will focus on integrated demand and supply side management of water at the local level, including creation of local infrastructure for source sustainability like rainwater harvesting, groundwater recharge and management of household wastewater for reuse in agriculture.Central Ground Water Board is implementing a nationwide programme of “National Aquifer Mapping and Management (NAQUIM)” for mapping of aquifers (Water bearing formations), their characterization and development of aquifer management plans to facilitate sustainable development of ground water resources.
