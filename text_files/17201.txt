ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES & PENSIONS AND PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR.JITENDRA SINGH):(a)	The spent nuclear fuel from the nuclear power reactors at Kudankulam will be stored initially in the spent fuel storage pools within the reactor buildings and thereafter in the Away From Reactor (AFR) facility to be set up at the site, till it is taken for reprocessing. (b)	Presently the process of obtaining various clearances for setting up the AFR at Kudankulam is in progress.(c)	India is pursuing a closed fuel cycle, where the quantity of radioactive waste generated is very less. Further technologies for separation, partitioning and burning of waste are being developed in the country, which will further bring down the quantity of radioactive waste. Considering the small quantity of radioactive waste, there is no need for Deep Geological Repository in near future.	*****
