                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (SMT. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) Health is a state subject. The Department of Health & Family Welfare, however, provides technical and financial support to the States/UTs under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), as part of National Health Mission (NHM), based on the proposals received in Program Implementation Plans (PIPs) from the States/UTs and subject to the resource envelope. Hypertension /High Blood Pressure is an integral part of NPCDCS. The programme focusses on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, health promotion & awareness generation for prevention, early diagnosis, management and referral to an appropriate level of healthcare facility for treatment of the given Non-Communicable Diseases including Hypertension.A population-based initiative for prevention, control and screening for common Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) i.e. Diabetes, Hypertension and common Cancers viz. Oral, Breast and Cervical Cancers, has been rolled out in the country under NHM and also as a part of Comprehensive Primary Health Care under Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWC). Under the initiative persons more than 30 years of age are targeted for their screening for common NCDs including Hypertension.“The India Hypertension Control Initiative (IHCI)” is also being implemented with primary focus on the control of high blood pressure, a leading risk factor for CVDs among adults in India. The project has been initiated in 83 districts of 18 states and has registered 1.4 million patients across the country. (b) As per National Action Plan and Monitoring framework for prevention and control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), there is a target to achieve relative reduction in prevalence of raised blood pressure by 10% by year 2020.The prevalence of hypertension can be determined by periodic surveys. National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 4 provided the first baseline data and reported a prevalence of 8.8 % in female and 13.6 % in male in the year 2015-16 in 15-49 years of age group. The latest results of NFHS-5 are awaited.(c) and (d) As per the report of NHFS-4, the prevalence of Hypertension is lower in younger age group as compared to older age group. The details for the same are as below:-Age Group	Male	Female15-19	3.4	2.820-29	9.4	5.630-39	18.0	13.040-49	27.0	23.0Preventive aspect of Hypertension is being strengthened under Comprehensive Primary Health Care under Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centers, by promotion of wellness activities and targeted communication at the community level. Other initiatives for increasing public awareness about the risk factors for Hypertension and for promotion of healthy lifestyle include observation of World Hypertension Day and use of print, electronic and social media for continued community awareness. Furthermore, healthy eating is also promoted through FSSAI. Fit India movement is being implemented by Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, and various Yoga related activities are being carried out by Ministry of AYUSH. In addition, NPCDCS gives financial support under NHM for awareness generation (IEC) activities for Hypertension to be undertaken by the States/UTs as per their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs), subject to resource envelope.(e) Under NPCDCS, 640 NCD Clinics at District level and 5148 NCD Clinics at Community Health Centre level have been set up to ensure the treatment of common NCDs including high blood pressure/hypertension.The screening for common Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) including hypertension is also being done as a part of Comprehensive Primary Health Care under Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres. The focus is on continuum of care. The patient with severe illness is screened and/or diagnosed and referred to appropriate higher health care facilities for further treatment and management. Further, the patient is referred back to the HWCs for follow up by front-line workers to ensure continuation of treatment compliance. High Blood pressure/hypertension patients are diagnosed and treated at various health facilities in the health care delivery system including District Hospitals, Medical Colleges, Central Institutes like AIIMS, etc. The treatment in Government health facilities is either free, or highly subsidized for the poor and needy. Under Free Drugs Service Initiative of NHM, financial support is provided to States/UTs for provision of free essential medicines. Furthermore, quality generic medicines are being made available at affordable prices to all, under Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana in collaboration with the State Governments.Guidelines and advisories were sent by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to State/UT Governments from time to time emphasizing the need for continuation of non-COVID essential health services for management of NCDs including hypertension during COVID pandemic.States/UTs were also advised to utilize the Population Based Screening (PBS) data during containment activities in order to identify those with NCDs including hypertension, and to place them under health surveillance.
