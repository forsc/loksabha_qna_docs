ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) & (b) : 	Coal based Power Plants located all over the world including India, cause emission of carbon and various derivatives of carbon oxides due to combustion of fossil fuel and contribute to global warming. The  carbon oxide emissions from Thermal Power Plants in the country is relatively higher for inferior quality of coal (high ash content), and further due to higher ambient air temperature and cooling water temperature in India the consumption of coal is more which results into  increased emissions.(c) & (d) :        In order to ensure uninterrupted power supply position in the country, a phased implementation plan for installation of Flue Gas De-Sulphurization (FGD) for control of sulphur oxides (SOx), adoption of suitable technology for control of Particulate Matter (PM) and other parameters of emission control norms, had been prepared by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) in consultation with the stakeholders. Accordingly, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has issued directions under section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to thermal power plants to comply with emission norms in a phased manner.            Decision to shut down or retire a unit is taken by the concerned power utilities based on its techno economic reason, non-compliance to environmental norms or any other reasons. Those thermal power plants which are not able to comply with emission control norms, are shutdown/ retired as per phasing plan and time lines given by the CPCB.*********
