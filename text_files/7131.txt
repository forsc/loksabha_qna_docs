ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  The Government has taken a number of steps with regard to prevention of wastage and unscientific use of water in agriculture. Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare is implementing ‘Per Drop More Crop’ component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna (PMKSY) which mainly focuses on enhancing water use efficiency at farm level through precision/micro-irrigation (Drip and sprinkler irrigation). It also supports micro level water storage or water conservation/management activities to supplement micro irrigation.Recently, Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation under Ministry of Jal Shakti has conducted a workshop in coordination with Government of Punjab at Amritsar on 14.11.2019 on “Water Use Efficiency in Agriculture” with emphasis on choosing “Sahi Fasal” which uses less water for cropping.A study for National Water Use Efficiency Improvement Support Program for Major/ Medium Irrigation projects has been completed with the help of Asian Development Bank.Under Namami Gange programme, a flagship programme for rejuvenation of Ganga, initiatives are being taken for sustainable agriculture with a focus on improving water-use efficiency in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare and State Governments.For efficient distribution of available water, the use of Piped Distribution Network (PDN) is being promoted. Central Water Commission has prepared guidelines for proper planning, design and implementation of Piped Irrigation Network and the same were circulated to States for reference in July 2017.Contd…P/2//2//Central Water Commission is conducting Performance Evaluation Studies and Water Use Efficiency Studies of completed irrigation projects in India for optimum utilization of water resources. So far, 137 numbers of Performance Evaluation Studies and 35 numbers of Water Use Efficiency Studies of major and medium irrigation projects from various regions/states of the country have been successfully completed. In this regard, the guidelines for performance evaluation study and improving water use efficiency of irrigation projects have been published in the years 2002 and 2014 respectively and circulated to all the State Governments, concerned Central Ministries and other beneficiaries.The "General Guidelines for Water Audit & Water Conservation” was prepared by Central Water Commission and Central Ground Water Board in December, 2005 and circulated among all the State Governments. The objectives of these guidelines are to introduce, standardize and popularize the water audit system for conservation of water in all sectors of water use and improve the water use efficiency.  Department of Land Resources, Ministry of Rural Development has requested States to take necessary steps on water conservation and water harvesting with emphasis on micro-irrigation initiatives.(b) to (d) In order to ensure systematic approach in water management, “Indian Railway Water Policy” has been issued by Railway Board in 2017. Indian Railways have been establishing water recycle plants at main consumption centers wherever it is economically viable and installing rain water harvesting systems wherever it is feasible. Indian Railways is also conducting water audits at major water consumption centers. To check the wastage of water, inspections are carried out at regular intervals.  The Government has decided that the thermal power plants, including the existing plants, located within 50 km radius of sewage treatment plant of municipalities/local bodies/similar organizations shall, in the order of their closeness to the sewage treatment plant, mandatorily use treated sewage water produced by these bodies. The Government has approved adoption of hybrid annuity Public Private Partnership (PPP) model for the sewage treatment infrastructure under Namami Gange Programme wherein efforts are made to identify and develop a market for the treated water so as to reduce the demand on riverine fresh water. A sewage treatment plant project has been taken up at Mathura Refinery under Namami Gange programme with provision of recycling and reuse of treated waste water.National Water Mission has requested all Ministries/Departments of Government of India to take necessary steps to avoid water wastage and to install water saving aerators on water taps in the buildings under their administrative control.Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) encourages Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) for rain water harvesting and recycle/reuse of waste water. The cities are also encouraged to make water system more efficient by reducing unaccounted water (non-revenue water) to less than 20 percent, which is also a part of the reforms to be implemented by the States/ULBs under the Mission.The Ministry of Rural Development has issued an advisory to State Governments and Union Territories dealing with Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna - Gramin (PMAY-G) to encourage beneficiaries of PMAY-G to install roof-top rain water harvesting system in the houses constructed under Phase-II of PMAY-G.*****
