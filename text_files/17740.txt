                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):      National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) was established on 2nd October, 1958 with the mission to promote trade of agricultural and forest resources across the Country. The details of the NAFED branches and its sub offices are enclosed at Annexure – I.Contd…2/--2-(b) & (f):       No such study has been done by the Government on the performance of NAFED.  NAFED is a national level cooperative marketing organization registered under the Multi State Cooperative Society (MSCS) Act, 2002.  Like any other Multi State Societies, the ultimate authority of NAFED vests in the General Body of NAFED.  Further, Government does not have any equity in NAFED and the share capital of NAFED is fully subscribed by its member cooperative societies/organization. As far as NAFED is concerned, it is one of the Central Nodal agencies for procurement of oilseeds and pulses under PM-AASHA.(c): 	NAFED has earned net profit of Rs.671.77 Crore during the period 2017-18 to 2019-20. However  this profit earned  is not sufficient to wipe out carry forward losses incurred up to 2016-17. (d) & (e): 	the total quantum of pulses and oilseeds procured under the Price Support Scheme by NAFED during each of the last three years and the current year are at Annexure-II and Annexure-III respectively. The number of farmers benefitted in the State of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra are at Annexure-IV and Annexure-V respectively.
