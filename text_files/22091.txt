(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) is promoting farm mechanization mainly through Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM).Mechanization for crop residue management is promoted through the Central Sector Scheme ‘Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi’ (CRM). The other schemes of the Department such as Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), which give autonomy to states to choose interventions as per their choice and integrated programmes such as Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) and National Food Security Mission (NFSM) also have components supplementing farm mechanization.Contd.....2/-- 2 -(c):	During the years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20, the funds amounting to              Rs.1591.02 crores, Rs. 2502.69 crores and Rs. 2101.93crores, respectively have been allocated/released to the State Governments towards farm mechanization under SMAM, CRM and RKVY schemes together.(d):	Selection of farmers for assistance under the schemes are done by the State Governments as per the broad guidelines of these schemes which stipulate focusing the areas of low ratio of farm power availability, areas with large number of small and marginal holdings and areas having less productivity of food grains but have potential to enhance productivity. (e):	A statement giving details of state-wise number of farmers benefited under farm mechanization during the last three is enclosed as Annexure-I.(f):	The impact evaluation studies highlight overall positive impact of mechanisation on farming as it was reported that mechanisation helped in overall increase of 17.9% in productivity and 14.1% in seed germination.
