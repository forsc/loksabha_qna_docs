For equitable distribution, allotments have been made to the States/ UTs in accordance with the proportion of their reported case load in respect of the entire country.Supply arrangements have been monitored by the National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Authority (NPPA) so as to ensure expeditious availability of the drug.
