ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONIC & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) to (d) :   Yes,  Sir. The concept of Legislative Impact Assessment involves making an assessment or analysis, through an informed and transparent process, and with the participation and involvement of all stakeholders, of preparedness and availability of requisite administrative, financial and infrastructural support for successful implementation of intended legislation.Under the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961, each Ministry/ Department has been allocated subject matters on which that Ministry/Department initiates, processes and implements legislative proposals and also studies social, economic, environmental and judicial impact of such legislative proposals. Therefore, it is for the concerned Ministry/Department to set up any committee/ task force to study various aspects of Legislative Impact Assessment. (e) to (g):   	Pre-legislative Consultation Policy was formulated by the Committee of Secretaries under the Chairmanship of Cabinet Secretary in the meeting held on 10th January, 2014. In order to give effect to the decision of that Committee, Legislative Department has circulated the said Policy to all Ministries/Departments for strict adherence and compliance thereof. 		The Ministry/Department concerned with the subject matter initiates pre-legislative consultations, holds deliberations with the public and all stakeholders and on that basis, finalises its legislative policy. The Ministry/Department concerned with the subject matter carries out the post-legislative scrutiny of the legislation on the basis of inputs, suggestions and feedbacks received from the public, experts and other stakeholders; takes appropriate decision for modifications, if any.
