ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) FOR NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND POWER AND MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP (SHRI R. K. SINGH)(a) India has set a target of installing 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by the year 2022. A total of 80.46 GW of Renewable Energy capacity stood installed in the country as on 30th June, 2019 against the target of 175 GW renewable energy capacity by 2022. Further, renewable energy projects of 70.46 GW capacity are either at various stages of implementation or bidding. India is confident of achieving the set target by the year 2022.    (b) Renewable Energy projects are primarily being set up by the private sector with Central/State organizations buying power at a rate either discovered through transparent competitive bidding process or fixed by the concerned State Electricity Regulatory Commission. The state-wise details of renewable energy capacity added during last ten years i.e. 1st April, 2010 to 30th June 2019 are given in the Annexure.(c) & (d) Most of renewable energy projects in the country are being set up by the private sector developers selected through transparent bidding process. The Government has issued standard bidding guidelines to enable the distribution licensees to procure power at competitive rates in cost effective manner. Since renewable energy power plants are capital intensive, any power plant developer needs to mobilize capital for the same at the rate of Rs 4-6 crore per MW.  To protect the interest of small developers as per central government guidelines, States/UTs can procure power from solar projects (less than 5 MW capacity) and wind projects (less than 25 MW capacity) not covered under competitive bidding guidelines through Feed-in –Tariff (FiT) to be determined by the respective State Electricity Regulatory Commission.   *****
