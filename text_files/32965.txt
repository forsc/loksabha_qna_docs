ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) & (b) Yes Sir. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is constructing a flyover with provision of service road & drain on Left Hand Side (LHS) of carriageway of NH-27 parallel to an existing flyover (also with provision of service road & drain) on RHS carriageway. The width of drain is 1.5m with varying depth in 2.5 Km length on LHS and length of service road is 3.18 Km with varying width from 5.5m to 7.5m on LHS. All the construction activities are carried out as per IRC norms and standards of water logging free technique.(c) to (e) Authority is regularly maintaining the service road and drains through Contractor. But the drains get clogged regularly due to pouring of untreated garbage by local residents and water logging is caused during rainy season.	The end points of the drain on LHS side are near Faringola Railway Crossing towards Siliguri side and further connected near Kishanganj Bus Stand in existing master Drain towards Purnea side. The possibility of connecting existing drains with Ramjan River was explored but was not found feasible due to insufficient gradient. A detailed plan by local Municipality is required to drain out water.*****
