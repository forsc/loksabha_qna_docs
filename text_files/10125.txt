KISHAN REDDY)(a) and (b):   ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India.  The State Governments are competent to deal with offences under the extant provisions of the law. Data on disposal of cases relating to sexual offences published by National Crime Records Bureau in the Crime in India 2017 Report indicates that investigation had been completed in 71% of the cases during the said year.

In order to facilitate States/Union Territories, MHA has operationalized an online analytic tool for police called “Investigation Tracking System for Sexual Offences (ITSSO)” to monitor and track time-bound investigation in sexual assault cases. Advisories have been regularly issued to States/ Union Territories to use ITSSO to ensure compliance with the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2018.(c) & (d):	Published data in respect of trials completed from January to September this year is not available. However, Government has approved a scheme for setting up 1023 Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) across the country for expeditious disposal of pending cases of rape under the Indian Penal Code and crimes under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.**********
