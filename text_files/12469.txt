ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) 642 Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) and 1225 Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) havebeen established in the country so far. State/UT-wise details are annexed.(b) & (c): Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one Jawahar NavodayaVidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country. All the districts of the country (as on31.5.2014) including the districts of Jharkhand have been covered under the Scheme.Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) are opened primarily to cater to the educational needs ofthe wards of transferable Central Government employees including Defence personnel byproviding a common programme of education. Proposals for opening of new KVs areconsidered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India/StateGovernments / Union Territories Administrations thereby committing resources for setting upa new KV as well as the availability of necessary sanction of the Government. The proposalsreceived from various sponsoring authorities for opening of new KVs also have to competeamong other proposals under the “Challenge Method”.No proposal in the prescribed proforma has been received by KVS from the StateGovernment of Jharkhand for opening of a new KV at Ichagarh, Chowka in Ranchi. Since noKV was functional at Khilari earlier in the State of Jharkhand the question of its re-openingdoes not arise.*****
