ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a), (b) & (c): In view of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there are restrictions on international flight operations to/from India. However, under the Vande Bharat Mission, special repatriation flights are being operated by Air India group and private Indian carriers, along with chartered flights being operated by both Indian and foreign carriers. Moreover, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has established Air Transport Bubble arrangements with 10 countries (as of 13.09.2020). These are temporary arrangements between two countries aimed at restarting commercial passenger services when regular international flights are suspended as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Indian aviation and health infrastructure is currently trying its best to efficiently handle the large scale Vande Bharat Mission and Air Bubble operations. Limited quarantine and other related health facilities to be provided by the State Governments is a factor that has to be taken into account before regular commercial scheduled international operations are allowed.(d) & (e): Domestic flights were suspended to restrict the movement of persons to prevent the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Keeping with the unlocking measures, partial resumption of domestic services in a calibrated manner has been started from 25.05.2020. At present, domestic flights are permitted to operate at 60% capacity of the approved Summer Schedule 2020. As part of the unlocking measures, State Governments, based on their assessment of the local COVID pandemic situation, have issued guidelines which the airlines have been advised to adhere to.
