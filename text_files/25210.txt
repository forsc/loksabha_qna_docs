                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a)	 For filling up of vacancies in the Central Ministries/Departments, their Attached and Subordinate offices, Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT) have issued instructions vide their OM No. 43014/03/2019-Estt(B) dated 21.01.2020 requesting them to review the vacancies and to fill them in a time bound manner.(b)	Respective State Governments fill up their vacancies as per their own policies and rules. However, as per information received from Govt. of Andhra Pradesh, they have taken following steps in this direction :i)	Released Annual Calendar for Recruitment for the Year 2021-22 for around 10,143 posts through Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission, Andhra Pradesh State Level Police Recruitment Board, District Selection Committee, & other Recruiting agencies of the various Government Departments.ii)	Has established 15004 Village Secretariats/Ward Secretariats as administrative units for every 2000 / 4000 population.

Codification of the Labour Laws will inter alia, reduce multiplicity of definitions & authorities, facilitate implementation & use of technology in enforcement of labour laws, and bring transparency & accountability in enforcement which would promote setting up of more enterprises, thus catalysing the creation of employment opportunities in the country. It would promote setting up of industries by reducing rigidity of labour market and facilitate hassle free compliance, paving the way for realizing the goal of Atmanirbhar Bharat. It will also harmonize needs of workers and industry and will prove an important milestone for welfare of the workers.*****
