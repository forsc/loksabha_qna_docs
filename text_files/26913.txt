                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS (SHRI DEVUSINH CHAUHAN)(a)	BharatNet project (earlier known as National Optical Fibre Network)is being implemented in a phased manner to provide broadband connectivity to all Gram Panchayats (GPs) in the country. As on 09.07.2021, a total of 5,30,928 km Optical Fibre Cable (OFC) has been laid under this project in the country.(b)	The State/Union Territory (UT)-wise details of the Service Ready Gram Panchayats under BharatNet project in the country are given in Annexure-I. (c)	In the State of Jharkhand, the District-wise details of the GPs which are yet to be made Service Ready under BharatNet project, are given in Annexure-II.(d)	The State/UT-wise funds allocation is based on the requests received from the Implementing Agencies. As on 31.03.2021, an amount of about Rs. 24,201 crore has been allocated/utilized under BharatNet Project in the country. The scope of BharatNet has been recently extended upto all inhabited villages beyond GPs. On 30.06.2021, Union Cabinet accorded approval for a revised strategy for implementation of BharatNet through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model in 16 States of the country covering about 3.61 lakh villages including GPs. The total approved cost for BharatNet project is now Rs. 61,109 crore. This includes Rs. 42,068 Crore for BharatNet (Phase-I and Phase-II) and a maximum of Rs. 19,041 crore on Viability Gap Funding (VGF) for implementation of the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model of BharatNet in 16 States. Since the approval for extending Fibre connectivity to all inhabited villages in the country has been taken very recently, the estimated incremental cost for the same for all the States/ UTs has not been finalized.
