                                                        (a)       Yes, Sir.  Under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY). PMKVY has two training components, namely, Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). STT is linked to placement, while RPL recognizes the existing skills of candidate and does not mandate placement. In the State of Maharashtra under STT-PMKVY, during last two years, i.e., FY 2019-21, 1.06 lakh candidates have been certified; out of which, 0.33 lakh candidates have been placed in diverse sectors. (b)       In the State of Maharashtra, central component of PMKVY is being implemented by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and state component is being implemented by Maharashtra State Skill Development Society (MSSDS) through empanelled training centres.(c)     Ministry promotes the establishment of model and aspirational skill centres known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) in every district for imparting skill training throughout the country in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. The Ministry through National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) provides capital expenditure through a secured loan up to a maximum of Rs 70 lakh per PMKK. In the State of Maharashtra, as on 01.07.2021, 50 PMKKs have been allocated covering all the 36 districts. Out of these, 44 PMKKs have been established.(d)       Under State component of PMKVY, Rs. 234.49 Cr. (Rs. 214.44 Cr. under PMKVY 2.0 and Rs. 20.05 Cr. under PMKVY 3.0) have been allocated for the State of Maharashtra.
