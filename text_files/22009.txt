ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a)	As on date, there are 647 functional JawaharNavodayaVidyalayas (JNVs) and 1242KendriyaVidyalayas (KVs) in the country. JNVs and KVs are not opened Constituency-wise. State/UT wise details of JNVs and KVs are annexed.(b) & (c):	e-Granthalaya, a digital platform developed by National Informatics Centre provides a complete ICT solution with integrated library management software, a digital library module and cloud hosting environment. E-Granthalaya software has been installed in the libraries of all the KendriyaVidyalayas and 589NavodayaVidyalayas in the country. E-Granthalaya software is being used for issue and receipt of library books and maintenance of records of books in digital mode.	Upgradation and modernization of laboratories in the KendriyaVidyalayas and JNVs is a continuous process and the work is taken up in a phased manner as per requirement.(d) The NavodayaVidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one JawaharNavodayaVidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country. All the districts of the country (as on 31st May, 2014) including Nabarangpurin the State of Odisha(except the districts in the State of Tamil Nadu which has not yet accepted the Scheme) have been covered under the scheme.Opening of new JNVs is a continuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government/UT administration to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of the permanent building and making available required temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV depends on the availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority.	Opening of new KendriyaVidyalayas (KVs) is a continuous process. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations, committing resources, including land, temporary accommodation etc. as per prescribed norms of KendriyaVidyalayaSangathan (KVS) for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities for opening of new KVs complete in all respects have to compete with other proposals under the “Challenge Method”.*****
