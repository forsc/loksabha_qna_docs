ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)  (a)	 to (c):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 246   FOR ANSWER ON 11th MARCH, 2020 REGARDING “IMPACT OF CORONAVIRUS ON CHINESE SUPPLIES”.(a) to (c) : The Corona Virus outbreak in China has led to restrictions on movement of people and business activities in many provinces of China, in order to control the spread of virus.  The closure of factories in China may affect Indian industries, which import components, intermediaries and raw materials from China like the pharmaceutical, electronics and automobile industries. The Government has engaged with the Export Promotion Councils and Trade Bodies and worked with them on assessing and addressing potential disruptions in their supply chains, including by putting them in touch with our missions abroad to  secure and transport inventories available with the existing suppliers and find alternative sources of supply.  A Committee has been formed by the Department of Pharmaceuticals under the Chairmanship of Joint Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to regularly review the availability of stock of API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients)/KSMs (Key Starting Materials) and API based medicines, and to suggest and enable suitable and appropriate measures for their management.Indian Missions abroad have also been asked to explore the possibility of sourcing raw material for our production, in their respective countries. Several Missions have shared the list of potential buyers/suppliers in their countries with our Export Promotion Councils (EPCs) and agreed to facilitate B2B meetings for them.******
