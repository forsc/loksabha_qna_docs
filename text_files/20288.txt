As far as provision of services is concerned, Indian Railways constantly strives to provide better services to its vast set of customers through proper planning and system improvements on a continuous and an ongoing basis depending upon customer feedback, operational feasibility and financial viability.

Thereafter, normal trains were introduced in a phased manner to transport passengers duly following COVID protocol. Based on the demand pattern, clone trains have also been introduced to meet the unmet demand.Simultaneously, various system improvements for freight services like computerization of Parcel service through Parcel Management System, Electronic Registration of demand (e-RD), paperless Electronic Transmission of Railway Receipt (eT-RR) and digital payments through Debit/Credit card using POS machine along with other online facilities have been implemented to ensure supply of essential items during the COVID-19 lockdown. Parcel special trains, including time-tabled trains, were introduced connecting all parts of the country. The operations of freight trains were also maintained unhindered during the lockdown to maintain essential supplies to the public all over the country. With a view to make Railway journey memorable, “Vistadome coaches”, equipped with roof top glasses and seats, which can rotate upto, 180 degrees, have been introduced.Moreover, changes/system improvement for provision of better services in the Railways is a continuous and ongoing process.(c) to (e):	No, Sir.
