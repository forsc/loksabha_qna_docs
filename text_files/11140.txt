ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d)	Under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) in the country including State of Rajasthan. This Scheme enables the youth for taking Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) through accredited and affiliated training centres (TCs) throughout the country. As on 17.01.2020, 1,368 TCs are empanelled under STT of the scheme. As on 17.01.2020, 6.43 lakh candidates have been trained / oriented in the State of Rajasthan. PMKVY 2016-20 has two components known as Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed (CSCM) being implemented by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and Centrally Sponsored State Managed (CSSM) being implemented by State Skill Development Missions of the States/ UTs popularly known as State- Engagement Component of PMKVY (2016-20). Under CSCM component of PMKVY 2016-20, there is no provision of State-wise funds allocation. However, under CSSM component of PMKVY 2016-20, funds and corresponding physical targets of PMKVY 2016-20 have been allocated to the States/UTs for the implementation of the scheme through State Skill Development Missions. Under this component, after evaluation of proposal received from Rajasthan Skill and Livelihoods Development Corporation (RSLDC), Government of Rajasthan, Ministry has given in-principle approval of a total target of 64,526 candidates and corresponding financial allocation of Rs. 94.62 Cr. for FY 2016-20; out of which, Rs. 14.19 Cr. has been disbursed to State of Rajasthan during FY 2016-17. However, due to slow performance and keeping in the mind that the scheme is going to end by March’2020, the financial allocation was rationalized to Rs. 70.96 crore.Additionally, the Ministry promotes establishment of model and aspirational skill centres known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) in every district for imparting skill training in every district throughout the country. At present, skill training at PMKKs is being imparted under MSDE’s flagship scheme PMKVY (2016-20). The Ministry through NSDC provides capital expenditure upto 75% of the project investment as well as operational support to each PMKK. As on 17.01.2020, 35 PMKKs have been allocated in Rajasthan. Out of allocated PMKKs, 34 PMKKs have been established. Funds amounting to Rs. 12.03 crores have been disbursed towards the establishment of PMKKs in Rajasthan.
