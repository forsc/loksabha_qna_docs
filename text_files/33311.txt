Upon examination, the process of Inter-Ministerial consultation (IMC) is undertaken, following the IMC process a note is submitted to the Cabinet for its approval. Once the Cabinet approves the proposal, the Hon’ble Minister of Tribal Affairs shall endorse the recommendation for obtaining the assent of the Hon’ble President of India.  After President''s assent, a Constitution Order is issued through a gazette notification.
