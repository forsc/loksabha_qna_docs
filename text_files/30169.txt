                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) : Details of the passengers carried as reported by the Scheduled Indian Air Carriers to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) are attached as Annexure. (b): Kannur International Airport was commissioned in December 2018. Within a period of one year, by Winter 2019 schedule, Indian carriers were operating 65 international services per week from Kannur, before scheduled international commercial passenger services were suspended on account of COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, due to significant imbalance in the number of points of call in favour of foreign carriers, the Government of India is not granting any non-metro airport in the country as a new point of call to any foreign carrier for the purpose of operating passenger services.(c) & (d):  Kannur International Airport is licensed under aerodrome reference  code ''4E''  i.e. DGCA has approved wide body operations from Kannur airport. Indian designated carriers are free to mount scheduled operations with wide body aircraft to/from any international airport including Kannur International Airport to foreign destinations  under the ambit of bilateral Air Service Agreements concluded by India with foreign countries. Moreover, as per approved Winter Schedule - 2021, Air India , Go First and Indigo have filed schedule to operate scheduled flights on domestic sectors to/from Kannur airport.
