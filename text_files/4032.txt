                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) to (c):	Yes Sir. In order to facilitate farmers with remunerative prices for their produce through online competitive bidding system in transparent manner, the Government is implementing National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) Scheme. Contd…2/--2-Three reforms are mandatory for States/Union Territories (UTs) in their respective State Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Acts for integrating their mandis with e-NAM platform i.e. (i) Provision for e-trading, (ii) Single point levy of market fee, (iii) Unified Single trading license for the State. States without APMC Act need to provide legally enforceable guidelines and institutional mechanism for implementing e-NAM. Based on the proposals received from the compliant States/Union Territories (UTs), mandis are considered for integration by Government of India with e-NAM platform. Government of India provides assistance to the States, such as free access to e-NAM platform, financial assistance for computer hardware, electronic weighing scale, assaying equipments and networking. In addition, a Mandi Analyst for each e-NAM mandi is provided for a year for handholding and training to stakeholders in the mandis being integrated. Total 585 wholesale regulated markets of 16 States and 02 UTs have been integrated with e-NAM platform till now which were commissioned by 31st March, 2018. State-wise list of wholesale regulated markets integrated with e-NAM platform is annexed. Now consolidation work in these 585 e-NAM mandis were being carried out, for which now inter-State trade has started on e-NAM platform. Government of India has further approved the integration of additional 415 wholesale regulated markets with e-NAM platform.(d):	 Already trading parameters for 150 agricultural and horticultural commodities such as cereals, pulses, oilseeds, fruits & vegetables, spices, flowers and fiber crops have been provided. Presently, trading in 116 commodities has been carried out on e-NAM platform.   No specific study has been done to find out change in remuneration paid to farmers due to their shift to e-NAM. However, States have informed that farmers are getting remunerative prices for their produce because of assaying, transparency and competitive bidding in auction process and e-payments to farmers on e-NAM platform. (e):	There is no proposal to make trading on e-NAM platform mandatory for all the farmers. Farmers are free to register on e-NAM Portal and sell their produce. The online and transparent bidding system is encouraging farmers to join increasingly on e-NAM platform. So far, more than 1.64 crore farmers have registered on e-NAM platform. (f):	To modernise the existing mandis, the Government is providing additional assistance under e-NAM Scheme for infrastructure for assaying, cleaning, grading, sorting and packaging facilities in the e-NAM mandis. Market information of agricultural commodities is also provided to farmers on e-NAM Portal. In addition, the Government is promoting market information system of agricultural commodities through Agricultural Marketing Information Network (AGMARKNET) Portal. Further, various schemes of Government of India such as Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana-Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied Sector Rejuvenation (RKVY-RAFTAAR), Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) scheme as well as Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture and Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA Yojana (Scheme for Agro-Marine Processing and Development of Agro-Processing Clusters) aim at promoting modern infrastructure including that of post-harvest and marketing infrastructure for agriculture marketing  in the country including that in  rural areas and rural haats . In addition, basic infrastructure in existing rural haats can be developed by states through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).
