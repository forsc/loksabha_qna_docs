ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (c) :	As reported by the States, all the inhabited census villages across the country stand electrified on 28.04.2018.		According to Rural Electrification Policy 2006, a village is reported as electrified, if:i)	basic infrastructure such as Distribution Transformer and Distribution Lines are provided in the inhabited locality as well as the locality inhabited by weaker sections of the society/hamlet where it exists,ii)	electricity is provided to public places like Schools, Panchayat Office, Health Centres, Dispensaries, Community Centres etc., andiii)	the number of households electrified should be at least 10% of the total number of households in the village. However, definition of village electrification has lost its significance since the launch of Saubhagya scheme in October, 2017 which provides for last mile connectivity and electricity connections to all un-electrified households in rural and all poor households in urban areas across the country.  All States reported electrification of all households as on 31.03.2019, except few in LWE affected Bastar region of Chhattisgarh.(d) :			There is no upfront allocation made to any State under Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY). Funds are released against sanctioned projects in installments based on the reported utilization of the previous installment(s)and fulfillment of stipulated conditionalities.  Government of India disbursed Rs.36,737 crore, as grant, under DDUGJY during the last three years and current year i.e. 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 & 2019-20 (up to 31.01.2020)  for various works related to rural electrification.************
