ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b) Climate Vulnerability Index is calculated and published by various organizations based on different sets of parameters with corresponding variable results. One such report titled ‘Mapping India’s Climate Vulnerability-A District level Assessment’ was published in October 2021 by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), a non-governmental organization. It covers floods, droughts, cyclones and their compounding impacts. The Department of Science and Technology in collaboration with Swiss Agency of Development and Cooperation, and research teams from the Indian Institute of Technology Mandi, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati and Indian Institute of Science Bengaluru, have studied the nation-wide vulnerability assessment and have released a report titled ‘Climate Vulnerability Assessment for Adaptation Planning in India Using a Common Framework’. Based on an all-India assessment, it identifies the most vulnerable States and districts in India with respect to the current climate and the main drivers of vulnerability based on a set of common indicators (biophysical, socio-economic, and livelihood-based indicators) and common methodology.  The States with a relatively high vulnerability, Jharkhand, Mizoram, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh, and West Bengal are mostly in the eastern part of the country. Assam, Bihar, and Jharkhand have over 60% districts in the category of districts which are highly vulnerable. (c)	No, Sir. The extant legal and promotional measures adequately cater to the concerns of climate change. Further, the relief, recovery, and rehabilitation related to disasters in India are governed inter alia by the relevant provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and the guidelines, directives, and orders of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the State Disaster Management Authorities. Furthermore, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) is responsible for monitoring, detection and forecasting of weather and climate including early warning for severe weather events such as cyclones, heavy rainfall, extreme temperature, thunderstorms, etc.(d)	Does not arise.(e)	Based on the inputs received from NDMA, contrary to the statement made in the aforesaid CEEW report, 673 districts of the country have prepared District Disaster Management Plans (DDMP). NDMA has issued guidelines for the preparation of DDMP. In addition, the National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) prepared by NDMA in 2019 and the respective State Disaster Management Plans (SDMP) provide the overall framework and guidance for the preparation of DDMP.Further, the Government is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) through National Missions that address climate change mitigation and adaptation across a range of sectors. Thirty-three States /Union Territories have prepared their State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCC) in line with the NAPCC considering the State specific issues relating to climate change. *****
