                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a)Government of India has approved a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, namely, “New India Literacy Programme (NILP)” with the aim to support the States and Union Territories in promoting literacy among non-literates across the country covering 5 crore adult non-literates during the implementation period from 2022-23 to 2026-27. The objective of the scheme is to impart Foundational Literacy and Numeracy; Critical Life Skills like Financial Literacy, Legal Literacy, Digital Literacy, Disaster Management, Commercial Skills, Child Care and Education, Health and Family Welfare issues on awareness on dietary habits, exercise, yoga, cessation of tobacco use, first aid care and management of road traffic accident, etc; Vocational Skills Development with a view towards obtaining local employment; Basic Education including preparatory, middle, and secondary stage equivalency and Continuing Education including engaging holistic adult education courses in arts, sciences, technology, culture, sports and recreation as well as other topics of interest or use to local learners, such as more advanced material on critical life skills.(b)The scheme would be dependent upon Information and Communications Technology (ICT) to a great extent and to be implemented through volunteerism in all States/ UTs across the country. Trainings, orientations, workshops of volunteers would be organized through face-to-face mode. All material and resources shall be provided digitally for easy access to registered volunteers through easily accessible digital modes, viz. TV, radio, cell phone-based free/open-source Apps/portals, etc.  (c)The literacy data in the country is collected through decennial census operation conducted by Registrar General of India. The last Census was held in 2011. A statement indicating the state-wise details of illiterate people in the age group of 15 years and above in rural and urban areas across the country as per Census 2011 is at Annexure. (d) to (f) The NILP scheme would target 5.00 crore adult non-literates in five years, i.e. 2022-27 @ 1.00 crore learners per annum under Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN) to be imparted alongwith Critical Life Skills. Under Basic Education Component, 1.00 lakh neo-literates would be targeted to enhance their literacy level and provide them equivalency during the period of the scheme. Flexibility for states/UTs would be provided to undertake innovative activities like literacy drives/projects in Cities/Town/Blocks/ and villages, slums, minority pockets, tribal and forest areas, prisons, etc.(g) A total financial outlay for New India Literacy Programme (NILP) for five years’ period (FYs 2022-23 to 2026-27) is Rs.1037.90 crore inclusive of Rs.700 crore as Central share and Rs.337.90 crore as State share. The Central and State shares are proposed to be in the ratio of 60:40 for all States other than NER and Himalayan States where the sharing pattern between the Centre and the State is proposed to be in the ratio of 90:10. For UTs with legislature the ratio would be 60:40, except in the UT of Jammu & Kashmir where the ratio would be 90:10, and for all other UTs without legislature the Central share would be 100%.***
