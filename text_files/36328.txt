ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) :		Ministry of Power has requested all the Ministries in Government of India and the State Governments to join the initiative on transformative electric mobility and advise their respective Departments to shift their fleet of official vehicles from present Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) based Vehicles to Electric Vehicles.(b) :		The total number of vehicles in use by the Government/Government agencies and the number of electrical vehicles out of the said vehicles as on 04.02.2022 is mentioned in Annexure.(c) : 		Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) through its wholly owned subsidiary CESL (Convergence Energy Services Limited), undertook consultations with State Transport Utilities (STUs), State Governments, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), NITI Aayog etc. to aggregate demand of 5,450 buses for deployment on Operating expenses (OPEX) basis across 9 major cities in India (having population over 4 million). CESL floated a unified tender on 20th January 2022 towards aggregation of e-buses. In respect of Electric 3 Wheelers (E3W), CESL has floated a tender to aggregate demand for one lakh E3W as per the modified Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles (FAME) Phase-II scheme. The aggregation of E3W has resulted into price reduction upto 22% in comparison to the retail segment. (d) & (e) : 	EESL through CESL has received an aggregated demand of 930 numbers of electric  4 Wheelers (e4Ws) from various Government departments at Central and State level. Further, 25,000 electric two wheelers have been aggregated for Government employees of Andhra Pradesh. Also, CESL has aggregated a demand of 82,000 electric three wheelers of various categories.  EESL has decided that it would do aggregation of demand only and would not get into financing the EVs in any capacity. (f) to (h) :	Ministry of Heavy Industries is administering phase-II of Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles to promote adoption of electric/ hybrid vehicles in India for a period of 5 years w.e.f. 01st April, 2019 with a total budgetary support of Rs.10,000 crore. This phase focusses on supporting electrification of public & shared transportation and aims to support, through subsidies, 7090 e-Buses, 5 lakh e-3 Wheelers, 55000 e-4 Wheeler Passenger Cars and 10 lakh e-2 Wheelers. Further, the following amendments  have been made in the FAME India Scheme to promote ecosystem of electric vehicles:i.	Aggregation will be the key method for bringing the upfront cost of 3W EV at an affordable level and at par with ICE 3 Wheelers. ii.	For Electric Buses, 4 million plus cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Surat and Pune) are focus areas. iii.	For Electric 2 Wheelers, demand Incentive will be @ Rs.15000/- per KWh.iv.	The cap on incentives for Electric 2 Wheelers will be 40% of the cost of vehicles. After re-modelling of the scheme weekly sale of e-2W have increased over @ 9000 in the month of March 22 from sale of e2W @ 2000 per month earlier.***********
