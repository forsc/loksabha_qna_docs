ANSWER




                                                         (a) & (b)  No, Sir. There is no proposal to develop Buckingham canal between Kakinada-Puducherry as river transport system and to extend it up to Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. (c) 	To develop navigation on the Vijayawada–Muktyala stretch of river Krishna which is part of National Waterway-4 in Andhra Pradesh, works have commenced at a cost of Rs.96 crore.  The interventions in this stretch include four floating terminals at Durga Ghat, Bhavani Island, Amravati and Vedadri and four permanent terminals at Ibrahimpatnam, Harischandrapuram, Muktyala and Madipadu.   (d)  	At present Inland Water Transport (IWT) Sector has a modal share of about 1.0% in the total transportation sector of India and various initiatives have been taken to increase the modal share of IWT e.g. Jal Marg Vikas Project on NW-1 and development of navigation facilities on technically viable new National Waterways.                                      *****
