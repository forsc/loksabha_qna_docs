                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE; MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MINISTER OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????; ??????? ?? ???????????? ??????; ?? ?????? ??????? ????????. ???? ?????(a)	The number of posts of scientists lying vacant in laboratories / institutes under Ministry of Science and Technology are given  at ANNEXURE-I. (b)	As and when a vacancy arises, the concerned laboratory / institute initiates  necessary steps to fill-up the vacant post of scientist in accordance with the extant  rules.(c)	The ‘Women Scientist Scheme’ of the Department of Science and Technology (DST) provides career opportunities including  fellowship to unemployed women scientists and technologists, especially those who had a break in career, for pursuing research in frontier areas of Science and Engineering. The scheme provides for conducting research in Basic & Applied Sciences;  S&T interventions for Societal Benefits; and enabling women to become Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) professionals.  In last five years, more than 1800 women scientists and technologists have been supported under Women Scientists Scheme. During 2017-18, DST launched a  new program  viz. ‘Indo-US Fellowship for Women in STEMM’ (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics & Medicine) to provide opportunities to Indian Women Scientists, Engineers and Technologists to undertake International collaborative research in premier institutions in USA for a duration of 3-6 months and 20 women scientists have availed this fellowship so far.Department of Biotechnology (DBT) is implementing a program known as Career Advancement and Re-orientation Programme (BioCARe) for women scientists aiming to enhance participation of Women Scientists in Biotechnology Research.The program was launched in January, 2011. 315 women scientists (165 unemployed and 150 employed) have been supported so far under this programme.Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)  under its "Capacity Building and S&T Human Resource Development: Doctoral and Postdoctoral Fellowship schemes",  provides age relaxation of 5 years to women candidates.  Of the total research fellows supported by CSIR, the representation of female research fellows has increased from earlier 36% to 42% at present.(d) & (e):  No Sir, No such similar scheme as practiced in the United States of America and European countries is under consideration. However, DST through its scheme ‘Scholarship for Higher Education’  (SHE)  under  Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE) Programme  has provided opportunities to the talented science students of various colleges, universities and institutes of higher learning to do Summer Research internship. Since  2014 , at least 8418 INSPIRE scholars  have undertaken  summer research internship at various Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs),  Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs), National laboratories, Central and State universities. CSIR also has a student-scientist connect programme, initiated in 2017 called Jigyasa. It is a non-fellowship programme. The focus of the programme is on connecting school students and scientists at CSIR laboratories so as to extend student’s classroom learning with that of a very well planned research laboratory based learning.DBT has a program known as Star College Scheme to support colleges and universities offering undergraduate education to improve science teaching across the country and ''hands on'' experimental work at undergraduate (college) level in sciences. Apart from financial support, colleges have benefited tremendously from guidance received in Advisory Committee Meetings, mentoring, Task Force Meetings and learning from peers in other colleges.                                                  ********
