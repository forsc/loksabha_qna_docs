ANSWER




                                                             MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.  STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.3515 BY SHRI UTTAM KUMAR REDDY NALAMADA TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 17.03.2021 REGARDING RAILWAY LINE BETWEEN DORNAKAL AND MIRYALAGUDA(a) Field survey for Dornakal to Miryalguda (114 km) new line was completed in 2017. Proposed alignment was not passing through Mudigonda, Nelakondapalli, Kodad, Huzurnagar and Neraducherla. However, alignment for survey has been changed in view of operational and commercial requirements and new proposed alignment is passing through Nelakondapalli, Kodad, Huzurnagar and Neraducherla. Survey has been taken up on the new alignment.During  2014-19, 377 Km project length (258 Km New Line and 119 Km Doubling) falling fully/partly in Andhra Pradesh have been commissioned, which is 4% more than total commissioning during 2009-14 (363 km). In 2019-20, 207 km project length (60 km New Line and 147 km Doubling) falling fully/partly in Andhra Pradesh have been commissioned, which is 185% more than average commissioning during 2009-14(72.6 km/year).Average annual budget allocation for infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/partly in the State of Andhra Pradesh, during 2014-19 has increased to ?2830 crore  per year from ?886 crore per year during 2009-14. Thus, an increase of 219% over the average annual budget allocation of 2009-14. Budget allotment for these projects  for financial year 2019-20 was ?3885 crore, which is 338% more w.r.t. average annual budget outlay during 2009-14 (?886 crore/year). Budget allocation of ?4910 crore has been provided for  Financial Year 2020-21,which is 454% more with respect to average Budget outlay for 2009-14. Budget  allocation (Proposed) has further increased to ?5812 crore in financial year 2021-22 which is, 556% more w.r.t. average of annual budget outlay during 2009-14.Execution of 4 New Line Projects of total length 841 km costing ?10,200 crore are held up due to non acquisition of land and non deposition of State share of ?1636 crore by State Government of Andhra Pradesh. Also two doubling projects namely Vijayawada-Gudivada-Bhimavaram-Narasapur, Gudivada-Machlipatnam and Bhimavaram-Nidadavolu (length 221 km costing ?3753 crore) and Yelahanka-Penukonda (length 48.53 km costing ?357 crore) are suffering due to non-deposition of ?976 crore State share in these projects by Government of Andhra Pradesh. Total amount of ?2612 crore is outstanding from State Government of Andhra Pradesh towards their share in these projects. The non-payment of state share is causing delay in execution of cost sharing projects in Andhra Pradesh.(b) and (c) Do not arise as work is not sanctioned.*****
