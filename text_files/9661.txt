                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (d) The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released in 2014 has assessed the increase in annual anthropogenic Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions between 2000 and 2010. According to this report, in 2010, 35% of GHG emissions were released by the energy sector, 24% (net emissions) from agriculture, forestry and other land use, 21% by industry, 14% by transport and 6.4% by the building sector.  As per India’s second Biennial Update Report submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in December 2018, emissions from energy sector was 73% of India’s total national GHG emissions (excluding Land Use, Land-use Change and Forestry) in 2014, and emissions from transport sector were about 13% of the total GHG emissions from energy sector in 2014. (e)& (f) The subject of “Land” and its management falls within the legislative and administrative jurisdiction of the States.  However, as part of its climate action agenda, Government of India is committed towards combating climate change through its several programs and schemes.   In line with National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), 33 States/ Union Territories have prepared their State Action Plans on Climate Change, which outline sector specific and cross sectoral priority actions to combat climate change.The Central Government has set up Compensatory Afforesatation Management and Planning Authority  (CAMPA) at both Central and State level, to promote afforestation and regeneration activities as a way of compensating for forest land diverted for non-forest uses.National Mission for Green India is one of the eight missions launched under NAPCC to improve quality of forest and to increase in forest cover, besides cross-sectoral activities on landscapes basis. Nagar Van Udyan Yojana envisions development of 200 city forests in the country. Further, during 14th Session of Conference of Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification held at New Delhi in September 2019, India has announced to raise its ambition to restore 26 million hectare degraded land by 2030. The Government is also implementing National Afforestation Programme for afforestation of degraded forest lands.****
