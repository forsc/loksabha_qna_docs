ANSWER




(a) to (e):  To create an enabling ecosystem through entrepreneurship education, training, advocacy and easy access to entrepreneurship network, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing a pilot scheme, Pradhan Mantri YUVA (PM YUVA) Yojana. The scheme covers 81 districts across 10 States and 2 Union Territories (viz. i.e. Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Kerala, Delhi and Puducherry).  The scheme is under implementation through the regional partner, Association of Lady Entrepreneur of India (ALEAP) in the 8 districts of Telangana namely, Hyderabad, Mahbubnagar, Medak, Medchal, RangaReddy, SangaReddy, Warangal and Yadadri. Further, MSDE in collaboration with GIZ, Germany has launched a pilot project, ‘Economic Empowerment of Women Entrepreneurs and Start-ups by Women’ to support aspiring and existing women entrepreneurs in India. Presently, this pilot project is being implemented in the North Eastern Region (Assam, Meghalaya and Manipur), Rajasthan and Telangana where 147 women have been given incubation and acceleration support as part of its first cohorts including 29 women from Telangana. 		Besides, to enable and mobilize Indian youth to take up skill training and become employable for sustainable livelihood, the scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (2016-2020) has been launched by MSDE on 2nd October, 2016, which has the provision for free of cost Skill Development Training and Skill Certification in more than 350 Job roles. A total of 58,27,108 candidates have been certified through 3,077 Training Centres running across the Country under the scheme including 1,86,918 candidates from Telangana State provided skill training through 83 Training Centres. 		Under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana by Technical Institutes (PMKVY-TI) AICTE has been entrusted through Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) to train the unemployed youth as per the NSQF approved courses in select sectors. Under this scheme, AICTE approved Institutes have to utilize their existing infrastructure and faculties for offering these courses in the off-college hours so that the students shall acquire adequate skill for certificate under the National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) and find placement in suitable private sector jobs. Under this initiative, grant in aid as per the guidelines issued by MHRD is released to institutes. Programme-wise/ Level-wise details of Institute count and sanctioned intake for the state of Telangana for 2019-20 are given in the Annexure.
