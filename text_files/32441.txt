                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b) The Government approved PMGSY-III in July, 2019 for consolidation of 1,25,000 km Through Routes and Major Rural Links connecting habitations, inter-alia, to Gramin Agricultural Markets, Higher Secondary Schools and Hospitals. The state of Bihar has been allocated a target road length of 6,162.50 km under PMGSY-III, out of which, 1,390.31 km road length with value of projects of Rs. 1,197.28 crore has been sanctioned till 15.12.2021. Funds are released to the States for implementation of PMGSY keeping in mind the works in hand, execution capacity of the State and unspent balance of previous year(s) available with the State. Bihar has an unspent balance of Rs. 862.28 crores as on 15.12.21 of previous releases. Thus, there is no dearth of funds for implementing PMGSY in Bihar.(c) & (d) As per the programme guidelines, the timeline for completion of road work is 12 working months from the date of issue of the work order. However, where a package comprises more than one roadwork, the total time given for completion of the package is 18 calendar months. Similarly, a time period of 21-24 months has been allowed for completion of bridge works exceeding 25-meter in length, depending on site conditions. The timeline for completion of PMGSY-III is March 2025. The responsibility of construction and maintenance of PMGSY works lies with the state government. Further, the progress of implementation of PMGSY is regularly reviewed by way of Regional Review Meetings (RRMs), Performance Review Committee (PRC) Meetings & Pre-Empowered/ Empowered Committee Meetings with the States. The Minister (RD) reviews the programme at regular intervals encompassing planning, progress of implementation, quality, maintenance, funds availability etc.  In addition to this, special review meetings/ monthly review meetings are also held by Secretary/ Additional Secretary/Joint Secretary, Ministry of Rural Development with Chief Secretaries/Additional Chief Secretaries/Principal Secretaries/ Chief Executive Officer-SRRDAs of the States.  *****
