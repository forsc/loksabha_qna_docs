ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF MINES, COAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a) & (b) District Mineral Foundation has been constituted in 24 districts of Jharkhand. Information is given in annexure-I and annexure-II.(c) Ministry of Mines circulated guidelines for Pradhan Mantri Khanij Kshetra Kalya Yojna (PMKKKY) on 16.09.2015 to be implemented by the DMFs in order to implement various development and welfare projects/programs only in mining affected areas, and to ensure long-term sustainable livelihoods for the affected people in mining areas. There are no such provisions in the MMDR Act to divert funds allocated in DMF for purposes other than welfare of people in mining districts.(d) Section 9B introduced through the MMDR Amendment Act, 2015, prescribes that the composition and functions of the District Mineral Foundation shall be such as may be prescribed by the State Government. Such information is not maintained centrally.(e) Ministry of Mines vide communication dated 28.03.2020 and subsequent amendments dated 11.6.2020 as part of Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojna (PMGKY) issued one time relaxation to State Govt. for using 30% of District Mineral Foundation funds available in districts for implementation of the projects under Pradhan Mantri Khanij Kshetra Kalyan Yojna (PMKKKY) for medical interventions required for testing and treating the patients affected by COVID-19 pandemic. This was also done for welfare of people in mining districts in this COVID-19 pandemic situation. In whole country, total Rs.364.84 cr. is utilized as on 15.9.2020 for COVID-19. Govt. of Jharkhand has utilized only Rs. 9.66 cr. for the said purpose. *****
