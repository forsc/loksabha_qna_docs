                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) to (c) 4-laning work from Viluppuram to Nagapattinam via Puducherry, Cuddalore and Nagapattinam has been envisaged under Bharatmala Pariyojana. The whole stretch has been divided into four packages and the work of package-II from Puducherry to Cuddalore stretch including bypasses at Puducherry and Cuddalore, was awarded and agreement signed in May, 2018. Due to delay in handing over of land, the agreement was terminated on 15.05.2019. Fresh bids have been invited on 16.12.2019 with due date of submission of bids as 24.02.2020. In the meantime, due to some PIL’s, Hon’ble High Court of Madras has ordered to hold the project and has directed to obtain MoEF clearance for entire four packages of NH-45A including Package-II. Necessary action has been initiated for appealing in Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against the order of Hon’ble High Court of Madras.*****
