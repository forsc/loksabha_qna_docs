                                                    (a) whether the Government proposes to engage foreign companies and foreign investment in coal mining;(b) if so, whether the Government has taken any action in this regard;(c) if so, the details thereof and if not, the reasons therefor; and(d) whether the Government has taken steps to protect the home players in the industry and if so, the details thereof?






ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a) to (d): Government has reviewed the Foreign Direct Investment (FDl) policy in the coal mining on 18.09.2019 allowing 100% FDI under automatic route for sale of coal, coal mining activities including associated processing infrastructure subject to the provisions of Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 [CMSP Act] and the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 [MMDR Act] as amended from time to time and other relevant Acts on the subject. Associated Processing Infrastructure includes coal washery, coal handling and separation (magnetic and non-magnetic). For sale of coal, allowing 100% FDI for coal mining activities including associated processing infrastructure is expected to attract international players and create efficient and competitive coal market. FDI in Indian coal market will complement efforts of home players in meeting the energy needs of the nation. The nation will be enriched with the infusion of new technology and global best practices, which would also be beneficial for home players in the industry.    *****
