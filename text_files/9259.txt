SINGH)(a) Yes Sir, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in a workshop held in Delhi on 27 June 2014 on the subject “Sustainable Mini-Grid for Energy Access” had advocated for micro grids based on renewable energy which will allow decentralized generation of power for cluster of villages and fill the energy gap in rural India.(b) & (c) Under Solar Off-grid and Decentralized Applications Programme  (Phase I & II)  the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) provided financial support up to 30% of the cost of microgrid system installation in rural areas of the country. So far solar micro grids of 2299.2 kWp aggregated capacity have been installed in 73 villages of the country with financial support from MNRE.  However, this scheme has come to closure with the end of  12th Five  Year Plan and there is no new proposal under consideration of MNRE.*****
