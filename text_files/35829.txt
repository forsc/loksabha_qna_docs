                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) & (b): Ministry of Food Processing Industries has been implementing Mega Food Park Scheme (MFPS), a component scheme under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY), to create modern infrastructure for the food processing sector along the value chain from farm to market. PMKSY is a central sector scheme and there is no state wise allocation of fund. Ministry does not set up Mega Food Parks on its own.The scheme is demand driven and proposals are invited through Expression of Interest. Under the scheme, Ministry had approved one Mega Food Park project at Tirunelveli District of Tamil Nadu. The status of the Park including Grant in Aid approved and released are at Annexure I.  This scheme has been discontinued by the Government with effect from 01.04.2021 with provision for committed liabilities for ongoing projects and there is no proposal under process for approval of Mega Food Park in the state of Tamil Nadu.     Ministry is also implementing the Scheme for Creation of Infrastructure for Agro Processing Clusters (APC) (similar to mini food park) which is also a component scheme under PMKSY for development of modern infrastructure to encourage entrepreneurs to set up food processing units based on cluster approach. Also,this scheme is demand driven and proposals are invited through Expression of Interest (EOI) and interested entrepreneurs may participate in the EOIs invited by theMinistry. So far Ministry has approved 11 APC in the state of Tamil Nadu. The details of these APCs including Grant in Aid approved and released are at Annexure II.*****
