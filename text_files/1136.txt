In order to supplement the efforts of the State Government, the steps taken by the Government of India for conservation of water are as under:•	Hon’ble Prime Minister has written a letter to all Sarpanchs regarding the importance of water conservation and harvesting and exhorted them to adopt all appropriate measures to make water conservation a mass movement.•	The National Water Policy (2012) formulated by Ministry of Water Resources advocates conservation, promotion and protection of water and highlights the need for augmenting the availability of water through rain water harvesting, direct use of rainfall and other management measures. The Policy has been forwarded to all States/UTs concerned Ministries/Departments of Central Government for adoption.•	In compliance to the decision taken by the Committee of Secretaries, an ‘Inter-Ministerial Committee’ under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Department of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, Minisrty of Jal Shakti has been constituted to take forward the subject of ‘Push on Water Conservation Related Activities for Optimum Utilization of Monsoon Rainfall’.Contd…P/2//2//•	The Ministry has circulated a Model Bill to all the States/UTs to enable them to enact suitable ground water legislation for regulation of its development, which includes provision of rain water harvesting. So far, 15 States/UTs have adopted and implemented the ground water legislation on the lines of Model Bill.•	Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has been constituted under Section 3 (3) of the “Environment (Protection) Act, 1986” for the purpose of regulation and control of ground water development and management in the Country. CGWA has issued directives to the Chief Secretaries of all States as well as Administrators of all UTs to take measures to promote/adopt artificial recharge to ground water / rain water harvesting. •	Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) regularly undertakes training programs and Information, Education and Communication  (IEC) activities for capacity building and awareness creation of stakeholders on the importance of water conservation and rainwater harvesting in augmenting the ground water resources. •	Best practices of water conservation by various entities including private persons, NGOs, PSUs etc have been compiled and put on the web site of the Ministry for the benefit of general public. •	Implementation of National Water Mission (NWM) is one of the steps being taken to promote water conservation. The main objective of NWM is “conservation of water, minimizing wastage and ensuring its more equitable distribution both across and within States through integrated water resources development and management”. NWM has been undertaking training and mass awareness programmes on water conservation. (c) & (d)  Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) carries out ground water monitoring, on regional scale through a network of observation wells in the Country. In order to assess the declining/rising trend in water level on a long-term basis, pre-monsoon water level data 2018 has been compared with the decadal average (2008-2017) water level. Analysis of data indicates decline in ground water level in about 52% of the wells and rise in 48% wells being monitored. The State-wise details are annexed.As per the report of 5th Census of Minor Irrigation Schemes with reference year 2013-14, available in the website (http://mowr.gov.in) of Ministry of Jal Shakti, Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, out of about 21 million total wells in the country about, 2.6 lakhs wells are permanently not in use for various reasons like salinity, dried up, destroyed beyond repair, sea water intrusion, etc.*****  S.
