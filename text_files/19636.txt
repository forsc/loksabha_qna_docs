ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a) to (c)	The Ministry of Education in association with the State Governments, UT Administrations, Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) and Private Corporates had launched the Swachh Vidyalaya initiative in 2014 to provide separate toilets for boys and girls in all government schools within one year. Under this initiative, 4,17,796 toilets had been constructed/reconstructed in 2,61,400 Government elementary and secondary schools till 15 August, 2015, thereby completing the target. State/UT-wise number of toilets constructed/re-constructed by the Central Public Sector Undertakings Private Corporates in Government elementary and secondary schools under Swachh Vidyalaya initiative is at Annexure-I. Swachh Bharat Kosh Trust (SBKT), Ministry of Finance has also been funding to States/UTs for construction/re-construction of toilets in Government schools, details of which are at Annexure-II. (d) and (e)	State/UT-wise status of availability of toilets in the schools as per UDISE+    2018-19 (Provisional) is at Annexure-III. The primary responsibility of maintenance of school toilets lies with the concerned State Government and UT Administration. The Ministry of Education has repeatedly requested the States/UTs to ensure maintenance and functionality of toilets constructed in schools, and to also take steps to bring about behavioural changes among students and teachers through an intensive awareness campaign to ensure that the toilets are properly used and kept neat and clean. Recently, the Department of School Education & Literacy has again requested the States/UTs, on 12th November 2020, for ensuring water supply in toilets, hand-washing area and drinking water facilities in all Government schools.The Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Centrally Sponsored Scheme for School Education – Samagra Shiksha w.e.f. 2018-19, which subsumes the three erstwhile Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). Under Samagra Shiksha, States and UTs are supported for strengthening of existing Government schools, and for creation and augmentation of infrastructure facilities including drinking water and toilets as per proposals received from respective State/UT. The scheme also envisages an annual recurring composite school grant varying upto Rs. 1,00,000/- per annum depending upon the number of students, for all government schools. Each school is required to spend at least 10% of the composite school grant on activities related to Swachhata Action Plan for maintenance and repair of school building including toilets and other facilities to keep the infrastructure in good condition.*****
