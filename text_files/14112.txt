In order to reduce the likely congestion, the Indian Railways is continuously undertaking a large number of works for station development for smooth integration of various modes in order to reduce congestion. In addition to the existing terminal in major urban centers, Satellite stations for distributing footfalls and reducing congestion are being developed.Railway administration is regularly coordinating with State Authorities, Local Bodies for easing traffic congestion around railway stations by providing better access to public transportation, vehicle parking, and developing smooth traffic flow plans for station circulating area, constructing Road over Bridges, Road under Bridges, subways, skywalks etc.(c)  Does not arise.(d) and (e) Delhi has a number of passenger terminals for distributing the footfalls and reduce traffic congestion around stations. The existing stations, New Delhi, Old Delhi, Nizamuddin, Anand Vihar and Delhi Sarai Rohilla are continuously being upgraded to cater to rising traffic demands. In addition, Indian Railways is developing three more terminals at Delhi namely, Shakurbasti, Bijwasan and Holambi Kalan.*****
