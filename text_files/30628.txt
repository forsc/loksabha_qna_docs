ANSWER




(a) District-wise number of operational Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) in Bihar, as reported by the State, is annexed. (b) Anganwadi Services is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme which is implemented through State Governments/ UT Administrations and the process of acquisition of land for construction of Anganwadi Centre is the responsibility of the concerned State Government/ UT Administration. However, as informed by the State of Bihar, for acquiring the land for setting up of new AWC, the concerned Child Development Project Officer (CDPO) sends a proposal with the name, nutrition area or vacant ward, minimum area requirement etc. for the new AWC to their concerned Circle Officer (CO). The CO identifies and selects the government land and if government land is not available then a proposal of donated land through their halka karamchari is seen. After district level approval the said land is transferred for AWC through due process by District Magistrate. The list of land is then sent to the concerned Deputy Development Commissioner by the CDPO/DPOs for the construction of new AWC. (c) Yes Sir. The Government of Bihar has requested for sanctioning of additional 18380 Anganwadi Centres to the State of Bihar. However, all the 14 lakh AWCs/AODs/Mini-AWCs approved by the Government of India have already been sanctioned to States/UTs (including Govt. of Bihar), presently, there is no AWC available for sanction.   (d) & (e) Yes Sir. The district-wise number of AWCs functioning in rented or private properties, as reported by the State, is annexed. ******  AnnexureAnnexure Referred In Reply to Part (a) and Part (d) & (e) of Lok Sabha Un-Starred Question No.2272 for answer on 10.12.2021 asked by Dr. Sanjay Jaiswal regarding “Setting Up of New Anganwadis” District-wise number of Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) in State of Bihar alongwith the AWCs in rented premises S.
