                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL) (a):	Yes Sir.  (b):	Ministry of Food Processing Industries is implementing a Centrally Sponsored "PM Formalisation of Micro food processing Enterprises (PMFME) Scheme" for providing financial, technical and business support for upgradation of micro food processing enterprises in the country. Support to upgrade existing units or setting up of new micro units for individuals is provided through a credit linked grants-in-aid @35% upto maximum of Rs. 10.00 lakhs. The Scheme also provides support to food processing units of SHGs/ FPOs/ Cooperatives for credit linked grants-in-aid @35%, Seed Capital to SHGs, Incubation Centre, Common Infrastructure, Marketing & Branding and Capacity Building.  The Scheme adopts One District One Product (ODOP) approach to reap the benefit of scale in terms of procurement of inputs, availing common services and marketing of products. ODOP for the scheme provides the framework for value chain development and alignment of support infrastructure. The State Cabinet has approved the implementation of PMFME Scheme in the State in September 2021. Till date, Rs. 3.81 crore has been released to Jharkhand as the Centre Share. The National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) has recommended 114 applications of SHG members with seed capital support of Rs. 39.05 lakhs to the State Nodal Agency. The details of the proposals / applications for establishing individual micro food processing units and seed capital received under the scheme from Santhal Pargana region of Jharkhand are at Annexure-I.  (c) & (d): The Ministry does not set up mini food parks on its own. However, MoFPI has been implementing the Scheme for Creation of Infrastructure for Agro Processing Clusters (APC) under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) to incentivize the setting up of agro processing clusters in the country. Till date, Ministry has approved 68 agro processing cluster projects. However, no project has been approved in Jharkhand under the scheme due to non-receipt of eligible proposals from the State. The State-wise details on number of APC projects sanctioned under the scheme are at Annexure-II. (e):	The Ministry has been implementing Central Sector Umbrella Scheme - Pradhan MantriKisan SAMPADA Yojana (PMKSY) coterminous with extended period of 14th Finance Commission Cycle i.e. 31.03.2021 for overall growth and development of food processing sector, including processing of agro- products and thus increasing the income of the farmers. The component schemes of PMKSY are - (i) Mega Food Park, (ii) Integrated Cold Chain andValue Addition Infrastructure, (iii) Creation /Expansion of Food Processing & Preservation Capacities, (iv) Infrastructure for Agro Processing Clusters, (v) Creation of Backward & Forward Linkages, (vi) Food Safety and Quality Assurance Infrastructure, (vii) Human Resource and Institutions, (viii) Operation Greens. Under component schemes of PMKSY, the Ministry provides mostly credit linked financial assistance (capital subsidy) in the form of grants-in-aid to entrepreneurs for setting up of food processing / preservation industries. PMKSY is not any region or State specific but demand driven and is implemented across the country. Also, as part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative, Ministry is implementing a Centrally Sponsored PM Formalisation of Micro food processing Enterprises (PMFME) scheme for providing financial, technical and business support for setting up/upgradation of 2 lakh micro food processing enterprises through credit linked grant during five years from 2020-21 to 2024-25 with an outlay of Rs. 10,000 crore.*****
