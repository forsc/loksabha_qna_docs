The details of new nuclear power projects is given below:Project	     Location & State 	  Capacity     Sanctioned     Expected          Annual                                   (MW)          Cost        Commencement      Fuel                                              (Rs Crore)    of Operation     Requirement	 	  	                                                     Per Reactor                                                                              (tons UO2)KKNPP- 5&6     Kudankulam          2 X 1000	49621	     2026 / 2027       25 (LEU)*               Tamil Nadu Chutka-1&2     Chutka, 	            2 X 700		     Progressive       125 (NU)#                   Madhya Pradesh                  105000        completion Kaiga-5&6      Kaiga, Karnataka	    2 X 700	              by 2031 		             Mahi 	       Mahi Banswara, 	    2 X 700	Banswara- 1&2  Rajasthan		GHAVP– 3&4     Gorakhpur, 	    2 X 700	               Haryana 		Mahi 	       Mahi Banswara, 	    2 X 700	Banswara- 3&4  Rajasthan	*Annual requirement at 90% Capacity Factor of Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) #Annual requirement at 85% Capacity Factor of Natural Uranium (NU)(d)	Yes, Sir. (e)	Four units of indigenous 700 MW Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) are planned to be set up at Gorakhpur in Haryana in two phases – GHAVP 1&2 (2 X 700 MW) and GHAVP 3&4 (2 X 700 MW). The total land for locating the four units of about 534 Hectares has been acquired. The approved completion cost of GHAVP 1&2 is Rs. 20594 crore. The GHAVP 3&4 project has been accorded sanction as a part of the 10 indigenous 700 MW PHWRs, to be set up in fleet mode at a cost of Rs. 105000 crore. GHAVP 1&2 is expected to commence operation in 2026 / 2027 and GHAVP 3&4 in 2027 / 2028.(f)	During construction, large numbers of contractor manpower are employed. In each of the twin unit projects, GHAVP 1&2 and GHAVP 3&4, the employment potential during construction will follow a bell curve with about 8000 persons at the peak. On becoming operational, each of the twin unit station is expected to generate employment (direct and indirect) for about 2000 persons. In addition, large employment potential is generated with the contractors/ vendors and from business opportunities that emerge consequent to the increase in economic activity at the site.(g)	The wastes generated in solid, liquid and gaseous forms during the operation of GHAVP 1 to 4, like other operating nuclear power plants will be of low & intermediate radioactivity level, which will be managed at the site in the dedicated waste management facilities. The wastes will be appropriately treated, concentrated and subject to volume reduction. The concentrates will be immobilized in inert materials like cement, bitumen, polymers etc. and stored in specially constructed structures located at the site under monitoring. The radioactivity level of the stored wastes reduces with time and by the end of the plant life, falls to a very low level. The treated liquids and gases will be diluted and discharged under monitoring, ensuring that the discharges are well within the limits set by Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB).*****
