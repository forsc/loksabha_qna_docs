This Ministry has searched the App on prominent App Stores and APK Stores and could not find the so called App in any of these online stores. This Ministry is not aware of any technical vulnerability that makes social media intermediaries susceptible to manipulation as reported in the news articles.  (e)	and (f):The Government is committed to ensure that the Internet in India is Open, Safe & Trusted and Accountable for all users. As internet expands and delivers many benefits for citizens, the Government is also aware of growing phenomena of users harms caused by misuse of some social media intermediaries/ platforms by some users which also includes cybercrimes related to identity theft.The Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000 has adequate provisions to deal with such cyber crimes, where  sections 66C and  66D of the IT Act specifically provide punishment for identity theft and for cheating by personation by using computer resource, respectively. In addition, any hacking or suspected hacking attempt can also be reported to Indian Computer Emergency Response Team.Rule 3(2)(b) of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 also provides for immediate removal of any imagery which is in the nature of impersonation in an electronic form from an Intermediary platform.*******
