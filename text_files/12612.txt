                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a):  To enable an area based development approach for Scheduled Castes, the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana (PMAGY) is being implemented since 2009-10 with the aim of integrated development of villages having Scheduled Castes population more than 50%. In October, 2018, the Scheme was extensively revised to bring focus on important and critical monitorable socio-economic indicators under 10 domains namely, Drinking Water & Sanitation, Education, Health & Nutrition, Livelihood and Skill Development, Social Security, Rural Road and housing, Electricity and clean fuel, Agricultural practices etc., Financial inclusion and Digitization. The scheme provides a framework for convergence of the Schemes of the Central as well as State Governments so as to ensure that the residents are provided with all such critical infrastructure and basic services as are necessary to have a dignified living, creating thereby an environment in which everyone is enabled to utilise her/his potential to the fullest. Funds are provided to the States under this Scheme for filling any identified infrastructure gap which can not be taken up from any other Scheme of the Central or State.Under this scheme, 225 villages in 2009-10, 288 villages in 2018-19 and 234 villages in 2019-20 have been taken up for implementation of Scheme in Rajasthan. (b)   No State-wise allocation of funds is being made under the Scheme. Funds are sanctioned to the States/UTs based on the number of villages selected under the scheme. During the last three years and current year a total of Rs.55.222 crore have been sanctioned to the State of Rajasthan. (c): No such targets have been set and selection of villages is subject to the availability of funds. As on date total 747 villages have so far been selected for implementation of Scheme in Rajasthan. (d): As per the provisions of the Scheme, in order to ensure stabilization and improvement in the monitorable indicators, the convergent implementation of the Schemes is to continue for a period of 05 years from the date of start of implementation. An Online System has been put in place for implementation and monitoring of the Scheme.(e) and (f) : Only Scheduled Castes (SCs) majority villages i.e. villages having population of SCs more than 50% are eligible under this Scheme. However, the development initiatives proposed under the Scheme are for all sections of the society of the selected villages, including, persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes living therein.*****
