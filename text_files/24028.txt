ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) to (c)   Yes, Sir. A Pedestrian Underpass (PUP) has been demanded at the said location. However, the topography of the road section at said location is such that one side is higher than the other side, which may cause drainage problem during rainy season, if a subway is constructed. Further, an underpass in close vicinity of a toll plaza is technically not feasible. However, feasibility for the construction of a suitable crossing facility like foot over bridge at the said location as change of scope within the existing concession agreement has been initiated. The work will take about six months for its completion once started.(d)	10 Vehicular Underpass (VUP) & 05 Pedestrian Underpass (PUP) in the Stretch Gorhar to Khairatunda and 10 VUPs & 01 PUP in the Stretch Khairatunda to Barwa Adda have been sanctioned.*****
