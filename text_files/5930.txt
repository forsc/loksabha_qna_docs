ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): Yes, Sir. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has received a proposal to develop new greenfield airport at Silchar in Assam. Also, Ministry of Civil Aviation has granted ''In Principle'' approval for setting up a New Greenfield Airport at Hollongi, Itanagar in Arunachal Pradesh. For Hollongi Airport, AAI has initiated the preparation of bidding documents, whereas for Silchar Airport, AAI has requested the State Government to share the land details for conducting pre-feasibility study.;Development of airports is a continuous process and is undertaken by AAI from time to time depending on the availability of land, commercial viability, socio-economic considerations, traffic demand / willingness of airlines to operate to/from such airports. AAI has initiated action for the construction of a new terminal building at airports at Guwahati and Imphal, re-carpeting of the runway at Lilabari airport, extension of runway and allied works at airports at Dibrugarh and Barapani, strengthening of runway at Dimapur airport, construction of hangar and cargo building at Agartala airport and the development works at Rupsi and Tezu airports.;(c): The timeline for setting up an airport depends upon many factors such as land acquisition, availability of mandatory clearances, financial closure, etc. by the individual developer, which involve a lengthy and time consuming process.
