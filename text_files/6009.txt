Regulatory measures are implemented through Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification (2011 & 2019) under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986; the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972; the Indian Forest Act, 1927; the Biological Diversity Act, 2002; and rules under these acts as amended from time to time.
