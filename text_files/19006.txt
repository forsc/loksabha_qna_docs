                                                        The MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a)& (b):	The Government, in consultation with the Chief Justice, Supreme Court of India, has increased the Judge strength of the Supreme Court  from 30 to 33 Judges (excluding Chief Justice of India) w.e.f. 09 August 2019 .The sanctioned strength of High Court Judges has increased from 906 in 2014 to 1080 in 2021.  The strength of High Courts has been increased after receiving approvals from the State Governments, High Courts and Chief Justice of India. At present, there are 4vacancies of Judges in Supreme Court and 418 vacancies of Judges in various High Courts. While every effort is made to fill up the existing vacancies expeditiously, vacancies in High Courts do keep on arising on account of retirement, resignation or elevation of Judges and increase in the Judge strength.Under Article 235 of the Constitution of India, the administrative control over the members of district and subordinate judiciary in the States vest with the concerned High Court.  Further, in exercise of powers conferred under proviso to Article 309 read with Articles 233 and 234 of the Constitution, the respective State Government, in consultation with the High Court, frames the Rules and Regulations regarding the issues of appointment, promotion, reservations etc. of Judicial Officers in the State Judicial Service.  Therefore, Central Government has no role in this regard. (c)&(d):	Disposal of cases in courts is within the domain of judiciary. Government has no role in disposal of cases in courts. However, the Union Government is committed to speedy disposal and reduction in pendency of cases. National Mission for Justice Delivery and Legal Reforms was set up in August, 2011 with the twin objectives of increasing access by reducing delays and arrears in the system and enhancing accountability through structural changes and by setting performance standards and capacities.  The Mission has been pursuing a co-ordinated approach for phased liquidation of arrears and pendency in judicial administration, which, inter-alia, involves better infrastructure for courts including computerization, increase in strength of subordinate judiciary, policy and legislative measures in the areas prone to excessive litigation, re-engineering of court procedure for quick disposal of cases and emphasis on human resource development.
