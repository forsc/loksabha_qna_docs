ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ?? ????? ?????? ??????		               (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	There is no such proposal at present in this regard since classification of country’s Agro-Climatic Zones is a subject area of Department of Earth Sciences.  Study has been carried out by India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) considering trends and spatial/temporal variability of temperature, rainfall, rainy days, and heavy rainfall in different agro-climatic zones of the country, which indicated need for reconsideration of classification of agro-climatic zones in India under the scenario of observed climate changes in the country.(c)	The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has initiated National Innovation on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) in 2011 to develop and demonstrate agricultural practices with regard particularly to climate change. *******
