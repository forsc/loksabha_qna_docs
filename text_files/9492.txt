                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a) to (e):  A statement is laid on the Table of the HouseSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 273* FOR 6TH DECEMBER, 2019(a) to (e): As per the National Cancer Registry Program of Indian Council of Medical Research, the estimated incidence of cancer cases in the year 2018 was 15,86,571. Cancer is diagnosed and treated at various levels in the health care system. Treatment of cancer is by surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and palliative care. While doctors with D.M. (Medical Oncology), M.Ch. (Surgical Oncology) and M.D. (Radiation Oncology) treat cancer patients in higher level tertiary care hospitals, other doctors such as General Surgeons, Gynecologists, ENT Surgeons etc. also provide treatment for cancer in Government and private hospitals, depending on the type and site of cancer. The information regarding cancer patients in Government hospitals is not maintained centrally.	Health being a State subject, the Central Government supplements the efforts of the State Governments in providing health care services including cancer care. The Government of India is implementing the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) under the National Health Mission (NHM). The objectives of NPCDCS include awareness generation for Cancer prevention, screening, early detection and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. 599 NCD Clinics at District level and 3,274 NCD Clinics at Community Health Centre level have been set up under the programme.  Population level initiative for prevention, control and screening for common NCDs (diabetes, hypertension and common cancers viz. oral, breast and cervical cancer) has also been rolled out under the National Health Mission (NHM) in over 215 districts. Screening of common NCDs is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres.	To enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer, the Central Government is assisting 18 State Cancer Institutes and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres under the Strengthening of Tertiary Care for Cancer Scheme.  Further, Oncology is also one of the focus areas in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar in Haryana and strengthening of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata are also measures in the same directions. All these centres are envisaged to provide comprehensive treatment facilities and act as hubs for cancer care.*****
