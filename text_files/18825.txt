                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI SOM PARKASH)(a)to(d): One District One Product (ODOP) is an initiative which is seen as a transformational step forward towards realizing the true potential of a district, fuel economic growth and generate employment and rural entrepreneurship, taking us to the goal of AtmaNirbhar Bharat.  One District One Product (ODOP) initiative is operationally merged with ‘Districts as Export Hub’ initiative being implemented by DGFT, Department of Commerce, with Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) as a major stakeholder.   Department of Commerce through DGFT is engaging with State and Central government agencies to promote the initiative of One District One Product. The objective is to convert each District of the country into an Export Hub by identifying products with export potential in the District, addressing bottlenecks for exporting these products, supporting local exporters/manufacturers to scale up manufacturing, and find potential buyers outside India with the aim of promoting exports, promoting manufacturing & services industry in the District and generate employment in the District. To increase exports and take export promotion to the District level, Department of Commerce through the Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) is engaging with State / UT Governments to implement the said initiative in all districts of the country in a phased manner, with the objective of mobilizing the potential of each district of the country to achieve its potential as an export hub. Under the initial phase of the ODOP programme, 106 Products have been identified from 103 districts across 27 States.  As far as Rajasthan is concerned, two products namely Blue Pottery (Jaipur) and Markhana Marbels (Nagaur) are among the identified 106 Products. All the Districts of Rajasthan are already covered under the ‘Districts as Export Hub’ initiative. State Export Promotion Committee (SPEC) and District Export Promotion Committee (DEPC) have been constituted in Rajasthan. DEPC is constituted in all Districts of India, except districts of the state of West Bengal. DEPC meetings have been conducted in 510 Districts of India, Draft Export Action Plans are prepared for 451 Districts. ******
