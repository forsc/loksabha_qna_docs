ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	No, Sir.  These are State Governments’ schemes.  The Central Government has already started Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme aimed at providing income support to all land holding farmers’ families in the country, subject to certain exclusions, to enable them to take care of expenses related to agriculture and allied activities as well as domestic needs so as to protect them from falling in the clutches of moneylenders for meeting such expenses and ensure their continuance in the farming activities.  Further, the Government has also approved a pension scheme for all Small and Marginal Farmers (SMF) in the country, subject to certain exclusion clauses, with a view to provide them social security net as they have minimal or no savings to provide for old age and to support them in the event of consequent loss of livelihood.  These schemes are uniformly applicable to all States/UTs, including Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.******
