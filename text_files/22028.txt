MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) and (b)	The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, prepared by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT),recommends Art Education as a compulsory curricular area upto Class X. Music and Dance have been the integral part of the school curriculum as component of Art Education.NCERT has developed syllabus for Art Education from Class I-X as compulsory subject and for XI-XII in specialized subject areas under Art Education.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) offers six subjects under the areas of Music in Classes IX to XII as optional subjects. The Board also offers six different types of Indian Classical Dances as optional subjects in these Classes. The National Education Policy, 2020 also envisages to make Music and Dance an integral part of the school education from the earliest age to the school leaving Grade XII. (c)	NCERT has integrated components of rich heritage of various art forms including music, dance and drama in syllabus and textbooks across the classes. The Ministry of Education through NCERT organizes Kala Utsav every year to promote arts in education, by nurturing and showcasing the artistic talent of school students, in the country, recognizing the importance of aesthetics and artistic experiences for secondary-level students, which plays a major role in creating awareness about India’s rich cultural heritage and its vibrant diversity. CBSE conducts Annual Heritage India Quiz which places exclusive emphasis on the rich heritage of India including history, art, music, dance culture and traditions with an ample scope of orienting students to all such topics not directly covered under syllabus. ****
