ANSWER




                                                        ):  Under the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan, as on 21st June 2019, more than 2.29 crore beneficiaries have been enrolled and 2.21 crore have been trained, out of which 1.33 crore are duly certified by duly authorized 3rd party Certifying Agencies. The state-wise/UT-wise targets and the number of candidates trained and certified under the scheme since FY 2017-18 are given at Annexure. It may be seen that as against a target of 44,33,000 candidates for Maharashtra, so far, 11,70,820 candidates have been trained, out of which 6,95,969 candidates have been duly certified. Similarly, as against a target of 18,03,000 candidates for Jharkhand, so far, 12,93,007 candidates have been trained, out of which 7,21,497 candidates have been duly certified.(b):  Some of the key reasons for the slow implementation of the scheme include low internet connectivity in remote rural/far-flung areas, poor awareness about benefits of digital literacy, difficulty in covering non-accessible and sparsely populated areas and other infrastructure related issues.(c):  Government has taken up several steps for proper implementation of the scheme particularly in remote rural areas of the country which include scaling up the awareness and promotional activities towards Digital literacy program and expand it multifold through campaigns, workshops, seminars, digital vans, etc. to cover various segments of the population in an all-inclusive manner. Efforts have been made to identify and register new Training centres in uncovered Gram Panchayats across the country. In order to address the low internet connectivity issues, Wifi-choupals have been established at remote locations. Rural schools have been engaged for training and examination of candidates in order to penetrate the rural populous districts of identified states.*******    AnnexureThe State/UT-wise details of targets, number of candidates trained and certified year-wise under PMGDISHA Scheme:																			(As on 21-06-2019)S.No.	State	Targets (no. of candidates)	Achievement Status (no. of candidates) 			FY 2017-18	FY 2018-19	FY 2019-20			Trained	Certified	Trained	Certified	Trained	Certified1	ANDAMAN AND NICOBAR ISLANDS	18000	0	0	225	18	0	02	ANDHRA PRADESH	2028000	218761	118893	301045	142034	12625	59513	ARUNACHAL PRADESH	77,000	381	70	1848	465	47	334	ASSAM	1929000	89788	12929	988724	640771	86177	1108585	BIHAR	6630000	795999	409886	727427	494820	72532	607936	CHANDI-GARH	2000	0	0	0	0	0	07	CHHATTIS-GARH	1412000	713563	358546	618543	459752	55909	414638	DADRA & NAGAR HAVELI	13000	1	0	672	124	13	1089	DAMAN AND DIU	4000	0	0	464	246	43	4310	DELHI	30000	0	0	0	0	0	011	GOA	40000	3	0	181	2	5	5912	GUJARAT	2497000	756670	416867	397698	289883	22984	2516913	HARYANA	1191000	678104	383619	393341	268983	56082	4640614	HIMACHAL PRADESH	444000	81968	32343	36393	21685	6761	506115	JAMMU AND KASHMIR	658000	140398	74203	96984	71505	20833	1202916	JHARKHAND	18,03,000	968471	477010	293011	218031	31525	2645617	KARNATAKA	27,05,000	314184	172607	167506	103146	6297	497318	KERALA	12,57,000	12406	4095	9638	4194	1280	87619	LAKSHA-DWEEP	1000	0	0	6	0	0	020	MADHYA PRADESH	3784000	758857	364122	771886	513283	78380	7122221	MAHA-RASHTRA	4433000	545138	283065	530508	357473	95174	5543122	MANIPUR	137000	6126	1766	1755	910	300	5023	MEGHALAYA	171000	507	3	42986	15386	8744	773524	MIZORAM	38000	4387	2254	834	212	67	2925	NAGALAND	101000	1173	773	1459	633	474	26026	ODISHA	2517000	772041	414710	456118	338211	43069	3367727	PUDU-CHERRY	28000	6443	2661	3448	1977	243	5128	PUNJAB	1247000	273886	161814	438969	314444	35043	2515929	RAJASTHAN	3712000	721780	357402	491318	339133	55122	4058130	SIKKIM	33000	0	0	39	3	2	031	TAMILNADU	2679000	350604	198848	171365	109509	9033	626532	TELANGANA	2028000	218540	116069	147465	98518	15308	962033	TRIPURA	195000	32612	17844	38196	17724	4239	269634	UTTARA-KHAND	5,06,000	162127	93431	95647	65474	12283	977535	UTTAR PRADESH	11171000	2473387	1231890	2322173	1628818	275449	22066836	WEST BENGAL	4481000	317367	141971	198484	146421	28278	17530Total	60000000	11415672	5849691	9746356	6663788	1034321	841027*******
