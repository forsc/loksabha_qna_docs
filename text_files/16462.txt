ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a) to (d): The Right to Education (RTE) Act under section 12 (2) provides for reimbursement of expenditure to schools providing free and compulsory elementary education as specified in clause (c) of sub-section (l) of section 12. The schools are reimbursed expenditure incurred by them to the extent of per-child-expenditure incurred by the State, or the actual amount charged from the child; whichever is less, in such manner as may be prescribed.Education is a subject in the concurrent list of the Constitution and majority of the schools in the country are under the administrative control of the State Governments and UT Administrations. Hence, State/UT governments are given flexibility to devise their per child cost. As per the information provided by the States, 12 States/UTs have revised their per child cost since 2014-15. Central Government in various meetings like State Education Secretaries conference, Joint Review Missions (JRM), Project Approval Board (PAB) Meetings, has been advising/guiding State/ UT Governments on implementation of the Section 12(1)(c) of the RTE Act 2009.****
