                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING [RAO INDERJIT SINGH](a) & (b): This Ministry has launched a new regular Employment-Unemployment survey, namely, Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) during 2017-18 with certain changes in survey methodology, data collection mechanism and sampling design vis-à-vis the earlier quinquennial (once in every five years)Employment and Unemployment surveys of NSSO. Besides, the PLFS was launched with an objective of measuring quarterly changes of various indicators of the labour market in urban areas and for generating annual estimates of these indicators for rural and urban areas.These differences in methodology put certain limitations in respect of the comparability of results of PLFS with the results of earlier quinquennial surveys on Employment –Unemployment conducted by NSS.Based on the Annual Report (July, 2017-June, 2018) of PLFS, released on 31st May, 2019, unemployment rates, state-wise and gender-wise for different age groups in usual status are given in the Statements I to III at Annexure.(c): Based on the sample surveys conducted by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation and other relevant sources of data,Government is regularly publishing / releasing statistics related to different areas, aspects and subjects.(d): The current base year of National Accounts is 2011-12, and the estimates of National Accounts are published as per advance release calendar.(e): This Ministry has been regularly bringing out macro-economic aggregates and indicators. The statistical processes involved in producing such estimates are open, transparent and in line with the best international practices and standards. The processes are evolved after detailed deliberations in various technical committees and the recommendations thereon are placed in the public domain. These measures have been appreciated by different sections of society including research analysts, experts, international organisations, etc. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation has adopted the United Nations Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics to further strengthen the professional independence, impartiality, accountability and transparency in methods of collection, compilation and dissemination of official statistics.                                                 *****
