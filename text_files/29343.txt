SINGH)(a) Acknowledging the importance of clean energy for growth of the Indian economy, the Government has set a target for achieving 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by the year 2022. A total of 150 GW renewable energy capacity (including large hydro) has been installed in the country till date. Further, projects of 63.64 GW capacity are under various stages of implementation and 32.06 GW capacity are under various stages of bidding. Therefore, a total of 245.70 GW capacity has either been installed or is under implementation /bidding.(b) & (c) Under New National Biogas and Organic Manure Programme (NNBOMP) Scheme of the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE), financial support has been provided for setting up small biogas plants (1-25 m3) for production of clean cooking gas, based on cattle dung and other mixed organic wastes, in remote, rural and semi-urban areas of the country. Under the Scheme, 50.6 lakh biogas plants have been installed up to 31.03.2021. Further, under Biogas based Power Generation (Off-grid) and Thermal energy application Programme (BPGTP) support has been provided for setting up biogas plants in the medium size range of 30 m3 to 2500 m3 per day. Under this Scheme, 325 nos. of biogas plants with aggregate capacity of 7.2 MW have been installed till 31.03.2021. Further, under Waste to Energy Programme of MNRE, Biogas and Bio-CNG generation projects have been sanctioned in various States during the years 2018-20. Under this Scheme, Bio-CNG generation capacity of 1,26,000 kg/ day has been created in the country till 31.10.2021. The above-mentioned Schemes were valid till 31.03.2021 and have been recommended for continuation beyond 31.03.2021 only to meet the already created liabilities. For promotion of new and innovative models of Biogas Plants, MNRE in FY 2020-21 invited entrepreneurs and developers working in the Biogas Sector in the country. Subsequently, 8 projects have been accepted for field performance evaluation. (d) Under Ladakh Renewable Energy Initiative (LREI), Government has provided financial support for installation of 2750 nos. of dish-type solar cookers and 16 nos. of solar steam cooking systems in Ladakh.
