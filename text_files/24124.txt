MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) & (b) Education being in the concurrent list of the Constitution and majority of the schools, colleges and university are under the domain of respective State and UT Governments. The spread of COVID-19 pandemic has also had a severe impact on education as schools, universities and colleges closed their premises and states shut their borders in response to lockdown measures. This has interrupted the learning and led to disruption of education system in the country.The Central Government is constantly advising States/UTs through guidelines and meeting with respect to interventions for reducing impact of pandemic on education. The guidelines issued so far as follows:• Guidelines For Children of Migrant Labourers:https://www.mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/Migrant%20labour%20guideline.pdf• Guidelines For Out of School Children and Mitigation of Loss of Learning: https://www.education.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/guidelines_oosc.pdf.• PRAGYATA Guidelines on Digital Education: https://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/pragyata-guidelines_0.pdf• Learning Enhancement Guidelines for Continuous Learning: https://ncert.nic.in/pdf/announcement/Learning_%20Enhancement_Guidelines.pdf• COVID-19 Related Health and Safety Sop/Guidelines for School Re-Opening: https://www.mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/SOP_Guidelines_for_reopening_schools.pdf• Covid Action Plan for School Education: The Department of School Education and Literacy vide letter dated 4th May, 2021 has shared the Covid Action plan with States/UTs • Guidelines For Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya(JNV) –Residential Schools :https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LAc4iKQTqTJkNVDGc5glEDsrDGdAXwC8/view,• Guidelines for parents: Guidelines for parents to support learning of their children.• E-content for CWSN : Guidelines for e-content for Children with Special Needs (CWSN).• CBSE competency-based assessment framework: CBSE in collaboration with British Council has prepared a competency-based assessment framework for class X. This is based on recommendations of NEP 2020 and will help in reducing the stress of exams and aims to develop competencies in students rather than content knowledge alone.• National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) Guidelines for Teachers Education Institutions : https://ncte.gov.in/WebAdminFiles/RecentAnnouncement/0_20_08_2020_637335320672297662.pdfFurther, University Grants Commission (UGC) has also issued notices/advisories to Higher Education Institutions from time to time to contain the spread of COVID-19 and other academic related matters.UGC has framed guidelines for reopening of the campuses which inter alia deals with the safety and well being of the students.

UGC via this letter communicated to all Universities/Colleges the detailed procedure issued by the then MHRD for the conduct of Examinations with measures to be taken in view of COVID-19 situation.c) The subject matter of reduction of fee is within the purview of States/UTs. For Rationalisation of Syllabus for Summative Examinations, CBSE has decided to compensate the loss of face to face teaching learning by rationalizing the syllabus for the Board/Annual Examinations for classes IX to XII to an extent of around 30 percent. With respect to online teaching hours, Pragyata guidelines have been issued. With respect to teaching in classroom after school re-open, guidelines on learning with social distancing.

Another letter was issued on 17.12.2020 regarding refund of fees and non-retention of documents by the universities. These letters are available on UGC website www.ugc.ac.in.In view of the emerging situation related to COVID-19 pandemic in India, revised guidelines were issued. Wherein the universities were requested to complete the examinations by the end of September, 2020 in offline (pen & paper)/ online/ blended (online + offline) mode following the prescribed protocols/ guidelines related to COVID-19 pandemic. These guidelines have provision that in order to avoid financial hardship being faced by the parents due to lockdown and related factors, full refund of fees be made on account of all cancellation of admissions/ migration of students, up to 30.11.2020, for this very session as a special case. Thereafter, on cancellation/ withdrawal of admissions up to 31.12.2020, the entire fee collected from a student is refunded in full after deduction of not more than Rs.1000/- as processing fee. These guidelines alsostated that all the universities may follow a 6-day week pattern for the academic session 2020-21 and 2021-2022 to compensate the loss for this batch of students. Further, the universities were requested to compensate the delay in the start of academic session in the subsequent years by curtailing the breaks/ vacations so that this batch of students would get their final results for award of degree timely. (d) & (e) During COVID-19 Pandemic, Ministry of Education has held several consultations with the states and UTs at various levels and taken many initiatives to ensure that the school going students don’t lag behind in their studies during COVID-19 pandemic.

This Department has also developed an online module for compiling the data of Out of School children identified by each State/UT and their mapping with Special Training Centres (STC) on - the PRABANDH Portal (http://samagrashiksha.in).
