Thus, the average annual budget allocation for 2014-19 is 224% more than average annual allocation during 2009-14.Total allocation of Budget for Infrastructure & safety works falling fully/partly in the state of Karnataka, in 2019-20 is ` ¬¬¬3,386 crore, which is 306% more than average annual outlay of 2009-14.Proposed Budget allocation for Infrastructure & safety works, falling fully/partly in the state of Karnataka, in 2020-21 is ` ¬4,220 crore, which is 405% more than average annual budget allocation of 2009-14.

During 2014-19, 735 Km (253 Km of New line and 482 Km of Doubling projects) have been commissioned in the state at an average rate 147 Km per year, which is 30% more than commissioning during 2009-14.The completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions of working agencies/contractors  etc.  All these factors vary from project to project and site to site and affect the completion time and cost of the project, which is finally worked out at the completion stage. Therefore, confirmed time line for completion of project cannot be ascertained at this stage. *****
