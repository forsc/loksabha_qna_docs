Construction of permanent buildings for KVs is a continuous process, which depends upon identification of suitable land, completion of lease formalities in favour of KVS by the sponsoring authorities, submission of drawings / estimates by construction agency, availability of funds and requisite approvals etc. 	Construction of buildings has been started in 3 KVs out of above 17 KVs. In the remaining 14 KVs including GopalganjDistt., request has been made to the concerned sponsoring authorities, primarily Bihar Government, for transfer of land in favour of KendriyaVidyalaya Sangathan (KVS). Despite persistent follow up through various communications sent to the State Government and district administration of Gopalganj,the State Government of Bihar has not transferred the requisite extent of the land in favour of KVS.  *****
