T. R. PAARIVENDHAR TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 16.03.2022 REGARDING ELECTRIFICATION WORKS IN TAMIL NADU(a) No, Sir. Significant progress has already been made in this regard and Indian Railways is electrifying all Broad Gauge rail lines expeditiously. During 2014-21, routes of 24,080 RKM have been commissioned on electric traction against 4,337 RKM commissioned during 2007-14, an increase of 455%.(b) & (e) The completion of Electrification project depends upon various factors like clearances from the concerned Departments/State Governments/Central Ministries, completion of Transmission Line works by State Power Utilities and resolution of law & order issues during execution, which are beyond the control of Ministry of Railways. Therefore, it is not feasible to fix time lines for completion of the project.(c) Does not arise(d) As on 01.03.2022, out of 3,864 Route Km of Broad Gauge routes, 3,064 Routs Km have been electrified in the State of Tamil Nadu. Electrification works on the balance Broad Gauge routes are under different stages of execution and planned for completion in phased manner.*****
