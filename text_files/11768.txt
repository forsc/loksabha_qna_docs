                                                        THE MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a)	to (d)  A Statement is laid on the table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTs (a) TO (d) OF STARRED QUESTION   NO.-*77 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 06.02.2020 REGARDING “GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT” ASKED BY SHRI VISHNU DAYAL RAM, M.P.(a) Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has been constituted under Section 3(3) of the ‘Environment (Protection) Act, 1986’ for the purpose of regulation and control of ground water development and management in the Country. CGWA is regulating ground water withdrawal by industries / infrastructure/ mining projects in the country for which guidelines/ criteria have been framed, which are modified from time to time. The current guidelines, effective from 15.11.2015 are available on the website http://cgwa-noc.gov.in. As per information received from Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, the Model Building Bye Laws, 2016, has been issued for guidance of the States/UTs which has a chapter on ‘Rainwater Harvesting’.  33 States/UTs have adopted the rainwater harvesting provisions. The provisions of this chapter are applicable to all the buildings.  The implementation of the rainwater harvesting policy comes within the purview of the State Government/Urban Local Body / Urban Development Authority.  As per Model Building Bye Laws- 2016, provision of rainwater harvesting is applicable to all residential plots above 100 sq.m.In order to regulate the Over-exploitation and consequent depletion of ground water, the Ministry has circulated a Model Bill to all the States/UTs to enable them to enact suitable ground water legislation for regulation of its development, which includes provision of rain water harvesting. So far, 15 States/UTs have adopted and implemented the ground water legislation on the lines of Model Bill.(b) to (d)  Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management including conservation and water harvesting in the Country is primarily States’ responsibility.  However, the important measures taken by the Central Government for conservation, management of ground water and effective implementation of rain water harvesting in the country are at the following URL: http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf.Government of India launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan, a time bound campaign with a mission mode approach intended to improve water availability including ground water conditions in the water stressed blocks of 256 districts in India. In this regard, teams of officers from Central Government along-with technical officers from Ministry of Jal Shakti were deputed to visit water stressed districts and to work in close collaboration with district level officials to undertake suitable interventions.Government of India has approved Atal Bhujal Yojana (Atal Jal), a Rs. 6000 Crore Central Sector Scheme, for sustainable management of ground water resources with community participation in water stressed blocks of Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The scheme is being implemented with the financial assistance of World Bank with a sharing pattern of 50:50 between Government of India and World Bank. Contd…P/2//2//Central Ground Water Board has prepared “Empowering Village Communities for A Sustainable Water Future: A Resource Book for village level para-hydrogeologists” jointly with MARVI (Managing Aquifer Recharge and Sustaining Groundwater Use through Village-level Intervention) partners which, inter-alia, include Western Sydney University, Australia, CSIRO Land & Water, Australia, Arid Communities and Technologies, Bhuj and Development Support Center, Ahmedabad. This is a step which is likely to help facilitate participation of village communities in ground water resource management, ensuring a sustainable water future.Central Government supports construction of water harvesting and conservation works primarily through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana – Watershed Development Component (PMKSY-WDC).The State-wise details of Water Conservation and Water Harvesting works taken up in 2019-20 (as on 31st January 2020) under MGNREGS in various States/UTs are given at Annexure I.As per Ministry of Rural Development, Department of Land Resources, they have sanctioned 8214 watershed development projects in States/UTs from 2009-10 to 2014-15 under Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP)/PMKSY-WDC. The activities being undertaken through these projects inter alia include ridge area treatment, drainage line treatment, soil and moisture conservation, rain water harvesting, nursery raising, afforestation, horticulture, pasture development, livelihoods for assetless persons, etc. The State wise details of projects sanctioned, area covered by the projects and funds released as Central share to States under WDC-PMKSY are given at Annexure-II.*****ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (b) to (d) of Starred Question No. *77 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 06.02.2020 regarding “Ground Water management”.State-wise details of Water Conservation and Water Harvesting works taken up under MGNREGSS No.	State	Water Conservation and Water Harvesting		Completed	Ongoing		Number of works	Expenditure in Rs.
