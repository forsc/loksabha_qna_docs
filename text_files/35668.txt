(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (e):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF PARTS (a) TO (e) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *272 FOR 22.03.2022 REGARDING “POLICIES ON ORGANIC FARMING”(a):	Organic Farming has been defined as a process of production system where in synthetics are avoided or largely excluded to preserve the ecosystem and to maintain biodiversity within the farm. The modern concepts of organic farming combines Tradition (mixed farming and indigenous technical knowledge), Innovation (hybrids, bio-fertilizers, farm yard manure, enriched composts, oilcakes, micro irrigation, improved agronomic practices including crop rotation, intercropping & mulching in possible areas/ crops  and cultural & biological control of pests and diseases including ecological engineering) and Science (supplying required nutrients and management of pests and diseases without synthetics).	National Center of Organic & Natural Farming (NCONF) (erstwhile National Center of Organic Farming- NCOF) and its regional centers have been established to promote organic and natural farming through technical capacity building and quality control of organic inputs.	Government is promoting organic farming through dedicated schemes namely Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and Mission Organic Value Chain Development in North East Region (MOVCDNER).  Both the schemes provide end to end support to organic farmers from organic production to certification and marketing including post harvest management support like processing, packaging, storage etc. (b):	PKVY is implemented in all the States across the country while MOVCDNER is specifically implemented for promotion of certified organic production in North Eastern States. 	As regards certification of organic products, Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) under Ministry of Commerce has notified National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP). Under NPOP, the third party certification is done by accredited Certification Body. Until now, 29 accredited Certification Bodies have been authorized by APEDA for certification. Whereas, Ministry of Agriculture has launched low cost farmer’s group centric decentralized PGS-India organic certification programme for development of domestic organic market. PGS-Organic certification is done by authorized Regional Council under PGS- India Programme under Ministry of Agriculture. Until now 65 numbers of Regional Council have been authorized under PGS- India programme.(c):	States are required to certify their entire cultivable land under NPOP or PGS organic certification systems to become fully organic. The state of Sikkim has become fully organic in January 2016 by certifying its entire cultivable land of 76,000 ha into organic. Whereas, the Union Territory of Lakshadweep and Ladakh have become fully organic by certifying their entire area under Large Area Certification (LAC) programme. Under LAC, 14,445 ha area of Car Nicobar and Nancowry group of islands in Union Territory of Andaman & Nicobar Islands have been certified to transform into organic. Year –wise export of organic products from India during last 5 years (2016-17 to 2020-21) is given at Annexure I.   	(d): 	Organic farming is a sustainable production system which improves soil health and fertility. 	Government is implementing Soil Health Management (SHM) and Soil Health Card (SHC) schemes under National Project on Management of Soil Health and Fertility since 2014-15 to promote soil test based Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) through conjunctive use of chemical fertiliser, organic fertiliser and bio-fertiliser to improve soil health and fertility for sustainable production by increasing the organic sources of plant nutrient like organic fertiliser. Soil Health card provides information to farmers on nutrient status of their soil along with recommendation on appropriate doses of nutrients to be applied for improving soil health and fertility. 	Demonstrations about balanced used of fertilizers based on soil health card recommendations and training to the farmers on proper and integrated use of fertilizers are integral part of the scheme. Since 2015, around 6.45 lakh demonstrations, 93,781 farmers training and 7425 farmers’ melas are organized/ conducted under the programme.(e):	Indian Council of Agricultural Research through ICAR-Indian Institute of Farming Systems Research, Modipuram operates a research scheme of All India Network Programme on Organic Farming with 20 cooperating centres covering 16 States to develop package of practices for organic production of crops in cropping and farming systems perspective. The scheme involves 11 State Agricultural Universities, 8 ICAR institutes/centres and 1 special heritage university. As a result of the scheme, organic farming packages for 62 cropping systems suitable to 16 States and 8 integrated organic farming system models suitable to 7 States have been developed to provide technological backstopping.
