The Ministry is implementing PMMVY in accordance with the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) which provides that subject to such schemes as may be framed by the Central Government, every Pregnant Women & Lactating Mother (PW&LM), except those who are in regular employment with the Central Government or State Government or Public Sector Undertaking or those who are in receipt of similar benefits under any law for the time being in force, shall be entitled to maternity benefit of not less than rupees six thousand, in such instalments as may be prescribed by the Central Government.   Accordingly, under PMMVY, payment of maternity benefits of ? 5,000/- in beneficiary’s bank/post office account is provided in three instalments. The eligible beneficiary receives the remaining cash incentive as per approved norms towards Maternity Benefit under Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) after institutional delivery so that on an average, a woman gets ? 6000/-.   (d) & (e)         Employment status of the beneficiaries is not captured under the Scheme and thus this information is not available with the Ministry.
