The various actions to check illegal mining are taken as per the provisions under various Acts, such as Indian Forest Act, 1927; Wildlife Protection Act, 1972; and various rules made under these Acts and other State specific Acts and Rules.Further, to prevent and stop forest offences including illegal mining, various measures are taken by the State Forest Departments such as setting up of check posts, barriers, use of modern technology (that includes wireless networks, remote sensing, Geographical Information System, Information Technology, Global Positioning System and Differential Global Positioning System), improved mobility of field staff by providing vehicles for patrolling, survey and demarcation of forest areas and construction of boundary pillars. Local communities are also involved in conservation, protection and management of forests through Joint Forest Management.
