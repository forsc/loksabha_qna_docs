ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF MINES, COAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a) to (d) & (f) to (h): The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, administered by the Ministry of Mines, does not have any provisions on Stamp Duty. The rate and manner of levy of Stamp Duty on an instrument of mining lease lies within the legislative jurisdiction of State Governments. Stamp duty on instruments of mining lease is collected by the State Governments which goes into the Consolidated Fund of the State and appropriated by act of the State Legislature. Indian Stamp Act, 1899 prescribe the methodology for calculation of Stamp Duty on mining lease.               The Government has noticed that varied method of calculation of stamp duty in mining is being adopted by different States. Accordingly, it has been proposed for rationalizing the methodology of calculation of stamp duty in mining throughout the country in consultation with Ministry of Finance.(e):- The proposed amendment in the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 2020 was notified on 03.09.2020 on the website of Ministry of Mines for the comments of general public up to 24.9.2020.*****
