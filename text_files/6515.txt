The remaining provisions of the APR Act, 2014 are at various stages of implementation.

SAIL conducted the feasibility study and reported that the feasibility of setting up of integrated steel plant of the proposed configuration was prima-facie not found financially viable. The proposal for setting up of a major port at Duggirajupatnam was not found viable due to strong competition from nearby ports. Hence, the Government of Andhra Pradesh has been requested to suggest alternate site(s) for development of major port in the State.
