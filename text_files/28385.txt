ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Presently, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship does not have any scheme to set up Skill University in the State. However, the Ministry has encouraged States to open Skill Universities with an objective to promote skills education in an integrated and holistic manner with general education so as to ensure pathways for progression and mobility across forms of education and skill. The State Government of Karnataka may set up Skill University itself through State Act as has been done by other States like Haryana and Rajasthan.
