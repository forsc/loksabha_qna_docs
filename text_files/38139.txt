KISHAN REDDY)(a):	The Ministry of Tourism had shared a list of 50 Tourism destinations including Iconic Sites and UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the first phase and subsequently of 114 routes in the Second phase with Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, State Government and Border Road organization for improving road connectivity.The list of tourist destinations recommended by the state Government of Meghalaya has also been shared with Ministry of Road Transport & Highway for improving road connectivity.(b):	The Ministry of Tourism has launched the Incredible India Tourist Facilitator (IITF) Certification Programme- a digital initiative that aims at creating an Online learning platform with the objective of creating a pool of well trained and professional Tourist Facilitators across the country. The system provides basic, advanced (heritage and adventure), spoken language and refresher courses for candidates. The candidates can pursue these online courses from anywhere and at any time and at their own pace. The online courses can be accessed from different digital devices. The Programme has been made available online w.e.f. 01.01.2020. This certification programme has been conducted by Indian Institute of Tourism and Travel Management (IITTM) Gwalior.Regional Level Guides (RLGs) have also been inducted in the Advance Stage (IITG-Heritage) of this programme and they have been renamed as Incredible India Tourist Guide (IITG) on completion of Refresher Course. Some of them are already linguistic experts having knowledge of foreign language.In addition, Ministry of Tourism also conducts Linguistic Tourist Facilitators (LTF) Programme imparting training to the candidates of Foreign Languages such as Thai, Japanese, Chinese and Vietnamese. (c):	Air fares are not regulated by the Governments. Under the provision of Sub Rule (1) of Rule 135, aircraft Rules 1937, airlines are free to fix reasonable tariff having regard to all relevant factors, including the cost of operation, characteristics of service, reasonable profit and the generally prevailing tariff. Air fare so established by the airlines is published on their respective website under the provision of Sub Rule (2) of Rule 135, Aircraft Rules 1937. However, Ministry of Civil Aviation launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21-10-2016 to stimulate regional air connectivity and making air travel affordable to the masses. While launching the UDAN Scheme in 2016, the Government had capped the Air fare at Rs.2500 for a distance of approximately 500 km (equivalent to one-hour flight) per seat under Regional Connectivity routes. The capping is subject to indexation as per the formula specified in the UDAN Scheme document.  States of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh & Uttarakhand, North Eastern Region of India, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep Islands have been included in the Scheme Document as Priority Area(s). The Scheme document offers more benefits, including Viability Gap Funding (VGF) for Priority Area(s), to interested airline operators for participating in the bids for award of routes.***********
