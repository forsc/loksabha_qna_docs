All Major Ports comply with the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code, a mandatory code formulated by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), to ensure security at Ports handling international ships.  All Major Ports have their own Port Facility Security Advisory Committee which evaluates the security issues in accordance with ISPS Code.  Further, assessment of security arrangements in all the 12 Major Ports is  done by the Central Security agencies alongwith other stakeholders at regular intervals and Port-wise recommendations are made for upgradation/strengthening the security of ports.

Further, Major Ports have adequate number of CISF personnel deployed for security purpose.  Besides, all Major Ports have Vessel Traffic Management System (VTMS), Radiation Detection Equipments (RDEs), Quick Reaction Teams (QRTs) to counter any contingencies, proper Access Control mechanism. (c)	Government has also taken steps to increase the security of Major Ports by installing Mobile and Drive through Container Scanners in Container handling Ports, increasing the frequency of sea shore and QRT patrolling, following regular mock drill exercises on different contingencies, round the clock boat patrolling in port protected water and deploying high speed security patrol boats in Major Ports. Besides, security clearance is mandatory for bidders participating in dredging and Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects in Major Ports, as per guidelines of Ministry of Shipping. In case of Non-Major Ports, National Security Clearance Guidelines issued by Ministry of Home Affairs are followed.                                               *****
