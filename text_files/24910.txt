JITENDRA SINGH)(a) and (b) Yes Sir, the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) is implementing a scientists farmerspartnership scheme named as Biotech-Krishi Innovation Science Application Network(Biotech-KISAN), which aims to link innovative agricultural technologies with farms to benefitsmall and marginal farmers in all agro-climatic zones of the country including Uttar Pradesh andNorth East Region (NER). The scheme provides funding for the establishment of Biotech-KISAN Hubs in different agro-climatic zones in the country. Under this programme, so far 36Biotech-KISAN Hubs have been established covering all 15 agro-climatic zones in the country.The activities of the programme have been implemented in 170 districts including 112Aspirational Districts and have benefitted over 2,00,000 farmers directly or indirectly.Under the above scheme, four Biotech-KISAN Hubs have been established in the state ofUttar Pradesh, which is helping in understanding the local issues of farmers and providingscientific solutions to them. These Biotech-KISAN Hubs are located at ICAR-National Bureauof Agriculturally Important Microorganisms, Kushmaur; Foundation for Advancement ofAgriculture and Rural Development (FAARD Foundation), Varanasi; Indian Society for Humanand Rural Advancement (ISHARA), Deoria; and Foundation for Agricultural ResourcesManagement and Environmental Remediation (FARMER), Ghaziabad. The activities of Biotech-KISAN Hubs are being implemented in a total of 20 districts including seven AspirationalDistricts of Uttar Pradesh. In the NER, Biotech-KISAN Hubs are located at ICAR ResearchComplex for NEH Region, Umiam, Meghalaya and Assam Agricultural University, Assam.The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has established a network of 725Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) at the district level in the country mandated with technologyassessment and demonstration for its application and capacity development. There are 88 KVKsin Uttar Pradesh and 89 KVKs in North Eastern Region (NER). The KVKs organizedemonstrations, training programs, awareness programs, and skill development programs (forpromoting various modern agricultural technologies for the benefit of farmers, farm women, andrural youth).(c) Yes Sir, the programme makes provision of local hubs to collaborate with scientificinstitutions and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs). Leading scientific institutions such as ICARIndianAgricultural Research Institute, New Delhi; Acharya N.G. Ranga Agricultural University,Guntur, Andhra Pradesh; West Bengal University of Animal & Fishery Sciences, Kolkata; BiharAgricultural University, Sabour; Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences andTechnology (SKUAST), Srinagar; ICAR-National Bureau of Agriculturally ImportantMicroorganisms (ICAR-NBAIM), Uttar Pradesh; Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana;ICAR Research Complex for NEH, Umiam, Meghalaya; ICAR-Central Island AgriculturalResearch Institute (CIARI), Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands; ICAR-Research Complexfor Eastern Region, Patna; Central Rainfed Upland Rice Research Station (ICAR-NRRI),Hazaribag, Jharkhand; ICAR-National Institute of Biotic Stress Management, Raipur; RegionalRainfed Lowland Rice Research Station, ICAR-National Rice Research Institute, CuttackOdisha; Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology, Odisha; Indira Gandhi KrishiVishwavidyalaya (IGKV), Krishak Nagar, Raipur, Chhattisgarh; Dr. Rajendra Prasad CentralAgricultural University (RPCAU), Muzaffarpur. Bihar along with 60 Krishi Vigyan Kendras(KVKs) located in 21 states / UTs are associated with the programme.(d) The main aim of launching the Mission Programme on Biotech-KISAN is to connectscience laboratories with the farmers to find out innovative solutions and technologies to bedeveloped and applied at the farm level. The programme aims to work with small and marginalfarmers especially the woman farmers for better agriculture productivity through scientificintervention and evolving best farming practices by linking available science and technology tothe farm by first understanding the problem of the local farmer and providing solutions to thoseproblems. The significant achievements of the programme since its inception include: revival ofgrass pea cultivation and its popularization amongst farmers of Bihar, utilization of rice fallowsfor enhancing pulse production in North Coastal Andhra Pradesh, empowerment of womenfarmers through scientific goat and sheep rearing in Sundarbans, promotion and popularizationof good agricultural practices (GAPs) for seed spice cultivation amongst farmers of WesternRajasthan for getting a premium price for agriculture produce, scientific pig rearing forlivelihood improvement of tribal farmers of Meghalaya, production of quality planting material(QPM) of Malbhog variety of banana and its cultivation in Assam, promotion of conservationagriculture practices in rice-wheat and soybean-wheat cropping system in the state of MadhyaPradesh, etc.(e) The DBT has also taken steps to use Biotech-KISAN Hubs as test beds for testing,validating, and demonstrating various innovative technologies at the farmers’ level, which aredeveloped by various organizations. The programme also provides support for conductingtraining programmes for farmers in laboratories of scientific research institutions and immersionof scientists in agriculture farms to better understand the problems of farmers at ground level andfind solutions for the same. Recently, a project on the popularization of bio-fortified maizehybrids (rich in important amino acids and pro-vitamin A) among farming communities has beeninitiated in Himalayan states and Central India with special reference to North Eastern Regionfor sustainable nutritional security.********
