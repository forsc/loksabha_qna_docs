MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D. V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a):	Yes, Sir. National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), vide order SO 1041(E) dated 27th February, 2019 put a cap on Trade Margin of 42 select non-scheduled anti-cancer medicines under ‘Trade Margin Rationalisation’ Approach.By this approach the MRP of 526 brands of these medicines have shown reduction upto 90%. This move will result in an annual savings of around Rs. 984 crore to the patients.(b) & (c):	The National Policy for Treatment of Rare Diseases, 2017 was formulated by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. However, owing to implementation challenges, it has been decided to reframe the policy and pending reframing of the policy, the National Policy for Treatment of Rare Diseases, 2017 has been kept in abeyance. An Expert Committee under the chairmanship of Director General of Health Services (DGHS) has been constituted to review the National Policy for Treatment of Rare Diseases, 2017.*******
