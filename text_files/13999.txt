ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a): Yes. (b): Coal Mining operations have some adverse impact on environment in terms of change in land use pattern, dust, air, water and noise pollution. However, it is mandatory to get the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) approved by the competent authority before commencing the mining operations.A detailed environment impact assessment is carried out considering pre and post mining operations for preparing EMPs and Environment Clearance (EC) is granted by the MoEF&CC. While granting EC, MoEF&CC lays down certain conditions/ mitigation measures for implementing the EMPs which have to be complied with by the project proponents during mining.(c)&(d):Various measures are being taken as per approved Environment Management Plan (EMP). In general, one or combination of followings prescribed measures are being taken based on EIA/EMP.: Air Pollution control measures:•	The dust is controlled by installation of fixed sprinklers at CHPs, coal stock yards, weighbridges and along transportation roads. •	The mist type water spraying system have also been installed along the conveyor belts / Bunkers in major coal handling plants. The sides of CHPs are also covered by side cladding with GI Sheet to control pollution at source.•	Effective dust suppression through water through water sprinkling by mobile water tankers along the coal transportation roads and haul roads. •	Use of drills fitted with wet drilling and dust extractors in order to control generation of dust.•	Spillage of Coal from trucks on road is being controlled by covering of trucks, improving haul roads, dry sweeping of roads and water sprinkling.•	As far as possible, coal is being transported by conveyors / rails /tube conveyors to minimise generation of dust by reducing road transportation.•	The quality of ambient air in and around the mine is monitored every fortnight as per Environment (Protection) Amendment Rules, 2018 Water pollution Control measures:•	Garland drains are provided around the mine to collect run off water and siltation ponds are made for collection of silt.•	The Effluent from the mines is treated in settling tank before discharging in natural course. •	Oil & grease traps are installed and operated in workshop to separate & collect oil & grease from workshop effluent.•	Effluent treatment plants (ETP) are installed and operated efficiently for treatment of workshop effluent & CHP effluent.•	Sewage treatment plant (STP) is installed and operated for treatment of large domestic sewage.•	The quality of the final effluent is monitored in terms of the relevant Indian standards, before it is discharged to natural drainage or in open land.•	Action is taken towards the conservation of water resource by means of ground water recharge and rainwater harvesting.  Noise pollution Control measures:•	Periodic and condition based maintenance of equipment/HEMMs.•	Green belt provided around the mine as well as residential area;•	Controlled Blasting in opencast mines•	Adoption of blasting free technology of Surface Miner.•	Ear Muff or Ear Plugs provided to Workers at highly noisy areas; Tree plantation: •	Plantation on OB Dumps is done to minimize soil erosion;•	Tree Plantation is done around the source of air pollution like mine, infrastructure and roads to reduce air pollution;•	Green belt has been provided around the mine as well as residential colony for noise attenuation. MonitoringTo make environmental mitigation measures more transparent, Coal companies has introduced state-of-the-art Satellite Surveillance to monitor land reclamation and restoration for all opencast projects. The land reclamation and rehabilitation operations are being monitored by Satellite Surveillance. (e)&(f): The MMDR Amendment act, 2015 introduced the concept of DMF (District mineral fund), which is deposited @ 30 % of Royalty. This fund is utilized by the State for development of local community residing nearby. DMF has helped bring about changes to local communities with access to better water, sanitation and healthcare. Coal companies undertake CSR activities in the areas specified under Schedule VII of Companies Act 2013 such as healthcare, water supply, education etc. Primary beneficiaries of these activities are the people residing in and around the mining areas. These activities help in improving the standard of living of the local residents and also provide them with income generation opportunities.  ******
