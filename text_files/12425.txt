The Finance (No.2) Act, 2019 has also inserted section 271DB in the Act which provides for a levy of penalty of five thousand rupees per day in case of failure by a specified person to comply with the provisions of section 269SU.  However, the penalty will be levied w.e.f. 1st February 2020 if the specified person fails to install and operationalize the facilities on or before 31.01.2020.
