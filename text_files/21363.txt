ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) to (c)	BharatNet project is being implemented in a phased manner to create network to connect all the Gram Panchayats (approximately 2.5 lakh) with broadband in the country, including Tamil Nadu.In Tamil Nadu State, all the 12524 (approx.) Gram Panchayats are being implemented under State-led model of the BharatNet project by the State Government.The first tender for implementation of the project was floated in December 2019 by Tamil Nadu FiberNet Corporation Limited (TANFINET), the State Implementing Agency (SIA) for the implementation of BharatNet project in the State. Some complaints about restrictive and discriminatory clauses in this tender were received. It was considered after deliberations in the “Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade”, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, that the bidding conditions, incorporated by TANFINET in the bidding documents, were restrictive and discriminatory in nature. Accordingly, Tamil Nadu Government was asked to re-invite the bids with non-restrictive qualification criteria. The tender was re-floated in October 2020 by TANFINET for implementation of the project through 4 Packages A, B, C and D. Karur District is part of Package C. Letter of Acceptance (LoA) has been issued to the successful bidders of the respective packages namely, A, B, C and D on 26.02.2021. Subsequently, in the Writ Petition No. 18302 of 2020, the Hon’ble High court of Madras in its judgment on 02.03.2021 has issued directions to consider the bid submitted by Petitioner for package B for further evaluation on merits and in accordance with law. Accordingly, the finalisation of BharatNet tender for packages A, C and D is clear and as regards package B, the Tamil Nadu State is examining the legal options on the way forward. The timeline for project completion is 360 days from the date of issuance of Award of Work.
