ANSWER




ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) to (d):    Most of the activities under the Poshan programme are community based events which were impacted by restrictions placed due to Covid-19 pandemic.  Restrictions placed on movement on goods, services and manpower affected the roll out of components like capacity building, training,  organization of CBEs, etc.      Though no formal study on the subject has been conducted, Government has engaged with States/UTs through sustained reviews to ensure that targets are achieved and funds are utilized and to assess the progress made . Based on these engagements, steps have been taken to ensure nutritional quality, strengthen delivery mechanisms, introduce transparency and leverage technology for improving governance.  *****
