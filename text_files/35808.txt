The major improvements made include making the scheme voluntary for all farmers, compulsory use of atleast 0.5% of the gross premium collected by insurance companies for Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities; penalty provision for delay in settlement of claims by insurance companies & late release of share by States; intensive use of technology,   change in financial sharing pattern from 50 : 50 between Central and State Government in NER to 90 : 10; long term i.e. 3 year contract to insurance companies; freedom to States to choose risk cover as per requirements; use of technology etc. (c):  All the food, oilseeds and commercial/horticultural crops can be notified by the concerned State Government under the scheme subject to availability of past yield data of requisite number of years and capacity of the State Government to conduct requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) at unit area level to know the yield for calculation of claims.  State-wise details of area insured and number of farmer applications enrolled under PMFBY during 2021-22 are annexed.(d) : The Scheme is demand driven and voluntary for States as well as farmers.  Being a Central Sector Scheme, State-wise allocation/release is not made under the PMFBY.  Claims payment as per provisions of the scheme is the responsibility of the concerned insurance companies.
