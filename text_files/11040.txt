                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (a) to (d) As per extant guidelines dated 18.5.2017 on rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy,  Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has granted  general  permission  to domestic  Scheduled  Commercial  Banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks), to  open banking outlets  at  any place  in the country, without  seeking  prior  approval of  RBI  in  each  case, subject  to at least  25 percent  of the total  number  of  banking outlets  opened  during a  financial  year being in  unbanked  rural centres i.e. centres having population less than 10,000 (Tier 5 and Tier 6 centres). Further, ten Small Finance banks and seven Payments Banks have been licensed by RBI for providing banking services across the country including the rural centres. Under Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), all villages were mapped by banks into 1.59 lakh Sub-Service Areas (SSAs) with one SSA catering to 1,000 to 1,500 households. While 0.33 lakh SSAs have been covered with bank branches, 1.26 lakh SSAs, have been covered by deployment of interoperable Business Correspondents (BCs).  Of these, 7723 SSAs are in the state of Gujarat out of which 1859 are covered through bank branches and  5864 are covered through BCs. In pursuance of RBI guidelines, rolling out of banking outlets in uncovered areas is a continuous process and looked after by SLBC, in consultation with the concerned State Government, member banks and other stakeholders. Banks, inter-alia, consider proposals for opening banking outlets in the light of RBI’s instructions, their business plans and their commercial viability. To further assess the viability for opening a banking outlet, banks carry out survey as required.As apprised by RBI, the total number of functioning branches of Commercial Banks (SCBs) in Gujarat are as under: Number of Functioning Branches of Commercial Banks in Gujarat 	Total	Of which in RuralMarch 31,2017	7489	2296March 31,2018	7705	2346March 31,2019	7918	2391Sept. 30,2019	8300	2565  State Level Banker’s Committee (SLBC) Gujarat has apprised that no such incidence of delay in disposing off work of account holders due to excessive crowds in rural bank branches in Gujarat and poor customer service has been reported with the SLBC so far.*****
