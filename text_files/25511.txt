ANSWER




                                                        ANSWER THE MINISTER OF FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(SHRI PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a)	There is no such scheme for Integrated Pig and Fish Farming implemented by Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, FAHD for Integrated Pig and Fish Farming.  b) & (c) There was a successful project on integrated pig fish farming executed at Indian Council of Agricultural Research- National Research Centre (ICAR-NRC) on Pig, Guwahati in collaboration with Indian Council of Agricultural Research- Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute  (ICAR-CIFRI), Regional Office, Guwahati, Assam during 2014-15. This can be adopted and implemented in the Cuddalore District in the State of Tamil Nadu.Basic component of Integrated Pig and Fish Farming are as follows:1.	Pond area: for one hacter (7.5 bigha) pond area one can raise 35-40 adult pigs. 2.	On the bank of the pond one low cost house need to be constructed from where all waste materials will be drained to the pond. 3.	After house construction, pig need to be introduced first. After 10-15 days, fish fingerlings need to be introduced in the pond. Approx. 1 hacter pond area requires, 7500 fish fingerling.4.	While selecting fish fingerling, one should take precaution as different category fish having different feeding habits. 5.	No extra feed require for fish, the phytoplankton and zooplankton develop as a result of pig excreta along with waste feed will serve as fish feed.6.	Water qualities in terms of pH, dissolved oxygen, dissolved CO2, H2S ammonia etc are need to monitored at monthly interval for ensuring desirable fish growth and health.7.	Periodical application of lime (usually in monthly installments) to the pond is need to be done to neutralize soil acidity and stopping organic loading when problems of water quality deteriorate (e.g., Dissolved Oxygen depletion, algal bloom, etc.).8.	Water pH in the range of 6.5 to 9.0 (near neutral to slightly alkaline) is considered optimal for fish culture.9.	DO concentrations of 5 mg/l or more is generally considered as optimal for warm water fish. 10.	A net income of Rs. 35000 to 40000/- per month can be earned from such integration. d.	 There is prospect of such integrated farming for the larger benefit of the backward people and even in the districts. This farming can improve the socio-economic status of weaker rural communities, especially the tribal and backward sections of the society who traditionally raise pigs and can take up fish-pig farming easily.However, the integrated pig fish farming cannot be adopted in all parts of India due to religious taboos but it has special significance in certain areas.
