ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                                   (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)& (b): Yes, Sir. As per Census of India, the slum households in the urban areas of the country has increased from 1,01,50,719 in 2001 to 1,39,20,191 in 2011. National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Government of India conducts periodic surveys on particulars of slums.  The latest survey on Particulars of Slums was conducted by the National StatisticalOffice (NSO) during National Sample Survey (NSS) in its 69th round (July-December 2012). Estimated number of slum households as per NSS 58th round (July-December 2002) and 69th round (July-December 2012) are 82,29,744 and 88,09,007 respectively. (c)	: As per Census 2011, the slum population of India is 6,54,94,604.               NSSO has reported that data on slum population is not    maintained by them. (d)	& (e): ‘Land’ and ‘Colonisation’ are State subjects and therefore, it is the       responsibility of the State/Union Territory (UT) Governments to collect data, frame policies and implement schemes for removal of slums. However, the Government of India through its programmatic intervention has been assisting States/UTs both technically and financially to address their housing shortages. In pursuance to Government of India’s vision of facilitating Housing for All by 2022, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has been implementing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) Mission since June 2015 to provide Central Assistance to States/UTs for providing all weather pucca houses to all eligible urban households including slum dwellers.   “In-situ” Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) component under PMAY-U Mission mandates use of land as a resource for providing houses to slum dwellers. This approach aims to leverage the locked potential of land under slums to provide houses to the eligible slum dwellers by bringing them into the formal urban settlement. The year-wise details of Central Assistance released for rehabilitation of slum dwellers under various urban housing schemes of the MoHUA are at Annexure-I. 	The MoHUA has also been implementing the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM) since September 2013 by restructuring ‘Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana (SJSRY)’ to reduce poverty and vulnerability of urban poor households. The Employment through Skill Training and Placement (EST&P) component of the Mission aims to provide skills to the urban poor including beneficiaries from vulnerable sections of the society to increase their income through structured and market-oriented certified courses that can provide wage employment and/or self-employment opportunities which will eventually lead to better living standards and alleviation of urban poverty on a sustainable basis. The funds are released to States/UTs for implementation of DAY-NULM Mission as a whole and inter-se allocation of funds under various components are made by the State/UT Governments depending upon their requirement and capacity. The year-wise details of funds released to States/UTs under the Mission are at Annexure-II.                                             *****
