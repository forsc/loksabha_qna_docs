ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b) The purpose of education is to bring out a good human being out of the system. Forreal development along with knowledge, Life Skill education, value education, physicaleducation, experiential learning is essential. Creative skills need to be nurtured. It was demandfrom all stakeholders that because of heavy curriculum, there is no time left for all these aspects.Also rote learning is not the way forward. Therefore, School Syllabus must be rationalized. Toachieve this, the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) was advised toundertake an exercise to review its syllabus with a view to reducing the curriculum load on thestudents. Accordingly, NCERT has undertaken review of its textbooks in the year 2018-19 andhas already rationalized contents of its textbooks across the subjects. The revised textbooks areavailable for the year 2019-20.*****
