                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS (SHRI DEVUSINH CHAUHAN)(a) & (b) 	Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) monitors the performance of the Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) including Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) against the benchmarks for various Quality of Service (QoS) parameters laid down by TRAI by way of QoS regulations issued from time to time, through Quarterly Performance Monitoring Reports (PMRs). As per PMR for quarter ending December 2021, BSNL is meeting, in general, most of the QoS parameters for its cellular and basic services in its areas of operation including rural areas. (c)  BSNL augments its network to improve its services based on techno-commercial considerations. Further, in order to strengthen BSNL, the Government approved a revival plan for BSNL on 23.10.2019. The revival plan inter-alia includes measures to reduce the Staff cost through a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) for employees of age 50 years and above, administrative allotment of spectrum for providing 4G services with funding through budgetary allocation, monetisation of non-core and core assets to generate resources to retire debt, meet CAPEX and other requirement and debt restructuring by raising of Sovereign Guarantee Bonds.
