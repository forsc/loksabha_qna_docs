                                                                                       THE MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES & PUBLIC ENTERPRISES                                            (SHRI ARVIND GANPAT SAWANT)(a) & (b): Based on outcome and experience gained during the Phase-I of Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) Scheme and after having consultations with all stakeholders including Industry and Industry Associations, Department of Heavy Industry finalized and accordingly notified the Phase-II of FAME India Scheme on 8th March 2019, which is for a period of three years commencing from 1st April, 2019 with a total budgetary support of Rs. 10,000 crore. This phase will mainly focus on supporting electrification of public & shared transportation, and aims to support through subsidies 7000 e-Buses, 5 lakh e-3 Wheelers, 55000 e-4 Wheeler Passenger Cars and 10 lakh e-2 Wheelers. In addition, creation of charging infrastructure will be supported in selected cities and along major highways to address range anxiety among users of electric vehicles.(c) & (d):Yes Sir, length based classification of vehicles is applicable to decide GST on vehicles. Lower GST is applicable to smaller vehicles and higher GST rate is applicable to larger vehicles with a view to reduction in vehicular congestion.	Similarly, through CAFÉ norms, CO2 emission is being regulated through which companies are being directed to reduce CO2 emissions on each model manufactured by them, to align with overall vision of Government in reduction of Green House gas emissions.                                                       *****
