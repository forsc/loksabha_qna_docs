On receipt of memorandum from the State for any notified natural disaster, an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) is constituted and deputed for an on-the-spot assessment of damage and requirement of funds for relief operations, as per the extant items and norms.  The report of the IMCT is considered by the Sub Committee of National Executive Committee (SC-NEC).

The State Governments undertake assessment of damages and provide   financial   relief   in   the   wake   of   12 notified natural disasters, from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) already placed at their disposal. Additional financial assistance is extended from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) as per the established procedure in case of disaster of severe nature. No specific proposal for seeking assistance for damage to paddy crops during 2020-21 has been received in MHA.
