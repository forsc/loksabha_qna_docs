ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND PENSIONS AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a) to (c):    It is stated that in accordance with provisions of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972, pension of a pensioner retired from Central Government civil service can be withheld or withdrawn either in full or in part, in cases where the pensioner is found guilty of a grave misconduct or negligence during service in any departmental or judicial proceedings or is convicted of a serious crime or found guilty of a grave misconduct after retirement.Action to sanction pension/family pension is taken by the concerned Ministry/Department/Office in which the Government servant was working before retirement/death. The Department of Pension & Pensioners’ Welfare has developed and introduced an online pension sanctioning and tracking system called ‘Bhavishya’ which facilitates processing of pension cases with speed and accuracy and also ensures increased transparency and accountability in  the process. Timelines have been prescribed in the rules for each activity involved in the processing of a pension case. The rules also provide for sanction of provisional pension in cases where, on account of administrative reasons, a Government servant is likely to retire before finalization of his pension and gratuity.Instructions have been issued by Department of Pension & Pensioners’ Welfare from time to time for timely payment of pension, family pension and other pensionary benefits on retirement or death of a Government servant. In the Office Memorandum dated 9th March, 2021, Department of Pension & Pensioners’ Welfare has issued further instructions for regular monitoring of the progress of the pension cases by the Heads of the organizations/ Departments and by Secretaries of the administrative Ministries/Departments.*****
