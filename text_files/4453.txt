As per the information available on LIMBS portal, details of cases involving Ministries / Departments etc. pending in various courts are given below:Court	Number of cases pending.Supreme Court	13,260High Courts	1,30,031District / Subordinate Courts / Tribunals / Forums etc.	2,58,965Total	4,02,256(b) & (c): The Ministry of Law & Justice has suggested to various Government Departments and Organisations and other related bodies to explore options for settlement of their disputes through alternate methods, like mediation, arbitration, conciliation, etc. either online or otherwise.  For the purpose, the Government has made available information about Agencies / Institutions / Organisations working in the field of such alternate methods of dispute resolution on the website of the Department of Justice to provide information about them to the users.  The relevant Government Ministries were requested in April, 2017 to take necessary action for reducing number of court cases in which Government is a party.  It was followed by a series of meetings held with various Ministries and Departments in the months of June and August 2017 requesting them to review their pending cases with a view to reduce number of litigation and to consider contempt cases in particular so as to weed out vexatious and unnecessary litigation pending in courts.
