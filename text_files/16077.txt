                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (c) In the recent past, no complaint regarding the exploitation of Anganwadi Workers and Anganwadi Helpers has been received in the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD). Further, as Anganwadi Services [under Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme] is a Centrally sponsored Scheme and the administration, management and monitoring regarding implementation of Anganwadi Services is done by the State Governments/UT Administrations, the issue of irregularities and mal-practices fall within the purview of the concerned State Government/UT Administration. Accordingly, if any complaint is received regarding the exploitation of Anganwadi Workers and Helpers, the same is forwarded to the concerned State/UT for examination of the issue in the light of extant rules/regulations/guidelines of Anganwadi Services and thereby taking appropriate action under intimation to the MWCD. *****
