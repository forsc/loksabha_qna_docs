ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a) & (b):	Record of various cases in High Courts, District & Subordinate Courts is maintained on the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG). NJDG, however, does not maintain any separate category of land dispute cases in the rural areas.  Moreover, land and its management is the responsibility of the respective State Governments and figures in List II – State List under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.  Department of Land Resources, under the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India is, however, implementing the “Digital India Land Records Modernization Programme”  that, inter alia, provides for digitization of Records of Right, cadastral maps, computerization of registration and integration of registration with the revenue offices, ultimately resulting in minimization of land disputes, to some extent. Further, State Governments and High Courts have been requested to enable linking of land records with eCourts project. The Department of Land Resources has also taken up a project on pilot basis in the States of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra to integrate land records information with Case Information System (CIS) of eCourts project. ****
