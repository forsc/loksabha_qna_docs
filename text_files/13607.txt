                                                    (a)	 whether many National Highways (NHs) projects across the country are facing time and cost overrun;(b)	  if so, the details thereof, State and project-wise; and (c)	the remedial steps taken/being taken by the Government to expedite completion of these projects?






ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a)	to (c) State-wise details of the National Highway projects facing time-overrun are at Annexure-I. Delay in completion leads to cost overrun in some projects. These projects are delayed mainly due to land acquisition, utility shifting, non-availability of soil/aggregate, poor performance of contractors, environment/forest/wildlife clearances, ROB & RUB issues with Railways, public agitation for additional facilities, arbitration/contractual disputes with contractors etc. To fast-track these projects, various steps such as streamlining of land acquisition &environment clearances, premium re-scheduling, close coordination with other Ministries, revamping of dispute resolution mechanism, frequent review meetings with project developers, State Government and contractors at various levels etc. have been taken up.
