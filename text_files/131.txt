ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER FOR MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND MINISTRY OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a)	No Sir. Considering the rainfall data for the period from 1901 to 2017, it is found that the average rainfall of the country has not shown any significant decrease. Also it is found that All India South-West Monsoon Seasonal rainfall has not shown any significant increasing or decreasing trend. However, from the analysis of the past data of more than 100 years it has been reported that All India rainfall has multi decadal/epochal variability and currently it is in the dry epoch.(b)	India Meteorological Department (IMD) under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) implements an operational Agromet Advisory Service (AAS) scheme, viz., Gramin Krishi Mausam Sewa (GKMS) for the benefit of farming community in the country. Under GKMS scheme, quantitative district level weather forecasts including rainfall for the next five days for all the districts are generated. Based on the weather forecast, Agromet Advisories are prepared in collaboration with 130 Agromet Field Units (AMFUs) located in the State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), ICAR Institutes, IITs etc. and communicated to the farming community through multimedia channels like All India Radio, Doordarshan, print and electronic media, websites of IMD and AMFUs and also through SMS using mobile phones. Around 42 million farmers receive information on weather and Agromet Advisories through SMS directly.(c)	Studies on the impact of rainfall variation and its consequences may be available with Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), ICAR, Hyderabad. Based on such studies, CRIDA has come out with district level contingency plans based on rainfall deviations for adoption by the farmers. In addition, CRIDA also implements ‘National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA)’ to address such issues with mitigation measures through advisories to the farmers.
