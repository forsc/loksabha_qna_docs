                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI).....2/--2-(a): 	Yes, Sir. Surplus stocks of wheat and rice from States are moved to deficit States to meet requirements under National Food Security Act, 2013 by Food Corporation of India (FCI). The details of food grain stocks of wheat and rice moved from surplus States to deficit States are annexed at Annexure-A. The criteria for preparation of movement plan are as under:-i.	Quantity available in surplus regions;ii.	Quantity required by deficit regions;iii.	Likely procurement;iv.	Vacant storage capacity both in consuming as well as procuring regions; andv.	Monthly allotment/ off take of foodgrains. (b): 	The monthly movement plan is prepared by FCI keeping in view the criteria given above and enables FCI to gainfully utilise the available storage capacity throughout the year, which is a dynamic process rather than a static one. (c): 	Details of average percentage of achievement in loading of food grains in the country during lean season and busy season are annexed at Annexure-B.(d): 	Details of demand made by FCI and rakes made available by Railways are annexed at Annexure-B.(e): 	No, Sir. However, FCI has moved more rakes during lean season months when Dynamic Pricing Policy was applicable. Busy Season Charge for food grains levied under this policy earlier by Railways during busy season months has been withdrawn with effect from 01.10.2019.  *** Annexure AANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.2522 FOR ANSWER ON 03.08.2021 IN THE LOK SABHA.DESPATCHES OF WHEAT FROM SURPLUS STATE	(Fig. in 000 tonnes)Ex-States	2018-19 	2019-20	2020-21 	Desp.
