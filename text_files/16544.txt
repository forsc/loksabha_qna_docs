Hence, any action against erring police officials has to be taken by the respective State Governments. As reported by NHRC, it did not make any recommendation for action against the erring police personnel. It has, however, recommended  monetary relief to the tune of Rs. 4.44 crore in cases of custodial deaths and Rs. 88 lakh in cases of encounter deaths. (e)   Ministry of Home Affairs has issued an advisory on 13.07.2020 to all the State Governments/ UT Administrations requesting them to sensitize and direct all the functionaries at State, district and below level to follow and adhere to law of the land and the guidelines issued by NHRC on custodial deaths, and to act firmly against any abuse of law in respect of Custodial Deaths. Moreover, Members, Special Rapporteurs and senior officers from NHRC carry out periodical  visits  to  various  jails  to   evaluate  the  living  conditions   and  make recommendations for better protection of human rights. During various Camp Sittings, Open Hearings, Workshops and Seminars, NHRC makes efforts to sensitize public servants in this regard.
