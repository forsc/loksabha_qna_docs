However, the detailed list of overcharging cases where demand notices have been issued is available on the NPPA’s website www.nppaindia.nic.in. (c):	Yes, Sir.(d):	Since inception of the NPPA till June 2019, 2038 demand notices have been issued to pharmaceutical companies for overcharging consumers for medicines at prices above the ceiling price notified by the NPPA. The demand notices have been issued for a total amount of Rs. 6370.20 crore.  An amount of Rs. 893.34 crore has been recovered from the pharmaceutical companies. An amount of Rs. 4032.55 crore is under litigation in various courts. The detailed list of overcharging cases where demand notices have been issued is available on the NPPA’s website www.nppaindia.nic.in. *******
