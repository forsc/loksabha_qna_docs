Total length of these Projects is 1014.77 Km, costing  10146.48 crore, out of which, 394.55 km length has been commissioned and expenditure of  2622.42 crore has been incurred up to March, 2019.   The status of all ongoing works including allotment of funds and expenditure on each project is appended.

(e)	Bhiwani-Loharu and Delhi-Sohna-Nuh-Firozpur Jhirka-Alwar new line projects  have been taken up by Haryana Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation (HRIDC),  Joint Venture (JV)  Company of Government of Haryana and Ministry of Railways,  for feasibility study.
