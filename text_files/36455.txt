ANSWER




                                                        The MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a) & (b): The details of existing vacancies in Supreme Court of India & High Courts and District & Subordinate Courts is at Annexure-I and Annexure-II respectively.As per the Memorandum of Procedure, for the appointment of Judges of High Courts, the Chief Justice of the High Court is required to initiate the proposals in consultation with two senior-most Judges from amongst the eligible candidates from the Bar and concerned State Judicial Service six months prior to the occurrence of vacancies.Filling up of vacancies in the High Courts is a continuous, integrated and collaborative process between the Executive and the Judiciary. It requires consultation and approval from various Constitutional Authorities both at the State and Centre level. Every effort is made to expedite the process of appointment of Judges following the due procedure. 	Under Article 235 of the Constitution of India, the administrative control over the members of district and subordinate judiciary in the States vest with the concerned High Court. Further, in exercise of powers conferred under proviso to Article 309 read with Articles 233 and 234 of the constitution, the respective State Government, in consultation with the High Court, frames the Rules and Regulations regarding the issue of appointment, promotion, reservations and retirement of Judicial Officers in the State Judicial Service.  Hence, in so far as recruitment of judicial officers in the States is concerned, respective High Courts do it in certain States, whereas the High Courts do it in consultation with the State Public Service Commissions in other States. The Union Government does not have a role under the Constitution in the selection and appointment of judicial officers in District/ subordinate judiciary. The Supreme Court, in its orders of 04th January, 2007 in Malik Mazhar case, has devised a process and time frame to be followed for the filling up of vacancies in subordinate judiciary which stipulates that the process for recruitment of judges in the subordinate courts would commence on 31st March of a calendar year and end by 31st October of the same year. The Supreme Court has permitted State Governments / High Courts for variations in the time schedule in case of any difficulty based on the peculiar geographical and climatic conditions in the State or other relevant conditions.  	Further, in compliance of the above directions of the Supreme Court, Department of Justice forwarded a copy of the Malik Mazhar judgement to Registrars General of all High Courts for necessary action. Department of Justice is writing from time to time to Registrars General of all High Courts to expedite the filling up of vacancies in subordinate judiciary mandated by Malik Mazhar case. (c):	The number of cases pending in Supreme Court of India, High Courts and District & Subordinate Courts in the country is as under:-Sl. No. 	 Name of Court	Pendency as on 1	Supreme Court of India	70,154   (02.03.2022)*2	High Courts	 58,94,060 (21.03.2022)**3	District & Subordinate Courts	4,10,47,976 (21.03.2022)**Source *Website of Supreme Court of India.**National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG).	Disposal of cases pending in various courts is within the domain of judiciary.  Timely disposal of cases in courts depends on several factors which, inter-alia, include availability of adequate number of judges and judicial officers, supporting court staff and physical infrastructure, complexity of facts involved, nature of evidence, co-operation of stake holders viz. bar, investigation agencies, witnesses and litigants and proper application of rules and procedures.  There are several factors which may lead to delay in disposal of cases.  These, inter alia, include vacancies of judges, frequent adjournments and lack of adequate arrangement to monitor, track and bunch cases for hearing.****** Annexure-ISTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO  PARTS (A) & (B) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. †3898 FOR ANSWER ON 25.03.2022 REGARDING  SHORTAGE OF JUDGES IN COURTStatement showing sanctioned strength, working strength of the judges in the Supreme Court and High Court as on 14.03.2022 	 	Sanctioned strength	Working strength	VacanciesA.
