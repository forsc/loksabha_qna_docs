                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) to (d) It was informed by CBI on the basis of input received from INTERPOL that in Cambodia, in March 2020, an inter-agency team seized illicit methanol from a warehouse located at Phnom Penh. The methanol was used for counterfeiting hand sanitizers, due to the high demand caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.  In the Phillippines, in the areas of Quezon and Laguna, during 2018 and end of 2019, several persons counterfeited (preparing, mixing, blending, brewing, distributing to local stores) an indigenous traditional beverage called “Lambanog” (coconut wine), using methanol, which resulted in 34 deaths.  In Iran, in several regions, during March 2020, based on the false perception that alcohol consumption would prevent and protect against COVID-19, more than 3000 persons were harmed by consuming counterfeit alcohol containing methanol, of which at least 320 lost their lives. The input received has been brought to knowledge of all the State/UT DGPs/IGPs and all Interpol Liaison Officers on 05.06.2020 by the CBI.****
