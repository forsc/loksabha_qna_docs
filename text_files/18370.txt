(a)        The National Super-computing Mission (NSM), is jointly steered and implemented by Department of Science and Technology (DST) and M/o Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) with Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC, Pune) and Indian Institute of Science (IISc-Bengaluru) as the implementing partner. The main objectives of the mission include:  1.         Creation of state-of-the-art High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities and infrastructure to enhance the national capability to enable cutting-edge research in various domains in solving grand challenge problems.2.         Development of HPC Applications for major Science and Engineering domains.3.         Promote Research and Development in HPC leading to next generation Exa-scale computing readiness.4.         Human Resource Development to handle and spearhead HPC activities in the country. Under NSM, Government is building Multiple Super-computing Systems of various capacities ranging from 650 Teraflops to 3000 Teraflops or 3 Petaflops to 25000 Teraflops or 25 Petaflops at various academic and research institutes across the country in a phased manner.  The achievements made with regard to developing super computers are as follows: I        The first four systems from the six systems approved under Phase-I that are already installed and made operational include systems at:•	Indian Institute of Technology at Varanasi •	Indian Institute of Technology at Kharagpur•	Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) at Pune.•	Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR)-Bengaluru. The two systems from Phase – I, which are under operationalization are installed at•	Indian Institute of Technology – Hyderabad.•	Indian Institute of Technology – Kanpur. II        Under Phase-II, eleven Supercomputing systems, all manufactured in India, are under assembly and  installation at various academic and research institutions.III         Under Build Approach, R&D C-DAC is designing and developing super-computing subsystems indigenously. Phase-III systems are designed and manufactured in India.(b)        Applications development has been undertaken in multiple domains in consortium mode involving various academic and research organisations. There are no collaborations with non-governmental agencies for applications.(c)            Yes Sir. HPC aware human resource development is a key deliverable of this mission. For this, a framework for running short term, medium term and formal education courses has been worked out, in consultation with D/o Higher Education. This includes design of the course curriculum for running courses at under graduate, post graduate and post graduate diploma levels. Multiple faculty development programs, HPC awareness workshops, training programs for application developers, with or without domain expertise, and Hackathons have been conducted to train the faculties and students in various institutions across the country. So far, about 2500 participants have been trained. More such training programs are envisaged for the future, including online training program to overcome the pandemic situation. *****
