ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Yes, All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on fruits sanctioned by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is already in operation at Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, Pusa, Bihar conducting researches on banana cultivation.(b)	Research on banana under this AICRP has resulted in increase in the area of banana cultivation and production in Bihar.  Presently Bihar rank ninth position in area-wise cultivation and seventh position in the field of productivity of banana at all India basis.(c)	Banana Research Centre at Goraul in Vaishali district was working earlier under erstwhile Rajendra Agricultural University at Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Vaishali.  Presently, this centre has started functioning at Goraul, Vaishali from April, 2019.  A sophisticated Banana Tissue Culture Laboratory with capacity of 8 lakhs tissue culture plantlets per year has started functioning.  The mandate is to provide Tissue Culture disease free plantlets of local varieties of banana like Malbhog, Alpan, Chinea, Kothia and others to the farmers.(d)	Yes, productivity of banana in Bihar is comparatively lower than Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu because, farmers in Bihar still use conventional banana suckers as planting material.  Further in other states, G9 variety of banana is cultivated which gives more yield while in Bihar farmers prefer local varieties.  The Technology for Panama wilt disease has been developed and released by this University as well as AICRP Fruits.*******
