                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS &  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (e) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.   STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) To (e) OF STARRED QUESTION NO.102  BY SHRI RAM MOHAN NAIDU KINJARAPU TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 09.02.2022 REGARDING KOTIPALLI-NARSAPUR RAILWAY LINE(a) to (e) Kotipalli-Narsapur (57.21 km) new line Project was sanctioned in Budget 2000-01. Project is on cost sharing basis with Government of Andhra Pradesh. Government of Andhra Pradesh is sharing 25% cost of the project. Sanctioned cost of the project is ?2120 crore, So far an expenditure of ?1048 crore has been incurred and an outlay of ?120 crore {(Gross Budgetary Support (GBS)} has been provided for the project for Financial Year 2021-22. Project involves acquisition of 369  hectare land, out of which 163 hectare land has been acquired. Works on three important bridges have been taken up. So far Government of Andhra Pradesh has deposited only ?2.69 crore towards their share in project, an amount of ?357.96 crore is outstanding from Government of Andhra Pradesh towards their share in project. Government of Andhra Pradesh has stopped releasing their cost shares fund for all cost sharing projects including Kotipalli-Narsapur new line in Andhra Pradesh. Works on Kotipalli-Narsapur new line project is held up on this account.Completion of a Railway project(s) depends on various factors like expeditious land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, timely deposition of cost share by cost sharing authorities, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project(s) site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions etc. and all these factors affect the completion time and cost of the project(s), which is finally worked out at the completion stage. Nevertheless, every effort is being made to execute the project(s) expeditiously.Railway is regularly following up with Government of Andhra Pradesh for depositing their share in the project.                                                                                                                                                                                     Since 2014, there has been substantial increase in budget allocation and commensurate commissioning of infrastructure projects. Average annual budget allocation for infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/partly in the State of Andhra Pradesh, during 2014-19 has increased to ?2830 crore  per year from ?886 crore per year during 2009-14. Thus, an increase of 219% over the average annual budget allocation of 2009-14. Budget outlay for these projects has been increased to ?3885 crore in 2019-20 (338% more than average annual budget outlay during 2009-14) and ?4910 crore in 2020-21 (454% more than average annual budget  outlay during 2009-14). For financial year 2021-22, highest ever budget outlay of ?6223 crore has been provided for these projects, which is 602% more than average annual outlay during 2009-14.During 2014-21, 731 Km sections (319 km New line and 412 km Doubling) falling fully/partly in the State of Andhra Pradesh have been commissioned at an average rate 104.43 km per year, which is 44% more than average annual commissioning during 2009-14( 72.6 Km/Yr.)*****
