It is a fact that Foot and Mouth Disease and Brucellosis significantly diminish milk production. b) 	A number of research literature, published in different journals (details of which are given in Annexure A) have mentioned about the losses of milk yield due to FMD. Similarly, with respect to Brucellosis, there is also lowered milk production to the tune of approximately 10% of the total lactation yield in Brucella positive cattle and buffaloes.

More, recently the National Animal Disease Control Programme for Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis has been approved by the Cabinet on 31.05.2019 as a new Central Sector Scheme for a total outlay of Rs.13,343.00 crore for five years (2019-24). An amount of Rs.2683.00 crore is proposed for the financial year 2019-20. It has the following components:Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) Control Programme: The programme envisages 100% vaccination of cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats and pigs at six monthly intervals in the entire country. Further, animals will be identified using unique animal identification ear tags. The programme also includes de-worming of targeted population of livestock twice a year as one of its activities.Brucellosis Control Programme: The programme envisages 100% vaccination coverage of female cattle and buffalo calves (4-8 months age) once in a life time. The proposal envisages complete control of FMD and Brucellosis in cattle and buffalos by 2025 with vaccination and subsequent eradication by 2030.
