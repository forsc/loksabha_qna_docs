ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c)	Under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is implementing a flagship scheme called Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) 2016-20 with an objective to provide skilling to one crore youth under Short Term Training (STT) courses and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) across the country. STT is being imparted to either school/college dropouts or unemployed youth at accredited and affiliated Training Centres (TCs). Upon successful completion of their assessment, candidates are being offered / provided with placement assistance by Training Providers (TPs). Under RPL, individuals with prior learning experience or skills are being assessed and certified. It aims to align the competencies of the unregulated workforce of the country to the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF). As on 11.11.2019, 69.03 lakh (appx.) (38.01 lakh STT + 31.02 lakh RPL) candidates have been trained under the scheme in the country. Under STT, as per data reported on SDMS (Skill Development Management System), as on 11.11.2019, 30.21 lakh candidates are certified. Out of these candidates, 15.4 lakh candidates have been reported to be placed in various sectors across the country. The State/UT-wise details are given at Annexure.(d)	Under PMKVY 2016-2020, training centres facilitate placements of certified candidates through multiple initiatives like Rojgaar Mela, collaboration with industries and Sector Skill Council. In addition candidates can also avail benefit of placement through ‘Yuva Sampark’ portal which brings both candidate and potential employer on IT platform to find potential match between two (employer and candidate). For improving the quality of trainers ‘Training of Trainers programme’  (a self-paid programme) is being implemented by Sector Skill Councils and facilitated through NSDC in short-term skill development eco-system. Till date, 25600 Trainer certifications have been issued across 38 sectors. Currently, the trainers who undergo Training of Trainers programme are engaged by the training providers, as most short-term skill development schemes have made certification of trainers as a mandatory requirement for providing training in the concerned category. AnnexureThe State-wise details of candidates enrolled, trained, assessed, certified and reported placed under PMKVY 2016-20, as on 11.11.2019, is given below:S.
