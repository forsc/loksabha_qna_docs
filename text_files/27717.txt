PMKVY has two training components, namely, Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). Under PMKVY-STT, candidates are being trained in short duration courses through empanelled training centres (TCs) across the country, including the State of Gujarat. The empanelment of TCs is being done online through Skill India Portal (SIP) combined with a third party inspection. Under PMKVY-RPL component, individuals with prior learning experience or skills are assessed and certified through orientation or bridge courses. Also, MSDE promotes establishment of model and aspirational skill centres known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) in every district for imparting skill training throughout the country, including the State of Gujarat, in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. Under PMKVY-STT, since inception, 735 TCs (249 under PMKVY 1.0, 423 under PMKVY 2.0 and 63 under PMKVY 3.0) have been empanelled, as on 10.07.2021, in the State of Gujarat.

In addition to above short-term training, Directorate General of Training (DGT) under MSDE is implementing long duration vocational courses through Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) which offer range of one or two years’ vocational /skill training courses. At present, 506 ITIs are there in the State of Gujarat.(b)       The Ministry through National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) provides funding support upto Rs. 70 lakh to training provider (TP) for setting up of PMKK. As on 10.07.2021, Rs. 243.02 crore have been disbursed by the NSDC for the establishment of PMKKs across the country, including the State of Gujarat. 	In long-term skilling, DGT has disbursed Rs. 103.76 crore under Upgradation of existing Government ITIs into Model ITIs scheme to the States including 3.18 crore to the State of Gujarat.
