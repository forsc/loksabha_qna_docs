                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) to (e):  A Statement showing Sanctioned strength, Working Strength and Vacancies of Judges and total number of Judges appointed during  2016 to 2019 ( till 20.11.2019)  in the Supreme Court of India and the High Courts is at Annexure.                              As per the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), initiation of proposal for appointment of Judges in the Supreme Court vests with the Chief Justice of India, while initiation of proposals for appointment of Judges in the High Courts vests with the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court who may initiate the proposal for appointment of a Judge in the High Court at least six months prior to the occurrence of vacancies. However, this timeline is rarely adhered to.  Filling up of vacancies in the Supreme Court and the High courts is a continuous, integrated and collaborative process, between the Executive and the Judiciary. It requires consultation and approval from various Constitutional Authorities. Hence, time frame  to appoint  Judges cannot be indicated. While every effort is made to fill up the existing vacancies expeditiously, vacancies in High Courts do keep on arising on account of retirement, resignation or elevation of Judges and increase in Judge Strength.  As per the Constitutional framework, the selection and appointment of Judges in subordinate Courts is the responsibility of the concerned High Courts and State Governments.******AnnexureStatement referred to in reply to parts (a) to (e)  in Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 1416 to be answered on 27.11.2019 regarding ‘Vacant posts in Courts’.
