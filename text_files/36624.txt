ANSWER




                                                              MINISTER OF STATE					(SHRI AJAY BHATT)      IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE(a) to (d):  As per Annual Report 2018-19, against the total enrolled strength of 13,29,202  cadets, Girl Cadets were 4,23,464  constituting 31.8 % of the total enrolled cadets.  To encourage enrolment of girl cadets in NCC, ‘Mixed Unit” Concept was introduced in the year 2005. Before that, NCC had only Boys unit and Girls unit. Now NCC units are either Girls unit which allows girls only or Mixed units which enrolls both Boys and Girls. There is no ‘Boys Only’ unit.While raising new NCC units, there have been conscious efforts to raise more number of girls units. Since the year 2010, nine girls Battalions have been raised.In order to ensure safety and security of girls cadets in NCC camps and training venues, Girl Cadet Instructors (GCI) are appointed. Being escorted by GCI instills confidence in girls and encourages them to join NCC. Starting from 2020-21, sanction has been accorded for recruitment of 637 GCIs in phased manner.  As per latest data available, the girl cadet strength in NCC is 35.48 % of total enrolment. The details of gender ratio among NCC cadres in various States, State-wise; are attached at Annexure.*****
