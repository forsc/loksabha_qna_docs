ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF MINISTRY OF PLANNING, AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION  (RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a)	Yes Sir. The NITI Aayog has released the 2nd edition of the India Innovation Index on the 20th of January, 2021, which ranks 29 States and 7 Union Territories (UTs) based on their innovation capabilities and performance. While calculating the Innovation scores of the States/UTs, indicators such as the number of venture capital deals, registered Geographical indications, information and communications technology exports, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflow, etc., have been taken into account.(b)	The NITI Aayog has been releasing the India Innovation Index since the last two years, viz. 2019 and 2020. The India Innovation Index 2019 and the India Innovation Index 2020 have, therefore, been prepared based on the latest data available, on the various indicators, at that point-of-time. The State-wise comparative statement - on the indicators mentioned in the part (a) of the Question - is, therefore, being provided for only 2 years (Annexure-1). (c)	Yes Sir, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the economic slowdown. As the India Innovation Index 2019 and 2020 were released using data from the previous years, they did not reflect the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. However, given the implications of the pandemic, the role of innovation is instrumental in leading the recovery. Innovation will play a critical role in revitalizing the economy, which is happening across most of the States/UTs.The need to innovate is crucial to overcome the multitude of challenges that will begin to arise in the future. The NITI Aayog, through the Atal Innovation Mission (AIM), is developing a culture of innovation in the country which is continuing to gather momentum even during the pandemic. (d)	The focus of the Central and the State Governments needs to be on the most immediate concerns like supporting the overburdened healthcare system, recovering from the short-term economic shock and mobilizing entrepreneurial potential. For instance, the healthcare sector has a prime opportunity to boost innovation through the prioritization of targeted Research & Development and the commercialization of intellectual property (IP). Strategic innovation projects are likely to play a crucial role, as innovation is a key driver of economic growth and development in the long run. Innovation would also allow harnessing the opportunities that arise from every crisis across different sectors. As India seeks to revive from the impacts of the pandemic, the NITI Aayog,  is actively coordinating with all the stakeholders, including the States and the Union Territories, to drive the innovation related initiatives at the national and the state level. The Governing Council of the NITI Aayog provides a platform to discuss various matters with the States and the Union Territories, including the role of innovation to revitalize the economy.  *****   Annexure-1Venture capital dealsS.
