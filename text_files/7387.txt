                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)‘Public Health’ and ‘Hospitals’ are State subjects and therefore, such information is not maintained centrally. However, as far as three Central Government Hospitals in Delhi viz. Safdarjung, Dr. RML and Lady Hardinge Medical College and Associated Hospitals are concerned, to address the issue of shortage of staff in these hospitals, efforts are being made to fill up the sanctioned posts on regular basis as per rules. However, sometimes recruitment of staff against regular vacancies takes a lot of time as the process requires framing/amendment of recruitment rules, revival of lapsed posts, re-advertisement of vacancies etc. Therefore, pending regular appointments of these posts in the above mentioned hospitals, permission` is granted to make appointments on contract/ outsource basis against the vacant posts, as a stop-gap arrangement, in public interest.	Further, post creation and filling up of posts are continuous process. Since, there is ever increasing load of patients in these hospitals, new posts are created and filled as per the requirement of the hospital subject to availability of resources.
