                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)& (b)According to the estimation of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) during2015, 62,000 Million Litre per Day (MLD) wastewater (sewage) is generated from urban centres of India. A total of 23,277 MLD treatment capacity has installed through 816 Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs).Out of 816 STPs at present, 522 STPs are functional whereas 145 STPsare  under construction,  79  STPS are non-operational or under renovation and 70  STPs  are proposed to be installed . (c)to (e) Setting up ofwastewater (sewage) treatment plants (STPs) to tackle the steady increase in sewage generation in the country due to high population growth and rapid urbanization is a long term continuous process which involves the collective effort of the Central and State Governments. It is the responsibility of the State Governments/ concerned local bodies to set up facilities for collection, transportation and treatment of sewage. State Governments, apart from their own budgetary allocation, are also accessing financial assistance for creation of sewerage infrastructure, including STPs, in various cities/towns under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and Smart Cities Mission of Ministry of Housing  andUrban Affairs as well as Namami Gange programme of Ministry of Jal Shakti.In addition to this, Ministry of Jal Shakti is  alsosupplementing the efforts of the State Governments in abatement of pollution in identified stretches of various rivers, including setting up of STPs, under the National River Conservation Plan (NRCP), on cost sharing basis between the Central and State GovernmentsCPCB has issued directions under Section 18 1(b) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 in April, 2015 to all the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) in the country to make it mandatory for local bodies to establish STPs of adequate capacity and provide sewerage system to cover the entire local/urban areas to bridge the treatment capacity gap alongwith enforcement of standards for sewage treatment. CPCB has also issued directions in October, 2015 to municipal authorities of 66 metropolitan cities and State capitals under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to ensure proper treatment and disposal of sewage generated for abatement of pollution of rivers. Adoption of decentralized or centralised STPs are decided by the State Governments/concerned local bodies based on sewage generation and other local conditions such as availability of land and regular power for the STP, configuration of the existing sewerage system, topography of the area, treatment technology selected, etc.  Further, STPs are designed to reduce Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Suspended Solids (SS) of sewage.  	*****
