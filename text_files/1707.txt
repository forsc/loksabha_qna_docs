The number of registered NBFCs under various Regional Offices of RBI, along with details of the States and Union Territories over which each Regional Office has jurisdiction, is at Annex 1. As on June 24, 2019, as per National Housing Bank (NHB) data, 101 Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) were registered with NHB. The State-wise and Union Territory-wise number of HFCs registered is at Annex 2.(b): As per RBI data, gross Non-Performing Assets (NPA) ratio of NBFCs (Deposit-taking and Systemically Important Non-deposit-taking NBFCs) during the last four financial years are as under:Financial year	Gross NPA ratio2015-16	3.9%2016-17	6.1%2017-18	5.3%2018-19	6.6%(c): RBI has informed that it is closely monitoring the problem of liquidity being faced by certain NBFCs, mainly due to asset-liability mismatches and the overall liquidity position of NBFCs. NHB has informed that, as part of due diligence, it is continuously monitoring the liquidity position of 15 major HFCs.(d): With regard to whether Government has conducted any enquiry recently, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has informed that the Registrar of Companies, Kerala conducted an inquiry of an NBFC under section 206(1) of the Companies Act, 2013, which brought out non-compliance of certain provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 but no reporting on defaults in repayment/redemption of debentures were observed. The Ministry has further informed that the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) has been ordered to conduct investigation in respect of an infrastructure-related NBFC.(e): NBFCs are regulated and supervised by RBI as per powers vested in it under the provisions contained in Chapter IIIB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. As per RBI inputs, a number of measures were undertaken to ameliorate liquidity issues faced by NBFCs. The measures taken include, inter alia, the following:(i)	Open market operations were conducted, in addition to regular Liquidity Adjustment Facility auctions, to inject liquidity in financial markets.(ii)	RBI permitted special dispensation to banks up until 31st March 2019, whereby their incremental credit to NBFCs and HFCs after October 19, 2018, could be treated as high quality liquid assets for calculation of Liquidity Coverage Ratios.(iii)	The single-borrower exposure limit for NBFCs that do not finance infrastructure was increased from 10 percent to 15 percent of capital funds, up to 31st March 2019.(iv)	Banks were permitted to provide partial credit enhancement for non-deposit accepting systemically-important NBFCs registered with RBI and HFCs registered with NHB as per guidelines.(v)	RBI reduced the minimum average maturity requirement for External Commercial Borrowings in the infrastructure space raised by eligible borrowers from five years to three years.(vi)	To encourage NBFCs to securitise/assign their eligible assets, the Minimum Holding Period requirement for originating NBFCs was relaxed till December 2019.(vii)	NBFCs were provided regulatory concessions to enable restructuring of MSME loans.(viii)	NBFCs with assets over Rs. 5,000 crore have been asked to appoint a Chief Risk Officer to improve the standards of risk management.*** Annex-1Lok Sabha Unstarred Parliament Question No. 1457, for 1.7.2019Number of registered NBFCs under Regional Offices of RBIRegional Office (jurisdiction over State/ Union territory (UT))	Number of registered NBFCs as on June 23, 2019Ahmedabad (Gujarat, and UTs of Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli)	253Bangalore (Karnataka)	133Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh)	103Bhubaneswar (Odisha)	20Kolkata (Sikkim, West Bengal and UT of Andaman and Nicobar Islands)	4,541Chandigarh (Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and UT of Chandigarh)	215Chennai (Tamil Nadu and UT of Puducherry)	331New Delhi (Haryana and NCT Delhi)	2,013Guwahati (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura) 	118Hyderabad (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana)	155Jaipur (Rajasthan)	198Jammu (Jammu and Kashmir)	32Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand)	143Mumbai (Maharashtra and Goa)	1,214Patna (Bihar and Jharkhand)	35Thiruvananthapuram (Kerala and UT of Lakshadweep)	139Total	9,643Source: RBI*** Annex-2Lok Sabha Unstarred Parliament Question No. 1457, for 1.7.2019Number of registered Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) under NHBState/Union territory	Number of HFCsAndhra Pradesh	1Delhi	19Gujarat	5Haryana	3Karnataka	5Kerala	2Madhya Pradesh	1Maharashtra	40Manipur	1Mizoram	1Rajasthan	6Tamil Nadu	15West Bengal	2Total	101Source: National Housing Bank***
