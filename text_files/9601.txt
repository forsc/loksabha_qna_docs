ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES [SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR](a) & (b):	The Press Council of India (PCI) has framed “Norms of Journalistic Conduct” for adherence by the media of publishing news which is accurate and fair. The PCI also has an institutional mechanism for redressing any complaints received by it, in accordance with the Press Council (Procedure for Inquiry) Regulations, 1979, and enables it to warn, admonish or censure a newspaper, news agency, editor or journalist, etc.	With regard to electronic media, the Cable Television Network (Regulations) Act, 1995 and Rules made there under inter alia provide that no program shall be carried out which contains anything obscene, defamatory, deliberate, false and suggesting innuendoes and half truths. Monitoring is done through a system of self- regulation by the News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) and the National Broadcasting Association (NBA) and the Broadcasting Content Complaints Council (BCCC) of the Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF). The NBA has also formulated a Code of Ethics in broadcasting standards. The NBSA has issued an advisory dated 12.05.2016 to its members that manufacturing, drawing, tailoring, and tutoring or creating any kind of false or fake news or an attempt to do so will be considered as a serious misconduct on the part of the broadcaster. 	An Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) in the Government looks at specific complaints regarding violation of Programme Codes by private TV channels and recommends appropriate action in cases of violation of the programme codes. The Information Technology Act, 2000 provides for removal of objectionable online content.(c):	Press Council of India (PCI) has defined Fake News to mean, “news, story, information, data and reports which is or are wholly or partly false”.*****
