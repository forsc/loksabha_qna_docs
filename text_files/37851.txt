As on 4 March 2022, Government of India has released   ? 29,213.60 crore for 100 Smart Cities, out of which ? 25,177.65 crore (86%) has been utilized.  So far, 100 Smart Cities have tendered out 6,928 projects worth ? 1,91,238 crore; work orders have been issued in 6,282 projects worth ? 1,65,503 crore; 3,576 projects worth ? 59,958 crore have been completed.(b): As per SCM Guidelines, Central Government will provide financial support to the extent of ? 48,000 crore over five years i.e., on an average ? 100 crore per city per year.  An equal amount on a matching basis will be contributed by the State Government/Urban Local Body (ULB). The details of funds released by Central Government under SCM for the Smart Cities in Bihar and utilization thereof by the Smart Cities is given below :-                                                                      (Amount in ? crore)Smart City	Funds released by Central Government 	Utilization thereof by Smart CitiesBhagalpur	   196.00	                              153.97Bihar Sharif	   196.00	                               60.00Muzaffarpur	   196.00	                               60.00Patna	           194.00	                               155.81Total	           782.00                                       429.78 (Source: SCM Geospatial Management Information System(GMIS), as on 4 March 2022)(c) & (d): The objective of SCM is to promote cities that provide core infrastructure and give a decent quality of life to its citizens, a clean and sustainable environment through application of smart solutions. The focus is on sustainable and inclusive development and the idea is to look at compact areas, create replicable models which will act as lighthouses for other areas in the same city/other aspiring cities. The Smart City Proposal (SCP) of each city has been prepared through extensive citizen engagement. Since needs and aspirations of citizens in different cities are different, the priorities and projects contained in such SCPs vary from city to city. Ensuring connectivity through airports was not envisaged as an objective under SCM.                                 ******
