As per the report of CACP for sugar season 2020-21, the All India projected A2 + FL cost of production (i.e. actual paid out cost plus imputed value of family labour) of sugarcane is Rs. 159 per quintal..........2/--2-(b)&(c): 	On the recommendations of CACP, the Government has fixed the FRP of sugarcane for sugar season 2020-21 at Rs. 285/- per quintal for a basic recovery rate of 10%; providing a premium of Rs. 2.85/qtl for each 0.1 % increase in recovery over and above 10%. In respect of those mills whose recovery is below 10% but above 9.5 %, the FRP would be reduced by Rs. 2.85/ qtl for every 0.1 percentage point decline in sugar recovery below 10%. The Government with a view to protect interest of farmers has also decided that there shall not be any deduction in case of mills where recovery is below 9.5%; such farmers will get Rs. 270.75 per quintal for sugarcane. ****
