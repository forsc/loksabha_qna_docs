SINGH) (a) to  (b) : 	Ministry of Power on 5th April 2018 had issued a mechanism to provide flexibility in generation and scheduling of Thermal Power Stations to reduce emissions. Under the mechanism, the thermal power generating company has the flexibility of using its thermal power or renewable power to supply firm power under existing contractual agreements. 		This flexibility provides the generators an opportunity to optimally utilize generation from RE sources and also help in reducing emissions. Beneficiaries of the power will also get the firm power including Renewable power, which will help them to meet their RPO obligations. The net gain realized, if any, from supply of RE power in place of thermal power under existing PPA shall be passed on to the beneficiary in the ratio of 50 (Beneficiary) : 50 (Generator). (c) & (d) : 	There were 34 coal based thermal power projects with capacity of 40,130 MW which were under stress as per data provided by Department of Financial Services. Out of these, 14 projects with a total capacity of 16,450 MW have since been resolved.
