ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a)	No Sir.(b)	In view of (a) above, does not arise.(c)	Yes, Sir(d)	In light of the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs for Surveillance, Containment and Caution during the COVID – 19 pandemic, the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports and the Sports Authority of India (SAI) have issued various Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for opening of sports venues and resumption of sports activities in the COVID – 19 scenario. Such SOPs are applicable to all stakeholders including the National Sports Federations (NSFs). A COVID Task Force Committee has also been set-up by SAI to ensure that the guidelines are strictly implemented at the training centre. The Committee is responsible for the constant monitoring and management of the health protocols issued by the Government. National Coaching Camps were conducted within a bio-bubble for the Olympic bound athletes under approved Annual Calendar for Training and Competitions (ACTC). So far, no complaint, that would merit taking action against NSFs, for flouting COVID-19 protocol / social security norms, has been received. *****
