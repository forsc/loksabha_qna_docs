Government proposes to set up more Automated Weather Stations (AWSs) across the country. The details of proposed installation of AWSs are as follow:•	For Kerala – 100 AWSs•	For North East India – 200 AWSs•	For replacement of old AWSs installed across India – 200 AWSs•	For District Agriculture Meteorological Units – 200 AWSs•	For tourism places across India - 100 AWSs•	For measurement of snow fall and snow depth along Himalayas and North East India - 80 AWSs. (b)	 & (d)	Yes Sir. The Surface Instrument Division of India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune has a workshop which is ISO 9001-2008 certified. All manufactured instruments are tested and calibrated at this workshop. The workshop also carries out research and development of instrumentation and brings out new designs. The Division maintains detailed instruction manuals and engineering drawings on all the instruments. It maintains a large network of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) and other meteorological equipment across the country. To ensure quality of the data, all surface meteorological equipment installed at conventional observatories are checked and compared with portable standards once a year for ensuring accurate measurements. Portable standards are traceable to national standards. National standards are regularly compared and calibrated against International / WMO standards. The data is ingested into the forecasting model after quality control to avoid erroneous data in the computation procedure.
