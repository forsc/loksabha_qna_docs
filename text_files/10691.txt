ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) FOR NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY, POWER and MoS for  SKILL DEVELOPMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP(SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) to (d) The Phase II of Grid Connected Rooftop Solar (RTS) Programme approved in February 2019 has targeted installation of grid connected rooftop solar systems of cumulative 40 GW capacity by year 2022. Out of this 40 GW capacity, 4 GW capacity is targeted from residential grid connected rooftop systems with Central Financial Assistance (CFA). Under the Phase II of RTS Programme, which will be implemented through power distributing companies (DISCOMs), the CFA has been restructured with a target of addition of 4 GW capacity for residential sector. The CFA of 40% of the benchmark cost or tendered cost, whichever is lower is provided for residential grid connected rooftop systems upto 3 kW and 20% of the benchmark cost or tendered cost whichever is lower for residential grid connected rooftop systems of capacity 3 kW to 10 kW. There is no CFA for grid connected rooftop  system above 10 kW in residential sector since solar power for such category is cost effective compared to grid tariffs applicable for such category of consumers. The Phase-II of RTS programme also provides CFA upto 20% of benchmark cost or tendered cost whichever is lower, for Group Housing Societies/ Resident Welfare Associations for supply of power for common facilities. DISCOMs have been made asimplementing agencies as they have direct access to the consumers, have an organisedinvoicing/billing/execution system and hence are best suited to manage distributed andrelatively independent clients/prosumers. Incentives for the DISCOMs for installing additional capacity above baseline have also been provided for.*****
