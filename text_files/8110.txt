ANSWER




(a):	The Government of India is aware of the increasing urbanisation and existence of slum settlements across the country. ‘Land’ and ‘Colonisation’ are State subjects and therefore it is the responsibility of the State/ Union Territory (UT) Governments to implement schemes for urban and slum development. However, in order to proactively address the housing requirement of eligible urban households including slum dwellers, the Government of India through the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) had launched the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) Mission on June 25, 2015 to assist States/ UTs both financially and technically. PMAY (U) envisages to provide all weather pucca houses with basic civic infrastructures like water, sanitation, sewerage, road, electricity etc. to all eligible urban households including slum dwellers.  The “In-situ” Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) component under PMAY-U Mission mandates use of land as a resource for providing houses to slum dwellers across the country. This approach aims to leverage the locked potential of land under slums to provide houses to the eligible slum dwellers by bringing them into the formal urban settlement. (b): The MoHUA regularly monitors and reviews the overall progress of the projects, including those under ISSR component, undertaken under PMAY-U Mission through an Inter-Ministerial Committee viz. Central Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee (CSMC) constituted under the Chairpersonship of Secretary, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs. (c): The details of houses constructed during the last three years and number of houses allotted to the people of SC, ST and minority community, State-wise and year-wise are at Annexure.                                               *****
