At present, Biometric Token Machines are used at 05 major Railway Stations for queue management for passengers boarding general coaches in 17 prominent trains. These trains include Train nos. 12534, 12137, 12111, 12859 (C Shivaji Maharaj Terminus Railway Station); 12533 (Lucknow Junction Railway Station); 12555, 11016 (Gorakhpur Junction Railway Station); 12955, 12933, 12903, 12961, 22945 (Mumbai Central Railway Station) and 12925, 19707, 19039, 12907, 12471 (Bandra Terminus Railway Station).*****
