ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):	Section-7(5) of the Cigarettes and other Tobacco products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulations of Trade and Commerce Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003 (COTPA, 2003) stipulates that No person shall, directly or indirectly, produce, supply or distribute cigarettes or any other tobacco products unless every package of cigarettes or any other tobacco products produced, supplied or distributed by him indicates thereon, or on its label, the nicotine and tar contents on each cigarette or as the case may be on other tobacco products along with the maximum permissible limits thereof: Provided that the nicotine and tar contents shall not exceed the maximum permissible quantity thereof as may be prescribed by rules made under this Act.  However, the above Section has not been made effective due to the fact that the said provision is not in line with the guidelines of World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) that cautions all member parties from displaying any quantitative statements on tobacco product packaging and labelling. The available medical evidence also suggests that there is no safe level for nicotine and tar contents and as such there cannot be any permissible limit thereof in the cigarettes or other tobacco products. Further the provision relating to display of maximum permissible limits of tar and nicotine contents is also susceptible to misuse to promote tobacco products ''as safer products''.(c) & (d):	Three National Tobacco Testing Laboratories (NTTL), each one, in the campus of Regional Drugs Testing Laboratory, Guwahati, Central Drugs Testing Laboratory, Mumbai and National Institute of Cancer Prevention & Research, Noida  have been set up for testing of tobacco products.
