ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a)	No, Sir. Department has no regulation to cover the Gramin Dak Sevaks (GDSs) under Employees’ Provident Fund ( EPF) and Employees’ State Insurance ( ESI). The GDSs are holders of a civil post but outside the regular civil service. Hence, they cannot be treated as regular employees. In a civil APPEAL No. 3050 and 3151 OF 2019 of Gurusewak Singh and Others Honourable Supreme Court has observed that a GDS is not an employee under the 1972 Gratuity Act. GDS work is part time in nature and for this work, they are being paid Time Related Continuity Allowance. In addition, it is imperative for every GDS to have alternate means of livelihood for their engagement.(b)	The details of welfare schemes extended by the Government to GDSs are enclosed in Annexure-I.(c)	The maximum working hours for GDSs has been restricted to  five hours a day as the  work of GDS is part time in nature and for this work, they are being paid Time Related Continuity Allowance (TRCA). In addition, it is imperative for every GDS to have alternate means of livelihood for their engagement.(d)	No, Sir. (e)	Does not arise in view of reply to (d)  above.(f)	No, Sir. The Gramin Dak Sevaks work for a minimum of four hours and maximum five hours a day. This work is part time in nature and for this work, they are being paid Time Related Continuity Allowance. In addition, it is imperative for every GDS to have alternate means of livelihood for their engagement. Moreover, the Honourable Supreme Court in the Judgement pronounced in 1977, held that though the Gramin Dak Sevaks are holders of civil posts, but they are outside the regular civil Service. Recently, in a  common order dated 17.11.2016 of Honourable CAT Principle Bench Delhi in OAs No. 749/2015, 3540/2015 & 613/2015 filed by GDS, the Honourable CAT rejected the claim of GDS for parity with regular civil servant.	Promotional Avenues :-(1)	Gramin Dak Sevaks are considered for absorption as multi-tasking staff in 50% of vacancies on seniority cum fitness basis and 25%   by Competitive Examination.(2)	Gramin Dak Sevaks upto the age of 50 years are considered for recruitment in 50% of vacancies of Postman by Competitive Examination. (3)	Unfilled vacancies of Postal Assistants of a promotion quota are offered to Gramin Dak Sevaks subject to fulfillment of educational qualification, age, etc. and their being successful in the aptitude test.
