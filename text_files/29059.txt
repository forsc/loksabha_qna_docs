ANSWER




(a) to (d) Under Joint Guidelines issued for construction of Anganwadi Centres under MGNREGA in convergence between Ministry of Women & Child Development and Ministry of Rural Development, drinking water and sanitation (DWS) facilities are provided. During 2017-18 to 2019-20, for identified AWCs in Government owned buildings running without DWS facilities, funds have been released  for drinking water facility.  States/ UTs have also been advised to shift AWCs running in rented premises without drinking water facilities to nearby primary schools where these facilities are available.  As per approved cost norms for Administrative Expenses under Anganwadi Services, there is a provision for payment of electricity and water bills at AWC/ Mini AWC level. The responsibility of electrification of AWC building falls within the purview of State Governments/ UT Administrations as Anganwadi services is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme implemented by States/ UTs.  As reported by Govt. of Maharashtra, out of the total 4808 Anganwadi Centres in Satara district of Maharashtra, 1881 have free electricity connection and 2739 have free water connections.*********
