(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) to (c):  Government is taking  all steps including crop diversification, crop planning as per the  agro climatic zones, improved agronomic practices, agri mechanisation and support for infrastructure for drip and sprinkler irrigation to improve water use efficiency.PMKSY-PDMC is being implemented since 2015-16 under which financial assistance @ 55% for small and marginal farmers and 45% for other farmers is provided for installation of Drip and Sprinkler systems. In addition, some States provide top-up subsidy for encouraging farmers to adopt Micro Irrigation.Under PMKSY- PDMC, Central Assistance of Rs. 11985.85 crore was released to States during the period of 2015-16 to 2019-20 and an amount of Rs. 4000.00 crore (BE) is allocated for the current year. An area of 47.92 lakh ha (Drip 25.82 lakh ha & Sprinkler 22.10 lakh ha) has been covered under Micro Irrigation in the country since 2015-16.…..contd…2/--2-Micro Irrigation Fund (MIF) with a corpus of Rs. 5000 crore has been created with NABARD to facilitate the States in mobilizing the resources for expanding coverage of Micro Irrigation by taking up special and innovative projects and also for incentivising micro irrigation beyond the provisions available under PMKSY-PDMC.Under the Command Area Development and Water Management Programme (CADWM) Scheme operated by the Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (DoWR, RD &GR), financial assistance is given to the States for creation of Micro irrigation infrastructure in the canal irrigated commands.  It is provisioned in the scheme that micro–irrigation shall cover at least 10% of the targeted Culturable Command Area (CCA) of the Project.Awareness among the farmers on benefits of Micro Irrigation is taken up by wide publicity through press & print media, publication of leaflets/booklets, organization of workshops, exhibitions, farmer fairs, information on State/Government of India web portals etc.Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) organizes demonstrations and training programmes on water use efficiency including micro irrigation through Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) to educate farmers. To intensify this activity, Micro Irrigation demonstration units have been established under 190 KVKs suitable to the average farm holding and crops of the concerned districts for demonstration and training to the farmers.  During 2019-20, the KVKs organised 1308 training programmes/demonstrations on the Micro Irrigation benefitting 58078 farmers. In addition, the ICAR-Indian Institute of Water Management (IIWM), Bhubaneswar through the Centres of All India Coordinated Research Projects on Irrigation Water Management located at various State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) is providing training to educate farmers on efficient irrigation techniques including drip irrigation for various crops.The Ministry of Jal Shakti also organises conferences as well as trainings of various stake holders including Water Users Associations (WUAs) for promoting micro- irrigation and Participatory Irrigation Management.************
