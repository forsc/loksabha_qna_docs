Kargil-Zanskar (Sl/IL/gravel road to 2L with paved shoulder by NHIDCL) (c) & (d)    BRO has undertaken many new initiatives to speed up road construction. BRO has taken in hand execution of surfacing works with cementitious base/sub base in eastern Ladakh. BRO has constructed a 1400 ft span Permanent Bridge using micro piling in substructure at an altitude of 14500 ft in record 17 working months. In addition Geo-Web and Geo-Cell are being used extensively for surfacing and permanent works.(e) Following steps have been taken by the Govt. to meet the challenges of developing long-lasting and low-maintenance roads to border areas of Ladakh to ensure connectivity around the year.1.	Interlocking blocks are being used in mountain passes to provide  good riding surface in all weather.2.	Geo cells are also being used in surfacing in various stretches.3.	Tunnels i.e., Tanglanla, Shinkunla, Lachungla are also being planned to further improve the connectivity in the region for which DPRs are under progress.  *****
