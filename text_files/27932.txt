ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ??????? ?????? (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a): The objective of Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) is to ensure remunerative prices to farmers for their produce of oilseeds, pulses and copra of Fair Average Quality (FAQ). PM-AASHA is an umbrella scheme comprising Price Support Scheme (PSS), Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) and Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme (PPSS). These schemes are implemented at the request of the State / Union Territories Governments. PSS is implemented for procurement of pulses, oilseeds and copra of Fair Average Quality (FAQ) at Minimum Support Price (MSP). The PDPS is implemented for notified oilseeds crops. However, States/UTs have options to choose either PSS or PDPS in a given procurement season with respect to a particular oilseed crop for the entire State. PDPS does not involve any physical procurement but envisages direct payment of the difference between the MSP and the selling / Modal price to pre- registered farmers selling the oilseeds crops of prescribed FAQ norms within the stipulated period in the notified market yard through a transparent auction process. Besides, PPSS is also implemented for oilseeds on pilot basis and States have the option for implementation of PPSS in district/selected APMC(s) of district involving the participation of selected private agencies. (b) to (d): Under PM-AASHA, there is a provision in the guidelines of PSS for procurement of notified pulses, oilseeds and copra by Central Nodal Agencies through State designated agencies. Further, as per provision of PPSS guidelines,   the procurement of notified oilseeds crops are done through private agencies. Till date, based on the proposals from the concerned State/UT governments, 91.68 LMT of Pulses, oilseeds and copra was procured under PSS and 16.83 LMT of oilseeds was covered under PDPS. The state-wise procurement details of oilseeds, pulses and copra at MSP under PM-AASHA since its inception (i.e. from Kharif 2018-19) are at Annexure A. (e): The Union Budget for 2018-19 had announced the pre-determined principle to keep MSP at minimum levels of one and half times of the cost of production. Hence, Government has increased the MSPs for all mandated Kharif, Rabi and other commercial crops with a return of at least 50 per cent over all India weighted average cost of production from the agricultural year 2018-19. PM-AASHA is helping farmers in getting increased MSP by way of procuring the notified agricultural produce at MSP and making the payments directly into farmers accounts. Besides the overall market also responds to declaration of MSP and Government’s procurement operations which results in private procurement on or above the MSP benefitting the farmers for various notified crops.(f):  In order to provide remunerative price to farmers, Government also undertakes procurement of paddy and wheat at MSP from farmers through Food Corporation of India (FCI) and State Agencies. Further, different types of nutri-cereals and maize are procured at MSP from farmers by State Governments itself in consultation with FCI to the extent that the concerned State Government may utilise the same for distribution under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) as well as Other Welfare Schemes (OWS). Further, Cotton and Jute are procured by Government at MSP through Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) and Jute Corporation of India (JCI) respectively.
