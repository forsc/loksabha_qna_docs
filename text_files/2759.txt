Statement referred to in reply to LokSabha Starred Question No. *221 for answer on 09/07/2019 regarding Branded and Generic Medicines(a)& (b):	The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) fixes the ceiling price of scheduled medicines specified in the first schedule of the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO) in accordance with the provisions of the DPCO. All manufacturers of scheduled medicines (branded or generic) have to sell their products within the ceiling price (plus applicable local taxes) fixed by the NPPA. A manufacturer is at liberty to fix the maximum retail price of a non-scheduled formulation (branded or generic) launched by it. However, as per the DPCO, the manufacturers of non-scheduled formulations are not allowed to increase the maximum retail price of such formulations by more than 10 % per annum. 	The medicines sold under the PradhanMantriBhartiyaJanaushadhiPariyojana (PMBJP) are generic and normally cheaper by 50-90% of average price of top 3 brands of corresponding medicines.
