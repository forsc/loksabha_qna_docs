Violation of these norms prescribes severe punishment as laid down in the said regulations.    Clause 1.5 also prescribes that every physician should prescribe drugs with generic names legibly and preferably in capital letters and he/she shall ensure that there is a rational prescription and use of drugs. Further, Medical Council of India has issued Circulars from time to time directing all the Registered Medical Practitioners to comply with the aforesaid provisions.(b):     The Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers informed that in accordance with the provisions of the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO, 2013), Government regulates the prices of medicines listed in Schedule I of the order. The National List of Essential Medicines 2011 (NLEM-2011) and subsequently NLEM-2015 have been incorporated as Schedule- I of DPCO, 2013. As per para 8 of DPCO, 2013 the MRP of the formulations shall be fixed by the manufacturer on the basis of ceiling / retail price notified + local taxes as applicable.Ceiling prices of medicines included in Schedule- I are fixed on the ‘Market based pricing’ methodology. National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) has fixed the ceiling prices of 530 scheduled medicines under Original Schedule-I (NLEM-2011); and has also fixed the ceiling prices of 860 formulations under the Revised Schedule-I (NLEM-2015).  The detail of prices fixed is available on NPPA’s website.(c) to (e):	The Department of Pharmaceuticals, Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers informed that the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority capped the Trade Margin of all the non-scheduled formulations of select 42 Anti-Cancer drugs, recommended by Expert Committee of Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, under the ‘Trade margin Rationalisation Approach’ vide order S.O. 1041(E) dated 27th February, 2019. The decision has been taken up as Pilot for Proof of Concept, under the laid down provision of paragraph 19 of DPCO, 2013, under extra-ordinary circumstances in public interest. On the basis of data submitted by manufacturers, it has been analysed that there would be annual saving of approx. Rs. 984 crores to the patients.
