                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) & (b):	The income of agricultural households in the country is estimated by National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) through the ‘Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Households’ conducted from time to time. As per the results of latest such Survey conducted in 2013, all India average monthly income per agricultural household from various sources is estimated to be Rs. 6426. Since the last survey on income of agricultural households was conducted in 2013, the extent of increase in income during the last five years is not known.(c):	 The Government had constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee in April, 2016 to examine the issues relating to ‘Doubling of Farmers Income’ and recommend a comprehensive strategy to achieve the same. The Committee has submitted its Report to the Government in September, 2018 which is also available on the Department’s website at http://agricoop.nic.in/doubling-farmers. The Committee recognises agriculture as a value led enterprise and has identified seven major sources of growth in farmers’ income, viz., improvement in crop productivity; improvement in livestock productivity; resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; increase in the cropping intensity; diversification towards high value crops; improvement in real prices received by farmers; and shift from farm to non-farm occupations.   On an ongoing basis, Government has been reorienting its schemes and programmes on the lines of interventions suggested by the Committee on Doubling of Farmers Income.*******
