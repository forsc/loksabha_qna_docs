                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ?? ????? ?????? ??????       ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	The details of area and production of Cocoa from 2016-17 to 2020-21 (Third Advance Estimates) State-wise, are at Annexure I.(b):	Directorate of Cashewnut and Cocoa Development (DCCD)has intimated that as per the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) statistics, India occupies 14th position globally in the production of Cocoa (Annexure II). DCCD has further reported that the Horticulture practices followed are mostly organic in nature and the quality of the Cocoa beans being produced is mainly dependent on soil and weather parameters. The Cocoa beans produced in India are quite comparable to Ivory Coast beans (the best beans are produced in Ghana followed by Ivory Coast) and many Multi-National Companies involved in grinding of Cocoa are taking a lot of interest in Indian Cocoa beans.(c)&(d):	Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (ICAR-CPCRI)has reported the following initiatives/ efforts:•	To increase productivity, high yielding varieties (5 hybrids and 3 clones) were developed from ICAR-CPCRI and region specific varieties were identified through ICAR-CPCRI (6 centres) and All India Coordinated Research Project on Palms(AICRPP) (7 centres) in major Cocoa growing States as well as in North East States. They are suitable to be grown in Palm based cropping systems under Arecanut, Coconut and Oil palm gardens. •	Different plant densities under Arecanut, double hedge system under Coconut and Canopy architecting methods were standardized to increase productivity per unit area. •	Primary farm/ home level processing methods were transferred to farmers to add value to their produce, to sell as dry beans and get more remuneration. •	The Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Co-operative Limited (CAMPCO), is collecting both wet and dry beans from growers, processing through its Chocolate factory and exporting Cocoa butter and Cocoa powder to considerable extent.      •	Annual training programs/ district level seminars are being conducted on Cocoa production and processing technologies to encourage farmers to grow Cocoa with DCCD funding.•	Regional nurseries were established with ICAR-CPCRI materials and DCCD funding, for smooth supply of planting materials. •	Skill development program for nursery workers was conducted.   •	Under Scheduled Castes Sub Plan/ Tribal Sub-Plan programs, Cocoa seedlings were supplied to farmers of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.	Under Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) a Centrally Sponsored Scheme is being implemented with effect from 2014-15 for holistic growth of the horticulture sector in which all States and UTs are covered. For area expansion of plantation crops including Cashew and Cocoa, assistance is being provided at the rate of 40% of the maximum cost for meeting the expenditure on planting material, cost of drip system, Integrated Nutrient Management/Integrated Pest Management, canopy management etc. in 3 installments in the ratio of 60:20:20. In the case of North East areas, Himalayan States, Tribal Sub-Plan area, Andaman &Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep Islands, assistance is being extended at the rate of 50% of cost. Cocoa area expansion programme is being undertaken under MIDH and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) schemes.	The DCCD is supplementing the above efforts by way of new planting programme in Cocoa exclusively under tribal communities. The details of programs being implemented by the DCCD under MIDH are as below:•	New plantation development programme: The main objective of the programme is to develop new plantations with clones of high yielding varieties of hybrid seedlings of Cocoa in the farmer''s field. •	Technology dissemination through front line demonstrations: The main objective of the scheme is to demonstrate latest technologies on Cocoa production in the farmer’s field under different agro-climatic regions and farming situations.•	Production of planting material: This programme envisages establishing new Cocoa nurseries in the States where there is deficit of planting material. Besides, accreditation of existing nurseries is also envisaged for ensuring the quality of planting materials.•	Transfer of technology programs: The main activity of the programme is to narrow the gap in knowledge and skill among farmers by giving training on various Cocoa production technologies to all the people involved in the Cocoa sector.
