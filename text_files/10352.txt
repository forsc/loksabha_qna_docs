                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS,  HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) 	The Cabinet in the meeting held on 23.10.2019 approved the revival plan for Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) which inter-alia, includes administrative allotment of spectrum to BSNL for providing 4G services. Full cost of spectrum (excluding GST) of Rs.14,115 Cr will be funded by Government through equity infusion. GST component of Rs 2,541Cr on the cost of spectrum will also be funded through budgetary allocation from Government. (b) 	The radio spectrum and the telecom licenses being awarded by the Government are technology neutral and can facilitate deployment of any network/services. The standards for IMT 2020(International Mobile Telecommunications 2020), also known as 5G technologies in industry, are being finalised. An inter-ministerial High Level Forum for 5G India 2020 was constituted to articulate the Vision for 5G in India and to recommend policy initiatives and action plans. The High Level Forum has submitted its report titled as “Making India 5G Ready”. Based on the report, the Government is creating an enabling framework for deployment of affordable and secure 5G services in India.(c) 	The cabinet has also approved that allotment of spectrum for 5G services will also be made to BSNL on the same principle followed for allotment of spectrum for 4G services.************
