ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)PM-KISAN is a continuous and ongoing Scheme under which the funds are transferred directly to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). The process of benefit disbursement under the Scheme starts with the State/UT Governments identifying the eligible beneficiaries as per the Operational Guidelines of the Scheme and uploading the data thereof on the PM-KISAN portal. Once the data of the beneficiary have been uploaded on the PM-KISAN portal, it goes through multiple levels of validations verifying the correctness of Aadhaar and bank account details. If the validation of the data fails at any level, the data is sent back to the respective State/UT Government for correction. When the data has been corrected and passed all levels of validation, the payment to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries is made through the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode.       Sponsored bank of the State/UT Government remits the fund into the accounts of individual beneficiary through the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) platform. In the process, sometimes transaction fails due to failure of validation of accounts by PFMS, wrong account number, closure of accounts etc. To make the transaction successful, further attempts are made after the necessary correction/validation of bank accounts.       A statement showing the payments failed while transferring installments of PM Kisan Scheme is at Annexure.
