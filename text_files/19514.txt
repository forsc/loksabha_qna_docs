ANSWER




MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a):	In the state of Punjab, during the current cotton season 2020-21 (from 1st October, 2020 to 30th September, 2021), Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) started purchases of seed cotton (kapas) under Minimum Support Price (MSP) operations and has procured around 28.25 lakh quintal kapas equivalent to 5.38 lakh bales through its 22 procurement centres. MSP purchases had been made by paying MSP rate of Rs. 5665/- per quintal, depending upon the quality parameters, as per the guidelines.(b):	No, Sir. CCI has not stopped purchases under MSP in Punjab. However, due to substantial increase in kapas rates during last two weeks, the ruling price of kapas is more than MSP rates and hence farmers are getting better price for their produce in the market.(c):	Out of the total estimated production of around 63 lakh quintal kapas equivalent to 12 lakh bales in the state of Punjab, around 52.50 lakh quintal equivalent to 10 lakh bales i.e. 83% of the production had already been arrived in the market. CCI has procured 5.38 lakh bales so far from 1.03 lakh farmers who are mostly small and marginal.***
