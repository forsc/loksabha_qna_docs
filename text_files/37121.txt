ANSWER




 MINISTER OF COAL, MINES & PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) a. and b. Yes Sir. Second attempt of second round of auction for Commercial Mining was launched on 27th September 2021. Details of bids received in this second round is as below:S. No. 	Name of Coal Mine 	MSTC Regn No 	Name of Bidder 1 	Beheraband North Extn. 	151187 	Auro Coal Private Limited 		64836	JSW Steel Ltd.2 	Gondbahera Ujheni East 	235414 	MP Natural Resources Private Limited 3 	Lalgarh (North) 	242504 	Adhunik Power & Natural Resources Ltd. 		265144	Assam Mineral Development Corporation Limited		268462	Virtuous Mining Limited4 	Tokisud Block II 	242211 	Twenty First Century Mining Private Limited  c.	      Details of estimated revenue and employment likely to be generated from aforementioned coal blocks is as below:S.No	Mine	State	Successful Bidder	Annual Revenue generated based on the PRC of mine(Rs. crore)	Total Employment1	Lalgarh (North)	Jharkhand	Adhunik Power and Natural Resources Ltd	213.22	13522	Beheraband North Extn	Madhya Pradesh	AURO COAL PRIVATE LIMITED	NA*	NA*3	Gondbahera Ujheni East	Madhya Pradesh	MP Natural Resources Private Limited	NA*	NA*4	Tokisud Block II	Jharkhand	Twenty First Century Mining Private Limited	156.20	2028*Mine is partially explored. Hence these figures cannot be estimated.at this staged. and e.      Out of seven bidders who participated in Second attempt in Second round of auction, two bidders, namely JSW Steel and Adhunik Power & Natural Resources Ltd.  have participated in first round of commercial auction also. Remaining five bidders were the first time bidders.  Indian coal sector has come a long way from the nationalization of coal mines in 1973 to opening up of the sector for commercial coal mining by private players.  While the auction-based regime introduced in 2014 allowed private sector participation, it was limited to captive usage in own end use plants. Opening up the sector for commercial mining by private sector would generate a host of benefits for all the stakeholders in coal mining. Key features of the commercial coal mining policy are:o	FDI Policy has been amended to allow 100% FDI under automatic route for coal mining activities for commercial mining. Any foreign firm can also participate in the commercial auction in adherence to the applicable FDI norms.o	No technical or financial eligibility criteria to participate in the commercial auction process and the Ministry of Coal, Government of India has thrown the sector open to newer players.o	Requirement of minimum number of Technically Qualified Bidders for valid auction process is just 2, rather than earlier 3.o	Payments for upfront amount has been relaxed and shall be paid in 4 equal instalments with an upper ceiling of Rs. 500 crore for mines with reserves above 200 MT and Rs. 100 crore for mines with reserves up to 200 MT.o	No restriction on utilisation of coal. Mine owner can use the coal in any manner including sale, captive use, export and conversion.o	National Coal Index implemented to create a transparent, market-based pricing mechanismo	Greater Flexibility in Coal Production Scheduleo	Incentive for early coal production and utilization of coal in coal gasification and coal liquefaction****
