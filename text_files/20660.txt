The Central Government supplements their efforts by providing necessary technical support and financial assistance under various schemes to protect, conserve and manage forests and wildlife. Buffer zone is not defined for forests. It is defined only for Tiger Reserves under the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.  (e)	Conservation efforts taken by the Government have resulted in increase in population of several wild animals including Elephants, Tigers, Leopards, Rhino, Asiatic Lions, etc. This along with the fact that the wild animals keep moving out of forests,often leads to negative interactions between humans and wild animals resulting in human wildlife conflicts. The important steps taken by Government of India to manage and mitigate human-animal conflict in the country include: i.	Funds are provided under National CAMPA for augmentation of fodder and water in forest areas for restricting wild animals to forest areas. An amount of Rs. 47,872.31 Crores has been provided to various States for promoting afforestation and achieving green objectives of the country during 2019-2020.ii.	Voluntary relocation of villages from the core area of Tiger Reserves, National Parks and Sanctuaries is also being funded under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme: ‘Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats’ as proposed by the State Governments for avoiding conflictiii.	The Ministry provides financial assistance to States/UTs under the Centrally Sponsored Schemes of ''Development of Wildlife Habitats'', ‘Project Tiger’ and ‘Project Elephant’ for management of wildlife and its habitats in the country. The broad activities supported under these schemes include habitat enrichment andwater augmentation. iv.	The funds are also used for construction /erection of physical barriers such as solar powered electric fence, bio-fencing using cactus, boundary wall, animal proof trenches around forest, etc.v.	The financial support to the States/UTs also includes a component of compensation due to damage by wild animals.vi.	Under the revamped operational guidelines of Pradhan MantriFasalBimaYojna (PMFBY), issued by the Government of India (effective from the year 2020), States can provide add-on coverage for crop loss due to attack by wild animals.vii.
