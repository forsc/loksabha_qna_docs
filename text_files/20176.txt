ANSWER




                                                        (a)	and (b):   Government of India had approved a scheme titled “Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA)” to usher in digital literacy in rural India by covering 6 crore rural households (one person per household) in February 2017 at a total outlay of Rs. 2,351.38 crore (approx.). In order to ensure equitable geographical reach, it is envisaged to cover each of the 2,50,000 Gram Panchayats across the country. The implementation of the Scheme is carried out through CSC e-Governance Services India Private Limited (CSC-SPV). The scheme is aimed at digitally illiterate rural citizens belonging to the age group of 14 to 60 years to train them to operate computer or digital access devices (like tablets, smart phones etc.) in a course duration of 20 hours at duly identified Common Service Centre(CSC)/training centre located within the Gram Panchayats. As on date, 2.46 Lakh Gram Panchayats are covered under the Scheme. So far, around 4.21 Crore candidates have been enrolled/registered, around 3.44 Crore candidates have been trained, out of which more than 2.51 Crore candidates have been certified by duly authorized 3rd party Assessment Agencies. The State/UT-wise candidates registered, trained and certified under the scheme are as Annexure.(c):  As per 71st NSSO Survey on Education 2014, only around 6% of rural households and 29% urban households have a computer. Under the PMGDISHA scheme, the beneficiaries are trained to use/operate digital access devices such as computers, tablets, smart phones etc. which are made available at the respective training centres. After the training, the candidates are allowed to use such digital infrastructure available at the Training centres for further practice, as and when required.(d): The Training centres/CSCs working under the scheme are required to adhere to the stipulated guidelines which inter-alia include prescribed IT infrastructure including computer, webcam, biometric device, projector/LCD, Internet connectivity and availability of qualified trainer, etc as the major requisites for training delivery. The scheme guidelines also prescribe that each training centre empanelled in the scheme shall have a minimum of one trainer, with a minimum educational qualification of Basic Computer Course (BCC) or its equivalent. The Training centres are permitted to conduct training only after due physical verification of these pre-requisites is carried out by CSC-SPV.(e):  PMGDISHA Scheme is funded as a Central Sector Scheme, hence, funds are not allocated to States and UTs. *******AnnexureState-wise Status of PMGDISHA scheme as on 04.02.2021S.N.
