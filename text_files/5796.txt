ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (g)  	The concept of flood plain zoning recognizes the flood plain of a river essentially as its domain and that any intrusion into it or developmental activity therein must recognize the river’s ‘right of way’.           With the aim to provide hindrance free natural flow of river and mitigation of likely damage by floods, a model draft bill for flood plain zoning legislation was circulated by the Union Government in 1975 for guidance of all the States/Union Territories for enactment of legislation. The Model Bill envisages zoning of a flood plain of a river according to flood frequencies and defines the type of use of flood plain. It provides for flood zoning authorities, surveys and delineation of flood plain area, notification of limits of flood plains, prohibition or restriction of the use of the flood plains, compensation and power to remove obstruction etc.       This Ministry has repeatedly impressed upon the State/ UT Governments to enact legislation in this regard. While the States of Manipur, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand have enacted legislations, the response from the State Governments towards enactment of flood plain zoning legislation has not been encouraging.               As far as River Ganga and its tributaries are concerned, Ministry, vide Gazette Notification dated October, 2016 has specified that the bank of River Ganga and its flood plain shall be construction free zone to reduce pollution sources, pressures and to maintain its natural ground water recharge functions. Notification further states that no person shall construct any structure, whether permanent or temporary for residential or commercial or industrial or any other purpose in River Ganga, Bank of River Ganga or its tributaries or active flood plain area of River Ganga or its tributaries. For river Narmada, Water Resource Department, Government of Madhya Pradesh has informed that there is no proposal to impose such ban.*****
