ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (c) : 	Electricity is a concurrent subject. Providing electricity to all the consumers including various areas, cities, villages and remote areas etc, is the primary responsibility of concerned State Governments/Power Distribution Companies (DISCOMs). As on 31.05.2019, the installed generation capacity is about 357 Giga Watt (GW) which is sufficient to meet the peak power demand of the country. The maximum peak demand occurred during the current year 2019-20 (upto May, 2019) was around 183 GW. During April-May, 2019 the average power shortage in the country was only around 0.4% and the peak power shortage was only around 0.5%. The state-wise details of power supply position in the country including Karnataka during the current year 2019-20 (up to May, 2019) are at Annexure. This gap is generally on account of factors like constraints in distribution network, financial constraints to purchase power by Distribution Company etc.(d) : 		Government of India supplement the efforts of the States through its schemes including Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana- Saubhagya, Ujjwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY). These schemes help them to strengthen distribution network/grid connectivity and achieve 24x7 Power for All to consumers and would facilitate uninterrupted power supply to consumers.Government of India also assists the States/UTs by allocating power from Central Generating Stations (CGSs). State can also purchase power through various market mechanisms including power exchanges to meet any gap in demand and supply.************
