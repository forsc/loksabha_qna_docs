ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a)	Yes, Sir. (b) 	Indian Railways has adopted an energy-efficient power supply system for coaches called Head On Generation (HOG) system wherein power supply is drawn from Over Head Equipment (OHE) through converters provided in electric locomotive (WAP-7/WAP-5) for coach AC, lighting, fans etc. In SCR zone, 44 trains have been converted to Head On Generation (HOG) technology trains.(c) & (d) This system is being provided in End On Generation trains, where power cars equipped with DG sets, are provided at both the ends. The system is considered to provide a cost effective, reliable and energy efficient supply system for coaches. This eliminates use of Diesel Alternator set in power cars which creates noise & air pollution.	As on date, 1010 trains out of 1050 trains are HOG compliant and it has been decided to convert the balance trains as HOG compliant, in a phased manner.*****
