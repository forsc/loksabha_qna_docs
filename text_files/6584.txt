ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RAMDAS ATHAWALE)(a) & (b):  Article 17 of the Constitution of India abolished ‘untouchability’, forbade its practice in any form and made enforcement of any disability arising out of ‘untouchability’, an offence punishable in accordance with law. In accordance with this Constitutional provision, an Act of Parliament namely the Protection of Civil Rights {PCR} Act, 1955, was enacted which prescribed punishment for enforcement of any disability arising from practice of ‘untouchability’.      Section 3 (a) of the Protection of Civil Rights {PCR} Act, 1955, inter-alia, specifies that whoever on the ground of ‘untouchability’ prevents any person from entering any place of public worship which is open to other persons professing the same religion shall be punishable in accordance with the punishment prescribed.              ''Police'' and ''Public Order'' are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule (List-II) to the Constitution of India and the concerned State Governments and Union Territory Administrations are primarily responsible towards taking necessary action against the accused person(s) in accordance with the relevant provisions of the PCR Act. Further, when such an incident is brought to the notice of the Ministry, the factual report is sought from the concerned State Government and Union Territory Administration.  ******
