ANSWER




MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D. V. SADANANDA GOWDA)                               (a):	Yes Sir. (b):	Based on some complaints and media reports on overpricing and inflated bills to the patients, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) undertook a case study in February 2018. It was found that there was a significant difference between the procurement prices of scheduled formulations, non-scheduled formulations, medical devices and consumables as compared to amounts at which the drugs were billed to the patients by some private hospitals.  	Action has been initiated against the manufactures concerned for non-compliance of notified ceiling price in accordance with the provisions of the DPCO.(c):	The Government is effectively monitoring the prices of scheduled as well as non-scheduled medicines under the DPCO. The NPPA has registered the PMRUs (Price Monitoring and Resource Units) in 8 states for enhanced price monitoring. Further, the NPPA has developed multi-dimensional mechanism that includes overcharging references from the State Drugs Controllers, purchase of  samples from open market, information obtained from market-based data used by the NPPA, and complaints received online through ‘Pharma Jan Samadhan’ on the NPPA’s  website as well as  through the Centralized Public Grievance Redress And Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) Portal. *******
