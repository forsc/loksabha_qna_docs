It is the responsibility of the States/Union Territories (UTs), Local Bodies and Industrial Units to ensure required treatment of sewage and industrial effluents to the prescribed norms before discharging into river and other water bodies, coastal waters or land to prevent and control of pollution therein. For conservation of rivers, this Ministry has been supplementing efforts of the States/UTs by providing financial and technical assistance for abatement of pollution in identified stretches of rivers in the country through the Central Sector Scheme of Namami Gange for river Ganga and its tributaries and the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) for rivers in other basins. Setting up of sewage treatment plant (STPs) is one of the important components of these programmes.Proposals for pollution abatement works in the towns along polluted river stretches are received from the States/UTs from time to time for consideration under NRCP and sanctioned based on their prioritization, conformity with NRCP guidelines, availability of plan funds, etc.NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches on 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country with a sanctioned cost of Rs.5961.75 crore, and inter-alia, a sewage treatment capacity of 2677 million litres per day (mld) has been created since its inception. Under the Namami Gange programme launched in June, 2014, a total of 363 projects, including 160 projects for sewage treatment of 5023.98 mld and sewer network of 5227 kms, have been sanctioned at a cost of Rs.30841.53 crore. River Pamba of Kerala is included under NRCP. River Ramzan in Kishanganj, Bihar falls within Ganga river basin system which is covered under Namami Gange programme. State/UT-wise details of rivers covered under NRCP, Namami Gange and Ganga Action Plan (GAP) are given at Annexure.Under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) programme of Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, 889 sewerage & septage management projects amounting to Rs.34205 crore have been taken up, of which 400 projects costing Rs.9056 crore have been completed so far. Under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) 2.0 launched in October, 2021, Rs.15883 crore has been allocated to States/UTs for waste water/used water management, including setting up of STPs and fecal sludge treatment plants (FSTP).***** ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (A) TO (E) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 253 TO BE ANSWERED ON THE 03.02.2022, REGARDING ‘RIVER REVITALISATION PROJECTS’ a)	State-wise details of rivers covered under National River Conservation Plan(excluding Ganga and its tributaries) S.
