                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING (RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a),(b)and(c) The Ministry releases funds under the Members of Parliament         Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) in accordance with the scheme guidelines  and implementation in the field is undertaken by the District Authorities in accordance with the State Government’s technical, administrative and financial rules. Sanction, rejection and completion of the work are to be done by the District Authorities as per the time line stipulated in MPLADS guidelines. Ministry regularly follows up with the District Authorities to submit the fund related documents online for timely release of funds. Training  to the District Officials is also being imparted. Given  the distinct nature of the MPLAD Scheme, several measures are also taken by the Ministry from time to time to reduce delay in execution of works such as:-  (i)   Officers of the Ministry are deputed to visit various States/ Districts to review the implementation of the Scheme. (ii) Ministry conducts Annual Review Meeting with the Nodal Departments of all the State/ UT Governments to discuss the implementation  of the scheme. Ministry also impresses upon the Nodal Departments of the State/ UT Governments to convene Meetings under the Chairmanship of Chief Secretary with the District Authorities and Members of Parliament at least once in a year. Quarterly review meetings are conducted by the District Authorities with the implementing agencies at district level to review the progress of implementation of MPLAD Scheme. (d), (e) and (f)  The Members of Legislative Assembly Local Area Development ( MLA LAD) funds may vary across states and is under the domain of respective State/UT Government.  There is no  proposal under consideration of the Government to increase the MPLADS funds at present.                                                 *****
