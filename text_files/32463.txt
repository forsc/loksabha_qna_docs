The wage rate is made applicable from 1st April of each financial year. However State Governments can provide wage over and above the wage rate notified by the Central Government. State/UT-wise notified wage rates for unskilled worker under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA for the financial years 2020-21 and 2021-22 is given at Annexure. *******
