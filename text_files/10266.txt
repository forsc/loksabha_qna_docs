As on 21st November, 2019, SIDBI has committed Rs 3123.20 Cr. to 47 SEBI registered Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs). These funds have raised a corpus fund of Rs. 25,728 Crore. Rs. 695.94 Crore have been drawn from the Fund of Funds for start-ups.  Rs. 2,669.83 Crore have been invested into 279 startups.  There is no provision for State/UT-wise distribution of funds under FFS.(f):	2,85,890 jobs are reported by 23,657 DPIIT recognized start-ups, as on 4th December 2019.
