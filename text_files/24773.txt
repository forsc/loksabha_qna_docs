ANSWER




                                                         (a)	The impact of Covid-19 at Major Ports started from March 2020. There was a considerable decline in the total traffic and containers traffic. However, the recovery has started since June 2020. 	The following steps taken by Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways:-(i)	Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways has issued necessary directions from time to time to all ports to put in place a screening, detection and quarantine system of disembarking Seafarers or cruise passengers, to obtain self-declaration from arriving crews/passengers, to install thermal scanners and procure Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) readiness, N-95 masks, create awareness among the travelers at Ports and Port officials. They were also advised to arrange vaccination of all their employees, their kith and kin, vaccination centre for seafarers, keep adequate stock of life saving drugs and injections (Remdesivir, etc.) at the port hospitals, improved ICU care facilities, and make ventilators and oxygen available. Further, various advisories/circulars were issued to provide relief to the trade in terms of non-charging of demurrage and other penalties/charges. Various technological/digital inductions were expedited to maintain smooth functioning without human interference viz. E-invoice, E-payment, E-DO and E-BoL at PCS1x. Further, in view of the excessive requirement of Oxygen and related equipment in the country, all Major Ports were directed to waive-off all charges (including vessel related charges, storage charges etc.) and accord highest priority in the berthing sequence to the vessels carrying consignments of Medical Grade Oxygen, Oxygen Tanks, Oxygen Bottles, Portable Oxygen Generators, Oxygen Concentrators, Steel Pipes for manufacturing Oxygen Cylinders and associated equipment for three months w.e.f. 25th April 2021.(b)	 There is no job loss in this sector. However, Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways has given monetary compensation of Rs.50 lakhs to the dependent Members/legal heirs of the employees who lost their lives due to acquired covid infection at work place.                                               ****
