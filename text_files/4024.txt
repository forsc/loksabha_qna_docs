                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE  ???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????   (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (f):	 During 2018-19, about 561 lakh farmer applicants were covered at subsidized premium rates under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) in the country.  Out of which, about 85 lakh farmers got insurance claims due to loss of their insured crops.Similarly, in Haryana during the same period 14.93 lakh farmers applications were covered under PMFBY and 9.68 lakh eligible insured farmers got insurance claims.  Claims for few crops/areas for Kharif 2018 and the claims  for almost all  crops/areas of Rabi 2018-19 are not reported by the concerned insurance companies.In Kurkushetra district 62,732 farmers applicants were covered under PMFBY and 21,791 eligible insured  farmers got admissible claims during this period.It is Government’s endeavour to increase the coverage to atleast 50% of Gross Cropped Area (GCA) in the country.  For this various steps like persuading the States/Union Territories to notify more and more number of crops and areas under the scheme,  lower rates of premium for farmers, technical support to stakeholders including States, 50% assistance to States for use of technology and towards conducting of incremental Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs), services of Common Service Centres (CSCs) for coverage of non-loanee farmers etc. have been taken by the Government to increase coverage under the scheme.    ********
