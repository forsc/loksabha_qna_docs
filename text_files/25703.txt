JITENDRA SINGH)(a) to (c):   The Government had constituted a Committee in the year of 2013 under the Chairmanship of the then Secretary, Department of Social Justice and Empowerment to make in-depth analysis of the reasons for non-filling up of reserved vacancies/ less employability of SCs, STs and OBCs in Government Sector and to suggest remedial measures.In view of the recommendations of the Committee, Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT) issued instructions in December, 2014, to all Ministries/Departments to constitute an In-House Committee for identification of backlog reserved vacancies, to study the root cause of such vacancies, to initiate measures to remove the factors causing such vacancies and to fill them up through Special Recruitment Drives.DoPT monitors the progress in filling up of backlog reserved vacancies for SCs, STs and OBCs with ten Ministries/Departments, having more than 90% of the employees of Central Government. These Ministries/ Departments collect such data from their attached/subordinate offices, Central Public Sector Undertakings, Financial Institutions, Nationalized Banks, etc and, thereafter, furnish consolidated data to DoPT. Ministry/Department-wise and category-wise (i.e. SCs, STs and OBCs) details of backlog reserved vacancies, as on 01.01.2020, as received from eight Ministries/Departments, are enclosed. Filling of vacancies, along with backlog reserved vacancies, is a continuous process.*****
