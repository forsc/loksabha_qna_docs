As regards the private sector steel plants, it is stated that steel is a deregulated sector and the data/information in this regard is not maintained by the Government. The role of the Government is that of a facilitator which lays down broad policy guidelines for creating conducive environment for improving efficiency and performance of the Steel Sector. The Steel companies both public and private, enjoy operational and financial autonomy. The managerial and financial strategies are made by the individual companies from time to time, based on the commercial considerations and market dynamics. (e) 	Domestically Manufactured Iron & Steel Products Procurement Policy (DMI&SP) mandates to provide preference to domestically manufactured steel products both from public and private sector in Government procurement. ********
