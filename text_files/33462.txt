                                                        (a)&(b)		No Sir.(c)			Government of India in partnership with States is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) to provide tap water supply to every rural household by 2024. Under JJM, the fund sharing pattern between Centre and States/ UTs, is 100% for Union Territories, 90:10 for North Eastern & Himalayan States including UT of Jammu & Kashmir and 50:50 for other States. To bring in ‘sense of ownership and pride’ among rural communities, community contribution has been mandated, which is 5% of capital cost towards in-village water supply infrastructure in hilly, forested, and in villages having more than 50% SC/ ST population and 10% in the remaining villages.(d) &(e)		The Fifteenth Finance Commission (FC-XV) has recommended a total of ?2,36,805 crores for duly constituted Rural Local Bodies (RLBs) in 28 States for the period2021-26 including for the areas which are not required to have Panchayats (Fifth and Sixth Schedule areas and Excluded Areas). Out of the total grant earmarked for Panchayati Raj institutions, 60 percent is earmarked for drinking water supply, rainwater harvesting and sanitation (tied grant) while 40 percent is untied and is to be utilized at the discretion of the Panchayati Raj Institutions for improving basic services.Rural local bodies may utilise tied grant components in convergence with any other scheme, aided by the Union Government for drinking water and sanitation including Jal Jeevan Mission, Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen (SBM-G) etc., to cover maximum population within the jurisdiction of the concerned local body or to improve the quality of the assets proposed to be constructed for the purpose.
