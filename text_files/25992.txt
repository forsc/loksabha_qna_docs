ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) to (f)      Ministry issues sanction for construction of NH works on the proposals received from its implementing agencies such as State PWDs, NHAI, NHIDCL & BRO etc. No such proposal/estimate has been received from Government of Kerala (State PWD) for seeking sanction for junction development at National Highway-66 between km 147 to 148. The construction of proposed Kannur bypass as part of 6-laning of Thaliparamaba to Muzhippilangad section of NH-66, for which agreement has already been signed on 31.03.2021, will detour this junction. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is maintaining the existing NH-66 in traffic worthy condition through Concessionaire during development period. Construction of Kannur Bypass will ease traffic block problem in Kannur City.  *****
