                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) to (c): 	Yes Sir. In the absence of any exact data regarding the migration of people during the COVID-19 lockdown in the country in 2020, the Government liberally allocated free of cost foodgrains to cater to about 8 Crore migrants/stranded migrants including migrant labourers. Accordingly, during COVID-19, 2020, as part of the Economic Measures [Atma Nirbhar Bharat Scheme (ANBS)] , the Government  allocated free foodgrain, @ 5 kg per person per month  free of cost for the migrants/stranded migrants, who are not covered under National Food Security Act (NFSA) or State Scheme PDS Cards for two months (May & June, 2020) to benefit approximately 8 crore migrants/stranded migrants to ensure availability of free foodgrain to them. Under this Scheme, Govt. of India had also decided to bear the entire cost on account of such distribution, without burdening the States/UTs. The States/UTs were asked to assess the number of migrants/stranded migrants during this crisis in their respective jurisdictions. All the States/UTs put together, after their overall assessment on the ground, had estimated a total of about 2.8 Crore such migrants/stranded migrants, who did not posses any ration card for assistance under the ANBS and it is worthwhile to mention that provision for 8 Crore potential migrants was far sufficient to actually cater estimated number of 2.8 Crore migrants/stranded migrants. The States/UTs were given the responsibility of identifying the migrants/stranded migrants.Accordingly, the Government allocated about 8.00 LMT foodgrains (2.44 LMT wheat and 5.56 LMT rice) under this scheme. During the two months period of May-June 2020, States/UTs lifted a total of about 6.41 LMT forodgrains and a total quantity of about 2.74 LMT of foodgrains were distributed to an average of about 2.74 Crore migrants/stranded migrants (i.e. nearly 98% of the total estimated number of migrants/stranded migrants). The State/UT-wise distribution/utilization pattern of the foodgrains under ANBS of 2020 is at Annexure I.ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) to (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION No. 3556 FOR ANSWER ON 10.08.2021 IN THE LOK SABHA Foodgrain Distribution under Atma Nirbhar Bharat  SchemeSr.	State/UT	Total Allocation	Total lifted quantity from FCI	Total Distributed Quantity under ANB	Total migrants covered per month 	 	(in MTs)	(in MTs)	(in MTs)	 1	Andaman & Nicobar Islands	61	61	60	5,9502	Andhra Pradesh	26,823	26,823	7	6803	Arunachal Pradesh	820	819	799	79,8794	Assam	25,153	21,582	15,712	15,71,1905	Bihar	   86,450 	         86,450 	         86,449 	            86,44,945 6	Chandigarh	         275 	              275 	               146 	                 14,580 7	Chhattisgarh	    20,077 	           2,108 	             1,964 	              1,96,430 8	Daman & Diu D&NN	285 	285 	159 	15,900 9	Delhi	7,273 	           7,273 	               4,544 	              4,54,440 10	Goa	         532 	              532 	    22 	                   2,160 11	Gujarat	    38,254 	         33,581 	                  287 	                 28,656 12	Haryana	    12,649 	            8,337 	               7,959 	              7,95,885 13	Himachal Pradesh	      2,864 	           2,864 	              2,028 	             2,02,758 14	Jammu And Kashmir	      7,241 	           3,035 	               1,958 	              1,95,800 15	Jharkhand	    26,370 	         26,370 	               717.2 	                 71,718 16	Karnataka	    40,193 	         40,193 	             11,600 	            11,60,007 17	Kerala	    15,480 	         15,480 	               2,142 	              2,14,150 18	Ladakh	         144 	                34 	                    33 	                   3,274 19	Lakshadweep	           22 	                22 	                    15 	                   1,450 20	Madhya Pradesh	    54,642 	           1,963 	                1,754 	              1,75,399 21	Maharashtra	    70,017 	         34,509 	             17,315 	           17,31,500 22	Manipur	   2,457 	           2,457 	                  676 	                 67,600 23	Meghalaya	      2,146 	           2,145 	               2,145 	              2,14,500 24	Mizoram	         668 	              668 	                  250 	                25,000 25	Nagaland	      1,405 	           1,405 	                1,405 	              1,40,463 26	Odisha	    32,360 	            630 	                  630 	                 63,000 27	Puducherry 	        628 	              628 	                    73 	                   7,340 28	Punjab	    14,145 	          14,145 	             10,902 	            10,90,200 …….2/--2-29	Rajasthan	    44,662 	         44,600 	             42,478 	            42,47,800 30	Sikkim	         379 	              378 	                  315 	                 31,500 31	Tamil Nadu	    35,734 	         35,734 	               1,449 	              1,44,944 32	Telangana	    19,162 	     19,162 	                  180 	                 17,995 33	Tripura	      2,483 	           2,483 	                    22 	                   2,193 34	Uttar Pradesh	 1,42,033 	      1,40,637 	             11,809 	            11,80,924 35	Uttarakhand	      6,196 	           2,905 	                  383 	                 38,277 36	West Bengal	    60,184 	         60,184 	             45,894 	            45,89,400 Grand Total	8,00,267	6,40,757	2,74,279	2,74,27,887*
