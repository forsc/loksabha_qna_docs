                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a)  As on 01.02.2022, Oil Marketing Companies(OMCs) have released 8.99 crore LPG connections under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana(PMUY) which includes PMUY Phase-I and Ujjwala 2.0.(b)   No State/UT wise target was fixed under PMUY Scheme. As on 01.02.2022, OMCs have released 2.03 lakh LPG connections under PMUY in Aurangabad District of Bihar. (c)  All the domestic consumers including consumers enrolled under PMUY get refills at non-subsidised rate and the applicable subsidy is directly transferred into their registered bank accounts. The Government has released Rs. 11,895 crore in the Financial Year 2020-21 as subsidy for various schemes related to domestic LPG. (d) Distribution of PDS Kerosene within the States/Union Territories(UTs) under Public Distribution System(PDS) network to various categories of ration card holders/consumers is the responsibility of the concerned States/UTs.  Scale and criteria of distribution are also decided by respective State/UT. However, along with  other factors, increased penetration of LPG has contributed to 11 States/UTs  becoming PDS Kerosene free.(e) Release of LPG connections is a continuous process and LPG distributors are under instructions to immediately register any request for new LPG connection all over the country, including in the State of Bihar. Further, Government have taken several steps to ensure that all households in the country have LPG connections, which include, deposit free LPG connection under PMUY, hassle free connections, 5 kg cylinders, secondary connections for an existing LPG connection holder, option to apply online for new connection including PMUY and release of e-subscription vouchers, organizing LPG panchayats and public awareness campaigns involving State/UT Governments etc. ******
