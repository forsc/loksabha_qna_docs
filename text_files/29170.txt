                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND     ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (d) Indian Railways had discontinued all regular passenger carrying trains w.e.f  23.03.2020  to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic and only special trains were operated keeping in view health advisories to manage the pandemic efficiently.  Further, Indian Railways do not run train services on State-wise basis as railway network straddles across State boundaries. However, over Palakkad division of Southern Railway which, primarily serves Northern part of the Kerala state, all Mail/Express services except 8 train services are being operated as regular services.                       At present, Season ticket holders of North Kerala are permitted to travel in unreserved coaches of 18 trains.*****
