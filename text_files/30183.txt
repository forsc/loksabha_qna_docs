ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) & (b) Yes, Sir. Ministry of Civil Aviation has issued National Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) Policy Framework on 24 October 2021 for, inter-alia, facilitating safe and seamless transfer of goods by unmanned aircraft systems within and across zones. ;    On 24 September 2021, the drone airspace map of the country has been published on the digital sky platform. The map demarcates India''s entire airspace into red, yellow and green zones. Operation of drones in red and yellow zones is subject to permission from the Central Government and concerned Air Traffic Control authority respectively. No approval is required for operation of drones in green zones which means the airspace upto a vertical distance of 400 feet. ;    The UTM policy framework is a dynamic document subject to changes based on technological advancements, actual experiences and other developments in airspace management systems. The UTM Policy Framework seeks to achieve the phased objective of segregation to accommodate and integrate unmanned aircraft systems into the Indian airspace for which UTM and Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems are required to communicate with each other at the systems level.    The National UTM Policy Framework is to be implemented based on the outcome of the experiments to be conducted by the Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management Service Providers (UTMSP). The Government plans to publish a Request for Expression of Interest (RFEOI) for UTM experiments. The duration of such UTM experiments will not exceed six months. The experiments will be outcome-based and each participating UTMSP will propose recommendations as per the RFEOI requirements.
