                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) :  The Supreme Court, in the case of Imtiyaz Ahmed versus State of Uttar Pradesh & Others, inter-alia, asked the Law Commission of India to evolve a method for scientific assessment of the number of additional courts to clear the backlog of cases. In 245th report in the year 2014, the Law Commission observed that filing of cases per capita varies substantially across geographic units as filings are associated with economic and social conditions of the population. As such Law Commission did not consider the judge population ratio to be a scientific criterion for determining the adequacy of the judge strength in the country. The Law Commission found that the “Rate of Disposal” method, to calculate the number of additional judges required to clear the backlog of cases as well as to ensure that new backlog is not created, is more pragmatic and useful.(b): 	In May, 2014, the Supreme Court asked the State Governments and the High Courts to file their response to the recommendations made by the Law Commission.  In August 2014, the Supreme Court asked the National Court Management System Committee (NCMS) to examine the recommendations made by the Law Commission and to furnish their recommendations in this regard.  NCMS submitted its report to the Supreme Court in March, 2016. It has, inter-alia, observed that in the long term, the judge strength of the subordinate courts will have to be assessed by a scientific method to determine the total number of “Judicial Hours” required for disposing of the case load of each court. In the interim, the Committee has proposed a “weighted” disposal approach – disposal weighted by the nature and complexity of cases in local conditions.  As per the direction of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in its Order dated 02.01.2017, the Department of Justice has forwarded a copy of interim report of the NCMS Committee to all State Governments and High Courts to enable them to take follow up action to determine the required Judges Strength of district judiciary based on the NCMS report. (c):	The sanctioned strength, working strength and vacancies in District & Subordinate Courts as on 05.12.2019 is given in Annexure-I and in High Courts as on 01.12.2019 in given in Annexure–II.(d) and (e): Filling up of vacancies in the High Courts is a continuous, integrated and collaborative process between the Executive and the Judiciary. It requires consultation and approval from various Constitutional Authorities both at the State and Central level. While every effort is made to fill up the existing vacancies expeditiously, vacancies do keep on arising on account of retirement, resignation or elevation of Judges and increase in Judge strength. Sanctioned strength of Judges of High Courts has been increased from 906 in May, 2014 to 1079 currently. Due to combined efforts of Government  and Judiciary, 126 Judges in 2016, 115 Judges in 2017, 108  Judges in 2018 and 72 Judges in 2019 (as on 05.12.2019) have been appointed in High Courts.As per the Constitutional framework, the selection and appointment of judges in subordinate courts is the responsibility of the High Courts and State Governments concerned. However, the Union Government, on its part, has been taking up the matter of filling up of vacant positions in District & Subordinate Courts with the States and High Courts. In August, 2018, Union Minister of Law & Justice has written to all Chief Justices of High Courts to monitor status of vacancies regularly and to ensure proper coordination with State Public Service Commission to fill up vacant posts stipulated by Supreme Court in Malik Mazhar Sultan case. In addition, series of meetings were held with Registrars General of all High Courts and Law Secretaries of all State Governments / UTs through Video Conferencing in January, 2018, July, 2018, November, 2018 and September, 2019 to follow up on filling up posts of Judicial Officers in District and Subordinate Courts. Department of Justice has hosted a MIS web-portal on its website for reporting and monitoring of sanctioned and working strength, and vacancies of Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Courts on monthly basis. Sanctioned and working strength of Judicial Officers in District and Subordinate Courts has been increased as follows:As on	Sanctioned Strength	Working Strength31.12.2013	19,518	15,11505.12.2019	23,597	18,144Annexure - ISanctioned Strength / Working Strength and vacancies in District & Subordinate Courts as on 05.12.2019Sr. No.	Name of State / UT	Total Sanctioned  Strength	Total Working Strength	Total Vacancy 1	Andaman and Nicobar	0	13	-132	Andhra Pradesh	597	529	683	Arunachal Pradesh	41	27	144	Assam	441	412	295	Bihar	1847	1152	6956	Chandigarh	30	29	17	Chhattisgarh	468	394	748	D & N Haveli	3	3	09	Daman & Diu	4	3	110	Delhi	799	680	11911	Goa	50	43	712	Gujarat	1506	1185	32113	Haryana	772	475	29714	Himachal Pradesh	175	152	2315	Jammu and Kashmir	290	232	5816	Jharkhand	677	462	21517	Karnataka	1345	1106	23918	Kerala	536	461	7519	Lakshadweep	3	3	020	Madhya Pradesh	2021	1504	51721	Maharashtra	2189	1942	24722	Manipur	55	39	1623	Meghalaya	97	49	4824	Mizoram	64	46	1825	Nagaland	33	25	826	Odisha	919	771	14827	Puducherry	26	11	1528	Punjab	675	579	9629	Rajasthan	1428	1121	30730	Sikkim	25	19	631	Tamil Nadu	1224	1087	13732	Telangana	413	334	7933	Tripura	120	96	2434	Uttar Pradesh	3416	2012	140435	Uttarakhand	294	228	6636	West Bengal	1014	920	94	TOTAL	23597	18144	5453Annexure-IIStatement showing Sanctioned strength, Working Strength and Vacancies of Judges in High Courts (As on 01.12.2019)Sl.
