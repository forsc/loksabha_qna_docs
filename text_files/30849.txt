                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI PANKAJ CHOUDHARY)a)	The Government has introduced a Narcotic Drug and Psychotropic Substances Amendment Bill, 2021 in the Lok Sabha on 6.12.2021.b)	Yes, the Hon’ble court had directed to take appropriate steps for amendment as required in Section 27A to rectify the anomaly.c)	The provisions of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Amendment Act, 2014 came in to effect from 01.05.2014. Prior to the amendment, clause (viiia) of section 2 of the said Act, contained sub-clauses (i) to (v), wherein the term ‘illicit traffic’ has been defined. This clause was re-lettered as clause (viiib) by the NDPS (Amendment) Act, 2014 as a new clause (viiia) in Section 2 defining ‘essential narcotic drugs’ was inserted. However, inadvertently, consequential change was not carried out in Section 27A of the NDPS Act, which cause an anomaly. Though in the matter of Julie Singh Vs Union of India in the High Court of Bombay at Goa the hon’ble court with regard to Section 27A of the NDPS Act had held that object behind the legislation and the purpose for enacting the same is clearly discernible. Therefore, the legislative intent of the statute, has always been to read clause: (viiib) in section 27A, and already stood thereind)	The Hon’ble President has already promulgated the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021 (8 of 2021) on 30.09.2021 to rectify the aforesaid anomaly and to carry out the legislative intent of the statute. The Government has introduced a Narcotic Drug and Psychotropic Substances Amendment Bill, 2021 in the Lok Sabha on 6.12.2021.****
