SINGH (RETD))(a) & (b): Airports Authority of India (AAI), the Implementing Agency, has awarded 948 valid routes  after completion of four rounds of bidding under RCS- UDAN. As on 17-03-2022, 409 RCS routes have been operationalized by the Selected Airline Operators (SAOs). To encourage development of UDAN routes by airline operators, SAOs are granted exclusivity for operating air transport services / flights on an RCS Route under the Scheme for a period of 3 years. Out of these 409 routes, 126 routes have completed three years of exclusivity. Subsequent to completion of the exclusivity period, any airline operator may operate flights on that route subject to the prevailing applicable law. Till date about 90 lakh passengers have flown on the flights under the UDAN Scheme.(c) to (e): There is a delay in operationalizing some routes, and also discontinuation of the routes, for reasons which include:-;i) Adverse impact of COVID-19 pandemicii) Non-readiness of civil airports/heliports, which could be related to availability of land, creation of regional infrastructure, obtainment of  license from the Regulator etc.iii) Unsustainability of the operation on the awarded routes.;iv) Non-readiness of Selected Airlines Operators (SAOs)Airports Authority of India(AAI), the Implementing Agency has identified 154 RCS airports including 14 water aerodromes and 36 helipads so far under UDAN for operation of RCS flights.

An airport which is included in the awarded routes of UDAN and requires upgradation / development for commencement of RCS operations, is developed under "Revival/upgradation of unserved and underserved airports/heliports/water aerodromes" Scheme. The Government of India has approved a budget of Rs. 4500 crore for revival of existing unserved / underserved airports / airstrips of the State Governments, Airports Authority of India, Public Sector Undertakings and Civil Enclaves. An amount of Rs. 2097.22 crores has been reimbursed by the Ministry of Civil Aviation to AAI till February, 2022 under the scheme.
