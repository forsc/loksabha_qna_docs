MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a)to(e): A statement is laid on the table of the House. STATEMENT IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 182 FOR ANSWER ON 04.03.2020 BY SHRI SUSHIL KUMAR SINGH, M.P. REGARDING “COAL PRODUCTION”.(a): As per the current import policy, coal is kept under Open General License (OGL) and consumers are free to import coal from the source of their choice as per their contractual prices on payment of applicable duty. In view of limited domestic production of coking coal, coking coal will continue to be imported for use by the steel sector. Further, coal imported by power plants designed on imported coal and high grade coal required for blending purposes will also be imported in the country as this cannot be fully substituted by domestic coal. With enhanced domestic availability of coal, coal imports, which was growing at a compound annual growth rate of 22.86% between 2009-10 to 2013-14, has reduced to 1.96% between 2014-15 to 2018-19. The focus of the Government is on accelerating domestic production of coal through allocation of more coal blocks, pursuing with State Government for assistance in land acquisition and coordinated efforts with Railways for movement of coal.Recent steps taken up for growth in coal sector which are expected to result in enhanced coal production are as follows:•	Methodology for allowing allocatees of coal mines for specified end use or own consumption to sell upto 25% of actual production in open market (RoM basis) with payment of additional premium on such sale has been approved and 10 mines have been allocated in the year 2019 under this methodology.  •	Mineral Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, has enabled the allocation of coal blocks for composite prospecting license-cum-mining lease (PL-cum-ML) which will help in increasing of the inventory of coal/ lignite blocks for allocation. •	With the promulgation of Mineral Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, the repetitive and redundant provision requiring previous approval of Central Government  even in cases where the allocation or reservation of coal/ lignite block has been made by the Central Government itself has been done away with. This would significantly reduce the time taken for operationalisation of  coal/ lignite mines.•	Earlier, the mines in Schedule II and III of Coal Mines Special Provision (CMSP) Act could only be auctioned to companies that were engaged in specified end use. The promulgation of Minerals Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 has provided flexibility to the Central Government in deciding the end use of Schedule II and III coal mines under the CMSP Act. This would allow wider participation in auction of Schedule II and III coal mines, for a variety of purposes such as own consumption, sale or for any other purpose, as may be specified by the Central Government. Further, Coal India Limited (CIL) has also taken the following steps to enhance coal production: •	CIL and its subsidiaries have planned and implemented higher capacity mega mines (Capacity>10MTY) with high mechanization. CIL has identified mines/projects for further capacity expansion plan till 2030.  •	Portal based monitoring of on-going projects to ensure timely completion of projects.•	Introduction of Surface Miners in opencast mines to improve operational efficiency and cater to environmental needs. During 2018-19, around 50% of the opencast coal production in CIL was through Surface miners.•	Introduction of Mass Production Technology in underground coal mines: 2 mines are worked with Powered Support Longwall technology and 11 mines are worked with Continuous Miner technology. (b):  The details of closed coal mines during the last three years and the current year and those to be closed down in the coming years is given below:  Company	Sl.
