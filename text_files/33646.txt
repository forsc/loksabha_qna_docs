ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ (SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL)(a) to (c) The Central Sector Scheme, SVAMITVA, aims to provide the ‘Record of Rights’ to village household owners possessing houses in inhabited areas in villages with issuance of legal ownership rights (Property cards/Title deeds). It is being implemented with the collaborative efforts of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, Survey of India (SoI), State Revenue Department, State Panchayati Raj Department and National Informatics Centre. States need to sign Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with SoI for implementation of the scheme. So far 29 States, including State of Rajasthan, have signed MoU with SoI. The scheme is yet to be initiated in the State of Bihar since the MoU between State Government and SoI has not been signed. As on 29th January 2022, drone flying has been completed in 1,396 villages across the State of Rajasthan and Property Cards have been distributed to 582 beneficiaries in 38 villages of the State. The number of beneficiaries is known only after the completion of the survey process. As per the guidelines of the scheme, the SVAMITVA scheme is scheduled to be completed by March 2023 in the State of Rajasthan.(d) So far, the Survey of India has been released Rs. 20.4 crore for establishment of 85 Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) in Rajasthan. The Survey of India has also been released Rs. 7.8 crore for Large Scale Mapping (LSM) using drones in 13,000 villages of Rajasthan. No funds have been released to the state of Bihar since they have not signed the MoU.***
