                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (i): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (i) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.1569 BY SHRIMATI BHAVANA PUNDALIKRAO GAWALI TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 28.07.2021 REGARDING PENDING RAIL ROUTES IN MAHARASHTRA (a):  The Railway projects are sanctioned Zonal Railway-wise and not State/UT-wise as the Indian Railways’ network spans across various State boundaries. During the last 15 years i.e. 2005-06 onwards, a total of 147 New Line projects of 13,799 km length costing `2,81,972 crore have been included in Budget subject to requisite approvals. Out of these, 14 New Line projects of a total length of 1692 km costing `43,297 crore falling fully/partly in the state of Maharashtra have been included in the budget.(b):  During 2009-14, 7,599 km length (1727 km New Line, 3997 km Gauge Conversion and 1875 km Doubling) was commissioned at an average of 1520 km/year. During 2014-19, 13,124 km length (3035 km New Line, 3,993 km Gauge Conversion and 6,096 km Doubling) has been commissioned across the Indian Railways’ network which is 73% more than the commissioning during 2009-14 (7,599 km). During 2019-20, 2,226 km length (360 km New Line, 408 km Gauge Conversion and 1458 km Doubling) has been commissioned which is 46% more than average annual commissioning during 2009-14 (1,520 km/year). During 2020-21, 2,370 km length (286 km New Line, 470 km Gauge Conversion and 1614 km Doubling) has been commissioned which is 56% more than average annual commissioning during 2009-14 (1,520 km/year).(c):  As on 01.04.2021 across Indian Railways, 484 Railway projects of 51,165 km length, costing approx. `7.53 lakh crore are in different stages of planning/sanction/execution, out of which 10,638 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `2.14 lakh crore has been incurred upto March, 2021. As far as the  State  of  Maharashtra  is  concerned, 35  Projects  (16  New Line, 2 Gauge Conversion and 17 Doubling projects) costing `91,137 crore for 6,142 km length falling fully/partly in Maharashtra are under different stages of planning/ approval/execution, out of which 906 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `18,008 crore has been incurred upto March, 2021. The completion of any Railway project(s) depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, deposition of cost share by State Government in cost sharing projects, priority of projects, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project(s) site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions etc. and all these factors affect the completion time of the project(s), which is finally worked out at the completion stage. However, Railways is making all the efforts for expeditious completion of projects. (d):  No, Sir. Budget outlay has been provided to the projects in a rationalized manner and budget has been allotted to the projects which are in advance stage of completion, priority projects, important New Line & National projects, executable & important Gauge conversion projects and the projects which are important from the throughput enhancement considerations. Thus, focused attention is given in fund allotment, rather than thinly spreading the resources without commensurate results.(e):   Yes, Sir. Average annual Budget allocation in the Indian Railways for New Line, Gauge Conversion and Doubling works during 2014-19 has increased to `26,026 crore per year from `11,527 crore per year during 2009-14, which is 126% more than average annual  budget outlay  of  2009-14.The Annual budget allocation for these projects for Financial Year 2020-21 was `43,626 crore which is 278% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14. For Financial year 2021-22, highest-ever budget outlay of `45,465 crore has been provided for these works, which is 294% more with respect to average annual budget outlay of 2009-14. Similarly, Average Annual Budget allocation for Infrastructure and safety works, falling fully/ partly in State of Maharashtra, during 2014-19 has been enhanced to `4,801 crore per year from `1,171 crore per year during 2009-14, which is 310% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14 and budget outlay of `6,700 crore was provided for these projects for financial year 2020-21 which is 472% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14.  For financial year 2021-22, budget outlay of `7,277 crore has been provided for these works, which is 521% more with respect to average annual budget outlay of 2009-14. Details of all ongoing Railway projects including cost, expenditure and outlay are made available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in >Ministry of Railways >Railway Board >About Indian Railways >Railway Board Directorates >Finance (Budget) >Rail Budget/Pink Book (Year)> Railway wise Works Machinery and Rolling Stock Programme.(f):  After the sanction of the project, detailed field survey is carried out and land acquisition proposals are prepared and submitted to respective State Governments for processing the acquisition of land. (g):   Yes, Sir. (h):  No, Sir. Adequate fund has been provided for acquisition of land for priority projects.(i):    Does not arise.*****
