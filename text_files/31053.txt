ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND PENSIONS AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a) & (b):    Yes Sir, the Government has created a countrywide grievance redressal platform namely Centralised Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) accessible at https://pgportal.gov.in. Any citizen can lodge his/her grievances pertaining to the Central Ministries/Departments/State Governments/Union Territories (UTs) from anywhere. Every Ministry/Department in Government of India and State Government/UT have access to this system and grievances are resolved by the concerned Ministries/Departments/States/UTs. CPGRAMS is also accessible to the citizens through a Mobile App which is also integrated with UMANG platform. (c):  The Government of India has undertaken several measures to make CPGRAMS platform more pliable and user-friendly such as (i) CPGRAMS reforms 7.0 for guided registration through drop-down menu and direct transition of grievance to the concerned officers thereby reducing disposal time (ii) integration of State Grievance Portals with CPGRAMS (iii) Revision of time lines for disposal of grievances from 60 days to 45 days (iv) Introduction of appeal mechanism in CPGRAMS. Further, to ease the submission of Public grievances by the citizens Government has signed MoU with Common Service Centres (CSC) of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (Meity) to facilitate citizens to lodge the grievances. (d):   The details of State wise complaints received on CPGRAMS during the last three years from (2018-2020) and their disposal is given in Annexure. 	                                                                *****
