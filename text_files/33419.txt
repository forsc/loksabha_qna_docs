The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, vide Order dated 23.10.2018 in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 728 of 2015 had banned the production and sale of crackers other than Reduced Emission firecrackers (with 20–30% reduction in pollution). In addition, Hon’ble National Green Tribunal vide Orders dated 09.11.2020 and 01.12.2020 in Tribunal on its Own Motion Vs. Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change & Others had directed the following:1.	“There will be total ban against sale or use of all kinds of fire crackers in the NCR from midnight of November, 9 -10, 2020 to the midnight of November 30 - December 1, 2020, to be reviewed thereafter.” (also applicable to all cities/towns in the country where the average of ambient air quality during November (as per available data of last year) fall under ''poor'' and above category.)2.	“There will be total ban on sale and use of all kinds of fire crackers during Covid-19 pandemic in the NCR and all cities/towns in the country where the ambient air quality falls under the ‘poor’ and above category.”3.	“During Christmas and New Year, green crackers can be used from 11:55 pm to 12:30 am only at places where air quality is ‘moderate’ or below as directed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.”(b)In Tamil Nadu, there are 1433 Fireworks Industries in which 58597 workers are working.(c)& (d)The major cause of air pollution in Delhi are due to unfavourable meteorological conditions (October-February period) including industrial pollution, vehicular pollution, dust from construction and demolition activities, road and open areas dust, biomass burning, stubble burning, municipal solid waste burning, fires in sanitary landfills, burning of firecrackers etc.Source apportionment study has been carried out for Delhi-NCR by TERI-ARAI in the year 2018 which reveals that during winter months, Industries contribute 27% and 30% to PM10 and PM2.5 respectively, Dust (soil, road, and const.) contributes 25% and 17% to PM10 and PM2.5 respectively, and Transport contributes 24% and 28% to PM10 and PM2.5 respectively.*****
