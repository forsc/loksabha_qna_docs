Through recent amendments in the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 and associated rules, the Central Government has created the legal and institutional mechanism to enable States to collect stamp duty on securities market instruments at one place by one agency (through the Stock Exchanges  or Clearing Corporations authorized by the Stock Exchange or by the Depositories ) on one instrument.  A mechanism for appropriately sharing the stamp duty with relevant State Governments based on State of domicile of the buying client has also been included.  The collection and allocation mechanism of stamp duty for securities market instruments has been rationalized along with uniformity of the stamp duty on securities across States so as to facilitate ease of doing business and thereby build a pan-India securities market.(b)	 As per the data reported by Member Lending Institutions (MLIs), an amount of Rs. 163,103 crore has been sanctioned to 42,01,060 borrowers and an amount of Rs. 117,885 crore disbursed to 25,01,216 borrowers under ECLGS as on 09.09.2020.(c)	  A total number of 19 GST Council meeting have held between August, 2017 and January, 2020. In many of these meetings, the GST Council inter-alia made recommendations regarding late fees for late filing of return under GST such as reduction of amount of late fees, waiver of late fees in certain cases etc.(d)	  The Government of India has signed a loan agreement on August 24, 2020 with AIIB for financing USD 500 million to Mumbai Urban Transport Project-III.  The loan closing date of the project is October 31, 2025. The objective of the Project is to improve the network capacity, service quality and safety of the suburban railway system in Mumbai.

Part 4: Institutional Strengthening, Capacity Building and Technical AssistanceStrengthening the Project Implementing Entity’s institutional and technical capacity and providing training and technical assistance to the same through the preparation of studies to enhance suburban rail operations and strategic sectoral planning.(e)	  There are 11 companies against whom cases of GST evasion have been registered by DGGI-DRI led teams.*****
