However, against a projected demand of 526 MT for power sector, many Power Houses linked with CIL have regulated the intake of coal and have only lifted about 398 MT of coal against the prorated demand of 474 MT upto February 2021. Therefore, adequate coal is available from CIL to cater the needs of the Power Sector.****
