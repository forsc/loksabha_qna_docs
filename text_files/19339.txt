ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI) (a)  The length of National Highways constructed till December, 2020 is 7767 kms which is in accordance with the construction target in the current fiscal year i.e. 2020-21. (b)   The length of National Highway projects awarded till December, 2020 in the fiscal year 2020-21 is 7203 km as compared to 3434 km during the same period in financial year 2019-20. (c) & (d)   29 projects in the length of 683 km & costing Rs.10,992 cr. are progressing at slow pace in the state of Tamil Nadu as on 31.12.2020. Details are at Annexure-I.These projects are delayed mainly due to land acquisition, utility shifting, non-availability of soil/aggregate, poor performance of contractors, environment/forest/wildlife clearances, ROB & RUB issues with Railways, public agitation for additional facilities, arbitration/contractual disputes with contractors etc.In order to ensure timely completion of the projects and their subsequent maintenance, regular meetings are held with project developers, State Governments and contractors.  Regular review meetings are held in Head Quarter by Ministry/ NHAI with Regional Officers, concessionaires /contractors to make the construction of projects hassle free. To expedite completion of these projects, various steps are also taken which include streamlining of land acquisition & environment clearances, exit for equity investors, premium re-scheduling, close coordination with other Ministries, revamping of dispute resolution mechanism.
