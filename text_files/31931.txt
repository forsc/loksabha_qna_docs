ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (e):  The World Health Organization and World Bank compile the incidence of catastrophic spending on health and incidence of impoverishment of various countries.  According to the National Health Accounts Estimates for India, the Government Health Expenditure as share of total health expenditure has increased from 28.6% in the year 2013-14 to 40.8% in the year 2017-18 and the Out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) has declined from 64.2% to 48.8% during the same time period. Keeping in view of financial hardships arising due to out-of-pocket expenditure, Government has taken multi-pronged initiatives to increase the public spending on healthcare. The Government has continued to allocate more funds to strengthen the National Health Mission (NHM). Allocation to NHM has increased from Rs. 27,989.00 crore in 2020-21 BE to Rs.31,100.00 crore in 2021-22 BE. Under National Health Mission (NHM), technical and financial support is provided to the States/UTs to upgrade capacity and enhance quality of the public healthcare system including support for ensuring sufficient supply of free essential drugs at public healthcare facilities towards the objective of providing accessible, affordable and quality healthcare to all those who access public health facilities. To ensure availability of essential drugs and reduce the OOPE of the patients visiting the public health facilities, Government has rolled out the Free Drugs Service Initiative (FDSI) under NHM. Other schemes such as free transport, free diagnostics, free dialysis, and free drug / Jan Aushadhi Kendras are initiatives that have contributed to reducing OOPE. Besides, Ayushman Bharat - PMJAY is an entitlement-based scheme, wherein all the eligible beneficiary families are covered from day one of the implementation of the scheme in the State/UT. AB-PMJAY provides health assurance of up to Rs.5 Lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary healthcare hospitalizations.  As of 28th November 2021, a total of 17.2 Crore Ayushman cards have been issued to the scheme beneficiaries. Further, a total of 2.49 Crore hospital admissions worth Rs. 28,863 Crore have been authorized through a network of approximately 24,000 empanelled public and private health care providers.***
