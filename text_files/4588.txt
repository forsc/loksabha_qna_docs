                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (c) The Renuka, Kishau and Lakhwar Vyasi projects in the States of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand have been declared National Projects by the Government of India in 2008 keeping in view of their importance from environmental and drinking water considerations.  The implementation of these projects rest with the concerned State Governments.  The States are required to obtain various approvals such as Statutory Clearances, approval from the Advisory Committee of Do WR, RD & GR on Irrigation, Flood control & Multipurpose Projects, Ministry of Jal Shakti, Investment Clearance etc. for implementing these projects.The Govt. of Uttarakhand has decided to take up Vyasi HE Project independent of Lakhwar Dam. Revised Cost Estimates (RCE) of Lakhwar Project amounting to Rs.5747.17 crore (Price Level: 2018) has been accepted by Advisory Committee of Do WR, RD & GR on Irrigation, Flood control & Multipurpose Projects in its 141st meeting held on 11.02.2019. However, National Green Tribunal (NGT) (Principal Bench) vide judgment dated 10.01.2019 directed Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of MoE & CC to appraise the Lakhwar Project afresh in terms of EIA notification 2006 and impose additional general and specific conditions as may be considered necessary. The NGT has directed to maintain the status quo till the project is reappraised.The RCE of Renukaji Dam Project (Price Level:2018) has been submitted by the Project Authorities to Central Water Commission(CWC) and is at various stages of appraisal.   Detailed Project report (DPR) of Kishau Multipurpose Project was submitted by the Project Authorities to CWC in the year 2010 and certain observations were communicated to them.  However, Project Authorities did not send compliance. Later, Project Authorities were requested to send the updated DPR which has also not been submitted by them.*****
