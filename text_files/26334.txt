                                                        (a) to (e): A statement is laid on the Table of the HouseStatement as referred to in reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No. *185 for answer on 02.08.2021 regarding "Measures announced for MSME Sector" by SHRI ANNASAHEB SHANKAR JOLLE and  SHRI B.Y RAGHAVENDRA        (a) to (c):I.	Yes sir, the measures announced so far include various long-term schemes/ programmes/ policies, which aim to benefit Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) also which are affected by COVID-19. Outcomes of these measures will be visible over a period of time. Details of key schemes recently announced so far related to MSME under Atmanirbhar Bharat, Budget for 2021-22 and recent financial package announced by Government in June 2021 are provided at Annex-1.II.	Multiple measures have been taken to support MSMEs, including their exports.  MUDRA provides refinance support to Banks / MFIs / NBFCs for lending to micro units having loan requirement upto 10 lakh under the Scheme of Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana. Government has launched schemes such as Credit Guarantee Scheme for providing access to credit to Micro and Small Enterprises, SFURTI scheme to organize the traditional industries and artisans into clusters to make them competitive, Cluster Development Programme for providing infrastructure support and enhance the competitiveness of Micro and Small Enterprises, providing skilled manpower to the industry, design and manufacturing of quality tools through Tool Rooms/Technology Centres etc. In addition to this, Ministry of MSME is implementing International Cooperation scheme to facilitate the MSMEs business delegations to visit / participate in international exhibitions/ trade fairs etc., of other countries for exploring new areas of technology infusion/ up-gradation, facilitating of joint ventures, improving market for MSMEs products, foreign collaborations amongst others. Government is also implementing the Niryat Bandhu Scheme for mentoring new and potential exporter on the intricacies of foreign trade through counselling, training and outreach programmes. ‘MSME clusters’ have been identified, based on the export potential of the product and the density of industries in the cluster, for focused interventions to boost exports.III.	Interest Equalization Scheme (IES) provides exporters a cheaper source of rupee credit for pre-shipment and post-shipment activities.  Presently IES covers 416 ITC-HS tariff lines at 4 digits at 3% subvention rates for merchants and manufacturer exporters, and all tariff lines with 5% rates for MSMEs. The Scheme has been extended till September 30, 2021. IV. RBI has taken several monetary and liquidity measures to keep the flow of credit uninterrupted to the productive sectors of the economy, including MSMEs. Some of these measures are listed in Annexe-1 (D). Overall, the RBI has since February 2020 announced liquidity enhancing measures worth ?17.2 lakh crore (8.7 per cent of nominal GDP of 2020-21).  (d) to (e): MSMEs in general and especially in the manufacturing sector are linked to the logistical supply chain of larger industries as most of such units function as ancillary suppliers or vendors This is also evident from the fact that the concentration of MSME is generally higher in the areas with higher industries base. Government of India is also working in this direction of integrating MSMEs with logistical supply chain of larger industries, by organizing Vendor Development Programmes in large organization/PSUs, helping MSMEs in the procurement of raw material, implementation of Public Procurement Policy, etc.  In this regard, the Public Procurement Policy for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSE) Order 2012 had mandated every Central Ministry/Department/PSU to set an annual goal for procurement of minimum 25% from the MSE sector. Total number of 149 CPSEs have uploaded details for 2020- 2021. The share of purchases from all MSEs amounts to Rs. 40442.86 crore (174701 MSEs benefited) which work out to be 28.12% of the total procurement. In addition, the Public Preference (Make in India) Order 2017 has mandated manufacturing, production of goods and services in India, in which preference for local manufacturers and service providers and local content requirement is supporting public procurement from local suppliers, especially by MSMEs.****** Annex – IMeasures taken so far to support MSMEsA.
