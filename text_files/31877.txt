At least 75% seats of the districts are filled by the candidates selected from rural areas. Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one JNV in each district of the country. All the districts of the country (as on 31st May, 2014), which have accepted the scheme, have been covered. JNVs have been sanctioned in all the 24 districts of Jharkhand State including Chatra and Latehar districts.Opening of new JNVs is a continuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of the permanent building and making available required temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV depends on availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority.*****
