ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	to (d): The U.S., in March 2018, has imposed additional tariff of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium imports from various countries, including India. The impact of the increase in these tariffs has been limited. In 2017-18, the share of US in India’s steel exports was 3.3% which came down to 2.5% in 2018-19 the year the tariffs were imposed. The U.S. has not imposed any tariffs recently on IT services from India. After the U.S has imposed additional tariffs on aluminium and steel imports in March 2018, India challenged the US measure by taking it to the Disputes Settlement Mechanism under WTO. ****
