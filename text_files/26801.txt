(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (b) & (e) The Government accords the highest priority to the welfare of farmers in the country. Agriculture is a State subject, However, in order to supplement the efforts of the States, the Government has been implementing several schemes for the welfare of the farmers covering various aspects of Agriculture. Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana (PMKSY) promotes micro irrigation, Sub Mission on Seed and Planting Material (SMSP) focuses on developing and strengthening infrastructure for production and distribution of quality seeds and Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojan (PMFBY) provides comprehensive crop insurance from pre- sowing to post harvest losses against non preventable natural risks at extremely low premium rate payable by farmers. Details of budget allocation for these schemes over last 5 years are given as Annexure-I. Government fixes MSP of 22 notified crops and Fair & Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane on the basis on the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP). From the agricultural year 2018-19, MSP for all mandated Kharif, Rabi and other commercial crops were increased with a return of at least 50 per cent over all India weighted average cost of production. Moreover a number of schemes such as PM-KISAN, Agriculture Infrastructure Fund, National Food Security Mission, Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture etc are being operated by the Government for the welfare of farmers.  (c) The schemes implemented by the Department are applicable to all farmers irrespective of age group. However, in 2019-20, Government introduced Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan Dhan Yojana (PMKMY), a voluntary pension scheme to landholding small and marginal farmers on attaining the age of 60 years.(d) Data on State wise productivity of food grains are attached as Annexure-II.
