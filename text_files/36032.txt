THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI SOM PARKASH)(a) to (c): 	Setting up of an Investment Clearance Cell (ICC) was announcedin the Budget 2020-21 with the objective to provide "end to end" facilitationand support to investors, including pre-investment advisory, provideinformation related to land banks and facilitate clearances at Centre andState level. The cell was to operate through an online digital portal.Envisioned as a one-stop shop for taking all the regulatory approvals andservices in the country, the ICC/ National Single Window System (NSWS)[www.nsws.gov.in] was soft-launched on 22nd September, 2021 by Hon''bleCommerce & Industry Minister.Currently 146 Central approvals across 21 Ministries/ Departments areenabled to be applied through the NSWS portal. 14 States’/UTs’ SingleWindow Systems have been linked with the NSWS Portal thereby providing access to approvals of these States/UTs to be applied through asingle login id. All concerned Ministries and Departments of the CentralGovernment and States have been requested to integrate their approvalprocesses with the NSWS.The total number of approvals required to set up any project in India variesfrom State-to-State and depends on many factors like size of investment,funding source, sector, environmental clearance, number and type ofemployment and the State/UT in which the project is being set up by theinvestor, etc. NSWS fulfills this requirement through the Know Your Approvals module(KYA) on the NSWS platform. The KYA is a dynamic, intelligentquestionnaire which is built incorporating the various variables of theinvestor like sector, size of investment, type of entity and the State in whichthe investment is made. The module provides an indicative list of bothCentral and State approvals based on the specific inputs provided by theinvestor. Currently, the KYA module has details of over 3400 approvalsacross 32 Ministries/ Departments and 16 States /UTs.Rajasthan is currently not integrated with NSWS. However, a preliminarydiscussion has been held with the State Government to apprise themabout the integration process to onboard the NSWS.******
