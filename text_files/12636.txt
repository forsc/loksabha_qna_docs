Government has increased the MSP of wheat from Rs.1840/- per quintal for 2018-19 to Rs.1925/- per quintal for 2019-20.Further, for increasing the production and productivity of wheat in the country, Government is implementing National Food Security Mission (NFSM) - Wheat in 126 districts of 10 States and 2 Union Territories of the country namely Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh. The interventions covered under the programme includes cluster demonstrations on improved package of practices, demonstrations on cropping system, Seed distribution of High Yield Varieties (HYVs), efficient water applications tools, etc.(c) & (d): 	An impact evaluation study of the programme of National Food Security Mission (including NFSM-Wheat) made during October, 2017 shows that as compared to 11th plan, 12th plan period showed increase by 1.95 m. ha, 8.95 m. tons. and 104 kg/ ha in the average wheat area, production and yield, respectively. Five states namely Madhya Pradesh (96.37%), Jharkhand (87.08%), Nagaland (70.16%), Himachal Pradesh (30.80%) and Chhattisgarh (23.45%) recorded higher wheat production during 12th plan over 11th plan.(e): 	In order to make agriculture profitable and sustainable, Government of India is implementing through State Governments, several Crop Development Schemes/Programmes such as National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India (BGREI), National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, Soil Health Card etc.Under these Schemes/Programmes, funds are provided to States for implementation of State specific agricultural strategies including incentives to farmers for use of quality seeds, improve soil health under Integrated Nutrient Management (INM), Integrated Pest Management (IPM), farm mechanization, etc. The States are also provided support for creation of agricultural infrastructure for optimal use of water and other natural resources.Government also keeps close watch on import of agriculture produce in the country and take necessary steps from time to time so as to restrict cheap import of agriculture produce and protect vulnerable farmers of the country by imposing Minimum Import Price, increasing import duties, imposing Quantitative restrictions on imports and restricting their import through licensing as and when required.Further, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), through its crop based institutes and All India Coordinated Research Projects (AICRPs), and in active collaboration with State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) is engaged in development of high yielding varieties/ hybrids of field crops including wheat to increase yield and production in the country. The research efforts of ICAR-Crop Science Division has led to the development and release of 40 high yielding and stress tolerant varieties/hybrids of wheat for Jharkhand (11), Madhya Pradesh (9) and Maharashtra (20) during 2014 to 2019.
