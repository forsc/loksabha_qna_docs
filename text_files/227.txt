ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR CULTURE AND TOURISM(PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a)to(c)	There is no such specific Adarsh Smarak Scheme being implemented by Archaeological Survey of India.  However, 100 numbers of monuments have been identified as Adarsh Smarak by the Archaeological Survey of India for development of public amenities. The list of Adarsh Smarak is at Annexure.  There is no separate budget allocation for  Adarsh Smarak and the expenditure is met from regular budget allocation of  Archaeological Survey of India.  (d)	At most of the monuments facilities/amenities have either been upgraded or provided. (e)	No, Sir. However, provision of facilities is always based on need at monument despite its Adarsh status/other monuments. (f)&(g)	Since identifying Adarsh Smarak is not a scheme therefore the State participation does not arise.
