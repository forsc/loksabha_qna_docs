ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS [SHRI KIREN RIJIJU]  (a) Shri Jagbir Singh from Agra, Shri Suboth Khandekar from Jhansi, Shri Tushar Khandekar from Jhansi, Shri Ashok Kumar from Jhansi, Mohammad Shahid from Varanasi, Shri Devesh Chauhan from Etawah, Shri K. D. Singh from Barabanki, Shri Ravinder Pal Singh from Lucknow, Shri Zafar Iqbal from Aligarh, Shri Danish Mujtaba from Prayagraj, Shri Lalit Kumar Upadhhaya from Varanasi, Mohammad Amir Khan from Prayagraj and late Shri Dhyan Chand from Prayagraj, include the hockey players from Agra and adjoining areas. (b) & (c) Sports being a State subject, the responsibility of development of sports related infrastructure, including stadium at Agra rests with the State Government. The Central Government supplements the efforts of the concerned State Government by bridging the critical gaps under Khelo India Scheme, which deals with sports infrastructure. Khelo India Scheme does not provide for creation of mega projects such as international stadium in the States / Union Territories.  ****
