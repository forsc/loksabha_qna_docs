ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE & MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING                                {SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR}(a)	 According to Ministry of Home Affairs, National Crime Records  Bureau (NCRB) has not published data on attacks in respect of separate categories of professionals, including journalists. However, as per monthly information collected for cases registered under section 325, 326, 326A & 326B IPC for attacks on journalists, State wise information for the period 2014-2016 is given at Annexure.(b)	 In pursuance of its policy to uphold the freedom of press, the Government does not interfere in the functioning of newspaper industry. The Government is committed to ensure the right to freedom of speech and expression enshrined under the Article 19 of the Constitution of India.  Therefore, there is no pre-censorship in Press in India. Press Council of India (PCI), a statutory autonomous body, has been set up under the Press Council Act, 1978 with twin objectives to preserve the freedom of the Press and to maintain and improve the standards of newspapers and news agencies in India. Government attaches highest importance to the safety and security to every citizen of the country including journalists. ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule (List II) to the Constitution of India and State Governments are responsible for prevention, detection, registration and investigation of crime and for prosecuting the criminals through the law enforcement agencies. The Ministry of Home Affairs has issued advisories to the State and UTs from time to time to maintain law and order, which are available on its website viz., mha.gov.in.  An advisory on safety of journalist was issued to States/UTs on 20th October, 2017.(c)  The Government has come across media reports carrying the result of survey ‘World Press Freedom Index 2019’ by ‘Reporters without Borders’. However, Press Council of India (PCI) has raised its concern about the authenticity and credibility of the reports, the basis on which the ranking is done, as also the methodology used to rank the nations. (d)	The Press Council of India had constituted a Sub-Committee to examine the issue of Safety of Journalists. The report of Sub-Committee submitted on 23.7.2015 carried various recommendations with regard to safety and security of Journalists. The Ministry of Home Affairs has examined the said report and opined that the existing laws are adequate for protection of the citizens, including journalists.(e)	Ministry of Information & Broadcasting implements a ‘Journalist Welfare Scheme’ to provide one time ex-gratia relief on urgent basis to journalists or their families under extreme hardship on account of death of journalists and to the journalists in case of permanent disability, major listed ailments and in case of accidents causing serious injuries necessitating hospitalization. *****
