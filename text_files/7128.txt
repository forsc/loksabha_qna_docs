ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b) NITI Aayog, in its report titled “Composite Water Management Index” published in June 2018, has mentioned that 21 major cities including Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chennai and New Delhi are expected to run out of groundwater by 2020 affecting approximately 100 million people. This is based on the estimates of annual groundwater replenishment and its extraction. However, it does not take into account the groundwater availability in the deeper aquifers. Names of such cities as intimated by NITI Aayog are given at Annexure.(c) to (e) Practices for efficient and sustainable management of water resources such as conjunctive use of surface water and ground water resources, participatory ground water practices, increasing water use efficiency amongst others need to be promoted on a large scale by involving all the stake-holders to deal with future water demand challenges. Water being a State subject, efforts to initiate suitable demand side and supply side interventions including conservation and management of water resources is primarily States’ responsibility. However, steps taken by the Central Government in this regard are at the following URL: http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf.Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has been constituted under Section 3(3) of the ‘Environment (Protection) Act, 1986’ for the purpose of regulation and control of ground water development and management in the Country. CGWA grants ‘No Objection Certificates’ (NOC) for ground water abstraction in 23 States/UTs through guidelines which are modified from time to time. Other States / UTs are regulating ground water development through their own Acts, notifications or Government Orders. Further, CGWA has also appointed the District Magistrate / District Collector of each Revenue District and Regional Directors of CGWB in these States as Authorized Officers, with power to enforce compliance of NOC conditions.Government of India launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan, a time bound campaign, with a mission mode approach intended to improve water availability including ground water conditions in the water stressed blocks of 256 districts in India. In this regard, teams of officers from Central Government along-with technical officers from Ministry of Jal Shakti were deputed to visit water stressed districts and to work in close collaboration with district level officials to undertake suitable interventions. *****ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) & (b) of Unstarred Q.
