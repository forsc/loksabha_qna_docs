ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b) A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed on 15.03.2017 between the Chennai Port Trust and Government of Puducherry to develop Pondicherry Port as a Feeder Port of Chennai Port. A ‘trial run’ was conducted at Puducherry Port by transporting Containers from Chennai Port by a special Container Vessel. During the trial run, it was observed that there were few areas in the Channel and mouth of the port where the draft was less. Therefore, dredging needs to be carried out on a regular basis to handle Containers Vessels.(c) & (d). Ministry of Shipping had already sanctioned an amount of Rs. 44 Crores under “Sagarmala Scheme” to take up the dredging work at Puducherry Port. Govt of Puducherry has obtained the requisite Environment Clearance and Coastal Regulation Zone clearance from Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change and invited tenders for work of  the Capital Dredging.                                          *****
