This survey is not applicable to other forest areas where claims under Forest Right Act, 2006 have not been rejected. 14,259 rejected polygons submitted by the nodal agencies have been analysed. (c)	The responsibility of protection of forests including prevention of encroachments lies primarily with the respectiveState/UT Governments. The Indian Forest Act 1927, State specific Forest Acts and Rules empower the State/UT Governments to prevent encroachment of forest land in the respective States/UTs. The State/UT Governments will act upon the encroachments, thus reported under the above-said satellite based analysis.***
