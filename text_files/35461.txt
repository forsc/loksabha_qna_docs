                                                        MINISTER OF TOURISM 			        (SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) to (e): 	The  Ministry of  Tourism  has  not  sanctioned  any tourism project in  the  State  of  Karnataka under its  Swadesh Darshan scheme, however, the Ministry of Tourism has already sanctioned 76 projects in 31 States/UT Administrations under the scheme. The Ministry has now revamped its Swadesh Darshan scheme for sanctioning of  new projects in the country,   following  a  destination and  tourist  centric  approach. In  addition,  the Ministry of  Tourism  under  its   ongoing scheme  of  ‘Pilgrimage  Rejuvenation  and Spiritual, Heritage, Augmentation Drive (PRASHAD)’  also  sanctions  projects in the   country for  development of  tourism infrastructure with the objective of integrated development of identified pilgrimage and heritage destinations.Development of Tourism is primarily responsibility of the State Governments/Union Territory Administrations.  The Ministry of Tourism  had advised the  State  Government  of Karnataka  for submission  of  proposal  to  be taken  up  under  Swadesh Darshan  scheme. The State Government of Karnataka has submitted a concept proposal for Development of Sri Chamundeshwari Devi Temple in Mysuru under PRASHAD scheme. Site  visit to  Chamundeshwari Temple  has  been  conducted  on  10th February, 2022 and  the  State  Government  has  set  the  target  to  submit the Detailed  Project  Report (DPR)  for  further  approval  of  project  under  PRASHAD  scheme. ********
