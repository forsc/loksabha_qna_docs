                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) Water resources projects are planned, funded, executed, and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priorities.

(b) to (d)   The details are given below:Sl. No.	Name of the project	Latest Approved cost (Rs. in crore)	Central Assistance (Rs. in crore)	Date of comple-tion	Ultimate irrigation potential (hectare) 1.	Rukura medium irrigation project	296.98 (2016 price level).	88.78 (of which  25.12 released during 2016-21 under PMKSY)	June, 2017	76482.	Ret medium irrigation project	768.46 (2016 price level)	190.4386 (of which Rs. 96.121 crore released during 2016-21 under PMKSY)	March, 2019	8500 (e)  The projects have since been completed.*****
