                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) to (e): The growth rates of Gross Value Added (GVA) in agriculture, industry and services sector along with the growth rates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) during the last three years are given in the table below: Table : Growth of Real GVA at Basic Prices by Sectors and GDP at Market Prices (percent)Sectors	2016-17	2017-18  2nd RE	2018-19 1st REGVA at basic prices	8.0	6.6	6.0       Agriculture, forestry &  fishing	6.8	5.9	2.4       Industry	7.7	6.3	4.9       Services	8.5	6.9	7.7GDP at market prices	8.0	7.0	6.1Source: National Statistical Office (NSO).     Notes: 2nd RE: Second Revised Estimates     1st RE: First Revised Estimates The government does not as such fix the target growth rate for various sectors. However, the government reviews the performance of various sectors regularly and takes necessary steps to enhance their growth. Some of the reform measures taken by the government in recent years include Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to strengthen the financial system, Goods and Services Tax (GST) to simplify the indirect taxation regime, Make-in-India programme to boost domestic manufacturing capacity, liberalization of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) Trinity towards greater transparency, efficiency and financial inclusion. Recently, the corporate tax rate has been cut to 15 per cent for new domestic manufacturing companies, which is amongst the lowest in the world. In December 2019, the government has announced the ?103 lakh crore National Infrastructure Pipeline which would significantly boost infrastructure and spur growth impulses in the economy. The Union Budget 2020-21 has announced a number of measures to support broad-based and inclusive growth. *****
