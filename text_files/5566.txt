ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a)  to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 5144 BY SHRIMATI S. JOTHIMANI TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 24.07.2019  REGARDING STOPPAGE AND ROBS AT MANAPPARAI STATION(a): Manaparai is an existing station on Villupuram-Tiruchchirappalli-Dindigul section for which doubling project has been commissioned in March 2018. There is no other survey work taken up for rail connectivity  to Viralimalai in Karur Constituency. (b): There is neither any station named “Kujilipalayam” nor any train named “Palani Express” existing on Indian Railways’ system. Further, Eriodu station is presently being served by 02 pairs of passenger trains which caters to the needs of the passengers of this station. Stoppage of additional train at Eriodu is operationally not feasible, at present. (c): Level Crossing (LC) No. 47 exists in Mayanoor station yard at    Km. 83/500-600 in Erode-Karur-Tiruchchirappalli section of Southern Railway. The traffic density at the level crossing is less than                1 lakh TVU.  Hence, it does not qualify for a Road Over Bridge/Road Under Bridge on cost sharing basis. (d): Presently, Mumbai, Delhi and Tirupati bound trains are already available from Tiruchchirappalli, which is 36 Km away from Manaparai station. Stoppage of additional trains at Manaparai is operationally not feasible, at present.*****
