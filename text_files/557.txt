ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	Union Government has no proposal under consideration to fix MSPs for State specific crops.  However, Government presently fixes minimum support prices (MSPs) for 22 mandated agricultural crops viz. paddy, jowar, bajra maize, ragi, arhar, moong, urad, groundnut-inshell, soyabean, sunflower, sesamum, nigerseed, cotton, wheat, parley, gram, masur (lentil), rapeseed/mustard, safflower, jute and copra and fair & remunerative price (FRP) for sugarcane on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP), after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned and other relevant factors.  In  addition, MSPs for toria and de-husked coconut are also fixed on the basis of MSPs of rapeseed/mustard and copra respectively.  These MSP crops cover approximately 99 per cent of the total agricultural production in the country. (c) & (d):	Minor crops like cluster sem (beans), moth (moth beans), gwar (cluster beans), lobia (black eyed beans), jeera (cumin seeds), dhania (coriander), lahsun  (garlic), isabgol, rendi, aloevera and mehandi are produced in some districts of Rajasthan, some  of which are perishable in nature. Government implements Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) for horticultural crops which are perishable in nature and some agricultural crops which are not covered under the MSP on the request of State/UT Governments concerned.  The objective of intervention is to protect the growers of these commodities from making distress sale in the event of a bumper crop during the peak arrival period when the prices tend to fall below economic levels and cost of production.*******
