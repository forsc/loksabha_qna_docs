MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a): As per the provisions of the Fuel Supply Agreement, the responsibility of transportation of coal is with the coal consumer. The ownership of coal is transferred to the concerned power plants after dispatch of coal from the loading point of the coal companies. CIL has continuously persuaded the linked power plants of Punjab to increase the coal intake and build up sufficient stock at their end. However, the power plants of Punjab regulated their coal intake for the first two quarters of the current fiscal.(b):  The details of the coal stock at the power plants of Punjab before and after the blockade are as per the table below:Name of the Power Plant	24.09.2020	23.11.2020	01.12.2020	28.02.2021	000 Tonnes	In days	000 Tonnes	In days	000 Tonnes	In days	000 Tonnes	In daysLehra Mohabbat	41.38	3	19.14	2	27.65	3	44.24	5Goindwal Sahib	25.48	4	0.18	0	105.42	22	255.92	53Nabha Power Rajpura	199.43	11	3.68	0	120.90	10	514.94	31Ropar TPS	92.62	10	64.35	8	64.04	8	66.2	9Talwandi Sabo TPP	188.58	8	7.65	0	173.16	11	178.18	8Total Stock of Punjab Power plants	547.49	8	95	2	491.17	10	1059.48	18 At present, there is no issue in coal supply to the Punjab based power plants and they are carrying a comfortable coal stock at their end.
