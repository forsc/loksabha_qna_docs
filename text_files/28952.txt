Subsequently IWMP was amalgamated as a Watershed Development Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (WDC-PMKSY) in 2015-16. A total number of 54 projects in preparatory stage were transferred to State in 2018 to implement them from their own budget. Therefore, DoLR has been financially supporting only 276 projects in State of Telangana.     Out of these, 276 projects, 191 projects have been reported as completed by State of Telangana. Remaining 85 projects are in advanced stage of completion.      Due to uncertainty posed by the pandemic COVID-19, State has not been able to complete planned activities. The State has got Rs. 67.26 crore unspent balance (as on 06.11.2021) which will be utilized for the completion of these projects by March, 2022. DoLR is regularly reviewing the progress of implementation of the scheme with Telangana. D.O. letters to Chief Secretary / Secretary have been written. Video Conferences with CEO, State Level Nodal Agency (SLNA), their officers and field visits to State by Senior Officers of the Department are also undertaken. During these reviews, completion of these projects have always being emphasized.     As per information received from State of Telangana, the district-wise details of projects sanctioned, projects completed and funds spent is given at Annexure.                                             *****                                                                                      Annexure    Annexure referred to in reply to part (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 288 for answer on 30.11.2021    District-wise details of number of projects, sanctioned, completed and funds spent for the projects in TelanganaSl.
