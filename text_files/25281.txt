ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) Yes, Sir.(b) India is ahead of many countries in terms of Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) and is improving its GER every year. Further, the Gender Parity Index (GPI) in Higher Education for India has quite improved from 0.92 in 2015-16 to 1.01 in 2019-20 indicating increased parity between males and females in the relative access to higher education in the country.(c) As far as the Gross Enrolment Ratio in Higher Education is concerned, (UIS data available at http://data.uis.unesco.org/ Sustainable Development Goals: Gross enrolment ratio for tertiary education by sex), India ranks nearly in the middle of various countries in 2019, the latest year for which comparable data is available. A detailed comparison of India with some selected countries at various stages of development, including BRICS and SAARC nations is in the table below.Gross Enrolment Ratio in Tertiary EducationYearCountry201420152016201720182019Afghanistan8.2......9.7..Pakistan9.79.29.09.39.0..Bangladesh13.9..17.918.220.624.0Ghana15.415.715.51615.717.2Nepal16.015.011.611.612.413.3Sri Lanka19.219.818.81919.621.1South Africa19.8..20.922.423.8..Azerbaijan23.225.525.927.127.731.5India25.426.826.827.428.128.6Indonesia30.933.335.436.436.3..Malaysia39.545.646.843.745.143.1China42.446.048.049.150.653.8Brazil50.251.350.751.653.3..United Kingdom56.656.558.460.061.4..Switzerland57.257.758.059.661.4..France61.562.864.765.867.6..Italy61.760.960.961.964.3..Canada65.664.866.468.970.1..Israel66.965.564.963.461.5..Belgium73.074.675.979.778.9..Russian Federation78.579.980.681.984.6..United States of America88.688.988.888.288.3..Republic of Korea94.994.394.094.395.9..(d) Yes, Sir.(e) The Government has approved the release of Performance Grading Index (PGI) 2019-20 for States and UTs and it is available at the link https://pgi.udiseplus.gov.in/PGI-State-2019-20-Brochure.pdf.(f) Policy reforms are a continuous process that is periodically revisited to align policy with societal needs and often targeted at systemic improvements. In this direction, the National Education Policy (NEP) was unveiled in July 2020 by the Government of India and the policy is being implemented in a phased manner.(g) National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has identified some of the major challenges currently being faced by the higher education system in India. They include:i. A severely fragmented higher educational ecosystem;ii. Less emphasis on the development of cognitive skills and learning outcomes;iii. A rigid separation of disciplines, with early specialisation and streaming of students into narrow areas of study;iv. Limited teacher and institutional autonomy;v. Lesser emphasis on research at most universities and colleges, and lack of competitive peer reviewed research funding across disciplinesvi. An ineffective regulatory system; andvii. Large affiliating universities resulting in low standards of undergraduate education.The Department of Higher Education has finalised a theme-wise implementation plan of NEP 2020 for higher education with various action points to overcome the challenges faced by the system and thereby deliver high-quality higher education, with equity and inclusion.The action points include:i. Establishing/transforming at least one HEI into large multidisciplinary HEI in or near every districtii. A stage wise mechanism for granting graded autonomy to colleges through a transparent system of graded accreditationiii. To end the fragmentation of higher education system by transforming HEIs into multidisciplinary universities.iv. Granting autonomy to Institutions and faculty to innovate on matters of curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment within a broad framework of higher education qualifications.The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), launched by the Ministry of Education in 2015, is an annual exercise that ranks institutions of higher education in India with a purpose to galvanize Indian Institutions towards a competitive environment that exists in today''s world. The key parameters used in India Rankings help institutions to work sincerely towards improving their national and international ranking.*****
