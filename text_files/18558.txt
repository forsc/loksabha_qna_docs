National Council for clinical establishments has approved minimum standards for hospitals, which among other norms also include list of legal requirements to be complied with by a hospital as made applicable by the local/State health authority.(b) to (d)  Health being a State subject, no such information is maintained centrally. It is for the respective State/UT Government to have monitoring mechanism to verify the authenticity of the claims made by the private hospital and take necessary corrective action accordingly.  (e)  Under the CE Act, 2010, the district registering authority has the power to cancel the registration (licences) of the private hospital, if conditions of registration are not being complied with.  Health being a State subject, it is within the ambit of the respective State/UT Government to implement the provisions of the Act and Rules there under.
