ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a): Construction of any amenities including toilets (Pay & Use / non Pay & Use) at stations is a continuous process and is undertaken depending upon category of  stations subject to inter-se priority and availability of funds. Zonal Railways either award contracts for maintaining toilets through ‘Pay & Use’ or maintain them in-house by deploying railway staff as per the situation (or) site conditions. At present, more than 950 stations have ‘Pay & Use’ (normal/deluxe or both) toilets over Indian Railways.Security has been identified as one of the priority areas by the Railways for strengthening and upgradation.  Measures initiated for strengthening of security over Railways in recent past include provision of CCTV cameras at important railway stations, operationalisation and upgradation of security helpline 182, installation of security equipment like baggage scanners etc. 132 baggage scanners have been provided under Integrated Security System.(b): The initiatives taken towards improvement of facilities for differently abled passengers (Divyangjans) include provision of wheelchairs at maximum stations and provision of other facilities like Battery Operated Vehicles (BOVs), escalators, lifts, ramps, drinking water taps, Braille sign indicators, etc at major railway stations.  Besides, disability inspectors are being appointed/nominated for providing assistance to Divyangjan. However, improvement of facilities to rail users, including Divyangjans, is a continuous process.  (c): Regular inspections are conducted at railway stations by various officials to monitor cleanliness in order to identify weak areas and take remedial measures.  Besides, CCTVs are being used for monitoring of cleanliness activities at major railway stations. Enforcement of penalty provisions for activities affecting the cleanliness at the railway premises have been intensified.  Besides Third party audit and ranking of stations on cleanliness is also carried out annually in order to give status check feedback and healthy competition over Zonal Railways.  *****
