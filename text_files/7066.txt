All such area is not under the ownership of the port trust. The suitability of waterfront land for port activities depends on type of back-up land, the available natural depths of the river, evacuation facilities, etc.. The port trust is into development of port facilities at Outer Terminal-II on the river at Haldia, port facilities at Salukkhali, ship-repair/building facilities at Howrah on port –owned land. Apart from development of Port’s own land, Kolkata Port Trust has encouraged private players for utilisation of riverfront land owned by them for creation of facilities for ship breaking at Kulpi. *****
