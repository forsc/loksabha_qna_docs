ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): Guru Nanak Dev''s 550th Parkash Purab is a very important event which will attract a large number of devotees from all over India and across the world. Ministry of Civil Aviation will encourage the airlines to provide more connectivity to Amritsar to meet the enhanced demand in this period.  Further, Air India has introduced Delhi-Toronto flight w.e.f. 27th September, 2019. This flight will provide connectivity to passengers flying from Amritsar to Toronto via Delhi. Further, Air India plans to restore the Amritsar-Birmingham flight.;(d) The Civil Aviation authorities of a few gulf countries have requested for enhancement of capacity by re-negotiations of bilateral agreements. However, as per National Civil Aviation Policy, 2016, the bilateral agreements can only be re-negotiated for enhancement of capacity entitlements if Indian carriers utilise 80% of their total capacity entitlements and seek additional traffic rights for further operations.
