ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (d): Government has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21.10.2016 to facilitate/stimulate regional air connectivity by making it affordable. As per the National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP) - 2016,  Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) is inter-alia implemented by way of revival of unserved or underserved airports. Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has approved the proposal on 06 March, 2017 for revival of existing un-served / underserved airports / airstrips of the State Governments, Airports Authority of India and Civil Enclaves at an estimated cost of Rs. 4500 Crore. Revival/development of airports/airstrips/helipads/heliports/water aerodromes is undertaken as RCS Airports under RCS bidding process, subject to firm commitment from airline operators as well as from the State Governments for providing various concessions. However, this scheme does not cover development of the new airports/airstrips.;RCS - UDAN is a market driven mechanism. Development of regional air connectivity routes is left to market forces. Based on the requests of the States routes are included in bidding for consideration of interested airlines. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN from time to time. State-wise list of airports connected under UDAN is attached in Annexure.
