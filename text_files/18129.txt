ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI  & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (d)  It is the responsibility of States/Union Territories (UTs) and local bodies to ensure required treatment of sewage and industrial effluent, before discharge into recipient water bodies to prevent and control of pollution therein. This Ministry has been supplementing efforts of the States/UTs by providing financial and technical assistance in abatement of pollution in identified stretches of rivers (excluding river Ganga and its tributaries), through the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) on cost sharing basis. Proposals for pollution abatement works/schemes in identified towns along polluted river stretches are received from the States/UTs from time to time for consideration under the NRCP, which are sanctioned based on their prioritization, conformity with the NRCP guidelines, availability of Plan funds, etc. For the State of Maharashtra, pollution abatement works have been sanctioned under NRCP at a total cost of Rs.1182.86 crore, and sewage treatment capacity of 260 mld has been created in 8 towns, as per the details given in Annexure.   Different pollution abatement works/schemes admissible under the NRCP include sewer network, interception & diversion, sewage treatment plants, low cost sanitation, afforestation, etc. These are implemented by the concerned States/UTs and their agencies through established system for award of works, wherein techno-economic viability of different treatment options and/or choice of state of the art technology vis-a-vis the mandate of NRCP and the standards/norms applicable, remain crucial considerations. ***** ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.1843 to be answered on 22.09.2020 on ‘River Restoration Projects’.S.No.	Town	River	Sanctioned Cost(Rs. in crore)	STP Capacity created (in mld)1.
