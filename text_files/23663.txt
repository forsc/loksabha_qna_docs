PATEL TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 24.03.2021 REGARDING RAIL CONNECTIVITY TO RAJASTHAN (a): Railway projects are not sanctioned State-wise,/ district-wise/  tehsil-wise, but sanctioned Zone-wise as Indian Railways’  network spans across various  State boundaries.   Further, Railway projects are taken up on the basis of remunerateveness, last mile connectivity, missing links and alternate routes, augmentation of congested/saturated lines, socio-economic considerations etc. depending upon throwforward of ongoing projects, overall availability of funds and competing demands. 	As on 01.04.2020, 5998 Route Kilometre length of Railway network is available in the State of Rajasthan. 	Further, as on 01.04.2020, 11  new line projects of total length 1228 Km falling fully/partly in the State of Rajasthan have been taken up to improve connectivity, out of which 69 Km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `1,930 crore has been incurred upto March, 2020.  District and  Tenshil Headquarters falling enroute  will be connected on completion of these projects.        Rajasthan is covered by Northern Railway, Western Railway, North Western Railway, West Central Railway and North Central Railway Zones of Indian Railways. The details of allotment of funds and expenditure project-wise and Zonal Railway wise are made available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in> Ministry of Railways> Railway Board> About Indian Railways>Railway Board Directorates> Finance (Budget), Pink Book (year)>Railway wise Works Machinery & Rolling Stock Programme.Average annual Budget allocation on infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/partly in Rajasthan during  2014-19 has increased to ` 2,951 crore per year from ` 682 crore per year during 2009-14. Thus, the average annual Budget allocation during 2014-19 is 333% more than average annual allocation of 2009-14. Budget allocation for these  projects in 2019-20 has been increased to `4,686  crore which is 587% more than average annual budget allocation of 2009-14, Budget outlay of ` 4,986 crore has been proposed for these projects for Financial Year 2021-22, which is 631% more than average annual Budget outlay of 2009-14.

However, train connectivity is generally available. Besides, introduction of new train is an ongoing process in Indian Railways subject to operational feasibility, traffic demand, availability of resources etc.(d): Survey for construction of new line between Jalore  to Udaipur via Sirohi Road (267Km) was completed in the year 2017-18.  As per the survey report, cost of the project was assessed as ` 6,626 crore with rate of return of (-) 6.20%. The project could not be taken forward being financially unviable. *****
