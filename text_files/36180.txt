ANSWER




(a)	and (b): TheGovernment is committed to Open, Safe & Trusted and Accountable Internet for users. Government is aware of the risk and danger posed by growing phenomena of dissemination of wrong and hateful information through some social media platforms. This Ministry does not track and monitor Apps or content appearing on social media platforms or online App stores unless they are explicitly reported to this ministry including Indian Computer Emergency Response Team  (CERT-In).(c)	to (h):   Government has noted the news articles about an App, namely, ‘Tek Fog’ that has been allegedly used to manipulate social media platforms. The said App is not present on any of the prominent online App Stores and APK stores. No technical vulnerability that makes social media intermediaries susceptible to manipulation as reported in the news articles have been reported to, or observed by, this Ministry.‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects as per the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. States/UTs are primarily responsible for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of crimes through their Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). The Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) at Centre and States take appropriate legal action as per provisions of law and when appropriate.*******
