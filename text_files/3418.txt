ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) Ground water levels in various parts of the Country are declining because of continuous withdrawal due to reasons such as increased demand of fresh water for various uses, vagaries of rainfall, increased population, industrialization & urbanization etc.NITI Aayog, in its report titled “Composite Water Management Index” (June 2018) has mentioned that 21 major cities are expected to run out of ground water by 2020. This is based on the estimates of annual ground water replenishment and its extraction. However, it does not take into account the ground water availability in the deeper aquifers.(b)  Water being a State subject, efforts to conserve and manage ground water including quality issues is primarily States’ responsibility. Among other initiatives, Government of Tamil Nadu has launched the ‘Kudimaramath’ water scheme for constructing and maintaining water bodies by the local communities. Hon’ble Prime Minister has written a letter to all Sarpanchs on 08.06.2019 regarding the importance of water conservation and harvesting and exhorted them to adopt all appropriate measures to make water conservation a mass movement.Government of India has launched the Jal Shakti Abhiyan which is a time bound campaign with a mission mode approach intended to improve water availability including ground water conditions in the water stressed blocks. Other steps taken by the Central Government to control ground water depletion are at the following URL: http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf   *****
