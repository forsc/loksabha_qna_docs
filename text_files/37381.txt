ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) & (b): Commission of Railway Safety (CRS), erstwhile known as “Railway Inspectorate” was placed under the administrative control of the “Department of Posts and Air” in May 1941 on the basis of the recommendations of Pacific Locomotive Committee (1939) that the Railway Inspectorate should be separated from the control of Railway Board. CRS has remained thereafter under the administrative control of the Ministry concerned with Civil Aviation.Unlike Railways, the Civil Aviation sector operations include private and foreign airlines, airports under Airports Authority of India (AAI)/Private sector/Public Private Partnership/Joint Venture and other stakeholders which include both private as well as Government (Public Sector Undertakings (PSU)). Further, the Civil Aviation sector functions in a realm which transcends national boundaries and requires adherence to prescribed standards and practices of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). DGCA, AAIB and BCAS are attached offices of Ministry of Civil Aviation with adequate autonomy. Moreover, all the safety/security related rules/guidelines issued by DGCA, AAIB and BCAS are subject to audit by ICAO.(c): There is no such proposal under consideration.******
