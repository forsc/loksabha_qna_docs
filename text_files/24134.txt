ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) & (b) The National Education Policy, 2020 at para 4.13 provides that “The three-language formula will continue to be implemented while keeping in mind the Constitutional provisions, aspirations of the people, regions and the Union, and the need to promote multilingualism as well as promote national unity. However, there will be a greater flexibility in the three-language formula, and no language will be imposed on any State. The three languages learned by children will be the choices of States, regions, and of course the students themselves, so long as at least two of the three languages are native to India. In particular, students who wish to change one or more of the three languages they are studying may do so in Grade 6 or 7, as long as they are able to demonstrate basic proficiency in three languages (including one language of India at the literature level) by the end of secondary school”. Further, para 4.12, inter-alia, provides that “There will be a major effort from both the Central and State governments to invest in large numbers of language teachers in all regional languages around the country, and, in particular, for all languages mentioned in theEighth Schedule of the Constitution of India. States, especially States from different regions of India, may enter into bilateral agreements to hire teachers in large numbers from each other, to satisfy the three-language formula in their respective States, and also to encourage the study of Indian languages across the country. Extensive use of technology will be made for teaching and learning of different languages and to popularize language learning”.(c) There is no such proposal under consideration.****
