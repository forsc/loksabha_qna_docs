ANSWER




                                                        (a)	As on 8th March 2021, there are a total of 1,12,29,398 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported by States and UTs. A total of 1,57,853 persons have died due to COVID-19 in the country. A large majority of total cases (96.91%) have recovered. India’s case fatality rate of 1.41% is also lowest among similarly affected countries. As of now, five States (Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu) are contributing to 83.98% of all active cases in the country, of these only 2 States (Kerala and Maharashtra) are contributing to almost 74.37% of all active cases in the country. A total of 44 districts have not reported any new case of COVID-19 for more than 28 days. State/UT wise details of such districts is given at Annexure-1.(b)	As on 09th March 2021, a total of 2.3 crore doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered to beneficiaries prioritized by National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC). The State/UT-wise number of persons administered COVID-19 vaccine is given at Annexure-2.(c)	Government is increasing the speed of the vaccination drive by increasing the number of COVID-19 Vaccination Centres (CVCs) in Government as well as Private Health Facilities.(d)	Since ‘Health’ is a State responsibility, no centralized data on number of healthcare workers/frontline workers providing treatment to COVID-19 patients in each State/UT is being maintained by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare but such database is available with States/UTs.(e)	& (f) COVID-19 vaccination is entirely voluntary. As on 09th March 2021, 80.85% of the registered Health Care Workers and 63.40% of the registered Front Line Workers have received 1st dose of COVID-19 Vaccine. Vaccination drive of these beneficiaries is being increased by increasing the number of COVID-19 Vaccination Centres (CVCs) in Government as well as Private Health Facilities, and undertaking various interventions to build up and sustain vaccine confidence through dissemination of factual information about the vaccine and the vaccination process.
