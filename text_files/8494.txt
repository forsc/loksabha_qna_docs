Section 8(C) and 9(C) of the RTE Act, 2009 makes it obligatory upon the ‘Appropriate Government’ and ‘Local Authority’ to ensure that a child belonging to weaker section and the child belonging to disadvantage group are not discriminated against and prevented from pursuing and completing elementary education on any grounds.
