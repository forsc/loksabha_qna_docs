                                                        (a) to (b): After Independence, various approaches and models have been developed for the tribal development. Tribal Sub-Plan came into existence in 1974-75 as a strategy for the development of areas having tribal concentration.Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) [also called as Scheduled Tribe Component (STC)] isthe dedicated source of fund for tribal development across the country including Bihar.  41 Central Ministries has been mandated by NITI Aayog to earmark Tribal Sub-Plan funds in the range of 4.3% to 17.5% of their total Scheme allocation every year for tribal development. Besides States Governments are mandated to earmark TSP funds in proportion of ST population in the State. Infrastructure development in tribal dominated areas in the country is carried out through schemes / programmes of concerned Central Ministries and the State Governments under TSP/STC. These schemes relate to various sectors including rural development, housing, drinking water & sanitation, nutrition etc. Consequent upon amendment in Allocation of Business rules (ABR) in January, 2017 Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) has been given mandate for monitoring of TSP based on the framework and mechanism designed by NITI Aayog. Accordingly, an online monitoring system has been put in place with web address http://stcmis.gov.in. The framework envisages monitoring of allocations for welfare of STs under the schemes and State wise release thereof.
