                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b) Permission to fell trees is accorded by the Officer authorized by the State Government/UT Administration as per the provisions of Rules or procedures established by the State Governments/ UT Administrations under the respective Act applicable to the area. This Ministry does not notify royal trees.(c) Protection and management of forest and tree resources is primarily the responsibility of State Governments/Union Territory Administration. There are strong legal frameworks for protection and management of forest resources of the country which include the National Forest Policy 1988, Indian Forest Act 1927, Forest (Conservation) Act 1980, Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 and State Forest Acts, Tree Preservation Acts, and Rules etc. The State Governments /UT Administrations take appropriate actions to protect forests and trees in accordance with the provisions made under these Acts/ Rules.In order to increase the forest cover in the country, afforestation programmes have been taken up under various Centrally Sponsored Schemes such as National Afforestation Programme (NAP), Green India Mission (GIM), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP), which from 2015-16 has been amalgamated as the Watershed Development Component of the “Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)” and under Compensatory   Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA). Local people are involved in afforestation activities by the State Forest Departments. *****
