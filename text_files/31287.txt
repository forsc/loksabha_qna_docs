ANSWER




                THE MINISTER OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                        (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)	: Land and Colonization are State Subjects. Schemes on housing are implemented by States/ UTs. However, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs under the vision of ‘Housing for All’ is supplementing the efforts of States/ UTs by providing central assistance under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana- Urban (PMAY-U) to construct houses for all eligible families/ beneficiaries across the country including Rajasthan. Details of the scheme is available at https://pmay-urban.gov.in/uploads/guidelines/60180813309f2-Updated%20guidelines%20of%20PMAY-U.pdf. (b)	: The number of houses sanctioned under PMAY-U in Banswara and Dungarpur districts is 961 and 627 respectively. No fresh demand is pending from these districts.(c)	& (d): Yes, Sir. As per the PMAY-U scheme guidelines, States/UTs engage Third Party Quality Monitoring Agencies (TPQMA) to ensure quality of construction under various components of the Mission to visit the project site from time to time and to advise State/ UT and Urban Local Bodies on quality related issues. On the basis of quality assurance report by such agencies and also reports of their own technical staff, States and ULBs are mandated to take both preventive and curative measures to ensure standard quality houses and related infrastructure.                             *****
