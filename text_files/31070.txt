ANSWER




                                                        (a): Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has implemented the network of Common Services Centres (CSC) under the Digital India Programme.The CSC scheme envisages setting up of at-least one CSC in each of 2.50 lakh Gram Panchayats (GPs) across the country, for delivery of various Government-to-Citizen (G2C) and other citizen-centric e-Services to citizens. It is a self-sustainable entrepreneurship model which is run by Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs). As on Oct, 2021, total 4,18,436 CSCs are functional across all states & Union Territories of the country, out of which, total 3,25,781 CSCs are functional at Gram Panchayat (GP) level.The CSC 2.0 is envisaged as a self-sustainable, transaction-based service delivery model, for delivering a large bouquet of e-services through a single delivery technological platform known as Digital Seva (DS) Platform, which would increase the sustainability of the CSCs across the country. Therefore, CSCs can deliver any service which may be offered either by the Government, private or social organisations.The DISHA Scheme was only one of the Scheme which was implemented by some of these eligible CSCsand even after completion of the same the CSCs are still operational under the subsequent CSC 2.0 scheme.  (b):  Skill development and creating skilled talent is an important mission to ensure that the growing digital economy of India is provided with the trained and skilled manpower that Industry requires. To further aid digital adoption, the Ministry has focused on digital literacy for citizens since 2014, across the country including in rural areas. In the years 2014 to 2016, two Schemes titled “National Digital Literacy Mission” (NDLM) and “Digital SakshartaAbhiyan” (DISHA) were implemented by the Government with a target to train 52.50 lakh candidates in digital literacy across the country. Under these two schemes, a total of 53.67 lakh beneficiaries were certified.Subsequently, a scheme titled “Pradhan MantriGramin Digital SakshartaAbhiyan (PMGDISHA)” was approved by Union Cabinet in 2017 to usher in digital literacy in rural India by covering 6 crore rural households (one person per household). The scheme is implemented through CSCs at the rural level which are deemed as Training Centres under the said scheme.(c):   As on 09.12.2021, total of around 5.39 crore candidates have been enrolled and 4.57 crore have been trained, out of which 3.39 crore candidates have been certified under the PMGDISHA scheme. The state-wise details are at Annexure.(d):  Commensurate with the fund allocated for implementation of the PMGDISHA scheme, as on 10.12.2021, a total of around 5.39 crore candidates have been enrolled and 4.57 crore candidates have been trained out of which 3.39 crore candidates have been duly certified. Furthermore, the impact of the scheme was assessed through a study conducted by the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA), New Delhi in 2019-20. The study made the following observations:•	PMGDISHA is a unique scheme due to its mass scale and use of remotely proctored examination. The target of 6 crore candidates under the scheme is envisaged to be achieved through uniform coverage of scheme in all the states/ UTs of the country•	18% fund used in SCSP, 12% for TSP and 11% for NER have made sure the empowerment of weaker sections.•	Women participation is very large and their inclusion at the rural level is expected to open up the path for the learning of the whole family•	 More than 55% of respondents cited a direct benefit to their livelihoods after PMGDISHA training.•	More than 40% of respondents empowered 1-5 people, 22.8% were able to help 6-10 people, 12.9% were able to help 10-20 people with the knowledge from PMGDISHA•	PMGDISHA has served the beneficiaries by facilitating their access to a wide range of information points and services for multitude of purposes. It has helped to decrease the overall digital divide in the country.******** AnnexureThe State/UT-wise number of candidates registered, trained and certified so far under PMGDISHA Scheme:S.
