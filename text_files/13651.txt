ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (d)  Protection of river beds and removal of encroachment from them are the responsibilities of the respective State Governments/ Union Territories. However, as per the Guidelines for the scheme of Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of water bodies under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojna (PMKSY) / Har Khet ko Pani (HKKP), State Government/UT is to take necessary steps for declaring the water body boundary through a Government order and ensure removal of encroachments in the water body spread area/water body boundary. This is a prerequisite before the State /UTs submit the proposal seeking release of 2nd instalment of central grant under the RRR.Cleaning and rejuvenation of river is a continuous process and Central Government is supplementing the efforts of the State Governments and Union Territories in addressing the challenges of pollution of rivers by providing financial and technical assistance through schemes like National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) and Namami Gange. The NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches of 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country with a sanctioned cost of Rs. 5870.54 crore. Under Namami Gange, the rejuvenation of Ganga and its tributaries have been taken up. So far, a total 310 projects have been sanctioned at an estimated cost of Rs.28790.66 crore under Namami Gange. Of these, 116 projects have been completed and made operational.In addition, sewerage infrastructure is created under programs like Atal Mission For Rejuvenation & Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and Smart Cities Mission of Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs.Contd…P/2//2//Under the Namami Gange Programme for rejuvenation of River Ganga and its tributaries, and NRCP, allocation of funds during last 3 year is as under:			Rs. in crore Programme	Fund Allocation	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19Namami Gange	1,675.00 	3,023.42	2,370.00NRCP	101.00	173.50	 150.50  Ramzan River in Kishanganj, Bihar falls within the Ganga River Basin system. Clearance of encroachment of river bed and adjoining areas is an administrative matter and the responsibility of the Department concerned in the State Government. Further, to curb encroachments along the rivers, Flood Plain Zoning Bill was prepared by CWC in 1975 and circulated to all the State Governments. Till date, only the states of Uttarakhand, Manipur and Rajasthan have taken steps for implementation of the Bill.*****
