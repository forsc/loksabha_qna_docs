ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES   (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a): The quantum of coal required per day by the thermal power plants of Karnataka Power Corporation Limited (KPCL) in Karnataka is 42,871 Tonnes.

The generation from coal based thermal power plants, therefore, varies depending upon demand and generation from other sources. The generation in Million Units (MU) by the three thermal power plants of KPCL of Karnataka during 2018-19 and 2019-20 (April’19 and May’19) is as under:  	 	Generation (Million Units)Name of TPS	Capacity (MW)	   2018-19       	Apr-19	May-19Bellary TPS	1700	4059	477	400Raichur TPS	1720	8918	1140	1026Yermarus TPS	1600	791	0	0 (c) to (e): The detail of coal supplied to Thermal Power Plants (TPPs) of KPCL in Karnataka from CIL and SCCL for the last three years is as under:(Fig in Million Tonnes) Year	 	Bellary TPS	Raichur TPS	Yermarus TPS	Total  2016-17	MCL	-	2.636	-	  11.703	WCL	-	1.919	-		CIL Total	-	4.555	-		SCCL	2.969	3.806	0.373		Total	2.969	8.361	0.373	  2017-18	MCL	-	2.882	-	  9.814	WCL	-	1.360	-		CIL Total	-	4.242	-		SCCL	1.707	3.111	0.754		Total	1.707	7.353	0.754	  2018-19	MCL	-	2.683	-	  9.409	WCL	-	1.325	-		CIL Total	-	4.008	-		SCCL	1.533	2.423	1.445		Total	1.533	6.431	1.445	 ****
