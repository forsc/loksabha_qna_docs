                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	to (e):  In order to avoid excessive use and to promote balanced and integrated use of fertilizers, Soil health card Scheme had been introduced in 2015 to assist State Governments to issue Soil health cards to farmers in the country. Soil health card provides information to farmers on nutrient status of their soil along with recommendation on appropriate dosage of nutrients to be applied for improving soil health and its fertility. Possibility of excessive use of fertilisers generally arises when it is applied without proper assessment of nutrient requirement of crop, contribution from soil and other sources, nutrient use efficiency of the fertiliser, availability of assured irrigation, mode, method and time of applications and policy. The Government of India is suggesting soil test based balanced and integrated nutrient management through conjunctive use of both inorganic and organic sources (manure, biofertilizers etc.) of plant nutrients for judicious use of fertilisers and to improve soil health and fertility. In addition, split application and placement of fertilisers, use of slow releasing fertilisers, fertigation, growing leguminous crops and use of Resource Conservation Technologies (RCTs) are also suggested. The ICAR also imparts training, organises FLDs etc. to educate farmers on all these aspects as and when required.Soil health data is available on soil health card portal (https://www.soilhealth.dac.gov.in/) which is uploaded by States upto farm land holding level in villages. GOI has also developed an IT enabled system viz., Integrated Fertilizer Management System (iFMS), which captures end to end details of Fertilizer in terms of Production, Movement, availability at dealer level, requirement, Sale, Subsidy Bill Generation to Subsidy payment to fertilizer companies. The iFMS system can be accessed at http://mfms.nic.in/.(f):	There is no proposal to withdraw fertilizer subsidy.*****
