                                                                    THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                         (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a)& (b): 	‘Land’ and ‘Colonization’ are State subjects and therefore, it is the responsibility of the State/ Union Territory (UT) Governments to implement housing schemes to provide houses to their citizens. However, in pursuance of the Government’s vision of ‘Housing for All’, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U) is giving Central assistance to States/ UTs for providing all-weather pucca houses to all eligible urban households through four verticals: (i) “In-Situ” Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) (ii)Credit-Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) (iii) Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP) and (iv) Beneficiary-led individual house construction or enhancement (BLC). PMAY-U projects are implemented on encumbrance free land either owned by beneficiary or public/ private agencies.  Therefore, any compensation and rehabilitation due to relocation; if any required, for Government housing projects is the responsibility of State/ UT Government. Central Government does not provide any assistance for this purpose.(c)& (d):	Does not arise.                              *****
