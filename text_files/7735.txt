                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPNDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPNDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a) to (c) : A statement is laid on the Table of the House.Statement referred to in reply to parts (a) to (c) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. *131 for 27.11. 2019.(a)	 In pursuance to the decisions of the Union Cabinet on 19.05.2005, the Government, through its resolution dated 01.06.2005, decided to set up the National Statistical Commission.  It also decided to merge the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) and Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) into a single entity called the National Statistical Office (NSO).  (b)	 The national statistical system in India is decentralised at the Central and State Government level, and works in an ecosystem of independence and autonomy in its statistical processes and generation of statistical products. The Government also adopted the United Nations Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics (UNFPOS) in May, 2016, which strengthens the national statistical system in producing reliable data by adhering to internationally agreed professional and scientific standards. The merger of CSO and NSSO to form the NSO leverages the strength of the two organisations in meeting the increasing demands of quality statistics. The National Statistical Commission has been re-constituted by the Ministry vide its Notification dated 18th July, 2019, appointing a part-time Chairman and three part-time Members with effect from 15.07.2019.(c)	 The key statistical products produced by the Ministry are released as per the Advance Release Calendar. Further, the Ministry has also made available all primary data collected to the public free of cost since April, 2019.                                              *****
