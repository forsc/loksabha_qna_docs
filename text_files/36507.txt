                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH ANDFAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (c): National Health Accounts (NHA), depict health expenditures and flow of funds in both Government and private sector in the country according to the global framework of System of Health Accounts 2011. The release of NHA Estimates depends upon the availability of data from multiple sources on which the estimates are based. In NHA, Government expenditure is based upon the actual expenditure by both Centre and the States, which become available only after the lag of two years.  The National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates for 2016-17  was published in October 2019. The National Health Accounts Estimates for 2017-18 was published in 2021 due to unprecedented situation of COVID-19. As per available National Health Account Estimates for India, the data on Government Health Expenditure, Current Health Expenditure & Pharmaceutical Expenditure as a percentage of Current Health Expenditure is given in the table below:	2017-18	2016-17	2015-16	2014-15	2013-14Government Health Expenditure (Rs. in crore)	2,31,104	1,88,010	1,61,863	1,39,949	1,29,778Current Health Expenditure(Rs. in crore)	5,01,760	5,39,371	4,95,190	4,51,286	4,21,194Pharmaceutical expenditure as percentage of current health expenditure	33.4%	36.8%	35.4%	37.9%	39.6%Source: National Health Accounts Estimates for India(d) : Drug Price Control Order (DPCO) 2013 has been promulgated based on National Pharmaceutical Pricing Policy 2012. Accordingly, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) fixes the ceiling price of scheduled medicines as specified in the first schedule of the DPCO, 2013 in accordance with the provisions of the DPCO to ensure their affordability.   All manufacturers of these scheduled drugs are required to sell their products at a price equal to or lower than the ceiling price. Further, NPPA monitors the prices of non-scheduled drugs so as to ensure that increase in their Maximum Retail Price (MRP) is not more than 10% of what was prevalent during the preceding twelve months.(e):  The vaccine manufacturers can fix the price of vaccine for procurement by Private Hospitals, which has to be declared in a transparent manner. Under National COVID-19 Vaccination Programme, COVID-19 vaccine is available free of cost for all citizens above 12 years of age irrespective of their socio-economic status at all Government COVID-19 Vaccination Centres.
