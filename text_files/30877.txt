ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (e) Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), India, in 2009, India made a voluntary declaration to reduce the emission intensity of GDP by 20-25 per cent from 2005 levels by 2020. Subsequently, under the Paris Agreement, India, in 2015, India has submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) with quantified targets to reduce the emissions intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level, to achieve about 40% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, and to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2eq through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. In addition, to deal with the challenges of climate change, Hon’ble Prime Minister of India at Conference of Parties (COP26) at Glasgow presented five nectar elements, Panchamrit, to deal with the challenges of climate change:i. 	India''s non-fossil energy capacity to reach 500 GW by 2030.ii. 	India will meet 50 per cent of its energy requirements with renewable energy by 2030.iii. 	India will reduce its total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes from nowto 2030.iv. 	India will reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 45 per cent by 2030, over2005 levels.v. 	By 2070, India will achieve the target of net zero emissions.The Government is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), which is the overarching policy framework and comprises of national missions in specific areas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan eco-system, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. Further, 33 States/Union Territories have prepared State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs) consistent with the objectives of NAPCC. Further, the Government has launched many schemes and programs to scale up India’s action on both, the adaptation and mitigation. Appropriate measures are being taken under these schemes and programs across many sectors including water, agriculture, forest, energy and enterprise, sustainability mobility and housing, waste management, circular economy and resource efficiency, etc. The Net Zero target of India Railways by 2030, has potential of reduction of emissions by 60 million tonnes annually. Similarly, India massive LED bulb campaign is reducing emissions by 40 million tonnes annually.  Apart from resolutely addressing climate change domestically, for the world India has created and continue to nurture International Solar Alliance (ISA) and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI). India is also taking lead with Sweden in innovation for hard to abate sectors. As a result of the aforesaid measures, India has progressively continued decoupling of economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions. India’s emission intensity of gross domestic product (GDP) has reduced by 24 per cent between 2005 and 2016. India’s non-fossil fuel based installed capacity is 156 GW, which is around 39.98% of the total installed capacity. Forest and tree cover has increased by 1.3 million ha between the 2015 and 2019 and the Landuse, Landuse Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sink (CO2 removal) is on the rise by 3.4 per cent between 2014 and 2016 and by approximately 40 per cent between 2000 and 2016. (f)	Government of India has sanctioned a grant of INR 480 crores over five years towards operational and programme activities of Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) including the funding towards extending technical support to vulnerable islands/ Small Island Developing States (SIDS).***
