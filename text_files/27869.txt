                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????	      (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):	 The Government felt need to reform the agricultural marketing sector so as to ensure better and competitive price realisation  to the farmers and encourage capital formation in the sector. In pursuance of the same various Committees/Task Force such as Expert Committee in December, 2000 under the  Chairmanship of Shri Shankarlal Guru, the “Inter-Ministerial   Task   Force”   constituted   on   July,   2001, Empowered Committee of 10 State Ministers in-charge of Agriculture Marketing in 2010, Working Group of Agriculture Production on May, 2010  were constituted for recommending for several market reform measures. The aforesaid Working Group of Agriculture Production constituted by Ministry of Agriculture on May, 2010 under the Chairmanship of the then Chief Minister Haryana, with the then Chief Ministers of Punjab, West Bengal and Bihar as members gave their recommendations that the market for agricultural produce must be immediately freed of all sorts of restrictions on movement, trading, stocking, finance, exports etc. The said Committee recommended that no monopoly, including that of Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) or corporate licensees, should be allowed to restrict the market.	The Draft of the Ordinances had been circulated to various Ministries/ Departments; NITI Aayog etc. for their comments. State Governments were also consulted through Video Conferencing (VC) on 21st May, 2020, which was attended by the officials of various States/ Union Territories(UTs) including Punjab, to obtain feedback on new legal framework facilitating barrier free inter-State and intra-State trade in agriculture produce to provide choice to farmers. Government of India has proactively undertaken efforts on series of extension activities through webinars, online conferences, workshops, teleconferencing, social media, print media, electronic media with the stakeholders on the aforesaid three Ordinances and thereafter on respective Acts.	The Government had promulgated “The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020”, “The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020”, and “The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020” on 5th June, 2020 by following the due procedure. Union Government had enacted the new Farm Laws under entry 33 of List-III (Concurrent List) of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, under which the Parliament is constitutionally competent to legislate. The bills on aforesaid laws were passed by both the houses of the Parliament and subsequently enacted these into Acts on 27th September, 2020.*****
