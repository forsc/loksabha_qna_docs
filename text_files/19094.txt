                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                          (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a) & (b)	Yes, Sir. The Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs is administering DAY-NULM w.e.f. September, 2013 in the country, including Bihar. The number of beneficiaries of DAY-NULM in Bihar include, 1,99,004 members of Self Help Groups, 24,753 skill-trained candidates and 6,971 micro-entrepreneurs. Further, 1,15,884 urban street vendors and 10,253 urban homeless have been identified in survey, conducted by the Urban Local Bodies.(c) to (e)	The Mission does not have a national average for beneficiaries’ coverage, inter-alia, because States/ UTs  notify the Urban Local Bodies, as per their capacity and requirement, to implement either the entire Mission or its specific components. The States/ UTs identify the beneficiaries as those living below poverty line in urban areas. Further, the coverage may be broadened by including families of disadvantaged groups like SCs, STs, women, minorities, disabled etc. subject to a maximum of 25 percent of the urban poor population.                              *****
