SHC provides two sets of fertilizer recommendations for 6 crops that can be grown in that area.  Recommendations for additional crops are also given based on the requirement of farmers.  Hence, SHC is intended to encourage farmers to adopt Integrated Nutrient Management for judicious use of fertilizers & crop planning for increase in productivity of the land.  As per the study report submitted by National Productivity Council in 2017, the quantum of fertilizer application reduced from 8-10% and yield increase of 8-6% was observed when the SHC recommendations were followed by the farmers.(b):	There is no such report received from any State.
