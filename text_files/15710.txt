(b ):	 All 77 Government quarters were inspected and 27 quarters were found to be suspected sublet. Notices were issued in these 27 cases. Allotment of 15 quarters has been cancelled due to proved subletting and 10 cases were closed since subletting was not proved. (c):	The Government has taken various steps for preventing subletting. Display boards have been placed at prominent locations in Government colonies to inform allottees about the action which could be taken against them for subletting.
