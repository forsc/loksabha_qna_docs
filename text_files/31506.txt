                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????           (SHRI NARENDRA  SINGH TOMAR)(a)  & (b):	Export of Potato is free and without any quantitative restrictions.  Farmers can take advantage of wider international market which contributes to increased income for the farmers. To increase export of potato, the Government has also established agri export clusters for potatoes in Agra & Farukkabad districts of Uttar Pradesh; Indore & Gwalior districts of Madhya Pradesh; Banaskantha, & Sabarkantha districts of Gujarat;  Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala, & Navashehar districts of Punjab. Besides, Ministry of Food Processing Industries is implementing the OG-TOP to TOTAL Scheme for providing 50% subsidy for transportation and storage for evacuation of 41 notified fruits and vegetables, including potato, from surplus production area to consumption centers.(c):	Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) is implemented for procurement of agricultural and horticultural commodities, including potato, which are perishable in nature and are not covered under the Price Support Scheme (PSS). The objective of intervention is to protect the growers of these commodities from making distress sale in the event of a bumper crop during the peak arrival period. Besides, an institutional mechanism in the form of high level Inter-Ministerial Committees (IMC) has been put in place which meets on weekly basis to keep a close watch of prices of various agri commodities, including potatoes, and takes suitable remedial measures as and when required to safeguard interest of farmers and consumers.                                                       *****
