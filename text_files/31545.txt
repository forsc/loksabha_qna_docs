(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (c):     Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare is implementing a Centrally Sponsored  Scheme namely Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) for holistic development of horticulture in the country. All States/UTs are covered under MIDH. Activities such as Production of Planting Material, Vegetable Seed Production, Cultivation of improved cultivars of fruits & vegetables, Rejuvenation of Senile Orchards, Protected Cultivation, Creation of Water Resources, Integrated Nutrient Management (INM), Horticulture Mechanization, Creation of Post Harvest Management (PHM) and Marketing Infrastructure are taken up under MIDH for promotion of Horticulture Sector in the country. There are two autonomous organizations namely National Horticulture Board (NHB) and Coconut Development Board (CDB), two Directorates namely Directorate of Cashewnut & Cocoa Development (DCCD) and Directorate of Arecanut & Spices Development (DASD) and one Institute i.e. Central Institute of Horticulture (CIH) under the umbrella MIDH scheme, which are also implementing various schemes for development of horticulture in the country. As a result, horticulture sector has recorded highest ever horticulture production of 331.05 million tons during 2020-21 (as per 3rd advance estimates) and thus contributing significantly towards national objective of doubling of farmer’s income.In addition, there are 23 Research Institutions, 25 Regional Stations, 11 All India Coordinated Research Projects and 2 All India Network Research Projects engaged in research and development of horticulture sector in the country under the administrative control of ICAR. The Government has recently launched National Nursery Portal for easy access to information on availability of quality planting material in the nearby localities for farmers/growers and other stake holders and thus will further help in increasing horticulture production. Government is also taking necessary steps for development of horticulture clusters and import of quality planting material of high value horticulture crops and promotion of globally popular exotic fruits and important indigenous fruit crops. The Government has also established an Agriculture Infrastructure Fund for Rs. 1 lakh crore providing collateral free term loan in subsidized rate of interest for creation of decentralized post harvest infrastructure which will help in reducing post harvest losses. ********
