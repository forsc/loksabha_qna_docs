ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????      (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (e):    Government fixes Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for 22 mandated agricultural crops on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), and after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned and other relevant factors. 	        Cost of production is one of the important factors in the determination of MSP. While recommending its price policy, the CACP considers all costs in a comprehensive manner. CACP projects the cost of cultivation for the current year on the basis of Composite Input Price Index (CIPI) which measures the change in input price over previous year. The CIPIs are based on latest prices of major inputs like human labour, bullock labour, machine labour, fertilisers and manures, seeds, pesticides and irrigation as per data available from different ministries/ departments. 	                The Government in its Union Budget for 2018-19 had announced the pre-determined principle to keep MSP at a level of one and half times of the cost of production. Accordingly, Government has increased the MSP for all mandated Kharif, Rabi and other commercial crops with a return of atleast 50 per cent over all India weighted average cost of production from the agricultural year 2018-19 onwards. Details of MSP, cost and return over cost since 2018-19 are given at Annex.	                Moreover, Government has taken several steps to enhance farmer’s income which include,  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), Soil Health Card (SHC), e-NAM, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan’(PM-AASHA), Agriculture Infrastructure Fund, interest subvention scheme on crop loans among others. (f) & (g):     The NITI Aayog (erstwhile Planning Commission) has conducted a study entitled “Efficacy of minimum support prices on farmers”, 2016. The study covered 14 States, 36 Districts, 72 Blocks, 144 Villages and 1440 Households. The study is based on both the primary and secondary data. The study has found among other things that MSP declared by the Government has encouraged 78 % of the farmers covered under the study for adopting improved methods of farming such as high yielding varieties of seeds, organic manure, chemical fertilizer, pesticides and improved methods of harvesting etc.              Government extends price support for paddy and wheat through the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and State Agencies. Under this policy, whatever food grains are offered by farmers within the stipulated period & conforming to the specifications prescribed by Government are purchased at MSP by the State Government agencies including FCI for Central Pool. It aims to service the National Food Security Act (NFSA) and other welfare schemes of the Government so that subsidized food grains are supplied to the poor and needy, and to build up buffer stocks of food grains to ensure food grain security.                 Additionally, Oilseeds, pulses and copra of Fair Average Quality (FAQ) are procured from registered farmers under Price Support Scheme under Umbrella Scheme of PM-AASHA, as per its prescribed guidelines at MSP in consultation with the concerned State Government.
