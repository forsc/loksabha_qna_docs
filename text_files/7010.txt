ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a): Three airports of Uttar Pradesh have been connected under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik). Thirteen airports of Uttar Pradesh are yet to be connected under RCS - UDAN.;(b): Currently route between Delhi and Prayagraj is Non-RCS route and therefore, does not come under the purview of RCS - UDAN. However, airlines can operate commercial flights on any routes including Delhi and Prayagraj based on their due diligence keeping in view the traffic and commercial viability.;(c) : Government of India has targeted an indicative airfare of Rs 2500 per passenger approximately, indexed to inflation, for an RCS seat for a distance of 500 kms to 600 kms on RCS - UDAN routes (equivalent to about one hour of flight) with fixed wing aircraft. Under the Scheme, an airfare cap has been kept for an RCS seat only. The primary objective of RCS is to facilitate/stimulate regional air connectivity by making it affordable. ;;;(d): UDAN is a demand driven scheme and the Implementing Agency would be awarding the routes periodically based on the transparent bidding process during the currency of the scheme i.e 10 years from 2016-17.
