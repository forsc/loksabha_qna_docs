HARSH VARDHAN)(a) to (d) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO.233* FOR 6TH MARCH, 2020(a) & (b) Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana                    (AB-PMJAY) is an entitlement-based scheme and no registration or enrolment of beneficiaries is required for availing the benefits under the scheme. However, in order to create awareness and facilitate easy availing of benefits, e-cards have been issued to the beneficiaries after verifying their identity under the scheme.Under AB-PMJAY, certain information of medical treatment of beneficiaries is linked to the AB-PMJAY e-Card ID and is saved in an encrypted manner. This information is collected with due consent of the beneficiary and follows strong Information Security and Data Privacy Standards. The details of provisions undertaken for data security of medical records by National Health Authority, linked to AB-PMJAY e-cards are at Annexure I.The Government of India has recently released the National Digital Health Blueprint (NDHB) report. This report extensively lays down the path for establishment of digital healthcare ecosystem which also covers Electronic Health Records. Stringent measures for data privacy and security have been proposed in the NDHB.(c) & (d) AB-PMJAY covers deprived families in rural areas and families of workers of identified occupational categories in urban areas, as per the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) -2011 data. Further, all such beneficiary families under erstwhile Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana that do not figure in the targeted groups as per SECC data are also covered under AB-PMJAY. The details of entitled categories under the scheme are at Annexure II. The families of Migrant workers and nomadic groups fulfilling the entitlement criteria are also covered under AB-PMJAY. Due to portability feature in AB-PMJAY, any beneficiary can seek treatment at any of the empaneled hospitals across the Country.
