The initiatives taken by the Government to increase the revenue in civil aviation sector and to strengthen it, include:-  i)   Provide airport infrastructure through Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the private operators which helps airlines add more flights and hence revenue.  ii)  Provide an efficient Air Navigation System in the Country that reduces congestion in air and on ground and hence reduces fuel consumption.  iii)  Provide Viability Gap Funding and other concessions to selected airline operators under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) as per the scheme document.  iv)   Reduction of Central Excise Duty applicable on ATF from 14% to 11% w.e.f. 11th October 2018.  v)  Rationalization of Goods and Services Tax provisions.  vi) Rationalization of Category-I routes under Route Dispersal Guidelines on the basis of criteria given in National Civil Aviation Policy - 2016.  vii)  The requirement for 5/20 is modified and all airlines can commence international operations provided that they deploy 20 aircraft or 20% of total capacity (in terms of average number of seats on all departure put together) whichever is higher for domestic operations.  viii)  Liberalization of domestic code share points in India within the framework of Air Service Agreements.  ix) Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for Scheduled Air Transport Service/ Domestic Scheduled Passenger Airline has been allowed upto 49% under automatic route. For Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), 100% FDI will continue to be allowed under automatic route.
