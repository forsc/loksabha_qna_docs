The Government does not maintain data on average time taken for disposal of cases in courts.  However, data available on the National Judicial Data Grid on the time taken to disposal of cases in respect of High Courts and District and Subordinate Judiciary as on 23.07.2021 is at Annexure. ****** ANNEXURESTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO  LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. †1438 FOR ANSWER ON 28.07.2021 REGARDING  DISPOSAL OF COURT CASES.
