                                                                                THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE                    MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                      (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a)to (c): Government of India launched the Smart Cities Mission (SCM) on 25 June 2015. 100 Smart cities have been selected through 4 rounds of competition from January 2016 to June 2018. The objective of SCM is to promote cities that provide core infrastructure and give a decent quality of life to its citizens, a clean and sustainable environment through application of ‘Smart’ solutions.Implementation of SCM at the city level is done by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) created for the purpose. The Smart City Proposal (SCP) of each city has been prepared through extensive citizen engagement. Since needs and aspirations of citizens in different cities are different, the priorities and projects contained in such SCPs vary from city to city.Most of the Smart Cities, including those in Maharashtra, have addressed issues related to climate change, disaster preparedness, mitigation and adaptation as part of their SCPs. In order to enhance walkability, increase use of non-motorized and public transport, Smart Cities, as on 4 March 2022, are implementing 789 Smart Road projects worth ? 26,794 crore, promoting non-motorized transport and better pedestrian facilities resulting in reduction of congestion, environmental pollution, and greenhouse gases. Similarly, 95 Solar Power projects costing ? 1,301 crore are being implemented. 316 Smart Water projects worth ? 24,029 crore and 268 Smart Wastewater projects worth ? 17,983 crore have been taken. These and many such initiatives lead to reduction in greenhouse gases, pollution and resource conservation are part of the Mission. Climate Smart Cities Assessment Framework (CSCAF) was launched in 2019 as a mechanism to strengthen climate-sensitive development practices in cities through healthy competition amongst them. The final report of the second edition of Assessment, CSCAF 2.0 was released on 25 June 2021. The 126 participating cities were assessed through 28 diverse indicators across 5 thematic areas namely Energy and Green Buildings; Urban Planning, Green Cover and Biodiversity; Mobility and Air Quality; Water Management; and Waste Management. The results of CSCAF-2.0 are available at https://niua.org/c-cube/c-cube-documents.To support climate action across India’s cities, the Climate Center for Cities (C-cube) has been established under National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA).Integrated Command and Control Centers (ICCCs) have been operationalized in 76 Smart Cities.  These ICCCs are playing important role in ensuring improved traffic management, solid waste management, water distribution management. Disaster Management is a key component of their functions.  Smart Cities have effectively used ICCCs and related Smart infrastructure for better management of the COVID 19 pandemic.With important objective of achieving green recovery from COVID-19 pandemic, SCM has launched important national level challenges to promote safer, healthier and environment friendly cities viz.
