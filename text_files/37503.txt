                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH&FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR) (a) to (c): The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoH&FW) conducts one integrated survey namely National Family Health Survey (NFHS) at an interval of about 3 years to provide high quality data on population and health indicators as well as data on emerging issues in health and family welfare and to provide essential information that may assist policymakers and programme managers in setting benchmarks. Five rounds of the NFHS have been completed during the period 1992-93, 1998-99, 2005-06, 2015-16 and 2019-21.The NFHS survey provides State/UT wise and also by background characteristics including Schedule Tribes, information on Fertility, Family Planning, Infant and Child Mortality, Maternal Health, Child Health, Nutrition and Anemia, etc. It is evident from the recent round of NFHS that there are significant improvements in the key health, family welfare and associated indicators for the tribal population across State/UTs including Himachal Pradesh, as compared to the previous rounds. The States/UTs wise performance of the key Health Indicators in respect of Scheduled Tribes are given at Annexure-1.   (d) and (e):    Public Health and Hospitals being a State Subject, all the administrative and personnel matters, including support for outsourcing/engagement of doctors and other health human resources lies with the respective State Governments/UT Administration. Further, under National Health Mission (NHM), Government of India provides financial and technical support to States/UTs to strengthen their healthcare systems. Details of some of the specific initiatives taken by the Government of India for better healthcare in tribal areas includes:i.	The tribal majority districts whose Composite Health Index is below the State average, have been identified as High Priority Districts (HPDs) for receiving more resources/funds.  ii.	Hard area allowances and special packages are provided to attract health professionals, to remote and difficult areas. iii.	The population norms for setting up Health Facilities in tribal areas have been relaxed.iv.	States/UTs have been given flexibility to deploy Mobile Medical Units (MMUs) to provide a range of health care services for the population particularly living in remote areas. v.	National Free Drugs and Diagnostic Service Initiative has been rolled out to minimize the Out of Pocket Expenditure incurred on health services. vi.	Support has been provided for implementation of National Ambulances Services for free transportation of sick patients to the health facilities.Under NHM, in the Final Year 2021-22, an amount of Rs. 189.70 lakhs was sanctioned by the MoH&FW to the State of Himachal Pradesh for 12 Mobile Medical Units. ****
