ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) & (b): 	No damage of Central Pool Foodgrains (wheat & rice) stored in godowns can be directly attributed to inadequate storage capacity. 	As on 31.07.2020, storage capacity available with FCI and State agencies for storage of Central Pool Foodgrain is 781.22 Lakh MT [FCI- 416.52 LMT (owned and Hired) and State Agencies -364.70 LMT] against the total stock of 766.68 Lakh MT.(c): 	The storage capacity is periodically monitored in the country and based on the requirement and storage gap assessment, storage capacities are created by hiring through various State agencies and private sectors. (d):  	The utilization of storage capacity depends upon the level of procurement, movement of foodgrains etc. and may differ from time to time. In procuring regions, the capacity utilization is maximum when procurement operations are going on but, subsequently, the stock is moved to deficit regions, which leads the storage capacity being surplus at micro level.  ****
