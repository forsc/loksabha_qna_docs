                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)	 & (b)  No Studies have been conducted by Government of Karnataka and Central Water Commission on the after-effects of flood in Karnataka. As per state Government of Karnataka, during the period from 3rd to 10th August, 2019, the State received 224 mm of rainfall with an overall departure of (+) 279 % which is the highest for Karnataka in the last 118 years for corresponding period. Some Districts received more than 700 % departure from normal rain fall during the period. Due to this, there was steep rise in water levels of major reservoirs during the first week of August 2019 which got filled to Full Reservoir Level (FRL) and consequently releases made in downstream areas.

The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. State Government of Karnataka has informed that relief and rehabilitation works have been taken up in the affected areas and has provided all necessary assistance to alleviate the sufferings of people.

For providing relief to the affected people of Karnataka, State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) has already been placed at the disposal of the State Government.  Central Government  has already released Rs.204 Crore from SDRF and also approved interim assistance of Rs.1200 crore “on account basis” from National Disaster Response Fund(NDRF) during the year 2019-20 to the State Government of Karnataka. Revenue Department of Government of Karnataka has informed that some of the measures taken for providing financial assistance are –i.
