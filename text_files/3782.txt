Further, vide Central Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Act, 2018, section 43A of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 provides that a registered person, while furnishing returns under sub-section (1) of section 39 of the said Act, shall verify, validate, modify or delete the details of supplies furnished by the suppliers.(c) and (d) No Sir.
