                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY       (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****  STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1886 BY SHRI KAUSHALENDRA KUMAR TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 03.07.2019 REGARDING INCIDENTS OF CRIME(a) and (b): Policing on Railways being a State subject, prevention of crime, registration of cases, their investigation and maintenance of law & order in Railway premises as well as on running trains are the statutory responsibility of the State Governments, which they discharge through Government Railway Police (GRP)/District Police. Cases of Indian Penal Code (IPC) crimes are registered and investigated by the concerned Government Railway Police. Railway Protection Force (RPF) supplements the efforts of GRP to provide better protection and security of passenger area & passengers and for matters connected therewith. Whenever any information about status of crime on Railways is sought, State GRP is requested to provide information. As per data provided by GRP, the cases of theft of passenger’s belongings in trains are on the rise. However, the cases of dacoity in trains have shown a decreasing trend from the years 2015 to 2017 but there is slight increase in such cases during the year 2018. Three passengers have lost their lives in such incidents of dacoity/theft in trains during the last three years and current year (upto May) over Indian Railways. The following steps are taken by the Railways in coordination with GRP to ensure security of passengers in Railways:- 1.	On vulnerable and identified routes/sections, 2500 trains (on an average) are escorted by Railway Protection Force daily in addition to 2200 trains escorted by Government Railway Police of different States daily.2.	Surveillance is kept through CCTV cameras, provided at about 453 stations over Indian Railways, to ensure safety and security of passengers. --2/--2-3.	Security Help Line number 182 is operational over Indian Railways for security related assistance to passengers in distress.4.	Through various social media platforms viz. twitter, facebook etc., Railways are in regular touch with passengers to enhance security and address their security concerns. 5.	An Integrated Security System (ISS) consisting of surveillance of vulnerable stations through Close Circuit Television Camera Network, Access Control etc. has been sanctioned to improve surveillance mechanism over 202 railway stations. 6.	All Railway Stations and passenger carrying trains are planned to be progressively provided with CCTV based surveillance system. 7.	Frequent announcements are made through Public Address System to educate passengers to take precautions against theft, snatching, drugging etc. 8.	Drives are conducted from time to time against the entry of unauthorized persons in trains and railway premises. 9.	Further, close liaison is made by Railways with the State Police/GRP authorities at all levels for prevention of crime, registration of cases, their investigation and maintenance of law & order in Railway premises as well as on running trains.(c) and (d): No, Sir. Since, Policing on Railways is a State subject, primary responsibility of prevention, registration and investigation of cases of dacoity in Railways lies with the GRP/Civil Police of the concerned State. However, adequate number of RPF personnel are available to assist GRP to ensure secure journey of passengers. *****
