They also conduct specific camps for target audience like farmers, small entrepreneurs, Self Help Groups, senior citizens etc. including women. The Centres for Financial Literacy project of the RBI also impart financial education among adults. In addition, banks in general organise camps, to create awareness about the banking habits including the benefits of keeping the account active.As a result of these initiatives, the share of operative PMJDY accounts has increased from 60.38% in March’17 to 85.70% in November’21. (c) Under PMJDY, the beneficiariescan avail overdraft facility upto Rs.10,000 after fulfillment of certain minimum conditions.
