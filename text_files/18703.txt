ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a)   & (b) : 	Government announces Minimum Support Price (MSP) for 22 major agricultural commodities including cotton each year in both the crop seasons after taking into account the recommendations of the Commission  for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).  Besides, Government also announces Fair Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane.  The Government had increased the MSP of all mandated crops since 2018-19 with a return of atleast 50% over all India weighted average cost of production. For perishable agricultural and horticultural crops for which MSP is not announced, Government implements Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) and Operation Green  schemes as per the extant schemes guidelines.  Contd…2/--2-(c):  	The FRP so fixed by the Central Government is the bench mark remunerative price for sugarcane.  Accordingly, FRP for 2020-21 sugar season has been fixed at Rs.285 per qtl. Linked to a basic recovery of 10% subject to a premium of Rs.2.85/qtl. for each 0.1% increase of recovery over and above 10% and reduction in FRP at the same rate for each 0.1% decrease in the recovery rate till 9.5%.  With a view to protect interest of farmers, the Government has decided that there shall not be any deduction in case where recovery is below 9.5%.  The sugar mills generally realized revenue from sale of sugar and its other by-products viz. molasses, bagasse and press cake as well as from industrial alcohol, ethanol manufactured from molasses or other sugar allied products including value-added range of confectionaries depending upon their own techno-economic viability.*******
