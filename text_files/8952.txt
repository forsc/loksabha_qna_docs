                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	No, Sir.(b):	The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA), 2005 provide for the enhancement of livelihood security of the households in rural areas of the country by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is a demand driven wage employment programme. It provides livelihood security i.e., fall back option for livelihood for the rural households when no better employment opportunity is available. The demand for work is influenced by various factors such as rain-fall, availability of alternative and remunerative employment opportunities outside Mahatma Gandhi NREGS. As per the information uploaded by the States/UTs in Management information system (MIS), 52.60 lakh households completed 100 days of employment under the Mahatma Gandhi NREGS during the FY 2018-19.(c):	 No, Sir.(d) to (f):	Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is a demand driven wage employment programme having bottom up approach and priorities of work thrust on creation of durable assets that generate incomes. The shelf of the permissible works is taken up as per the demand in rural areas. The implementation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is reviewed on regular basis based on the inputs received from the stakeholders and the list of permissible works is amended in the Schedule of the Act as and when found necessary.
