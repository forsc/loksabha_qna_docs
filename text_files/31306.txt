ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) to (c): Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21-10-2016 to stimulate regional air connectivity and making air travel affordable to the masses. UDAN is a market driven scheme. Interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN.;Airports Authority of India (AAI) , the Implementing Agency, had awarded UDAN routes connecting Jeypore airport to the Selected Airline Operator (SAO) in the first round of bidding. However, UDAN Routes connecting Jeypore airport were cancelled due to the non-compliance of agreement by the SAO. AAI has awarded routes connecting Jeypore to Bhubaneshwar and Vishakhapatnam in a recently conducted bidding under UDAN. The SAOs are obligated to commence RCS flight operations on a RCS-route within a period of 180 days from the issuance of Letter of Award or within two months from the readiness of airport, whichever is later, unless any extension is granted by the Implementing Agency.
