However, to curb plastic pollution, MoEFCC has come out with revised regulations for management of Plastic Wastes and notified "Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016", which, inter-alia regulates manufacture, sale, distribution of plastics. It aims to minimize plastic waste generation by encouraging recycling and re-use of plastic waste in road construction, energy & oil recovery.Further, Hon’ble Prime Minister has announced India’s pledge to Ban all Single-Use Plastic by 2022. In this regard Ministry has issued guidelines and written letters to offices of Central Government and its departments, major PSUs, corporates, etc to prohibit single-use plastic products in their offices.	Through the CRZ Notification, 2011 several activities are prohibited in the coastal areas like setting up and expansion of industries, disposal of wastes and effluents, except for some essential activities. Government of India, has initiated several programmes such as “Swachh Bharat Abhiyan”, National Mission for Clean Ganga and Smart Cities Mission” in order to develop a clean and sustainable environment.	Plastic litter is responsible for a number of deaths of marine animals by ingestion or starvation or injury etc. To tackle the problem of marine litter particularly due to the plastic waste,a Steering Committee with stakeholders from all the concerned Ministries and Departments has been constituted by MoEFCC. 	The Committee shall co-ordinate the actions of all the Ministries toexamine the proposals submitted by the Nodal Ministry for prioritizing the tasks for the management of marine litter, provide recommendations to the Ministries/departments for streamlining their acts/notifications, strategic guidance to the concerned State Government, advise the Central government on policy, planning, research and development to promote measures focusing on sound waste management, recovery of marine plastic litter, deployment of innovative technologies and materials, public education and outreach, international cooperation to enhance national capacities.*****
