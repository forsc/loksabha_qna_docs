ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE(SHRI PANKAJ CHAUDHARY)(a) to (d): Union Government provides funds for Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS)/Central Sector schemes (CS) as per approved guidelines formulated by the concerned Ministries /Departments. The Ministries /Departments monitor utilization of funds as per scheme guidelines and release next instalment on the receipt of utilization certificate. The utilization of the budgetary allocations is monitored by the Financial Adviser (FA) and Chief Controller of Accounts (CCA) of the respective Ministry/Department. The funds allocated during the year 2019-20 and 2020-21 under CSS and CS are as follows:Scheme Category 	   2019-20 (Actual)	2020-21 (RE)  CSS	                     3,09,552.68	3,87,899.80  CS	                     7,57,091.13	12,63,689.81 However, it is stated that to preserve the All India character of CSS scheme, Department of Expenditure vide D.O letter No.66(1)/PF-II/2015 dated 31.08.2017 issued a set of guidelines. As per the guidelines the specific name and details of each scheme receive Parliamentary approval through budget provision and the process of appropriation. Therefore, releases of funds of such schemes and their utilization must necessarily be strictly in accordance with the Parliamentary authorization. All Ministries/Departments have been requested that for each CSS, a set of core features consisting of the target group, funding pattern and delivery mechanism apart from its name, logo and tagline may be made unalterable by the State Governments. Narwa-Garwa-Ghurwa-Badi is a State scheme of Government of Chhattisgarh. State schemes are monitored by the respective State Governments.
