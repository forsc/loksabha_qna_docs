Will the Minister of CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS be pleased to state: (a) whether it is true that the Government has lifted anti-dumping duty on Vitamin C; (b) if so, the reasons therefor; (c) whether it is also true that approximately 100 Indian units producing vitamin C is affected by this decision of the Government; (d) if so, the reasons therefor; and (e) whether the Government has any plan to impose anti-dumping duty on import of Vitamin C from China and if so, the details thereof? 






ANSWER




(a) & (b): As per information provided by Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR), the Anti-dumping duty was extended on Vitamin-C originating in or exported from China PR on 06.08.2015 for a further period of 5 years vide Department of Revenue’s notification No. 38/2015-Customs (ADD) dated 06.08.2015. The anti-dumping duty thereafter expired (got lifted) on05.08.2020. (c) & (d):  As per the Notification dated 4th September, 2020 issued by Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) for initiation of Anti-Dumping investigations, there are just 4 Indian Manufacturers which account for 100% production of Vitamin-C in India. Therefore, the point that 100 manufacturers got affected does not seem to be true. (e):       Based on the application filed by the domestic industry, Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) has initiated an anti-dumping investigation concerning imports of “Vitamin C in all its form” from China PR on 04.09.2020. DGTR conducts anti-dumping investigations, under the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 and the rules made thereunder, and recommends imposition of duty, wherever appropriate, to the Department of Revenue by issuing its preliminary/final findings.  Acting upon such recommendations of the DGTR, the Department of Revenue may impose the provisional or definitive duties.  xxxxx
