                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) & (b)Climate change impact studies have been undertaken andreported as part of various government reports, including India’s national communications to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The climate change scenarios have not been assessed city-wise. (c) & (d)The Government is seized of the adaptation needs of various sectors in the country, including that of the urban sector. The Government is implementing National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which provides an overarching policy framework for climate actions in the country with eight Missions-(i) National Solar Mission (ii) National Mission on Enhanced Energy Efficiency (iii) National Water Mission (iv) National Mission on Sustainable Habitat (v) National Mission on Sustaining Himalayan Ecosystem (vi) National Green India Mission (vii) National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture and (viii) National Mission on Strategic Knowledge on Climate Change. These Missions supplement and complement each other, are mutually reinforcing and thereby address the climate change concerns in the cities.Climate actions at the state level are based on the State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCC). Thirty-three States/Union Territories have prepared their SAPCC in line with NAPCC taking into account state specific issues relating to climate change. These SAPCCs inter-alia outline sector specific and cross sectoral priority climate actions. The Government is also implementing National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC) to support adaptation measures of States/UTs in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. (e)The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has launched the ‘Climate Smart Cities Assessment Framework’ in February 2019. This framework serves as a comprehensive tool for cities to assess their present situation and drives them to adopt and implement other best practices towards green and sustainable urban development The Climate-Smart Cities Assessment Framework consists of 28 indicators across 5 categories namely; (i) Energy and Green Buildings, (ii) Urban Planning, Green Cover and Biodiversity, (iii) Mobility and Air Quality, (iv) Water Resource Management and (v) Waste Management.MoHUA has also set up the ‘Climate Centre for Cities’ at the National Institute of Urban Affairs to anchor climate actions in the urban sector. The centre is implementing capacity-building measures to promote climate-sensitive development.***
