ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):     The export of spices from India is steadily growing during the last decade. The year wise details of export of spices from India during the last 10 years is annexed.(b):    There is no ban on import of Indian Cardamom into Gulf countries. However, Saudi Arabia Food & Drug Authority (SAFDA) has detained a few import consignments of cardamom (Small) from India due to pesticide residue  above the Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) during April-May 2018. (c):	In order to address the pesticide residue in cardamom, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) campaigns and Spice Clinic Programmes have been conducted by the Spices Board to create awareness among the growers and promoting the adoption of IPM, use of bio-inputs for pest & disease management, etc. in the major cardamom growing villages  in Idukki District of Kerala.  Meetings and campaigns are conducted to motivate the cardamom growers to adopt Integrated Pest Management in Cardamom. The cardamom growers are educated on the judicious application of pesticides and to promote  use of bio-control agents in managing pests and diseases of cardamom. Besides, the Spice Board has prepared a Plant Protection Code for sustainable production of Cardamom promoting the use of need based judicious pesticide application and use of bio-pesticides & bio-control agents to reduce the dependence on chemical inputs.(d):   To facilitate the smooth export of spices to Gulf and other countries, the issue of pesticide residue above the Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) in export of cardamom (Small)  from India to Saudi Arabia has been taken up with SAFDA. They have been requested to provide a cooling off period and consider allowing the export of Indian Small Cardamom by relaxing the MRLs of pesticides for cardamom for two crop seasons (till September 2022), in line with Codex standards considering the fact that the Codex MRLs are universally accepted and are  considered as reference standards by WTO in international trade. It is informed by SAFDA that the standards are being revised.          Besides, Spices Board has conducted Buyer Seller Meet (BSM) at Kattappana in Idukki District of Kerala by inviting cardamom exporters and cardamom farmers/ farmers groups in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu who follow Integrated Pest Management as well as less application of pesticides. The BSM has helped to incentivize the farmers who adopt IPM practices, by facilitating direct market linkage.
