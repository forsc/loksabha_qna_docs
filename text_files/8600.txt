ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) to (c): The Income Tax Department conducts   suitable actions in the relevant cases as per the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 on various persons who may be engaged in diversified business activities across different sectors, including film industry.  Whereas no such report has been brought out by the Income Tax Department recently, it is a fact that each sector of economy has its unique ways to evade tax. The Income Tax Department takes all necessary measures to tackle such ways of tax evasion by way of sector specific legislative provisions, administrative measures to encourage tax compliance and enforcement actions in requisite cases which includes search and seizure actions, surveys, prosecutions etc. The Income Tax Department has also proactively engaged with foreign governments with a view to facilitate and enhance the exchange of information under Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs)/Tax Information Exchange Agreements(TIEAs)/Multilateral Conventions etc.Further, disclosure of information regarding specific taxpayers is prohibited except as provided under section 138 of Income tax Act, 1961.********
