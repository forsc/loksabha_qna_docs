ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) to (f): Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has reported that no  specific direction with respect to insistence on checking credit reports pertaining to loans to farmer has been issued by them. Lenders exercise their commercial judgment to grant loan or otherwise to borrowers based on the Board-approved policies of banks. Information contained in Credit Information Reports (CIRs) obtained from Credit Information Companies is one of the factors in the credit appraisal process. The decision to approve or reject a loan is taken on a holistic basis, taking into account all relevant factors forming part of the credit appraisal process, and not on the basis of CIRs alone.******
