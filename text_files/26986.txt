These Rules empower users and make the intermediary platform accountable for timely redressal of grievances received.   They are also expected to remove any unlawful content as and when brought to their knowledge either through a court order or through a notice by the Appropriate Government or its authorised agency.(e): Some Significant Social Media Intermediaries including Facebook, Google (YouTube), Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, ShareChat, Telegram, Koo, MyGov etc., have informed this Ministry about their commitment to comply and/or compliance with the above said Rules.
