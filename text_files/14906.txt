(???? ?????? ???? ?????) (a) to (c): The Government provides the broad framework for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) through Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act’). Further, Schedule VII of the Act indicates the activities to be undertaken by the company in areas or subject specified and the Companies (Corporate Social Responsibility Policy) Rules, 2014 prescribes the rules for implementation. CSR is a Board driven process and the Board of the company is empowered to plan, decide, execute and monitor the CSR activities of the company based on the recommendation of its CSR Committee. Schedule VII is broad based and can be interpreted liberally in terms of MCA’s circular no. 21/2014 dated 18th June, 2014. There is no proposal, at present, to add additional items in the Schedule VII of the Act. The entire CSR architecture is disclosure based and CSR mandated companies are required to file details of CSR initiatives annually in MCA21 registry. All data reported in the MCA21 registry by companies on CSR is available on National CSR Data Portal at www.csr.gov.in.On the basis of filings made by the Companies in the MCA 21 registry, the details of CSRspendby thevarious public and   private   sector companies under the Companies Act, 2013 for the financial years 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18are given below:  Nature of Company	Year of Filing	2015-16	2016-17	2017-18	No. of Companies	TotalAmountSpent(inRs.
