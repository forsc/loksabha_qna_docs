                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (f): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.   STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (f) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2595 BY SHRI SUNIL DATTATRAY TATKARE, DR. SUBHASH RAMRAO BHAMRE, SHRI MOHANBHAI KALYANJI KUNDARIYA, DR. DNV SENTHILKUMAR S., DR. AMOL RAMSING KOLHE, SHRI KULDEEP RAI  SHARMA AND SHRIMATI SUPRIYA SULE TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 04.12.2019  REGARDING HEALTH ATMs(a) to (f): No, Sir.  However, in order to earn revenue through sources other than freight & passenger fares, Indian Railways have issued Non-Fare Revenue (NFR) policies/schemes on Mobile Assets, Out of Home Advertising, Rail Display Network, Unsolicited proposals, Content on Demand in 2017 and New and Innovative Ideas and Concept Schemes (NINFRIS) in 2018 respectively.  Full powers have been delegated to General Managers and Divisional Railway Managers to implement the policies and they are empowered to explore various means of generating additional non- fare revenues. While no Health ATM has been installed under the Public-Private-Partnership mode, 24 Health Kiosks have been setup at a few railway stations by private licensees on payment of license fee to Railways. The private licensees man the Health kiosks by their own staff. The machines provide information about various health parameters. No funds have been allocated by the Government for the purpose as the Kiosk. The above facility is available only at stations where licensees have come forward to install the machines under non-fare revenue generation policies.*****
