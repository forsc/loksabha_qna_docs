ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES (SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) to (c): Ministry of Food Processing Industries has been implementing Mega Food Park Scheme (MFPS) to create modern infrastructure for the food processing in the country by linking agricultural production to the market through establishment of Food processing infrastructure near the farm, transportation, logistics and centralised processing centres. It includes creation of infrastructure for primary processing and storage including cold chain infrastructure facilities near the farm gate at Primary Processing Centres (PPCs) / collection centres (CCs) and common facilities and enabling infrastructure at Central Processing Centre (CPC) bringing together farmers, processors and retailers. The Scheme is based on cluster approach and is demand driven.          Ministry does not establish Mega Food Parks on its own. The proposals for setting up of Mega Food Parks are invited through Expression of Interest (EoI) and are selected on merit as per the criteria specified in the Mega Food Parks Scheme guidelines.         Presently, Ministry has approved 41 Mega Food Parks in the country including 2 Mega Food Parks in Surat and Mehsana districts in the state of Gujarat. There is no proposal under consideration with Ministry for setting up of Mega Food Park in Saurashtra region of Gujarat especially in Jamnagar.*****
