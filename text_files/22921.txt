ANSWERMINISTRY OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. ****    Statement referred to in reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No.*348 for answer on 19.03.2021 raised by Shri Khagen Murmu regarding ‘CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN’. (a) to (c)  The Government  reviewed the POCSO Act, 2012 in the year 2019 in the light of the rise of incidences of child sexual abuse in the country.  Accordingly, the POCSO Act, 2012 was amended in 2019 in order to make it more effective in dealing with cases of child sex abuse. It addressed the need for stringent measures to deter child sex abuse in the Country on one hand and the menace of relatively new kind of crimes on the other hand. It provides for more stricter punishment including ‘death penalty’ for offenses committed under the Act.Section 43 of the POCSO Act provides that the Central Government and every State Government shall take all measures to give wide publicity to the provisions of the Act. In accordance with this, the Government has taken various steps from time to time to create awareness on the provisions of the POCSO Act through electronic and print media, consultations, workshops and training programmes with stakeholders concerned.  Further, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018 was also  enacted to prescribe  stringent penal provisions including death penalty for rape of girls below the age of 12 years, as effective deterrence against sexual offences. The Act  inter-alia mandates completion of investigation and filing of charge sheet in rape cases in 2 months and trials to  be completed in 2 months (Section 173 CrPC).‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibilities to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens rest with the respective State Governments. The State Governments are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provisions of laws. ****
