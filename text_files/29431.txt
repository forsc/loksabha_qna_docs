ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI  R.K. SINGH)(a)	Government of India launched the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (Saubhagya) in October, 2017 with the objective to achieve universal household electrification. The Scheme aimed to provide electricity connections to all willing un-electrified households in rural areas and all willing poor households in urban areas in the country by March, 2019. As on 31.3.2019, all households were reported electrified by the States, except 18,734 households in Left Wing Extremists (LWE) affected areas of Chhattisgarh.  Subsequently, seven States namely Assam, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Manipur, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh reported that around 19.09 lakh un-electrified households, identified before 31.03.2019, which were unwilling earlier but later on expressed willingness to get electricity connections. All these seven States have since then reported 100% household electrification as on 31.03.2021. Since the launch of Saubhagya Scheme, a total of 2.817 crore households have been electrified up to 31.03.2021. State-wise and year-wise details of electrification of Households under Saubhagya are available as Annexure.(b)	No intervention of “Own your transformer scheme” was envisaged under the Saubhagya scheme by the Government of India.
