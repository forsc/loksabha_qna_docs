Subsequently, Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the ‘Act’) was amended vide Companies (Amendment) Act, 2019 and Companies (Amendment) Act, 2020. These amendments provided for the transfer of unspent CSR amount and made the non-compliance of CSR provisions a civil wrong w. e. f. 22nd January 2021. Further, Companies (CSR Policy) Rules, 2014 was also amended which have strengthened the CSR eco-system by bringing more objectivity, transparency, entrusting more responsibility on the board and enhancing the disclosures by the companies. *******
