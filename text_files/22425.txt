The promulgation of “Positive Indigenisation List” recognises the potential of the local defence industry to meet Defence needs of the Indian Armed Forces.	The List earnestly supports the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan and will invigorate impetus to domestic Research & Development by attracting fresh investment into technology and manufacturing capabilities.	This would also provide a long-term direction to defence procurement plans, and Industry can now plan its Capability Building, Capital Expenditure & Production Capability.(b) & (c):  In line with Government of India’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, the funds for Capital Procurement have been earmarked between Domestic and Foreign procurement in the Capital Acquisition Budget for the year 2021-22.  The funds have been earmarked for all three Services in the ratio of 64:36 between Domestic and Foreign procurement in the Capital Acquisition Budget for the year 2021-22.	It has also been decided that Services will further earmark a total of Rs. 1000 Crore towards Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX) initiative during Financial Year 2021-22 from within their allocation for Domestic Procurements. *****
