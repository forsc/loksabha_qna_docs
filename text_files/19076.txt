THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                        (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)	to (d) :Yes, Sir.  In terms of Smart Cities Mission Statement &Guidelines, Government of India will provide financial support to the Mission to the extent of ? 48,000 crores over five years i.e. on an average ? 100 crores per city per year. An equal amount on a matching basis will have to be contributed by the State/Urban Local Body (ULB). Apart from these, around ? 42,028 crore (21%) is expected from convergence with other Missions,  ? 41,022 crore (21%) from PPP, around ? 9,843 crore (4.8%) from loans, ? 2,644 crore (1.3%) from own resources and remaining from other sources.	Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has taken proactive steps to identify various sources of financing Smart City projects including, among others, from external agencies such as World Bank, Asian Development Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency, AgenceFrancaise de Development (AFD), European Union etc.  Moreover, some Smart Cities are being provided technical Assistance by international development agencies like Deutsche Gesellschaft Fur InternationaleZusammenarbeit (GIZ), United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), United Nations Development Program (UNDP), International Finance Corporation (IFC), United States Department of the Treasury (US-Treasury) etc. 		The City Investments to Innovate, Integrate and Sustain (CITIIS) Program has been launched in July 2018 with AFD, European Union and National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) for providing technical and financial assistance of € 100 Million to cities in implementing urban infrastructure projects that are integrated, innovation-driven and sustainable.	12 Smart Cities namely Agartala, Amravati, Amritsar, Bhubaneswar, Chennai, Dehradun, Hubbali-Dharwad, Kochi, Puducherry, Surat, Ujjain, Visakhapatnam have been selected through a challenge process for funding and technical assistance under the CITIIS Program. 	MoHUA has also signed an agreement with United States Department of the Treasury (US Treasury) for providing technical assistance to Vadodara, Rajkot, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Mysuru, Mangaluru and Faridabad for providing technical support in issuing Municipal Bonds. Similarly, an agreement has been signed with United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) for implementation of the National Urban Innovation Program.	In an attempt to get global expertise, many countries have supported Indian Smart Cities in identifying projects and technology solutions. For example, United States of America (USA) has supported the cities of Vishakhapatnam, Ajmer, Allahabad; United Kingdom has supported Pune, Amravati and Indore; Germany has supported Bhubaneswar, Coimbatore and Kochi and France has supported Chandigarh, Puducherry and Nagpur.	Further, Panaji Smart City, Goa has also signed a partnership agreement with Government of Denmark for developing an Urban Living Lab. Government of Denmark is also supporting Tumakuru Smart City in its technology driven projects. Department of International Development (DFID) of United Kingdom provided technical assistance to the Mission at the national level.                              …….
