ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW) (a) to (c) As a part of the exercise of rationalization of time table and speeding up train services, few stoppages have been discontinued.	At present, 11057 Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj(T)-Amritsar Express has scheduled stoppage at Karnal and Nilokheri, which are 12 km and 04 km from Taraori respectively and from where passengers may avail changeover for their onward journey.(d) to (f) 11057/58 Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj(T)-Amritsar Express is operational/running and serving Mumbai-Bina-Amritsar sector. Demands, including that from the Hon’ble Member of Parliament, have been received for provision of stoppage 11057 Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj(T)-Amritsar Express at Taraori.  These have been examined but found operationally not expedient, at present. However, provision of stoppages in existing train services is an ongoing process on Indian Railways subject to operational feasibility and commercial justification.*****
