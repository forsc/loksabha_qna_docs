                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (d):	There is no such proposal in the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. Further, the Ministry of Human Resource Development had constituted a committee under the Chairmanship of Dr. K. Kasturirangan to draft a National Education Policy (NEP). The Committee has submitted their draft report to the Ministry of Human Resource Development on 31.05.2019. Para 16.8.2 of Chapter 16 of the draft NEP, 2019 states that the first year or two of the MBBS course will be designed as a common period for all Science graduates after which they can take up MBBS, BDS, Nursing or other specializations. Common foundational courses based on medical pluralism will be followed by core courses focused on specific systems, and electives that encourage bridging across systems. Graduates from other medical disciplines such as nursing, dental etc., will also be allowed lateral entry into the MBBS course. A medical education qualification framework to achieve this will be developed in conjunction with NMC. The Ministry of Human Resource Development has invited suggestions/comments from various stakeholders including Central Ministries, State Governments and the public on the above mentioned draft report. The Ministry of Human Resource Development will finalize the National Education Policy only after considering the inputs/suggestions/comments of all stakeholders.  At this stage, no final stand has been taken in the matter.
