                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (e):  Government of India has enacted the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010 under which per se there are no such stipulations for the total number of beds available for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) patients in private hospitals or for concessional treatment in private hospitals for EWS patients, or for 25% reservation in private hospitals for free treatment to patients in Outdoor Patient Department (OPD) and 10% for Indoor Patient Department (IPD).  However, the clinical establishments are required to comply with among other conditions, with the laws prevailing in the State/Union Territory (UT), where they are located on any such matters, if any.  Further, implementation of the provisions of the CE Act lies with the State/UT Government, where the said Act has been adopted. The details regarding EWS beds etc. in respect of States/UTs including Tamil Nadu are therefore not maintained centrally.
