ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a)	 to (c): Incidences of Indian fishing boats being attacked by maritime agencies of Sri Lanka and Pakistan have been reported. The Government of India attaches highest priority to the safety and security of Indian fishermen. As soon as reports of attack on Indian fishermen were received, Government of India took up the matter with both these countries. The Government of India has lodged its strong protests with the Governments of Sri Lanka and Pakistan in all such instances and continues to reiterate to these Governments to consider the issue of fishermen as a humanitarian and livelihood matter. To effectively address the issues relating to Indian fishermen, their safety and security between India and Sri Lanka, over the years, bilateral Joint Working Group (JWG) mechanism and meeting of the Honourable Ministers of Fisheries of India and Sri Lanka have been institutionalized.  The last round of the JWG was held in December, 2020, wherein both the Governments discussed the entire gamut of issues related to fishermen. 	Government of India is providing assistance to the fisherman under its schemes.  In order to diversify the fishing activities of Indian fishermen by providing assistance to fishermen of Palk Bay area to enabling them to take up deep-sea fishing including tuna fishing, a subcomponent ‘Assistance to Deep Sea Fishing’ was introduced under the Blue Revolution Scheme of the Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying.  An amount of Rs. 300 crore was released during 2017-18 towards subsidy to the Government of Tamil Nadu for procurement of deep-sea fishing vessels under this scheme and for construction of Fish Landing Centre at Kunthakal in Rameshwaram district of Tamil Nadu. Training is also provided to fishermen on deep sea fishing and handling techniques. Blue Revolution Scheme also had another component to provide financial assistance for promoting open sea cage culture as alternative livelihood support to coastal fishermen and their families for diversification. The Department of Fisheries is implementing a flagship scheme namely “Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) with an investment of Rs. 20,050 crore for a period of 5 years with effect from the financial year 2020-21 to 2024-25 in all States and Union Territories. Under PMMSY, financial support is provided to fishermen for communication/tracking and Potential Fishing Zone (PFZ) devices, safety kits besides livelihood and nutritional supports as well as insurance. PMMSY also provides for multipurpose support services to fishermen through Sagar Mitras.	PMMSY also provides for financial assistance for promotion of seaweed cultivation, open sea cage culture, seed rearing, bivalve cultivation, recreational fisheries and sea ranching to marine fishers for diversification of livelihood. *****
