This step is being taken in a bid to control inflationary pressures and provide relief to consumers.The domestic price of crude is linked to international benchmarks (prices) of crude prices. These benchmarks get affected by many factors including supply and demand, impact of the covid scenario and geopolitical situation. Linear co-relation between pricing and any one of these factors in isolation is indeterminable.********
