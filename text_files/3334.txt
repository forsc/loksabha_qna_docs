ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                                 (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a):	As per National Institute of Transforming India (NITI) Aayog’s “Composite Water Management Index (CWMI)” published in June, 2018, 21 major cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, are expected to reach zero groundwater levels by 2020, affecting access for 100 million people.	Water supply being a State subject, it is the responsibility of the State Government/ Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to plan, design, execute, operate and maintain water supply system as per the required standards and quantity. Government of India augments such efforts of the State through its various schemes and initiatives.	Government of India launched Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) on 25 June, 2015 to provide basic services such as drinking water, sewerage etc. to households in 500 selected Mission cities in the country. Water supply is one of thrust areas of the Mission under which projects related to augmentation of existing water supply, water treatment plants, rehabilitation of old water supply systems, rejuvenation of water bodies specifically for drinking water supply and recharging of ground water etc. can be taken up by the States/Union Territories (UTs) to enhance water supply in the Mission cities. So far, 1273 projects worth Rs.42,254 crore have been taken up under the Mission by the States/UTs, of which, contracts have been awarded for 1133 projects worth Rs.34,002 crore including 278 completed projects worth Rs.2,305 crore. In addition, 140 projects worth Rs.8,252 crores are at various stages of tendering.Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs have taken additional measures aimed at water conservation like issuance of guidelines for Urban Regional Development Plan Formulation and Implementation (URDPFI) and Model Building Bye-laws (MBBL) for the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and Urban Development Authorities (UDA) to implement rain water harvesting and take other water conservation measures. Central Public Works Department has also brought out a manual on “Rain Water Harvesting & Conservation” in June, 2012 to augment groundwater levels.Recently, Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) has been launched by Government of India to intensify efforts for conservation, restoration, recharge and reuse of water through rain water harvesting, rejuvenation of water bodies and reuse of treated waste water etc.Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is participating actively in the Abhiyanand has issued “Guidelines for Urban Water Conservation” for the States/UTs.(b) & (c):	Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has been constituted under Section 3(3) of the “Environment (Protection) Act, 1986” for the purpose of regulation and control of ground water development and management in the country. CGWA has issued directives to the Chief Secretaries of all States as well as Administrators of all UTs to take measures to promote/adopt artificial recharge to groundwater/rain water harvesting. It also grants No Objection Certificates (NOCs) for groundwater extraction to Industries, Infrastructure units and Mining projects in feasible areas with mandatory conditions for conservation, augmentation and efficient use of groundwater. As per current guidelines, individual households do not require permission to extract groundwater, whereas residential societies require NOC for groundwater extraction.  Further, Ministry of Jal Shakti has circulated a Model Bill to all the States/UTs to enable them to enact suitable groundwater legislation for regulation of its development, which includes provision of rainwater harvesting. So far, 15 States/UTs have adopted and implemented the groundwater legislation on the lines of the Model Bill. 	In Delhi and Tamil Nadu, however, regulation is being done through Government orders.                           *****
