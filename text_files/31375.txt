ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) & (b) :	Yes, Sir. Government of India have provided funds to the States for implementation of smart prepaid metering under National Smart Grid Mission (NSGM) and Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS). Further, under the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) launched by Government of India on 20th July, 2021, provisions have been made to install 25 Crore pre-paid smart meters across the country.The details of smart meters, including prepaid smart meters already installed in the country are available as Annexure.(c) & (d) :	Prepaid smart metering eliminates human interventions in metering, billing and collection, while at the same time provides consumers the choice to calibrate their consumption to their actual requirements on a near real time basis. Automatic metering, billing and collection eliminate inefficiencies in these processes including losses due to theft.  This helps in reduction of Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses. ...........2. - 2 -(e) & (f) :	The Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme envisages financial support to DISCOMs for prepaid smart metering. Under the scheme, in “Other than Special Category States”, a fixed amount of 15% (22.5% in case of Special Category States) of the cost per meter worked out over the whole project period, subject to a maximum of Rs.900/- (Rs.1350/- in case of special category States) per meter in case of consumer meters, will be provided as the financial support from the Government of India.  Further, an incentive @ 7.5% of the cost per consumer meter worked out for the whole project or Rs.450 per consumer meter, whichever is lower, would be provided for “Other than Special Category States" for prepaid Smart Meters installed within the targeted timeline of first phase mission i.e. by December, 2023. This incentive for Special Category States would be @ 11.25 % of the cost per consumer meter worked out for the whole project or Rs.675 per consumer meter, whichever is lower.		Remaining cost will be borne by project developer who will be paid on monthly basis which can be easily met from increased collection of revenue by distribution company.For the purpose of execution of this scheme, all North Eastern States including Sikkim and States of Himachal Pradesh & Uttarakhand and Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep will be treated as Special Category States/UTs. *********
