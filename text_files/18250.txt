ANSWER




                                                        (a)	to (d): During the COVID 19 lockdown period, execution of works under the Smart Cities was temporarily halted in varying proportions  across  the  country.  However,  most  cities      have commenced works after un-lockdown which eased the availability of labour and the movement of materials. This could possibly delay the execution of projects by a few months in some cases. Bhubaneswar Smart City have informed that none of their projects were slated to be completed or started during the COVID 19 lockdown period. However, there were ongoing projects which got temporarily delayed. Corrective measures for quick remobilization of work force were undertaken by the Smart City, for which support for return of migrant laborers were provided. Work has now commenced on all such projects.                                    *****
