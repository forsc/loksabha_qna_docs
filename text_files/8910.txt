ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a): Under the scheme Dr. Ambedkar Scheme for Social Integration through Inter Caste Marriages, each couple is eligible for incentive amounting to Rs.2.50 lakhs. (b) & (c): Details of number of Inter-Caste couples who applied and number of couples given the incentive under the scheme in the financial years 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 is at Annexure. (d) to (f): The Dr. Ambedkar Foundation scheme for incentive for inter caste marriage was targeted at the time of inception of the scheme, to cover 500 marriages in one year, which was implemented on a pilot basis for 2 years i.e. 2013-14 & 2014-15.  However, the Dr. Ambedkar Foundation decided to continue the scheme beyond the year 2015.  The target of covering 500 couples in one year is indicative only, and not exhaustive.  The couples are provided incentive only if they are eligible under the provision of the Foundation Scheme. The said incentive is supplementary to the incentive already provided by the respective State Governments.  As such, there is no proposal at present to increase the incentive amount by the Dr. Ambedkar Foundation. *****
