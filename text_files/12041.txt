In addition the government has taken various steps/initiatives  across the country through its various Schemes viz. Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (A-TUFS), Schemes for the development of the Powerloom Sector(Power-Tex), Schemes for Technical Textiles, Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP),Scheme for Additional Grant for Apparel Manufacturing Units under SITP (SAGAM), Jute (ICARE- Improved Cultivation and Advanced Retting Exercise), Integrated Processing Development Scheme (IPDS), National Handloom Development Progarmme, Comprehensive Handloom Cluster Development Scheme (CHCDS), Silk Samagra, Integrated Wool Development Programme (IWDP), North East Region Textiles Promotion Scheme (NERTPS), Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (ROSCTL) etc. The Government had also approved a special package for textile sector with an outlay of Rs. 6000 crores to boost employment generation and exports particularly in Garmenting and Made-ups.****
