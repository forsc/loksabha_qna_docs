ANSWER




                                                        (a): Yes sir. The Hon’ble Supreme Court has passed a number of orders in M.C. Mehta Vs. Union of India (Writ Petition Civil 13029 of 1985) with regard to installation of CNG Stations.(b):Yes sir. As informed by Delhi Development Authority (DDA), 6 (six) number of applications for allocation of lands to applicants are pending. As per the existing policy, DDA allots land for CNG/ Petrol pump to Oil Marketing Companies and not to any individual license holders. DDA has revised license fee to be charged from the allotted fuel stations but the hike in license fee has been opposed by the Oil Marketing Companies. Revision of License fee has also been challenged in Hon’ble High Court of Delhi. The allocation of land for fuel stations including CNG is getting delayed due to non-acceptance of license fee.(c): No time line can be fixed in the light of pending litigation regarding revised license fee and scarcity of land on account of lapsing of acquisition of a large chunk of DDA land under section 24 (2) of Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act (LARR) Act, 2013.                                                  *****
