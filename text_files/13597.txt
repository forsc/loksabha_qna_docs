Government of India has launched the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) on 25th June, 2015 in 500 cities across the country with major focus on Water Supply and Sewerage & Septage Management. A small component under AMRUT Mission is Storm Water Drainage involving construction and improvement of drains and storm water drains in order to reduce and eliminate flooding.In order to formulate the strategy for flood management works in the entire country and river management activities and works in the border areas for period 2020-2023, a Committee has been constituted by NITI Aayog under the chairmanship of Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog. Besides, Officials from Government of India, Experts from the field, Principal Secretaries from States of Jammu & Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Punjab, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala are also the members of  the Committee constituted by NITI Aayog. *****
