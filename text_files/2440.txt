Regular maintenance dredging is undertaken by Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) annually for maintaining the navigable channel of 2.5 m depth between Dhubri and Neamati; 2.0 m depth between Neamati & Dibrugarh; and, 1.5 m depth between Dibrugarh and Oriumghat.  IWAI also undertakes regular works for fairway maintenance, river training and river conservancy.(d) & (e) 	A Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the development of Inland Water Transport (IWT) on NW-2 from Dhubri to Sadiya was prepared in 1989 at the time of declaration of Brahmaputra river as a National Waterway.  Based on the DPR, developmental actions were taken by IWAI for shipping and navigation in the    NW-2.   Further, IWAI undertook a study on ‘Modal shift of cargo passing through Siliguri Corridor destined for North-East and neighboring countries to IWT’ and ‘Pre-feasibility study for the proposed Multi Modal Logistics Park (MMLP) at Jogighopa’ in 2017 to assess the traffic potential for the North-East Region through IWT.                                                     *****
