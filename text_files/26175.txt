The details along with present status of the projects at Central Level is annexed.The proposals for Environmental Clearance (EC) are processed as per the provisions laid down in the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006. As per the procedure prescribed in EIA Notification 2006, the complete proposals received are appraised by Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) at Central level and by State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) at State level. The recommendation of EAC and SEAC are considered by Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change at Central level and SEIAA at state level for approval. The decision on the project gets delayed due to various reasons viz. incomplete proposals, additional information sought by EAC/SEAC etc. However, overall time taken in grant of EC has been coming down steadily due to various efforts taken by Government towards streamlining the EC procedure. ****
