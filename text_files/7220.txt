ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) to (f)  Indian Roads Congress (IRC) has formulated IRC SP: 98:2013 ‘Guidelines for the use of Waste Plastic in Hot Bituminous Mixes (Dry process) in Wearing Courses’ based on laboratory as well as field performance studies/investigations carried out in India.  As per IRC SP: 98: 2013, use of plastic waste is up to 8 percent by weight of bitumen and as per mix design requirement. To encourage use of waste plastic on National Highway, Ministry has also issued Guidelines for its use within 50 km periphery of urban areas having population 5 lakh or more. The Guidelines also stipulate to take up a stretch of at least 10 km as pilot project for assessment of its performance. In the last 3 financial years, waste plastic has been utilised in wearing course in about 11 km of NH stretches in the State of Tamil Nadu. Moreover, Government has decided that in 2019-20 the “Swachhata Hi Seva Campaign (SHS)” will focus on plastic waste management as main theme, wherein instructions have been issued for collection and re-use of waste plastic.  This includes awareness generation, recycling, effective disposal of collected plastic waste including its usage in road construction.*****
