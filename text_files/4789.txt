                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)Forest Fires occur every year during summer due to various natural and anthropogenic reasons. Forest Survey of India, Dehradun, disseminates the satellite based forest fire alerts to the State Forest Departments and other registered mobile users whenever forest fires are detected. Detail of forest fire alerts issued to all State/ Union Territory Forest Departments during last three years is given in Annexure-I.(b)Ministry in collaboration with the World Bank has conducted a study on Situation Analysis of Forest Fire and released a study report titled “Strengthening Forest Fire Management in India” which contains various recommendations regarding forest fire prevention, detection, suppression, post-fire management, engaging with communities, coordination with other agencies etc. Inputs from the study were used by the Ministry in preparation of National Action Plan on Forest Fire which has been circulated to all State/UTs in April,2018 to take appropriate action.(c)As per the report received from the various State/UT Governments, the details of loss of economic wealth, death of wildlife, death of humans, area affected due to forest fire and number of incidents reported due to forest fire are as follows:S. No	Year	No. of forest fire alert as per FSI	Area affected (in hectare)	Economic loss (Rs. in Lakh)	Death of wildlife	Death of Humans1.	2017	35,888	99541.61	373.45	0	02.	2018	37,059	70503.38	495.78	0	213.	2019 (till June )	28,252	10297.52	130.65	0	1(d)	& (e)	No Sir. National Action Plan on Forest Fire was prepared by the ministry after several rounds of consultation with all the State Forest Departments and other stakeholders. The objective of this Plan is to minimize forest fires by informing, enabling and empowering forest fringe communities and incentivizing them to work in tandem with the State Forest Departments. The Plan also intends to substantially reduce the vulnerability of forests across the diverse forest ecosystems in the country against fire hazards, enhance the capabilities of forest personnel and institutions in fighting fires, and speed up recovery after a fire event.Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is the Nodal Ministry for disaster management caused by forest fire, water pollution and hazardous substances in the country. A Crisis Management Committee has been constituted in the Ministry under the Chairmanship of Secretary. For the supervision and review of forest fire management, a Central Monitoring Committee has also been constituted under the Chairmanship of Secretary and represented by Principal Chief Conservator of Forests of all States and Union Territories. Nodal Officer for forest fire prevention and control has been appointed in all the States. Forest Survey of India has been made responsible to keep constant vigil on forest fire across the country and send forest fire alerts on registered mobile numbers in the States. Till date around 50,000 users have been registered to receive the fire alerts from Forest Survey of India. Since forests are managed by the State Forest Departments, responsibility of forest fire prevention and management lies primarily with the respective State Governments. Ministry supports the efforts of State/Union Territory Governments in prevention and control of forest fire by providing financial assistance for various forest fire prevention and management measures under the Centrally Sponsored Forest Fire Prevention and Management Scheme. State Government prepares Annual Plan of Operation for prevention and management of forest fire under this Centrally Sponsored Scheme and funds are released as per the Guideline of the Scheme. A sum of Rs.125 Crore (Rupees one hundred twenty-five Crore) have been released to the States in last three years under this scheme.  In addition, Compensatory Afforestation Fund Rules 2018 provide for utilization of net present value component of the fund for capacity building and providing appropriate firefighting equipment to forest fire fighting squads and activities for forest fire management in the States.******
