ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STEEL			   (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a)to(e): Ministry of Environment & Forest and Climate Change has notified environment protection norms under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. These norms determine whether units are polluting the environment or not. The Steel Plants are to comply with these norms. The Steel Plants are required to obtain Environmental Clearance from the Ministry of Environment & Forest and Climate Change, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/ Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) concerned, as per procedure prescribed. To ensure regular operation of Pollution Control Systems, CPCB and SPCBs conduct inspection and in case of violations of norms, Show Cause Notices are issued. In severe cases immediate closure orders are issued to stop manufacturing activities till the industry ensures up gradation of pollution control devices to meet the norms.  The steel industry being a deregulated sector, investment decisions are taken by the respective steel companies. There is no funding from Ministry of Steel in the steel companies for installation of the pollution control devices.********
