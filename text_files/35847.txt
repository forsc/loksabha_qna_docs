ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)     Under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G), a total target of 16,48,187 houses have been allocated to Uttar Pradesh State during the last four years i.e. from 2018-19 to 2021-22.  Against the target, the State has sanctioned 16,42,581 houses to the beneficiaries, out of which 15,33,471 houses have been completed and remaining 1,09,110 houses are at various stages of completion as on 17.03.2022. The District-wise detail of houses sanctioned, completed and under construction in Uttar Pradesh during the last four years as on 17.03.2022 is given at Annexure. (b)     Poverty Line was last revised in 2009. Since then, it has not been updated and not used for identification of beneficiaries of the programmes. PMAY-G identifies the beneficiaries on the basis of Socio-Economic Census held in 2011. The PMAY-G is being implemented with effect from 1st April, 2016 to provide assistance to eligible rural households on the basis of the Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC), which was conducted in 2011 and the Awaas+ 2018 survey (conducted to identify eligible households claiming to be left out of SECC 2011). The eligible households under PMAY-G are selected using housing deprivation, automatic inclusion and exclusion parameters. Under PMAY-G, a total of 26,09,356 houses have been sanctioned to beneficiaries in Uttar Pradesh  and 2,28,22,425 houses have been sanctioned to beneficiaries for the country as a whole since inception  date (as on 17.03.2022). (c)     Rural Housing is part of the mandate and responsibility of the State Governments. Many State Governments are also implementing their own housing schemes. PMAY-G is supplementing the efforts of the State Governments to provide benefits of housing to eligible beneficiaries.  PMAY-G is being implemented with effect from 1st April, 2016 to provide assistance to eligible rural households with overall target to construct 2.95 crore pucca houses with basic amenities. The beneficiaries are identified from Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011 database and Awaas+ survey. A total target of 50,98,883 houses has already been allocated to the States/UTs from Awaas+ database. The additional steps being taken by the Government to widen the coverage of PMAY-G are given as under:i.	Regular follow ups with the states to ensure provision of land to landless beneficiaries in rural areas. ii.	Micro monitoring of house sanction and completion using latest PMAY-G Dashboard and other IT tools & technologies.iii.	 Performance index dashboard to rank States/Districts/Blocks/Gram Panchayats, thereby creating healthy competition and motivation among the States/UTs for achieving the set targets. iv.	Regular conducting of Social Audits, monitoring by National Level Monitors (NLM) for accountability and transparency.v.	Timely allocation of targets to the States/UTs.vi.	Timely release of funds to the States/UTs and follow up with the States for onward releaseA total of 2,62,34,163 houses have been sanctioned under PMAY-G.  Out of which, 2,28,30,277 houses have been sanctioned to beneficiaries by various States/UTs and 1,75,69,419 houses have been completed.    (d)     Yes Sir.   The timeline for completion of PMAY-G is March, 2024.  *****
