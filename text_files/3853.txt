ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (c): The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one Jawahar NavodayaVidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country. Opening of new JNVs is a continuous processwhich depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government/UT administration to makeavailable requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of the permanent building andmaking available required temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till thepermanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV dependson the availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority. One JNV each has beensanctioned in all the districts of the country (as on 31st May, 2014) including the state of Assam.The state of Tamil Nadu has not yet accepted the Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme.In the state of Assam, three residential schools and one hostel with capacity of 100students each have been sanctioned under Samagra Shiksha scheme in Cachar, Kamrup (Metro)and Majuli districts. Further, 13 sub-districts/blocks, namely, Sarupeta (Pt), Jalah (Pt), Jonai,Umrangso, Mahur, Maibong, Haflong, Dudhnai, Boko, Phuloni, Silonijan, Khoirabari (Pt) andDonka, with more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons have beenidentified for opening of Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS).As JNVs start from the Class VI, posts of Primary Teacher (PRT) are not sanctioned inJNVs. The details of JNVs opened in the country during the last 15 years, State-wise and placewisealong with the details of posts created and staff in position (as on date) for the post ofTrained Graduate Teacher (TGT) and Post Graduate Teacher (PGT) are annexed.(d): The details of PGTs and TGTs posted in JNVs opened in the country during the last 15years, category-wise (as on date) are as under:<pre>Name of the Post UR OBC SC STPGT 256 142 108 44TGT 552 419 206 127</pre>(e) & (f): Posts of PGTs & TGTs in JNVs are sanctioned on regular basis and filled up bytransfer, recruitment and promotion duly following the Government of India rules and guidelineson reservation and concession. Contract teachers are engaged at JNV level on short term basisagainst the available vacancies as temporary measure to ensure that academics of students do nothamper. The details of contract teachers are not maintained by NVS as they are engaged as atemporary measure. Recruitment and promotion drives are conducted from time to time to fill upthe vacancies.*****
