ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY & EARTH SCIENCES(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)??????? ?? ???????????? ??? ?????? ??????? ??  ????? ?????? (???????? ??????)  (??. ???????? ????) (a) & (b): No significant brain drain to an extent of affecting the developments in Science and Technology (S&T) sector has been observed by the Union Government. A three-pronged strategy has been adopted to retain the best human resource in the country. First strategy has been the creation of substantial sophisticated research infrastructure, environment for scientific pursuit and academic / research institutions. Secondly, opportunities have been created for overseas scientists of Indian origin to contribute to our country. Thirdly, new opportunities have been created for postdoctoral research in the country.(c):       Several measures have been taken to reduce brain drain from the scientific community. The extramural funding schemes of Department of Science and Technology (DST) and Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and Fellowship schemes of DST, DBT and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) have been designed to encourage scientists to do quality research in the country. Several schemes/programmes for building research infrastructure for enhancing research capabilities such as Fund for improvement of S&T infrastructures in universities and higher educational institutions (FIST) have been instituted. Other schemes like Core Research Grant, Research fellowships such as JC Bose and Swarnajayanti are targeted at scientific community to empower them to pursue world-class research in cutting edge areas of science and technology. Special attention has been given to young scientists for making them independent and to motivate them to continue their research in the country. A large number of young scientists have been supported through schemes like Start-up Research Grant, National Postdoctoral Fellowship of the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB). MK Bhan-Young Researcher Fellowship Programme of DBT is a new Fellowship scheme to encourage young bright researchers to continue their research in the country after PhD. Visiting Advanced Joint Research (VAJRA) Faculty Scheme of SERB provides a platform for overseas scientists including Non-Resident Indians to undertake collaborative research in Indian Institutions and Universities for a finite period of time. The Flexible Complementing Scheme/Merit based promotion scheme positioned in scientific departments and introduction of Performance Related Incentive Scheme (PRIS) in strategic Departments have also been instrumental in recruiting and retaining scientists. All these measures have been aimed at retaining our scientific workforce in the country and thereby reduce brain drain.*****
