The number of active RuPay cards is dynamic in nature and keeps on changing on real time basis. State/UT-wise data on issue of RuPay cards and active RuPay cards is not centrally maintained. However, State/UT-wise data on number of RuPay cards used for a minimum of one inter-bank (off-us) financial transaction at an ATM or Point of Sale (PoS) in the last 365 days ending on 31st December, 2019, as provided by NPCI, is given in Annexure. The State/UT is the one in which the first financial transaction on an ATM/PoS was made, in the said period.(b)	and (c) Under Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), RuPay cards are issued to account-holders. As on 22.01.2020, 29.86 crore RuPay cards have been issued to PMJDY account-holders. Further, keeping in view the wider acceptability of RuPay card and the role it is playing in facilitating banking transactions by customers/merchants at an affordable cost, Public Sector Banks have been requested to issue RuPay card, in the event of customer not indicating any specific card preference.  As per Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) Master Direction on Know Your Customer (KYC) dated 25.02.2016 (updated as on May 29, 2019), Banks carry out authentication of the customer’s Aadhaar number using e-KYC authentication facility provided by the Unique Identification Authority of India upon receipt of the customer’s declaration that he is desirous of receiving any benefit or subsidy under any scheme notified under section 7 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 (18 of 2016) in his account. They also carry out Aadhaar authentication/off-line verification of an individual, who voluntarily uses his Aadhaar number for verification purpose.As informed by banks, as on 24.01.2020, approximately 85% of the Current Accounts & Savings Accounts (CASA) are Aadhaar seeded.(d)	The Central Government in the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has requested all Ministries/Departments/Institutions to ensure enablement of all the following digital payment modes in their websites/Mobile Apps for receiving payments: a)	Unified Payment Interface (UPI)b)	Dynamic UPI QR codec)	Debit Card (including RuPay)d)	Credit Card (Including RuPay)e)	Internet Banking*****Annexure to Lok  Sabha Starred question No. 20 for 03.02.2020 raised by Ms. Pratima Bhoumik, MP, regarding "RuPay Cards"State/UT	Number of RuPay cards used for a minimum of one inter-bank (off-us) financial transaction at an ATM in the last 365 days ending on 31st December, 2019	Number of RuPay cards used for a minimum of one inter-bank (off-us) financial transaction at PoS in the last 365 days ending on 31st December, 2019Andaman & Nicobar Islands	84,974	33,264Andhra Pradesh	10,950,579	4,566,617Arunachal Pradesh	153,632	57,369Assam	3,837,483	1,153,175Bihar	9,317,714	2,143,750Chandigarh	1,017,119	789,604Chattisgarh	3,456,989	1,158,470Dadra & Nagar Haveli	57,586	16,830Daman & Diu	216,267	172,150Delhi	8,254,963	4,861,808Goa	1,050,762	685,172Gujarat	10,348,040	4,364,013Haryana	7,207,964	4,670,747Himachal Pradesh	2,022,819	924,979Jammu & Kashmir / Ladakh	999,874	308,456Jharkhand	3,295,275	1,256,533Karnataka	17,787,870	10,427,103Kerala	8,361,324	3,531,021Lakshadweep	10,716	361Madhya Pradesh	9,020,063	3,043,864Maharashtra	30,601,101	14,488,405Manipur	360,740	70,772Meghalaya	294,534	126,991Mizoram	188,682	24,166Nagaland	183,999	25,194Odisha	6,824,333	2,141,850Others	9,528,756	3,558,568Pondicherry	827,323	524,031Punjab	5,858,595	3,005,745Rajasthan	10,429,314	3,253,849Sikkim	225,067	79,569Tamil Nadu	22,990,638	10,612,619Telangana	9,310,519	5,915,464Tripura	511,775	146,692Uttar Pradesh	20,047,351	8,209,725Uttarakhand	2,816,235	1,437,208West Bengal	10,577,820	3,144,512Grand Total	229,028,795	100,930,646Source: NPCI		Note: (1)  Only interbank (i.e. OFF-US) financial transactions have been taken into account.
