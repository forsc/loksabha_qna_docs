Selection of clusters  by private partner be based on economic viability coupled with development of the area.(v). Agreement between Gram Panchayat and the private partner that makes the restructured PURA a model for empowerment of Gram Panchayats and public accountability (b): Under the scheme, the Private Partner selected to undertake PURA projects was to identify a Gram Panchayat or a cluster of geographically contiguous Gram Panchayats for a population of about 25,000– 40,000. There may be sub-projects to cover each of the Panchayats within the cluster, or a large single Panchayat could individually provide critical mass to make the project viable.  In the identified PURA area, the Private Partner was to plan and put up an implementation action plan for different sub-projects of PURA.  (c):  The scheme has been discontinued with effect from 2015-16.*****
