ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????         (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):     The Government constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee in April, 2016 to examine issues relating to “Doubling of Farmers Income” and recommend strategies to achieve the same, The Committee submitted its final Report to the Government in September, 2018 containing the strategy for doubling of farmers’ income by the year 2022. After acceptance of the DFI Committee recommendations, the Government has constituted an ‘Empowered Body’ to review and monitor the progress.    The DFI strategy as recommended by the Committee include seven sources of income growth viz., (I) improvement in crop productivity; (II) improvement in livestock productivity; (III) resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; (IV) increase in the cropping intensity;(V) diversification towards high value crops; (VI) improvement in real prices received by farmers; and (VII) shift from farm to non-farm occupations.The Government has adopted several developmental programmes, schemes, reforms and policies that focus on higher incomes for the farmers. All these policies & programmes are being supported by higher budgetary allocations, non-budgetary financial resources by way of creating Corpus Funds like Micro Irrigation Fund, as also in the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying to promote dairy and fishery sectors. There have been several reforms to unleash the potential and these include Market Reforms like Model APLMC (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2017; Establishment of Gramin Agriculture Markets (GrAMs); Agri-Export Policy, 2018; The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2020; The Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act.  2020; Amendments to Essential Commodities Act, 1955; Promotion of National Agriculture Market (e-NAM); Promotion of 10,000 FPOs with necessary financial support under Atma Nirbhar Package (Agriculture)and Supplementary Income transfers under PM-KISAN; Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (PMFBY); Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY); Increase in Minimum Support Price (MSPs) for all Kharif& Rabi Crops ensuring a minimum of 50 percent of profit margin on the cost of production; Har Med Par Ped; Bee-Keeping; Rashtriya Gokul Mission; Blue Revolution; Interest Subvention Scheme; Kisan Credit Card (KCC) that now offers production loan to even dairy & fishery farmers besides agricultural crops etc. In the Budget Announcement 2021-22, allocation to Micro Irrigation Fund has been doubled to Rs 10,000 crore and Institutional Credit has been increased to Rs 16.50 lakh crore. (b):     To provide better insurance coverage to crops for risk mitigation, Government has introduced yield based Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and weather index based Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS) from Kharif 2016 to realize the above objective.  The scheme aims at supporting the sustainable production in agriculture sector by way of providing financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of unforeseen natural calamities, adverse weather incidence and to help in stabilize the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming. The scheme also encourage farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices and ensuring credit worthiness of farmers, crop diversification and enhancing growth and competitiveness of agriculture sector besides protecting farmers from production risk.   Comprehensive risk insurance to farmers is provided against non-preventable natural calamities such as drought, dry-spells, flood, hailstorm, inundation etc. under the scheme from pre-sowing to post-harvest losses.      Financial liability on premium subsidy to farmers is shared by the Central and State Government on 50: 50 basis except in North Eastern States, where it is 90: 10 with effect from Kharif 2020 season.     The scheme is voluntary for the States since inception and for all farmers w.e.f. Kharif 2020.(c):    National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), one of the Missions outlined under the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) was approved by Hon’ble Prime Minister’s Council for Climate Change (PMCCC) in the year 2010. The Mission aims to evolve and implement strategies to make Indian agriculture more resilient to Climate Change.NMSA was approved for three major components i.e. Rainfed Area Development (RAD); On Farm Water Management (OFWM); and Soil Health Management (SHM).Subsequently, four new programmes were introduced namely Soil Health Card (SHC), Paramparagat Krishi VikasYojana (PKVY), Mission Organic Value Chain Development in North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER) and Sub Mission on Agroforestry (SMAF). During 2015-16, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) was operationalised wherein the OFWM component of NMSA was subsumed under Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) component of PMKSY. In addition to the aforementioned programmes under NMSA, Restructured National Bamboo Mission (NBM) was launched in April 2018.*****
