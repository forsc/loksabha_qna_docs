                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (c) : Government has taken several initiatives through schematic and legislative interventions for economic empowerment and over all socio-political and economic development of women. Employment generation coupled with improving employability is the priority of the Government. Government has taken various steps for generating employment in the country like encouraging private sector of economy and through schemes such as Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), Deendayal Antodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Programme (SVEP), Aajeevika Grameen Express Yojana (AGEY) sub-schemes under DAY-NRLM, Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana (MKSP), Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY), Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), National Career Service (NCS) Project, Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY). For ensuring financial inclusion of the poorest of the poor, under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, over 375.5 million bank accounts have been opened in the last five years, and majority of the beneficiaries, that is, over 53.3% are women. Under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, collateral free loans are provided for promoting entrepreneurship. Similarly, the Stand Up India scheme aims to promote entrepreneurship among those who are underserved, including women entrepreneurs. Over 145 million women constituting over 69% of the beneficiaries, benefitted jointly from Mudra Yojana and Stand Up India in the last four years.As per Census 2011, the work participation rate for women is 25.51% as compared to 25.63% in 2001. As per 5th Annual Employment-Unemployment Survey (2015-16) conducted by Labour Bureau by adopting Usual Principal & Subsidiary Status (UPSS) Approach, the Worker Population Rate (WPR) for women is 30.2% in rural areas and 14.8% in urban areas.In addition, to improve women’s participation in the labour force, a number of protective provisions have been incorporated in various labour laws for creating congenial work environment for women workers. These include child care centres, time-off for feeding children, enhancement in paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks, provisions for mandatory crèche facility in the establishments having 50 or more employees, permitting women workers in the night shifts with adequate safety measures, etc. ‘The Sexual Harassment at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013’, has been enacted. The Act covers all women, irrespective of their age or employment status and provides protection against sexual harassment at all workplaces; both in public and private sector, whether organised or unorganised.Further, capacity building and training programmes have been organised for training of Elected Women Representatives (EWRs) in Panchayats to empower them to govern their villages effectively and develop into ‘Grassroot’ changemakers.(d) to (e) :       With regard to records of single women having ownership of land, it is to be stated that as per Seventh Schedule, ''land, that is to say, right in or over land’ is a ‘State’ subject under the Constitution, and as such the primary responsibility lies with the State Governments and Union Territory Administrations to maintain such records.
