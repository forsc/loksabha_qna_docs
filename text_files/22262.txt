ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI KRISHANPAL GURJAR)(a) 	Yes, Sir. State/UT Governments issue Disability Certificates as well as Unique Disability Identity (UDID) cards after assessment of the type of disability and percentage of disability at nominated hospital or through organising special camps. The Government is implementing the Unique Disability Identification (UDID) Project with a view to create a national data base for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) and to issue unique disability ID cards to PwD. The UDID project provides an online platform (swavlambancard.gov.in) for issuance of disability certificates as well UDID cards.(b)	Under the UDID project, the PwDs can apply for UDID card through UDID portal (www.swavlambancard.gov.in)  with proof of identity and address, of which the Aadhaar card is one of the proofs. On receipt of the application on the UDID portal, the concerned District Medical Authority assesses the type and percentage of disability as per the guidelines issued from time to time. Every District Medical Authority has been issued a login-id and password for enabling them official access to the portal for processing the application and grant of certificate of disability as well as UDID card. In addition, the portal has the option of designated District Medical Authorities to sign such certificates of disability as well UDID cards through Aadhaar or digital signature.    (c) to (e) Aadhaar enrollment is an ongoing process and any PwDs can register and get Aadhaar card. The benefits under the government schemes depend upon the eligibility criteria and scheme norms. Mandatory provision of Aadhaar in a scheme depends upon the benefits being given under the specific scheme.  All States/UTs in the country have started generating UDID cards to the PwDs. As on 11.03.2021, 54.62 lakh UDID cards have been generated in all States/UTs. The State/UT-wise details of the UDID cards generated are placed at Annexure-l.As on date, Government of India has sanctioned an amount of Rs. 17.93 crore to the State/UT governments for implementation of the UDID Project.*****
