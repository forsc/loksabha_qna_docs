The Mega Food Park Scheme (MFPS) aims at providing modern infrastructure facilities for food processing along the value chain from farm to market. The salient features of the scheme are mentioned in Annexure-I. Total 42 Mega Food Parks (MFPs) were envisaged by the Government. As on date, Ministry has accorded final approval to 37 MFPs in 23 States/UTs which are under various stages of implementation. Out of this, 19 MFPs are operational.
