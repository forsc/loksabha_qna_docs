ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a):	The details of beneficiaries who have been registered and transferred the benefits so far under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana (PM-KISAN), including district-wise details in respect of the State of  Rajasthan, are given at Annexures I to IV.(b) to (e):	Registration of farmers for this scheme and subsequent installment-wise transfer of benefits to them is a continuous and ongoing process. The transfer of benefits to the identified eligible beneficiaries takes place as and when their correct and verified data are uploaded by the concerned State / UT Governments on PM-Kisan web-portal www.pmkisan.gov.in. Contd…2/--2-The data of beneficiaries so uploaded by the State / UT Governments undergoes a multi-level verification and validation by various concerned agencies  and  uploading of error-free data by the State / UT Governments. Thereafter only the amount is successfully transferred into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. This entire process is replicated for transfer of every installment. Hence, at any point of time, there remains substantial unprocessed data of beneficiaries which are taken care of in due course of time. However, all eligible beneficiaries are entitled to be paid their benefits from the 4-monthly period in which their registration has taken place, and hence they will not lose the benefit of any installment for procedural delays, except on account of their ineligibility.To further facilitate registration of farmers, an exclusive ‘Farmers Corner’ has been provided in the PM-KISAN Web-portal through which the farmers can do their self-registration.  Farmers can also edit their names in PM-Kisan database as per their Aadhaar Card through the Farmers Corner.  Farmers can also know the status of their payment through the Farmers Corner.  The village-wise names of the beneficiaries are also available in the Farmers Corner.  Common Service Centres (CSCs) have also been authorized to assist the farmers in performing the above tasks.On the instructions of the Union Government, the States have organized Publicity/Awareness Camps to ensure expeditious Aadhaar authentication of the data of the beneficiaries along with new registrations and correction of already registered data.
