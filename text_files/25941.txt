ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) Telangana State Pollution Control Board has informed that no wastes, especially from pharmaceutical industries, are dumped into river Musi.(b) & (c) Cleaning/rejuvenation of rivers is an ongoing process. It is the responsibility of the States/UTs and local bodies to ensure required treatment of sewage and industrial effluents to the prescribed norms before discharging into water bodies or land to prevent and control of pollution therein. For conservation of rivers, excluding Ganga and its tributaries, this Ministry has been supplementing efforts of the States/UTs by providing financial and technical assistance for abatement of pollution in identified stretches of rivers in the country through the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP).Under NRCP, pollution abatement projects for conservation of river Musi have been implemented in Hyderabad at a total cost of Rs.335.65 crores and 4 Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) of total capacity of 593 million litres per day (MLD) have been constructed for treatment of municipal sewage. No funds have, however, been provided by the Union Government in the last three years under NRCP for conservation of river Musi.At present, 25 Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) with total capacity of 772.5 MLD in the catchment of river Musi are operational. In addition, work order for 17 STPs of 376.5 MLD capacity have been awarded at an estimated cost of Rs.1280 crore under Hybrid Annuity Model by Telangana Government.In compliance of the orders of National Green Tribunal (NGT) in Original Application No. 673/2018 regarding polluted river stretches in the country, including one stretch of river Musi from Hyderabad to Nalgonda in Telangana, States/UTs are required to implement approved action plans for restoration of the said stretches in their jurisdiction within the stipulated timelines. As per the orders of NGT, regular review on implementation of action plans is undertaken in the States/UTs and also at Center level.Besides, in Original Application No. 426/2018 regarding pollution of river Musi, National Green Tribunal (NGT) has constituted a Monitoring Committee under the chairmanship of Justice Vilas V. Afzulpurkar, former Judge, Andhra Pradesh & Telangana High Court.*****
