                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b): This Ministry implements the ‘Free Coaching Scheme for SC and OBC students’ under which financial assistance is provided for the candidates to undertake coaching for various examinations. Under the Scheme, the Ministry empanels coaching institutes with a prescribed number of slots, to provide coaching to SC and OBC students. The students eligible as per the Scheme guidelines who undergo coaching in these institutes are provided financial assistance for undertaking the course.Two institutes from the State of Tamil Nadu were empanelled under the Scheme with a total allocation of 200 per year. The year-wise percentage of successful candidates from these coaching institutes coached under the Scheme, as reported by the institutes, is as under-Percentage of  Successful candidates2017-18	2018-19	2019-2015%	2.5%	Not reportedThe District wise data of successful students is not maintained.In the current year, physical coaching classes have not started in view of ongoing pandemic situation.(c): There is no  provision under the Scheme for the department to open any Coaching Institutes for SC and OBC students. However, the Department empanels functional coaching institutes, based on the recommendations of the concerned State Governments. Any institute recommended by the concerned State Government, which fulfils the criteria as mentioned in the Scheme guidelines, may apply for empanelment under the scheme. No proposal for empanelment of additional institutes has been received from Tamil Nadu.(d):  The Scheme of “Coaching for Scheduled Tribes” was implemented up to the 11th Five Year Plan period i.e. from 2007-08 to 2011-12. An evaluation study of the Scheme was conducted which found that the present practice of conducting coaching classes appears to be highly unfocussed as the current methods used for coaching is highly impractical, with very low rate of success. The scheme was not revised subsequent to 11th Five Year Plan and the funding for “Coaching for Scheduled Tribes” has been discontinued since 2014-15.****
