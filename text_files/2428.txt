                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) & (b) :   As on 31.05.2019, a total of 204 Hydro Power Projects (above 25 MW) with an aggregate installed capacity of 45399.22 MW were in operation across the country. The State/UT-wise details of such projects along with power being generated during last three years and current year by each of the Hydro Power Projects is given at Annexure-I.  Presently, 36 Hydro Power Projects (above 25 MW) aggregating to 12034.50 MW are under construction across the country. The details, State/UT-wise, are given at Annexure-II. (c) :  		Majority of the Hydro Power Projects in the country, except a few, are generating power as per their installed capacity. However, some of the hydropower projects are not operating at their full capacity due to low inflows besides other reasons such as upstream water conductor system not being ready to its full capacity as per approved layout design and implementation of Renovation & Modernization works in some of the Projects.(d) :  		Out of 36 under construction Hydro Power Projects, 13 Hydro Power Projects aggregating to 4706 MW are stalled. The details of these Projects along with their cost over-run is given at Annexure-III. (e) & (f) :   To promote Hydro Power Sector Government has approved the following measures: 1.	Declaring Large Hydro Power (LHPs) (> 25 MW projects) as Renewable Energy source; 2.	Hydro Purchase Obligation (HPO) as a separate entity within Non-solar Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO);3.	Tariff rationalization measures for bringing down hydro power tariff;   4.	Budgetary Support for Flood Moderation/Storage Hydro Electric Projects (HEPs);5.	Budgetary Support to Cost of Enabling Infrastructure, i.e. roads/bridges etc.The above measures will help the revival of stalled hydro power projects.The other steps being taken by the Government for completion of hydro power projects in a time bound manner in the country are as follows :-  •	Central Electricity Authority (CEA) is regularly monitoring the under construction hydro power projects (above 25 MW). The progress of each project is monitored continuously through site visits and interaction with the developers & other stake holders. Member (Hydro), CEA holds regular review meetings with the developers and other stakeholders.•	Ministry of Power reviews the progress of ongoing hydroelectric projects regularly with the concerned officers of CEA, State Utilities / CPSUs / Project developers, etc. •	Project Monitoring Group (PMG) set up under Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) resolves issues / bottlenecks faced by developers by taking up with Central / State Government authorities.•	Issues are also raised in PRAGATI, for proactive governance and timely implementation, as and when required.•	In case of Central Power Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) projects, the project Implementation parameters / milestones are incorporated in the annual MoU signed between respective CPSU’s and MoP and the same are monitored during the quarterly performance review meetings of CPSU’s and other meetings held in MoP/ CEA. The issues related to erection and supply of Electro-Mechanical equipment is expedited with BHEL in various meetings held in CEA / MoP and other local issues affecting the progress of works are taken up with respective State Governments by the Concerned CPSU / MoP.**************
