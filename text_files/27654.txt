ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS                                                                   [RAO INDERJIT SINGH](a) & (b):  The Government provides the broad framework for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) through Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act’), Schedule VII of the Act and Companies (CSR Policy) Rules, 2014. The Schedule VII of the Act indicates the activities that can be undertaken by the companies as eligible CSR activities. The Ministry vide General Circular no. 21/2014 dated 18th June, 2014 clarified that items mentioned in Schedule VII are broad based and can be interpreted liberally.  Item no. (iv) of Schedule VII covers “ensuring environmental sustainability, ecological balance, protection of flora and fauna, animal welfare, agro forestry, conservation of natural resources and maintaining quality of soil, air and water;”  and also includes  ‘renewable energy projects’. The CSR spent under item no. (iv) of Schedule VII of the Act in Karnataka for the financial years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 respectively is as follows: State 	FY 2017-18	FY 2018-19	FY 2019-20Karnataka (INR Crore)	279.74	178.51	192.90             (Data upto 31.03.2021) [Source: National CSR Data Portal]Contd…2/--2-(c):   Since the inception of CSR provision in 2014, the Government has taken various initiatives for effective implementation of CSR by way of issuing clarifications,  and amendment in the CSR provisions and  rules made thereunder  from time to time.  The recent amendments to CSR provisions aim at strengthening the CSR ecosystem by improving the disclosures, simplifying the compliances, bringing in more objectivity and transparency, and entrusting more responsibility on the Board of the company. These amendments inter-alia, include mandatory registration of implementing agencies with the Ministry, treatment of unspent amount, impact assessment of CSR projects, modalities for creation and acquisition of capital assets through CSR etc.  Further, Ministry also organizes various workshops, webinars and capacity building programmes related to CSR through Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs (IICA) and professional institutes for sensitizing the stakeholders on policy related matters. Similarly, Ministry had also instituted National CSR Awards (NCSRA) to recognize corporate initiatives and excellence in CSR. (d):  As per the Act, companies are required to hold Annual General Meeting (AGM) within six months from the end of financial year. Thereafter, financial statements and board report containing disclosure about CSR, are to be filed in MCA21 within 30 days of the AGM.  Thus, the CSR data for the Financial Year 2020-21 is not available and filings for Financial Year 2021-22 are required to be made only after the end of current financial year.  However, on the basis of filings made by the companies in the MCA21 registry, the CSR spent by Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and private companies in Karnataka during the financial years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 respectively is as follows: Company Type	Amount SpentFY 2017-18	Amount spentFY 2018-19	Amount spentFY 2019-20PSUs	131.64	211.95	214.44Non-PSUs	902.68	1,012.97	1,169.22Total (INR Crore)	1,034.32	1,224.92	1,383.66   (Data upto 31.03.2021) [Source: National CSR Data Portal]       ******
