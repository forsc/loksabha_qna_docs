ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) Yes, Sir. As per India’s Third Biennial Update Report (BUR) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Feb 2021, India has successfully continued decoupling its economic growth from Green House Gases (GHGs) emissions, resulting in reduction of the emission intensity of its GDP by 24 per cent between 2005 and 2016 against a target of 33-35 percent reduction by 2030. As on 31 January 2021, the share of non-fossil fuel based capacity in the total installed electricity generation capacity is about 38.53% against a target of 40 percent by 2030.(b) Under Green Climate Fund (GCF), so far three projects have been approved for India with a total grant-cum-loan assistance of USD 177.82 Million. The total cost of the three sanctioned projects is USD 546.57 Million, including co-financing, to address both adaptation and mitigation measures. (c) to (d): Renewable energy target of 450 GW by 2030 was announced at the Climate Ambition Summit in December 2020. This reflects an enhancement over the target of 175 GW by 2022.***
