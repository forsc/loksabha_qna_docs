THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI SOM PARKASH)(a) & (b): Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, along with Invest India, initiated the process of developing the portal as a National Single Window System (NSWS). Envisioned as a one-stop shop for taking all the regulatory approvals and services in the country, NSWS [www.nsws.gov.in] was soft-launched on 22nd September, 2021 by Hon''ble Commerce & Industry Minister.  This national portal integrates the existing clearance systems of various Ministries/ Departments of Government of India and State Governments without disruption to their existing IT portals. Currently, IT portals of 19 Ministries/ Departments and 13 States’ Single Window Systems have been linked with the NSWS Portal. List of the linked Ministries/ Departments and States may be seen at Annexure.The Know Your Approvals (KYA) Module, a pre-investment advisory has been launched with more than 3000 approvals of Central Ministries/ Departments and various States. The Unified Application Form (UAF) has been enabled as a common application form for potential investors and is a dynamic form that captures all basic investor details, ensuring that there is no duplication of information being requested from investor.  Central Document Repository, a personalized document storage facility facilitates the investors to upload required documents and attach them to the forms as per the requirements of each approval. Once the investors complete the forms and submit all the required documents, they are prompted to make payment through the Payment Service on the NSWS corresponding to all the applications made. Once the application is submitted on the NSWS, the investors are able to monitor status of the application through the Investor dashboard. Apart from obtaining the final approval status on the NSWS, the investors are also able to raise queries and grievance as needed. ******
