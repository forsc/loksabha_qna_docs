ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): Airports Authority of India (AAI) owns and maintains 11 airports in Gujarat including two Civil Enclaves at Bhuj and Jamnagar. The airports at Ahmedabad, Bhavnagar, Kandla, Porbandar, Rajkot, Surat and Vadodara are DGCA licensed airports. DGCA does not have mandate to license Civil Enclaves at Defence Airfields. Further, Deesa Airport is a non-operational airport and for Keshod Airport, AAI has already submitted documents to DGCA for obtaining License. ;(c): Government of India, Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik) in October, 2016 with the objective to facilitate / stimulate regional air connectivity to  underserved and unserved airports. The revival of airstrips/airports is ''''demand driven'''', depending upon firm commitment from airline operators as well as from the State Government for providing various concessions. A tripartite agreement between Government of Gujarat, Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) and AAI has been signed for implementation of the RCS. Commercial air services from Bhavnagar, Jamnagar, Kandla and Porbandar have commenced under RCS.;(d): Indian carriers are free to mount services from any point in India including Surat airport to foreign destinations as per the respective bilateral air services arrangements whereas foreign airlines can operate only on designated point of call available under the bilateral arrangements. However, actual operations are always guided by commercial judgement of airlines.
