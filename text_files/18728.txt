ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS(SHRI D V SADANAND GOWDA)(a):   Chemical fertilizers are contributing substantially towards increase in crop production since green revolution due to introduction of high yielding varieties.(b):    There is no scientific evidence of degradation of soil with judicious use of chemical fertilizers. However, imbalanced use of chemical fertilizers coupled with low addition of organic matter and neglect of micro and secondary nutrients over years results in multi-nutrient deficiencies and deterioration of soil health particularly in intensively cultivated areas. The limiting nutrients, not allowing full expression of other nutrients, lower the overall fertilizer response and crop productivity. 	The NRM division of Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) is recommending soil test based balanced and integrated nutrient management through conjunctive use of both inorganic and organic sources (manure, biofertilizers, green manuring, in-situ crop residue recycling etc.) of plant nutrients with 4Rs approach i.e. right quantity, right time, right mode and right type of fertilizer for judicious use of chemical fertilizers.(c):     As per Agriculture Census 2015-16, the percentage of small and marginal farmers holding taken together (0.00-2.00 ha.) constitute 86% of total holding.(d):    Urea is being provided to the farmers at a statutorily notified Maximum Retail Price (MRP). The MRP of 45 Kg bag of urea is Rs. 242 per bag (exclusive of charges towards neem coating and taxes as applicable). The difference between the delivered cost of urea at farm gate and net market realization by the urea units is given as subsidy to the urea manufacturer/importer by the Government of India. Accordingly, all farmers including small and marginal farmers are being supplied urea at the subsidized rates.      The Government has implemented Nutrient Based Subsidy Policy w.e.f. 1.4.2010 for Phosphatic and Potassic (P&K) Fertilizers.  Under the policy, a fixed amount of subsidy, decided on annual basis, is provided on subsidized P&K fertilizers depending on their nutrient content. Under this policy, MRP is fixed by fertilizer companies as per market dynamics at reasonable level which is monitored by the Government. Accordingly, any farmer who is buying these fertilizers is getting benefits of subsidy. (e):    The steps being taken to provide direct benefit of subsidy to the farmers are as follows: 1.     DBT in Fertilizers:        The Government has introduced Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system in Fertilizers w.e.f. October 2016. Under the fertilizer DBT system, 100% subsidy on various fertilizer grades is released to the fertilizer companies on the basis of actual sales made by the retailers to the beneficiaries. Sale of all subsidized fertilizers to farmers/buyers is made through Point of Sale (PoS) devices installed at each retailer shop and the beneficiaries are identified through Aadhaar Card, KCC, Voter Identity Card etc. Different States/U.T.s have been put on Go-Live mode w.e.f. 01.09.2017 and the pan-India Roll out has been completed by March, 2018. Across the country, DoF have conducted 10878 training sessions till date. 2.26 Lakh PoS devices have been deployed across all States.  2.  DBT Dashboards for various stakeholders.        After successful PAN-India Roll out, attention was devoted to the development of Dashboards/various reports for stakeholders i.e. Kisan Corner, DOF/Movement Division, States Agriculture Departments, District Collector/District Agriculture Officer, Fertilizer companies and the Marketing Federations. These dash-boards provide various reports, viz., i.	Fertilizer Stock position (overall and production): at Ports, at Plants, in States and District levels.ii.	Proportionate requirement for the season and availability of stocks at various levelsiii.	 ‘Top 20 Buyers’ Listiv.	‘Most Frequent Buyers’ v.	Retailers not selling fertilizersDBT dash-boards can be accessed by general public by clicking the e-urvarak website of DOF (www.urvarak.nic.in). 3.       Launch of PoS Software 3.1 Version:    In 3.1 Version launched on 30th Sept 2020, in addition to existing biometric authentication, contact less OTP based authentication has been introduced keeping in view prevailing Covid-19 Pandemic. Android based Mobile Application and Desktop App have been developed. 4.       SMS Gateway:     The provision has been made in 3.1 version for sending SMS alerts on the following activities: i.	On every transaction through PoS/Desktop and Android Application for purchase of Fertilizers, buyer will also receive the Invoice detail by SMS on the number provided at the time of purchase.ii.	SMS Alert to the Farmers as and when new stock is received/acknowledged by the retailer about total stock availability at the retail outlet from where the farmer purchased fertilizer last time.iii.	Periodic (fortnightly in season & monthly in off-season) SMS to the farmers about for stock availability at the retail outlet from where the farmer purchased fertilizer last time.(f): 	Government of India is creating awareness among the farmers on growing traditional crops in the country under the schemes Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER) & Bhartiya Prakritik Kheti Padhati (BPKP) for natural farming. Handholding of the farmers beginning with formation of cluster/Farmers produces Organization and ensuring their capacity building/awareness generation for taking up organic farming are integral components of PKVY, MOVCDNER & BPKP schemes. Moreover, ICAR through its Plan Scheme “Network Project on Organic Farming (NPOF)” conducts research in 20 centres covering 16 states to develop location specific organic farming package of practices for crops and cropping systems. Organic farming package of practices for 51 crops/cropping systems have been developed to provide technical backstopping to Parampragat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) scheme under implementation in the country. Besides, ICAR has developed improved and efficient strains of biofertilizers specific to different crops and soil types under Network project on *Soil Biodiversity-Biofertilizers*. Liquid Biofertilizer technology with higher shelf-life has also been developed. The Council has also developed technology to  prepare various types of organic manures such as phosphocompost, vermincompost, bio-enriched compost, municipal solid waste compost, etc. from various organic wastes.  It also imparts training, organises front-line demonstrations to educate farmers on all these aspects.*********
