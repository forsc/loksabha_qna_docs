ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a): Yes Sir, there was heavy rainfall started from 03.00 AM on 29.09.2019 and continued till evening. At about 3.00 PM, there was a sudden increase in water level of Lilagar river, located about 60 mtrs. from the mine boundary in Surbhondi-Renki side.  The sudden increase of water  was so high and heavy that it over flew its banks in the mine side and breached the embankment to enter the mine at a width of about 30 to 40 mtrs.  Power supply was also got disrupted due to damage of Poles and Switches/Cables. The inrush of water gradually diminished and embankment by dumping of earthen material with the help of Dozer was made against River which was further strengthened. The pumping operation was restored on 01.10.2019 and presently 24,000 GPM pumping is being done.  About 60% of water has been dewatered.(b): The coal Production from the mine was restarted immediately after two days of the incidence i.e. from 02.10.2019.  Presently the mine is producing 70,000 Tonnes coal per day, which will further increase.(c) to (d): Power generation from NTPC Sipat got affected during September 2019 and October, 2019 due to flooding of South Eastern Coalfields Ltd. (SECL) Dipka mine on 29th September, 2019. Coal production target is likely to be affected due to flooding of mine. However, SECL has taken actions to make up the shortfall in production by starting a new section in the same mine.  (e): To prevent recurrence of the incidence, following steps have been taken: 1.	New HFL (Highest Flood Level) has been physically demarcated and embankment above the new HFL has been made with earth material.2.	Scientifically designed structured embankment with stone pitching will be constructed and construction work will be completed before onset of next monsoon. ****
