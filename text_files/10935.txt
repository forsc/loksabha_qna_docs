ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (d) The Odd-even scheme has been listed as an emergency (severe+) measure in Graded Response Action Plan, notified on January 12, 2017. The scheme has been implemented thrice by the Delhi Government till date, first during January 1-15, 2016, then from April 15-30 in 2016 and recently from November 4-15, 2019. Central Pollution Control Board had conducted an assessment of the odd-even scheme implemented from 1st to 15th January, 2016 in Delhi. The report stated that while some reduction in air pollution is likely to happen due to odd-even scheme, a single factor or action cannot substantially reduce air pollution levels in Delhi. During 2019, the data is compiled for odd-even period (12 days), pre odd-even period and post odd-even period for the same number of days and presented in below.  The data does not show much variation in pollution levels during the odd-even period.  The average concentration and range of concentration for pre odd-even period was higher with respect to odd-even period and the post odd-even period is lower than that of odd-even period.
