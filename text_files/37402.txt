ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) & (b): The Government is aware about the potentiality of the Solapur (Hotgi) Airport. However, obstructions like presence of four chimneys of a sugar factory in the East and huge habitation in the West of the airport are obstructing commercial operations from the airport. The responsibility to demolish the obstructions around the airport lies with the local authorities and the State Government of Maharashtra. Union Ministry of Civil Aviation has requested Government of Maharashtra to issue instructions for demolition of chimney of the said sugar factory so that aircraft operations at Solapur Airport can take place safely.;(c): The State Government of Maharashtra has identified land in Boramani village for construction of a new Greenfield airport, which has been planned to be developed through a Joint Venture Company of Airports Authority of India (AAI) (51%) & Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) (49%). The identified land also includes a patch of 32 hectare of forest land. The State Government had requested permission of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) to deforest the said land. However, the same has been denied due to habitation of Great Indian Bustard in vicinity of airport land. The State Government  of Maharashtra has requested MoEF&CC to review its decision. ;******
