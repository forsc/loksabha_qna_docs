The said proposals were examined as per approved modalities, in consultation with the Registrar General of India (RGI). As the RGI did not support the proposal of Mallah caste even on a second reference, the same has been rejected with the approval of competent authority. Proposal in respect of Bind caste was not supported by the RGI, accordingly it has been referred back to the State Government with a request to review or further justify their recommendation in the light of observations of RGI. There is no proposal from Government of Bihar for inclusion of Nishad and its sub-castes in the list of Scheduled Castes.(c): No, Sir.(d): Does not arise.(e): As any amendment in the list of Scheduled Castes can be made only by an Act of Parliament in view of clause (2) of Article 341 of the Constitution of India, no time frame can be assigned in the matter.*****
