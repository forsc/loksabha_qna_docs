To compensate the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA workers against inflation, the Ministry of Rural Development revises the wage rate every year based on change in Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labour (CPI-AL) published by Labour Bureau, Shimla for all States/UTs. The wage rate is made applicable from 1st April of each Financial Year.  (c)&(d):       Mahatma Gandhi NREGA is a demand driven wage employment programme. At present, there is no proposal to provide additional working days over and above the guaranteed 100 days as provided in the Act. However, an additional 50 days of wage employment is provided over and above 100 days in the notified drought affected areas or natural calamity effected areas in the country on recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare.  Various steps have been taken for proper implementation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS in all rural areas of the country which include geo-tagging of assets, Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), National electronic Fund Management System (NeFMS), Aadhar Based Payment System (ABPS), Software for Estimate Calculation using Rural rates for Employment (SECURE), Performance Review Committee meetings of the Ministry, Common Review Missions, regular video conferencing and establishment of independent social audit units.*****
