ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a) 	Yes, Sir. The benefits under GSP have been withdrawn w.e.f. 5th June, 2019.  India exported goods worth of US$ 6.3 Billion (as per USTR figures) to USA under the GSP programme during the calendar year 2018, which was 12.1% of India’s total export to USA in the year.  The reason stated by USA was that India has not assured the USA to provide equitable and reasonable access to the market.(b) & (c) Crisil Research Ltd. is not a Government research organization. As per analysis of Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council, only 1% of India’s total Gem and Jewellery exports to USA are expected to be impacted due to the recent withdrawal of GSP benefit.(d) & (e). Exports of key labour intensive sectors to USA in June, 2019 vis-à-vis June, 2018:(Values in US $ Million)( (P) Provisional)S.No.	Commodity	Jun  2018 	Jun  2019 (P)	%Growth1.	Gem &Jewellery	727.3	608.06	-16.42.	Textiles and allied products	682.94	683.95	0.15%3.	Leather and Leather Manufacturer	86.99	84.45	-2.92%Source: DGCISIn order to promote India’s exports including labour intensive sectors, the Government has taken several measures through Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2015-20 and other policy measures taken from time to time.  FTP provides framework for increasing exports as well generation of employment and increasing value addition in the country through schemes of incentives on exports and duty remission/exemption on input for export production.  At the time of Mid-Term Review of FTP in December, 2017, incentive rates for labour intensive / MSME Sectors under Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) were increased by 2%.  The rate under Interest Equalization Scheme was increased to 5% for MSME Sectors w.e.f. 02.11.2018 and merchant exporters were covered under the Scheme w.e.f. 02.01.2019.  A new scheme for Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) covering export of garments and made-ups was notified on 07.03.2019.  Further, the Government provides financial assistance for participation in international fairs, organizing buyer-seller meets, creation of export related infrastructure, etc. under various schemes of the Department of Commerce to boost exports.****
