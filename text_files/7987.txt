                                                        THE MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a) to (c)	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (c) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. *143 TO BE ANSWERED ON 28.11.2019 REGARDING INTER-LINKING OF RIVERS RAISED BY SHRI T.R. BAALU, M.P.(a)	A Committee called “Special Committee on Interlinking of Rivers” has been constituted by Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (Now Ministry of Jal Shakti) on 23rd September, 2014 in compliance with the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its judgement dated 27th February, 2012 in the Writ Petition (Civil) No. 512 of 2002 on ‘Networking of Rivers’ along with Writ Petition No. 668 of 2002. The Committee has been constituted to expedite execution of the Inter-linking of rivers (ILR) projects. Sixteen meetings of the Special Committee on Interlinking of Rivers have been held. The Special Committee on Interlinking of Rivers has not submitted any report identifying 14 links under the Peninsular Component and 2 links under the Himalayan Component. However, the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) formulated National Perspective Plan (NPP) for water resources development in August, 1980 through inter basin water transfer links from water surplus basin to water deficit basin. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component and 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). The FRs of 14 links under the Peninsular Component and 2 links under the Himalayan Component have also been prepared, the details of which are given at Annexure.(b)  The implementation of river link projects involves various steps including preparation of FRs of links, negotiation and consensus among concerned States, preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) of the projects, clearances from Ministry of Environment and Forests and Climate Change, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, techno-economic clearance by Advisory Committee on Irrigation, Flood control & multipurpose projects of Ministry of Jal Shakti and investment clearance. The stage of implementation of a project would be reached after its DPR is prepared, consensus among the concerned States and the requisite statutory clearances are obtained. The estimated time for implementation depends upon the construction schedule as per the DPRs of the inter-inking projects.(c)  The Government is providing assistance to State Governments for flood management and relief measures for drought affected areas through its various schemes and programmes. *****  ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. *143 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 28.11.2019 REGARDING “INTER-LINKING OF RIVERS”.Names of Inter Basin Water Transfer Links, the States involved, name of rivers and status of Feasibility Reports/Detailed Project ReportSl.
