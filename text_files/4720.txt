                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE(IC) OF THE MINISTRY OF AYURVEDA, YOGA & NATUROPATHY, UNANI, SIDDHA AND HOMOEOPATHY                                          (SHRI SHRIPAD YESSO NAIK)  (a) to (d):  A statement is laid on the Table of the House STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 389 FOR 19TH JULY, 2019(a) to (c) BGR-32 is not known so far to the Government as an Ayurvedic drug developed, manufactured and marketed for anti-diabetic use. However, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) constituent laboratories namely CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal & Aromatic Plants (CSIR - CIMAP), Lucknow; and CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute (CSIR-NBRI), Lucknow have jointly developed a scientifically studied herbal product NBRMAP-DB as hypoglycemic formulation. The knowhow and technology of the product was transferred to M/s AIMIL Pharma Limited, Delhi and who obtained license for manufacturing and marketing the formulation as Ayurvedic product under the branded name ‘BGR-34’ with claim of positive effects against Type-II Diabetes for having shown improvement in normalizing blood glucose level along with better quality of life. BGR-34 is known for its availability in the market in various parts of the country and also through online shopping sites.  Being a branded or proprietary Ayurvedic product, BGR-34 does not qualify for inclusion in the Essential Drug List published by the Ministry of AYUSH meant for facilitating supply of medicines to dispensaries & hospitals in the states under National AYUSH Mission.  Nevertheless, it is the prerogative of the Government procurement agencies to consider making formulary or list of medicines to be procured for hospitals and dispensaries following the stipulated codal formalities and procedures. Also, the prerogative is vested with the doctors to choose prescribing BGR-34 or not in accordance with their confidence in the effectiveness of the product as well as the disease condition of individual diabetic patients.  (d)  Mainstreaming of AYUSH is one of the strategies outlined in the National Health Policy-2017 and National Health Mission under which AYUSH facilities are created and co-located in healthcare delivery network. In this direction, grant-in-aid is provided to the States and 15172 AYUSH facilities have been co-located in the Primary Health Centres, Community Health Centres, District Hospitals etc. and 11837 AYUSH medical officers inducted. 7622 Primary Health Centres in the country are reported to have included AYUSH services and AYUSH practitioners. The engagement of AYUSH doctors and paramedics in the Primary Health Centres and their training is supported by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare under National Health Mission (NHM), while the support for AYUSH infrastructure, equipment, furniture and medicines is provided by the Ministry of AYUSH under National AYUSH Mission (NAM).*****
