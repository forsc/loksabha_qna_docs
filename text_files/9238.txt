                                                        THE MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a) to (e) A statement is laid on the table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF STARRED QUESTION NO.*252 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 05.12.2019 REGARDING “PER CAPITA AVAILABILITY OF WATER”.(a) to (c)  The per capita water availability in the country is reducing due to increase in population. The average annual per capita water availability in the years 2001 and 2011 was assessed as 1816 cubic meters and 1545 cubic meters respectively which may further reduce to 1486 cubic meters, 1367 cubic meters, 1282 cubic meters and 1228 cubic meters in the years 2021, 2031, 2041 and 2051 respectively.Ground water level in various parts of the country is declining because of continuous withdrawal due to reasons such as increased demand of fresh water for various uses, industrialization, urbanization, deficient rainfall, etc. Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) is periodically monitoring the ground water levels throughout the Country on a regional scale, through a network of monitoring wells including major cities like Chennai and Bangalore. In order to assess the decline in water level on a long-term basis, pre-monsoon water level data collected by CGWB during pre-monsoon 2019 has been compared with the decadal average (2009-2018). Analysis of water level data indicates about 66% of the wells monitored have registered decline in ground water levels, mostly in the range of 0-2 m. Decline of more than 4 m has also been observed in isolated pockets in parts of following Urban areas in the country viz. Mumbai suburban, Delhi, Hyderabad, Nasik, Pune, Indore, Gwalior, Guwahati, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Faridabad, Vadodara, Jaipur, Bhubaneswar, Ghaziabad, Kanpur, Lucknow, and Meerut. (d) & (e) Water being a State subject, steps to avert water crisis are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments. Central Government supplements the efforts of the State Governments through various schemes and programme.Ministry of Jal Shakti has launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) - a campaign for water conservation and water security. During the campaign, officers, groundwater experts and scientists from the Government of India will work together with State and district officials in India’s most water-stressed districts for water conservation and water resource management.  A meeting of the State Ministers of Water Resources and Water Supply chaired by Minister of Jal Shakti was held on 11th June 2019 to review the steps taken by various States on water conservation and the implementation of action plans to deal with the water supply situation, plan for water harvesting and conservation in convergence with other programmes. State Governments were requested to complete water conservation measures.Central Ground Water Board is implementing a nationwide programme of “National Aquifer Mapping and Management (NAQUIM)” for mapping of aquifers (Water bearing formations), their characterization and development of aquifer management plans to facilitate sustainable development of ground water resources including proper utilization of water resources. Aquifer maps and management plans have been shared with the respective State Government agencies.Contd…P/2//2//Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has prepared the Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Ground Water in India, which envisages construction of 1.11 crore rain water harvesting and artificial recharge structures in the Country to augment ground water resources. The Master Plan has been circulated to the State Governments for implementation.Further, Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has issued directives to all States/UTs to take measures to promote artificial recharge of ground water / rain water harvesting. Government of India has launched Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) on 25th June, 2015 in select 500 cities across the country for a period of five years i.e. from 2015-16 to 2019-20 with focus on development of basic civic amenities in the Mission cities. Under the water supply component of the Mission, projects related to rain water harvesting, rejuvenation of water bodies specifically for drinking water supply, recharging of ground water, etc., can be taken up by the States/UTs to enhance water supply in the Mission cities. Central Water Commission monitors live storage status of 120 reservoirs of the country on weekly basis and issues weekly bulletin on every Thursday. Weekly bulletin is shared with the Water Resources Departments of concerned states and also uploaded on the website of Central Water Commission. Whenever the current storage of reservoirs, being monitored by Central Water Commission, in a State falls below 80% of Normal (Average Storage of last Ten years), advisory is issued to the concerned State Government for judicious use of available water. In the year 2019, Central Water Commission has issued advisory to the State Governments of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Tripura and Uttarakhand for judicious use of available water.*****
