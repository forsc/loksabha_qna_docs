ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES (SHRI RAMESWAR TELI) (a) & (b):  As per Study, “Assessment of Quantitative Harvest and Post-Harvest Losses of Major Crops and Commodities in India” carried out by Central Institute of Post- Harvest Engineering and Technology (CIPHET), Ludhiana in 2015 for the crop year 2012-13, the average range of losses altogether for food grains, oilseeds and fruits & vegetables were estimated to be 4.65% to 15.88%, which indicate that overall losses had gone down by about 2% as compared to a previous study in 2005-07.(c) & (d): The schemes of the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) are, inter alia, aimed at reduction in post harvest losses through enhanced preservation and processing capacity in the sector. MoFPI is implementing a Central Sector scheme- Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) since 2016-17 and the completed projects under component schemes of PMKSY have resulted in creation of about 106 lakh Metric Tonnes of preservation & processing capacity. As part of Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, MoFPI has launched an all India centrally sponsored "PM Formalization of Micro food processing Enterprises (PMFME) Scheme" for providing financial, technical and business support for upgradation of two lakh micro food processing enterprises in a period of five years from 2020-21 to 2024-25 with an outlay of Rs. 10,000 crores. *****
