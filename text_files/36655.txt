                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) to (e) :  The National Commission for Women (NCW) used to provide financial assistance to Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) for organising Parivarik Mahila Lok Adalats (PMLAs) till the year 2014-2015. Thereafter, the scheme has been discontinued by the NCW.  The matters redressed through these Lok Adalats related to family affairs, matrimonial disputes, bigamy, succession, and motor vehicle accident disputes related to labour. The NGOs in association with District Legal Aid and Advisory Boards, activists, advocates and other stakeholders, used to organize PMLAs. Till discontinuation of the scheme in 2014-15, a total of 298 such Adalats were held.  The Government has now approved ‘Mission Shakti’, an integrated women empowerment programme. The program is carefully designed to touch upon and address all concerns and issues of women, responsively, in a comprehensive manner, and during their entire lifecycle continuum. One of the components included in Mission Shakti is ''Nari Adalat''. Initially, it is being started on a pilot basis, for providing women with an alternate Grievance Redressal Mechanism for resolving cases of petty nature (harassment, subversion, curtailment of rights or entitlements) faced by them at local level.   *****
