ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SHRIMATI ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) & (b) The Ministry of Education was implementing a Scheme for Providing Quality Education in Madrasas (SPQEM). SPQEM has now been transferred to the Ministry of Minority Affairs w.e.f. financial year 2021-22 i.e. from 01.04.2021. SPQEM was a voluntary and demand driven scheme. The objective of SPQEM was to provide financial assistance to encourage traditional institutions like Madrasas and Maktabs to introduce modern education through subjects such as Science, Mathematics, Social Studies, Hindi and English in their curriculum through support for a maximum of three teachers and teaching learning material. Further, Madrasas affiliated with the Madrasas Education Board in respective States follow the curriculum of the school education of the respective States. If the State follows NCERT curriculum and textbooks in school education, the Madrasas follow NCERT curriculum and textbooks. The medium of instruction also depends on the respective States.(c) As per the guidelines of SPQEM, financial assistance was provided only to Madrasas that are affiliated to any recognized School Education Board i.e. State Board of School Education, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) etc. Madrasas must obtain recognition as schools from the State Government for availing any assistance under the scheme. SPQEM provided opportunities to students of Madrasas to acquire education comparable to the National Education System especially for secondary and senior secondary levels. This enables children studying in these institutions to progress to higher levels of learning and also opens up better job opportunities for them. *****
