Year-wise allocation and cumulative expenditure for all the 4 sub-schemes of IMD under ACROSS namely, Atmospheric Observation Network (AON), Upgradation of Forecast System (UFS), Weather & Climate Services (WCS) and Commissioning of Polarimetric Doppler Weather Radars (PDWR) during last five years are mentioned below:(Rs. in Crores)Year	Budget Estimates	Revised Estimates	Actual Expenditure2016-17	241.60	166.41	144.082017-18	188.75	149.15	134.092018-19	186.46	185.89	175.942019-20	207.17	224.73	206.042020-21	249.22	155.20	150.33(c)	The sub-schemes under ACROSS are aimed at augmenting the observational network, improving the forecasting system and enhancement of Weather & Climate Services. These activities are meant for the entire country including Tamil Nadu. Details of these sub-schemes are as follows:Atmospheric Observations Network (AON)Main activities of the program undertaken during 2017-21:•	Sustenance and Augmentation of observational networks comprising of Doppler Weather Radars (DWRs), Automatic Rain Gauges (ARGs), Automatic Weather Stations (AWSs), Upper Air, Surface and Environmental Observatories etc. Improve upon the spatial and temporal density of Radar observational network, particularly over the regions with large data gaps in the country.•	To improve and upgrade weather and climate services over north-eastern region by establishing additional state of art surface and upper air observatories for real time observations.•	Sustenance & Establishment of Multi processing, computing and communication facilities for Satellite Meteorological Applications.Upgradation of Forecast System (UFS)Main activities of the program undertaken during 2017-21:•	Upgradation and sustenance of Communication Systems for Data and Product transmission.•	Development of an advanced Operational Forecast System, Delivery System for Forecast and other services.•	Conduct of special campaign for improving Cyclone, Thunderstorm and Fog forecasting through Aircraft reconnaissance and provision of additional observations.•	Integrated Himalayan Meteorological Programme for Western & Central Himalayas.•	Capacity Building, Outreach, Planning and sustenance of specific process related observing systems over India.Weather & Climate Services (WCS)   Main activities of the program undertaken during 2017-21:•	Setting up of District Agro-Met Units (DAMUs) at all the districts complimentarily with existing AMFUs in the country for extension of Agromet Advisory Services (AAS). Till date 200 DAMUs have been established which includes 115 aspirational districts also.•	Major upgradation of Meteorological facilities at all airports through commissioning of State-of-art Integrated Aviation Weather Observing Systems (AWOS), HAWOS, Microwave Radiometers, Doppler LIDARs, Wind Profilers etc to support Aeronautical MET Services.•	Establishment of a state-of the-art Climate Data Centre with integrated advanced Climate Data Services portal for rendering national and regional climate services. •	To upgrade the training infrastructure and facilities to enhance the capacity of the training establishment.Commissioning of Polarimetric Doppler Weather Radars (PDWR)The scheme “Commissioning of Polarimetric Doppler Weather Radars (DWRs)” is aimed at augmenting the DWR network over the country to facilitate plugging the existing gaps in the meteorological observational network of radars for most parts of the country, through installation of eleven C-Band dual polarized DWRs.(d)	All 4 sub-schemes of IMD namely, AON, UFS, WCS and PDWR along with other sub-schemes under ACROSS were evaluated by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) taking the domain experts from various national Institutes/ Departments.The committee appreciated the work being done under the ACROSS scheme in terms of expansion of observation network, running high resolution models in all temporal and spatial scales, carrying out campaign studies for understanding the physical processes responsible for severe weather, generating weather and climate products for various applications, and developing effective communication strategies for timely delivery of services.The IRC recommended continuation of all sub-schemes under ACROSS from the 14th Finance commission (2017-20) to the 15th Finance Commission, which has been approved recently.(e)	Details of allocation under ACROSS-IMD during FY 2016-17 to 2020-21 are mentioned at part (b).
