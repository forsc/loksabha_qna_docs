                                                           MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY AND    CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION                                         (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1447 BY SHRIMATI POONAM MAHAJAN AND MS. RAMYA HARIDAS TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 10.02.2021 REGARDING INCREASE IN FARE OF LOWER BERTH(a) & (b): No, Sir.(c) & (d): Operation of special trains on special charges is done by Indian Railways (IR) to cater to the unmet passenger demand during various periods in the year including the festive/ holiday period due to non-uniform passenger demand. Since additional efforts are required to operate such services such as arrangement of additional coaches, additional manpower for operations as well as maintenance, additional train path to accommodate the special service and in some cases unidirectional demand also, special fare is charged for such services which are already published since 2015.Steps taken by the Government to increase facilities in the trains include manufacturing of only Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches, which are technologically superior and have better riding, aesthetics and safety features than conventional Integral Coach Factory (ICF) type coaches. Production Units of IR have stopped the manufacturing of ICF type coaches and are manufacturing only LHB type coaches from the year 2018-19 onwards. As part of Project Utkrisht launched in April 2018 in order to improve the condition of ICF type coaches running in Mail/ Express trains, upgradation of 447 rakes of Mail/ Express trains has been completed till December 2020.New Train-set Vande Bharat and premium train services like Humsafar, Tejas, Antyodaya, Utkrisht Double air-conditioned Yatri (UDAY), Mahamana and coaches like Deen Dayalu and Anubhuti, with upgraded interiors/exteriors and improved passenger amenities have been introduced in service in various trains for better comfort and travel experience. With a view to make Railway journey more memorable “Vistadome coaches” are also being introduced. These coaches are equipped with roof top glasses and seats which can rotate upto 180 degrees.Conventional lighting in coaches has been replaced with modern and energy efficient Light Emitting Diode (LED) lights. Provision of increased number of mobile charging points has been made in coaches. 63 smart coaches with ultra-modern features like Smart Public address and passenger information system, Smart HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning system), smart security and surveillance system etc. have been manufactured and introduced in service.Conversion of End-on-Generation (EOG) trains into Head on Generation (HOG) trains has been done to reduce noise and air pollution at stations and in trains. It will also significantly reduce the consumption of fossil fuels.Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) Cameras have been provided in more than 2,900 coaches over IR. *****
