ANSWER




                                                        (a)        Under Skill India Mission, Ministry is implementing its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) to impart skill development training to youth of the country, including the State of Madhya Pradesh. Under PMKVY, in the last three years (i.e. 2018-21), 4,50,376 candidates have been enrolled for training/orientation in the State of Madhya Pradesh, of which 2,67,867 are male and 1,82,502 are female. (b)        PMKVY has two training components, namely, Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). Under PMKVY, placement opportunities are being provided to STT certified candidates, while RPL does not mandate placements as it recognizes the existing skills of candidate. Under PMKVY-STT, in the last three years (i.e. 2018-21), 1,43,140 candidates (Male: 74,250; Female: 68,888) have been placed in the State of Madhya Pradesh. (c)        Under Central component of PMKVY, there is no State-wise allocation; however, Rs. 288.52 crore was disbursed to training centres in the State of Madhya Pradesh in the last three years (i.e. 2018-21) for the implementation of the scheme.             Under State component of PMKVY, funds and corresponding physical targets have been allocated State-wise. For the State of Madhya Pradesh, Rs. 104.32 crore is allocated till date. Out of which, Rs. 9.42 crore was released during last three years (2018-21). Out of total released funds (Rs. 30.89 crore) till date, Rs. 23.95 crore was spent in last three years (i.e. 2018-21) in the State for implementation of the scheme. (d)        Under PMKVY, training has been imparted in 52 districts of State of Madhya Pradesh through 2,345 training centres, including 22 centres in the district of Bhind.Under PMKVY, training is being imparted in various National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) aligned job roles of level 3 to 5 including technical courses across 37 sectors. In the State of Madhya Pradesh, training has been imparted to around 321 job roles including technical courses such as Automotive Service Technician, Machining and Quality Technician, Assistant Electrician, Tack Welder, CCTV Installation Technician, Field Technician - Air Conditioner, LED Light Repair Technician, Mobile Phone Hardware Repair Technician, Solar Panel Installation Technician, TV Repair Technician, Baking Technician/Operative, Solar PV Installer (Suryamitra), Wastewater Treatment Plant Technician, Industrial Automation Specialist, Jr. Instrumentation technician (Process Control), Junior Software Developer, Graphic Designer, Sound Engineer, Junior Engineer (JE)-Power Distribution, Technician-Distribution Transformer Repair, Broadband Technician, Field Technician  Computing and Peripherals, Handset Repair Engineer, Optical Fiber Technician. Further, under the Scheme, focus has also been given for skilling on digital technology and Industry 4.0 skills. The Sector Skill Councils have also created job roles on new and emerging digital technologies and industry 4.0 skills like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT). (e)        The above reply (d) may be referred to. (f)        Under the STT-PMKVY, placement is linked with payout to training providers. The last tranche, i.e., 30 percent of total payout is disbursed to training providers only on ensuring placement of the candidates. Also, Rozgar Melas are organised with the support of Sector Skill Councils, training providers and implementing agencies to directly link the candidates with the potential employers. Further, based on the learning from implementation of PMKVY 1.0 (2015-16) and 2.0 (2016-20), the orientation of the scheme has been changed from being supply driven to demand driven under PMKVY 3.0. The demand driven and bottom-up approach has been provisioned to boost demand for job roles which are prevailing at regional/local level. In addition, informed choices / aspirations of the candidates have been given primacy which aims to support the self-employment as well. This scheme also supports the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat by encouraging candidates to opt for local skills with local jobs. Ministry has launched Aatmanirbhar Skilled Employees Employer Mapping (ASEEM) portal, which acts as a central directory of skilled workforce registered and certified under Skill India Portal (SIP), across all schemes at central and state level.
