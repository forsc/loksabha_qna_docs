ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (d): For operationalization of small airports, representations have been received from the States from time to time. Govt. of India has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)-UDAN(Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) for providing air connectivity to  unserved and underserved airports at affordable airfare to masses. Ramnad, Salem , Arakkonam, Chettinad, Cholavaram, Neyveli, Sulur, Ulundurpet, Vellore Airports of Tamil Nadu are included in the scheme documents. The implementing agency, Airports Authority of India (AAI) has awarded 39 UDAN routes in Tamil Nadu till completion of Phase I of 4.0 round of bidding. Out of these, 12 routes have been operationalized by the Selected Airline Operators. The implementing agency, AAI, subsequently cancelled 19 RCS routes due to non-compliance by Selected Airline Operator  (SAO). Delay in operationalization of remaining awarded routes under RCS-UDAN is primarily attributed to non-readiness of civil airports, which involves availability of land, creation of infrastructure etc. Details of the routes awarded in Tamil Nadu till 4th round of UDAN bidding and details of the routes operationalized are attached at Annexure-I and Annexure-II respectively.
