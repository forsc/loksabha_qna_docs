ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	Yes, Sir.  Department of Agricultural Education & Research (DARE)/ Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has established a Central Agriculture University, a number of Research Institutes, Regional Research Centres and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) in the North-Eastern States. Detailed list is enclosed as Annexure-I.(b)	In the last 5 year ICAR has developed 438 varieties of crops including Cereals, Oilseeds, Pulses, Fibres, Forages and Sugarcane besides potato (1), elephant foot yam (1), guava (4), papaya (1), pineapple (1) arecanut (1) and orchids (5). The varieties so developed are suitable for different land use conditions of the North Eastern region. The detail is given in Annexure-II.(c)	The KVKs under Agriculture Technology Application Research Institute (ATARIs) based in the region are mandated for technology assessment and demonstration for its application and capacity development for proper dissemination of agricultural technologies among farmers including small and marginal ones working in North eastern state. The details regarding the number of farmers benefitted from the technologies and the training and capacity building programmes run by ICAR are given in Annexure-III.(d)	The ICAR research Institutes have carved out a clear-cut road map for research & development for the next 5 years, as well as vision documents (vision 2030). The implementation of the action plans besides being monitored by the Concerned Subject Matter Divisions at the ICAR Headquarters is also reviewed and refined by the Quinquinneal Review Teams, set up by the Council for this purpose.   The major focus is accorded to the development of horticulture, livestock, poultry, fish and crop based intensive farming systems, horticulture based organic production system besides sustainable crop and animal production together with skill development programmes and other related activities. Besides, ICAR has also developed state specific, technology driven strategy documents to enable doubling farmers’ incomes by 2022 in respect of all the states of the region.(e)	In pineapple growing areas including north eastern states, pineapple fruits are mostly harvested at fully ripe stage which is technically not advisable. The research conducted by ICAR Research Institutes have revealed that, depending on the travel distance between the orchards and the market, the fruits should be harvested at CS-2 (20-25% colour development stage) which enhances shelf life by 8-10 days (at room temperature 22-25°C) or CS-3 stage (40-50% colour development) which enhances shelf life by 5-6 days. This way the post harvest losses could be minimised.Shelf life of pineapple can also be enhanced by processing and value addition. The following technologies have been developed by the ICAR.1.	Zero waste technology for Osmo Dehydrated pineapple products (OUAT, Bhuvaneswar centre)2.	Osmotic Dehydrated Pineapple Candy (ICAR-CIPHET, Ludhiana)3.	Process protocol for extraction of bromelain from pineapple waste for muscle food tenderization (CAU, Imphal centre)For pre-processing and easier handling of Pineapple fruits, ICAR has developed, peeler cum corer cum slicer (CAU, Imphal centre) & Pineapple cutter for dividing one pineapple fruit into 04 (four) quarters (CAU, Imphal centre).*******
