ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) No such proposal is under consideration at present. Proposals for opening ofnew Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) are considered only if sponsored by Ministries orDepartments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union TerritoriesAdministrations thereby committing resources for setting up a new KV as well as theavailability of necessary sanction of the Government. The proposals received fromvarious sponsoring authorities for opening of new KVs also have to compete amongother proposals under the “Challenge Method”.(b) & (c) 50 new KVs were sanctioned in the country in March, 2019 including oneKV at 45th BN SSB, Beerpur, Distt. Supaul, Bihar.
