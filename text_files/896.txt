(a) to (d): Capital procurement of defence equipment is undertaken from various domestic as well as foreign vendors, based on operational requirements of the Armed Forces, the availability or capacity to produce the equipment  in India and abroad, to keep the Armed Forces in a state of readiness to meet the entire spectrum of security challenges.	During the last four financial years (2015-16 to 2018-19), 135 contracts have been signed with Indian vendors and 75 contracts have been signed with foreign vendors for capital procurement of defence equipment for Armed Forces.  The defence equipment contracted with foreign vendors during this period include aircrafts, helicopters, missiles, rockets, artillery guns, assault rifles, navy vessels, simulators and ammunitions. ...2/-: 2 :Government is pursuing initiatives to achieve higher levels of indigenisation and self-reliance in the defence sector by harnessing the capabilities of the public and private sector industries in the country.  These measures include according priority and preference to procurement from Indian vendors and liberalization of the licensing regime.  Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) accords the highest priority to Buy Indian (Indigenously) Designed Developed and Manufactured (IDDM). The ‘Make’ procedure has been simplified with provisions for earmarking projects not exceeding development cost of Rs.10 crores (government funded) and Rs.3 crores (Industry funded) for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs); and  with provisions for involving private industry as production agencies  and technology transfer partners.  Government has also promulgated the policy on Strategic Partnership in the Defence Sector to encourage broader participation of the private sector in manufacture of major defence platforms and equipment.******
