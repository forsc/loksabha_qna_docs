The Finance Act, 2019 		provides that individual taxpayers having income upto Rs. 5 Lakh are not required to 		pay any income tax from Assessment Year 2020-21 onwards.   Contd…2/--2- (c)&(d)	The Government has taken several steps for timely detection of tax evasion.  Such 		action under direct tax laws includes searches and seizures, surveys, enquiries, 		assessment of income, levy of taxes, penalties, etc. and filing of prosecution 		complaints in criminal courts, wherever applicable. The Government has initiated 		various measures to prevent tax evasion which includes: (i)		Enactment of ‘The Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and 		Imposition of Tax Act, 2015 which has come into force w.e.f. 01.07.2015 to 		specifically and more effectively deal with the issue of black money stashed away 		abroad. (ii)		With the increase in electronic form of information being available, the Income Tax 		Department has developed a wide range of non–intrusive methods for detecting tax 		evasion. They include important measures like Computer Assisted Scrutiny Selection 		(CASS) for selection of cases for Scrutiny; Non-filers Monitoring System (NMS) to 		prioritize action on non-filers; Income Tax Business Application (ITBA) to help in 		curbing tax evasion through putting in place end to end processes for all verticals of 		the Department etc.(iii)	The Income Tax Department collects information on Specified Financial Transactions 		(SFT), above notified thresholds, relating to cash deposits, credit card payments, 		purchase and sale of properties, purchase of shares and mutual funds etc. Such 		information is collected, collated and analyzed for computer aided scrutiny and risk 		profiling of taxpayers, identification of non-filers and stop filers etc.(iv)	The Government has brought in a large number of legislative provisions in the Income 		Tax Act, 1961(the Act) to effectively tackle tax evasion. They include mandatory 		quoting of PAN for various cash transactions, restrictions on cash transaction of Rs. 2 		lakh or more, levy of TDS @ 2% on the amount of cash withdrawal by a person 		exceeding Rs. 1 crore in aggregate from one or more accounts maintained by the 		recipient with a banking company or a co-operative society engaged in the business 		of banking or post office during a financial year, prohibiting taxpayers from 		taking/accepting loans or deposits or a sum of more than Rs.20,000/- in cash or 		repayment of loans or deposits of a sum of more than Rs. 20,000/- in cash. No 		deductions under section 80G of the Act is allowed if cash donations exceed Rs. 		2000/-.Contd…3/--3-(v)	 	To bring transparency in the source of funding to political parties, suitable 		amendments have been made with effect from 01.04.2018 to provide that no donations 		of Rs.2000/- or more shall be received otherwise than by an account payee cheque 		drawn on a bank or an account payee bank draft or use of electronic clearing system 		through a bank account or through electoral bonds. (vi)	Introduction of measures to incentivize digital transactions by allowing for 		transactions through other prescribed electronic modes apart from account payee 		cheque or account payee bank draft such as payment by credit cards, debit cards, net 		banking, UPI, RTGS, NEFT, IMPS and BHIM Aadhaar pay. (vii)	Proactively engaging with foreign governments with a view to facilitate and enhance 		the exchange of information under Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements 		(DTAAs)/Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs)/Multilateral Conventions.(viii)	 Effective enforcement actions including expeditious investigation in foreign assets 		cases. Such actions include searches, surveys, enquiries, assessment of income, levy 		of taxes, penalties, etc. and filing of prosecution complaints in criminal courts, 		wherever applicable.(ix)	Mandatory linking of Aadhaar with PAN, to aid in de-duplication of PAN but also 		prevent potential tax frauds and money-laundering.*******
