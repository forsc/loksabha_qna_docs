It picked up slightly to post a fall of 79.5 percent in Q2 and that of 64.3 percent in Q3.•	A significant number of direct jobs were lost in the tourism sector once the lockdown was implemented.  14.5 million direct jobs during Q1, 5.2 million during Q2 and 1.8 million direct jobs during Q3 are expected to have lost as compared to estimated 34.8 million direct jobs in tourism sector in the pre-pandemic period of 2019-20.*******
