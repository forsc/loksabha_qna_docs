States/UTs have undertaken demand survey under the scheme for assessing actual demand of housing.  The validated demand reported by States/UTs so far is around 112 lakhs.  Based on the project proposals received so far from the States/UTs, a total 96,50,191 houses have been sanctioned in 4510 cities under the Scheme; out of this, 56,36,806 are at various stages of construction and 28,60,468 are completed/delivered.  State/UT-wise details of cities covered and houses sanctioned under the scheme are at annexure.(d) & (e):	 PMAY(U) guidelines provide that the houses should be designed and constructed to meet the requirement of the structural safety against earthquake, flood, cyclone, landslides etc. conforming to the National Building Code and other relevantCodes of Bureau of Indian Standards. States/UTs have also been requested to adopt modern, innovative and green technologies and building material for faster and quality construction of houses.Further, in order to ensure quality of houses sanctioned under the scheme, apart from regular quality checks by Urban Local Bodies (ULBs)/Implementing Agencies (IAs), Third Party Quality Monitoring of all the ongoing projects is also mandatory.Central Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee may also check the quality of the houses being constructed on random basis or houses of specific project through technical institutions. On the basis of quality assurance reports by such agencies and reports of their own technical staff, States and ULBs/IAs take both preventive and curative measures to ensure that standard quality houses and infrastructure are constructed under the scheme.                            *****
