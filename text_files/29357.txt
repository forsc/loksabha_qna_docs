                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR.

The NHM envisages achievement of universal access to equitable, affordable & quality health care services that are accountable and responsive to people’s needs.	NHM is successfully achieving the following objective to provide universal access to good quality healthcare services to the people including rural and urban areas:A.

Malaria cases and deaths declined from 21.27% and 20% respectively in 2019 from 2018.  9)	By the end of December 2019, 94% Kala-azar endemic blocks have achieved the elimination target of <1 KA case per 10,000 population at block level. 10)	The National target for sustaining Dengue related case fatality rate to less than 1% was met. Dengue related case fatality rate in 2014 was 0.3% and reduced to 0.1% in 2019.  11)	The prevalence of blindness (visual acuity <3/60) has reduced to 0.36% in 2019) from 0.68% in 2010.  12)	There is a 17.3% relative reduction in prevalence of tobacco use from 34.6% to 28.6% from 2009-10 to 2016-17. B.	Increased Access to Health Services: 1.	As a result of the health systems strengthening efforts of NHM, the proportion of those seeking care from public health facilities, increased from 28.3% to 32.5% in rural areas and 21.2% to 26.2% in urban areas between 2014 to 2017.; and utilization of public health facilities for institutional deliveries increased from 56% to 69.2% in rural areas and from 42% to 48.3% in urban areas.   2.	Growth in Public Health Facilities: NHM adopts a health system approach and targets to build a network for public health facilities with Health & Wellness Centres at the grassroot level and District Hospitals, with robust referral linkage, to offer Comprehensive primary and secondary care services to citizens. The growth in the number of facilities at various levels since 2005 is given in Table 1 -  S. No.	Type of facility	Status 2005	Status 2020Facilities as per classification in 2005		1.

Equitable development: There was also a sustained focus on the health of tribal populations, those in Left Wing Extremism areas, and the urban poor. A more recent effort at ensuring equity in access and use, is the Aspirational district initiative, in which 115 districts across 28 states, with weak social and human development indicators have been identified for allocation of additional resources and capacity enhancement to catch up with more progressive districts. 4.	National Ambulance Services: Under National Health Mission (NHM), Govt. of India (GOI) provides technical and financial support for emergency medical services in States/UTs through a functional National Ambulance Service (NAS) network linked with centralized toll-free number 108/102.5.	Human Resource Augmentation: Health care service delivery requires sufficient skilled human resources. There has been an enormous shortage of human resources in the public health care sector in the country. NHM has attempted to fill the gaps in human resources by providing additional health human resources to the States. NHM also supports co-location of AYUSH services in health facilities such as PHCs, CHCs and DHs. 6.	Health Sector Reforms: The NHM enabled the design and implementation of reforms specifically related to Governance, Procurement and Technology.7.	Addressing high Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (OOPE): Recognising the need for reducing the current high levels OOPE, and that, almost 70% of the OOPE is on account of drugs and diagnostics, the Free Drugs and Free Diagnostics Services Initiatives have been implemented under the NHM.
