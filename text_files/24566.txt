ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ??????? ?????? (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (b):	Government announces Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for  green gram, millet (jowar, Bajra & Ragi), groundnut and  various other oilseeds. However, the MSP of kidney bean is not announced by the Government.  Besides MSP announcement, Government also undertakes procurement operations of notified crops having Fair Average Quality (FAQ) through various designated procuring agencies directly from farmers. 		Moreover, based on the proposal of the concerned State/UT Govt. under respective Schemes, the Government ensures procurement of crops conforming to the specifications prescribed by Government are purchased at Minimum Support Price (MSP) directly from farmers through various designated procuring agencies during the harvesting period. The State wise procurement of green gram, millets (jowar, Bajra & Ragi) and oilseeds including ground nuts since 2016 is attached at Annexure I. The pulses, oilseeds and copra of Fair Average Quality (FAQ) are procured from registered farmers under Price Support Scheme under Umbrella Scheme of Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA), as per its prescribed guidelines at MSP in consultation with the concerned State Government. Under PM-AASHA, States / UTs are also offered to choose either Price Support Scheme (PSS) or Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) in a given procurement season with respect to particular oilseeds crop for the entire State. Further, States have the option to roll out Private Procurement and Stockist Scheme (PPSS) on pilot basis in district / selected APMC(s) of district involving the participation of private stockist for oilseeds.  	The millets are procured by State Governments itself in consultation with FCI to the extent that the concerned State Government may utilise the same for distribution under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) as well as Other Welfare Schemes (OWS). (c) to (d) :   Since Central Nodal Agencies undertake MSP operation on behalf of Government of India directly from farmers through state designated procuring agencies, the  redressal of the problems of farmers is dealt by the concerned State Government agencies as per existing norms of the Schemes.
