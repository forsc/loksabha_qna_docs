ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) Water resources development & management are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priorities.  In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes, such as, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana with subcomponents as Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme, Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP)-Command Area Development & Water Management, HKKP - Surface Minor Irrigation / Repair, Renovation and Restoration(RRR), HKKP-Ground Water Irrigation, Per Drop More Crop & Watershed Development, Flood Management and Boarder Areas Programme, Special Package for Irrigation Projects in Maharashtra, National River Conservation Plan(NRCP)-other than Ganga Basin, Atal Bhujal Yojana etc.Government of India in partnership with States, is implementing centrally sponsored programme Jal Jeevan Mission-Har Ghar Jal, which aims at providing potable water through tap water connection to every household across the country, by 2024. The total estimated outlay of the Mission is Rs.3.60 lakh crore out of which Rs.2.08 lakh crore is a central share.Contd…P/2//2//(b) to (d) The Godavari-Cauvery link comprises of three links namely Godavari (Inchampalli/Janampet)-Krishna (Nagarjunasagar), Krishna (Nagarjunasagar)- Pennar (Somasila) & Pennar (Somasila)-Cauvery (Grand Anicut) link projects. The link project as per draft Detailed Project Report (DPR) envisages an annual irrigation of 9.38 lakh ha in States of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. About 1.54 lakh ha of new areas lying in Tiruvallur, Vellore, Kancheepuram, Tiruvannamalai and Villupuram districts of Tamil Nadu will be provided with assured irrigation under the link project. About 1.43 lakh ha of existing ayacut under Cauvery delta would also be stabilised.  Out of 905 MCM of water provided for Domestic & Industrial uses, 459 MCM benefits Tamil Nadu State. Besides this, about 5553 MW of Solar power can be generated by canal top solar panels. The DPR of this project is presently under finalisation based on feasible comments/views of party States. National Water Development Agency(NWDA) completed the pre-feasibility, feasibility and detailed project reports of  the Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar  link project of National Perspective Plan (NPP) and circulated to the party States. As per DPR, the  link project will  provide  irrigation  to  an  area   of  4.48 lakh ha in the districts of Karur, Tiruchirapalli, Pudukkottai, Sivaganga, Ramanathapuram, Virudhunagar and Thoothukudi of Tamil Nadu State.  Apart from irrigation, it is also proposed to provide domestic water supply to 28 lakh population  and industrial water requirements in the command area through the project.   The  Cauvery (Kattalai) - Vaigai -Gundar link is an integral part of the Mahanadi-Godavari- Krishna-Pennar-Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar scheme of peninsular river links system formulated for inter basin transfer of water from surplus basins to deficit basins under NPP.   As the quantum of diversion from preceding links originating from Mahanadi and further supplementation from Himalayan component of NPP has reduced as per latest studies, the quantum of water proposed for diversion through this link project are being further  firmed up accordingly. A draft Cabinet Note for funding of all the Inter-linking of Rivers (ILR) projects has been circulated among various Ministries/Departments. All the ILR projects will enhance the water availability for irrigation, domestic and industrial needs of the command areas/nearby towns/cities which will benefit the common people as well as agriculturists to a greater extent. Government of Tamil Nadu has submitted a proposal in December, 2020 for “Nadanthai Vazhi-Cauvery” Project with an amount of Rs.713.39 crore under National River Conservation Plan for pollution abatement and conservation of river Cauvery and requested for consideration the same accordingly. National River Conservation Directorate (NRCD) has gone through the report and forwarded the project for Third Party Appraisal by Environment Protection Training and Research Institute (EPTRI), Hyderabad in December, 2020.*****
