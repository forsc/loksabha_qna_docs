                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (SH. PANKAJ CHAUDHARY)(a), (b), (c) and (d): Yes Sir, on 1stJuly,2021 majority of the members of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (Inclusive Framework) (130 out of 139 member jurisdictions including India) adopted a high-level statement which includes continuing work for an agreement on a global minimum tax with a rate of at least 15% on a country-by-country basis. The minimum corporate tax is intended to ensure that large and profitable multinational enterprises pay a certain minimum level of tax on their income.  It is targeted primarily at low or no tax jurisdictions and seeks to curb unhealthy tax competition, profit shifting and treaty abuse.The IF member jurisdictions have agreed to carry out further work so as to reach an agreement on a minimum corporate tax regime. India is actively participating in this work.
