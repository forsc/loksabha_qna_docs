ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b) 	As per the information available with the Ministry, the number of Indian prisoners in foreign jails as of 31.05.2019 is 8189 which also includes under-trials. Country-wise list is given at Annexure. However, due to strong privacy laws prevailing in many countries, the local authorities do not share information on prisoners unless the person concerned consents to the disclosure of such information. Even countries which share information do not generally provide detailed information about the people of foreign countries imprisoned. Indian Missions/Posts abroad remain vigilant and closely monitor the incidents of Indian nationals being put in jail in foreign countries for violation of local laws or alleged violation of local laws. Apart from extending them all possible consular assistance, Indian Missions and Posts also assist in providing legal aid wherever needed.  Missions and Posts also maintain a local panel of lawyers where Indian community is in sizeable numbers. The issue of repatriation of Indian nationals in foreign prisons is regularly pursued by Indian Missions and Posts abroad with the local authorities concerned.  The Government also follows up this issue during consular and other consultations with other countries, including in the context of bilateral agreements for Transfer of Sentenced Persons [TSP] wherever applicable.  Inter-Ministerial meetings on this issue are also convened, as necessary, between Ministries of External Affairs and Home Affairs.In addition, the Government, through its Missions/Posts abroad and during high level visits, also takes up and pursues grant of amnesty/commutation of sentences of Indian prisoners in foreign countries. Since 2016 till present, in the countries in Gulf region, a total of 3087 Indian nationals have received amnesty or commutation of their sentences.  (c)	The Indian Community Welfare Fund (ICWF) is set up in Indian Missions & Posts abroad for assisting overseas Indian nationals in distress situations on a means tested basis in deserving cases. The support extended under ICWF includes air passage to stranded overseas Indians. However, no specific data with regard to repatriation of Indian prisoners through ICWF is maintained in the Ministry.
