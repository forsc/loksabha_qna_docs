The month witnessed wide participation and enthusiasim from the States/UTs, field functionaries, general public, etc. For creating awareness, a number of activities i.e. Poshan workshops/seminars, Poshan walks, Panchayat meetings, Prabhat Pherries, youth group meetings, Haat bazaar activities, framer’s club meetings, local leaders’ meetings, harvest festival, nukkad natak, etc. were conducted as per details given in Annexure-I.
