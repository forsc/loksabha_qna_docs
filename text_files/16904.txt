The collaborating institutes includes IIT Madras, IIT Delhi, IIT Hyderabad, IIT Bombay, IIT Kanpur, IISc Bangalore, Society for Applied Microwave Electronics Engineering & Research (SAMEER) and Centre of Excellence in Wireless Technology (CEWiT).  The project envisages setting up of an end-to-end open 5G Test Bed in a distributed architecture model.  The project will enable Indian academia and industry to validate their products, prototypes and algorithms.  It will also provide facilities for experimenting and demonstrating 5 G applications/ use cases.  Recently, a private Telecom Company, M/s Reliance JioInfocomm Ltd. has also announced development of indigenous 5G technology products.  Introduction of 5G services depends on deployment of 5G equipment and device ecosystem and also economic and commercial considerations of the Telecom Service Providers.************
