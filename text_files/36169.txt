ANSWER




(a):Yes, Sir. The failure of the identity authentication through Biometric are attributed to various factors namely, improper capture of biometric due to worn-out finger print minutia, finger not placed properly on device, network failure related errors, etc.(b):To increase the success rate of identity authentication through biometric, UIDAI constantly provides training to authentication operators through its Regional Offices and encourages the use of identity authentication via Iris devices for residents of old age and whose finger print minutia are worn out. (c):As per the Notification bearing S.O. 3814(E) issued by the Ministry of Finance, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) on 17.09.2021, the specified date for intimation of Aadhaar under section 139AA (2) of the Income-tax Act, 1961(the Act) has been extended upto 31.03.2022.Also, as per The Election Laws (Amendment) Act, 2021 notified by Ministry of Law and Justice, Legislative Department on 30.12.2021, section 23(6) of the notification provides that-“(6) No application for inclusion of name in the electoral roll shall be denied and no entries in the electoral roll shall be deleted for inability of an individual to furnish or intimate Aadhaar number due to such sufficient cause as may be prescribed:Provided that such individual may be allowed to furnish such other alternate documents as may be prescribed.”*******
