                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) to (b): As per provisions in Section 7 of the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 loss of revenue to the States shall be calculated and released at the end of every two months’ period, for 5 years. However, in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic the GST collection as well GST compensation cess collection declined sharply in FY 2020-21, due to which GST compensation requirement to all States/UTs increased. Such increase in the GST compensation requirement of States/ UTs during FY 2020-21 could not be met from the GST Compensation Fund, as the amount available in the GST Compensation Fund was not adequate. Accordingly, the GST compensation of ? 12,402 crore for part period April-May, 2020 and for full period June’20–January’21 is pending to the State of Punjab along with all other States/ UTs. In addition, in order to meet the shortfall in GST compensation to be paid to States,  ? 1.1 lakh crore has been borrowed by Government of India in appropriate tranches using a special window. The amount so borrowed has been passed on to the States as loan on back-to-back basis to help the States to meet the resource gap due to non-release of compensation due to inadequate balance in the Compensation Fund. As per this decision, Central Government has released ?8,359 crore to the State of Punjab. All States have decided to take benefit of this assistance to tide over the temporary resource gap.  In addition, depending on the amount available in the Compensation Fund, Centre has also been releasing the regular GST compensation to States to make up for GST revenue shortfall. The States will be paid full GST Compensation as per GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 for the transition period by extending the levy of Compensation cess beyond 5 years to meet the GST revenue shortfall as well as servicing the loan borrowed through special window scheme.(c) to (d): Yes, Sir.  15th Finance Commission has recommended    ? 3,442 crore to Punjab for six specific- sectors. The details are as under: -S/No.	Components 	Amount recommended (? in crore)1.	Health Sector 	902.002.	PMGSY	230.003.	Statistics	43.004.	Judiciary	145.005.	Higher Education	156.006.
