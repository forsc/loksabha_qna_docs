                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SHRIMATI ANNPURNA DEVI)(a)The Ministry of Education was implementing a Scheme for Providing Education to Madrassas/Minorities (SPEMM) comprising Scheme for Providing Quality Education in Madrasas (SPQEM) and the scheme for Infrastructure Development of Minority Institutes (IDMI). SPEMM has now been transferred to the Ministry of Minority Affairs w.e.f. financial year 2021-22 i.e. from 01.04.2021. SPEMM was a voluntary and demand driven scheme. The objective of SPQEM was to provide financial assistance to encourage traditional institutions like Madarsas and Maktabs to introduce modern education through subjects such as Science, Mathematics, Social Studies, Hindi and English in their curriculum through support for a maximum of three teachers and teaching learning material. As per the then guidelines, financial assistance was provided through the State Governments to support engagement of a maximum of three teachers per Madrasa for full time Graduate teachers @ Rs.6000/-p.m. and Post Graduate/B.Ed. teachers @ Rs. 12000/-p.m on honorarium basis. The objectives of the IDMI is to facilitate education of minorities by augmenting and strengthening school infrastructure in minority institutions (elementary/secondary/senior secondary schools) in order to expand facilities for formal education to children of minority communities. (b) As per UDISE+ 2019-20 data, the district-wise number of Madarsas in Telangana is at Annexure-I. (c) & (d)The Ministry of Education released the funds to the respective State Governments after they prepared an annual consolidated proposal for the interventions under SPEMM. Eligible proposals, as per the scheme guidelines, were examined and placed before the Project Approval Board (PAB) for approval. The State Government then released the funds to the concerned Madarsas. No funds have been released to the State Government of Telangana under SPEMM during the last five years, as no such proposal was received by this Ministry.*****
