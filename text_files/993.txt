                                                    (a) whether some ports in the country are not fully utilized to their capacities due to infrastructure restraints;(b)  if so, the details thereof along with the other reasons therefor; and(c)  the remedial steps taken by the Government in this regard?






ANSWER




                                                        (a)&(b)  Ports handle around 90% of the EXIM trade by volume in the country. In order to meet the challenges of ever increasing EXIM trade, it is the endeavour of the Government to keep augmenting the capacities of the major ports. The present installed capacity and its utilization in the various major ports is annexed. The capacity as required for handling the existing cargo/traffic at ports is being fully utilized. The spare capacity available at the ports would enable the ports to handle growth in cargo/traffic in near future. Reason for spare capacity being available at some of the ports is not on account of infrastructure constrains but due to non generation of expected cargo in the wake of global recession. Environmental restraints and ban on Iron ore export have also lead to drastic reduction in Iron ore cargo traffic at Mormugao Port.(c)       Government is regularly monitoring the traffic and the trade at Major Ports. The Port Authorities also explore the possibility of generating new cargoes so that the gap between the traffic and capacity may be reduced.  Similarly, Major Ports also organise trade meets to attract traffic from their hinterland/region. To increase the volume of cargo handling in ports a number of steps have been taken to boost coastal shipping.
