ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (d): As per the provisions of the Right of Children to Free and CompulsoryEducation (RTE) Act, 2009 it is the duty of the respective State and Union TerritoryGovernment which is the appropriate Government under the RTE Act to provide freeand compulsory elementary education to every child of the age 6 to 14 years in aneighbourhood school. In pursuance of Section 6 of the RTE Act, the respective Stateand Union Territory (UT) Government have notified areas or limits of theirneighbourhood norms in their State RTE Rules, factoring in their State specificcondition, for opening of schools.The Central Government, through integrated centrally sponsored scheme ofSamagra Shiksha provides support to the States and UTs for implementing the variousprovisions of the RTE Act, including opening/ strengthening of schools as per gapsidentified from school mapping. Under erstwhile Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), till 2017-18 and Samagra Shiksha effective from 2018-19, sanction has been given for 3.64 lakhnew elementary schools out of which States and UTs have reported the opening of3.60lakh schools. Under erstwhile Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA), till 2017-18 and Samagra Shiksha effective from 2018-19, 13093 new secondary schools havebeen sanctioned, out of which States and UTs have reported opening of 12652 newschools, till 31.10.2021.Proposals for opening of new Kendriya Vidyalayas are considered only whenreceived in the prescribed proforma from the District Administration through the StateGovernment concerned. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities foropening of new Kendriya Vidyalayas also have to compete among other proposalsunder the “Challenge Method”.The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme provides for opening of one JawaharNavodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country for providing good qualityeducation to children predominantly from the rural areas. Opening of new JNVs is acontinuous process which depends on the availability of suitable land by the concernedState Government free of cost for construction of school buildings and the requiredtemporary accommodation (free of rent) to start the Vidyalaya. However, actual sanctionand opening of the JNV depends on the availability of funds and approval by theCompetent Authority.*****
