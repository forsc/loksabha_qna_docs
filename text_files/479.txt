                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (f):  	   A statement is laid on the Table of the House.--2--  STATEMENT IN REPLY TO THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *54 FOR 25.06.2019(a) & (b):   Yes Sir.  Cyclone Fani affected three States namely Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. As per the information received from the affected State Governments, details of reported losses/ damages are given as under:-  State	Human lives lost	Houses/ huts damaged	Cattlelost	Cropped area  affected(in ha.)	Fishermen’s Boats & nets damagedOdisha	64	5,56,761	6,281	1,48,663	6,416 boats & 8,828 netsAndhra Pradesh	Nil	222	28	1,365	NilWest Bengal	Nil	29,260	Nil 	1,12,000	NilIn addition, infrastructure like roads, power, railway, telecommunications etc. were also damaged in Odisha. (c)    Central Government extended full logistics support including deployment of 71 Teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) (50 Teams in Odisha, 12 Teams in Andhra Pradesh, 09 Teams in West Bengal) along with necessary rescue equipments for immediate rescue, evacuation   and   relief   measures  during cyclone  Fani.  Similarly, --3--L.S.S.Q.NO. 54 FOR  25.06.2019State Government of Odisha deployed 20 teams of Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF).  To prevent loss of human lives, a record number of 15,57,170 persons in Odisha, 17,460 persons in Andhra Pradesh and 2,34,801 persons in West Bengal were evacuated to safer places. (d)  	There are institutional mechanisms at the National and State level for effective management of natural disasters. Though the primary responsibility for disaster management rests with the State Governments, Central Government extends all possible logistics and financial supports to the States to supplement their efforts to meet the situation effectively. The concerned State Governments undertake assessment of damage and provide financial relief in the wake of natural disasters including cyclone, from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) already placed at their disposal. Additional financial assistance is extended from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) by following the laid down procedure, which includes an assessment based on the visit of an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT).   Financial assistance under SDRF/ NDRF in the wake of natural disasters is by way of relief and not for compensation of loss suffered/ claimed.  In order to support the affected people of the States, Central Government has released in  advance  an  assistance  of  Rs. 1086 crore --4--L.S.S.Q.NO. 54 FOR  25.06.2019(Rs. 340.875  crore  to Odisha,  Rs. 200.25 crore to  Andhra  Pradesh,  Rs. 235.50 crore to West Bengal and Rs. 309.375 crore to Tamil Nadu) from SDRF on 29th April 2019. In pursuance to the visit made by Hon’ble Prime Minister to Odisha after the cyclone ‘Fani’, Central Government released additional Rs. 1000 crore to Government of Odisha on 7th May 2019.  In the instant case, even before the receipt of memorandum from State Government of Odisha, IMCT visited the affected areas of the State from 12th to 15th May 2019 for rapid assessment of damages. Odisha State was severely affected by the cyclone and has submitted a memorandum seeking an assistance of Rs. 5227.68 crore.  IMCT visited the affected areas of the State from 20th to 22nd June 2019 again for an on-the-spot assessment of damages caused by the cyclone ‘Fani’. Upon receipt of report from the IMCT, further financial assistance under NDRF will be considered as per laid down procedure. (e):  	The National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC), headed by Cabinet  Secretary,  is  the  nodal  body  at  national  level to monitor and coordinate during major disasters. During Cyclone ‘FANI’, NCMC, under the chairmanship of Cabinet Secretary held 11 meetings on daily basis from 29th  April  to 10th May  and  monitored and coordinated the situation --5--L.S.S.Q.NO. 54 FOR  25.06.2019with the affected states and Central Ministries/Agencies concerned. Indian Metrological Department (IMD)  issued  regular accurate forecasts & warning bulletins to all the affected States.(f):	India with its continuous efforts has significantly improved its preparedness to deal with natural calamities. Our Disaster Management Act 2005 articulates the need for mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) into development planning. The National Policy and National Plan on Disaster Management seeks to build a safe and disaster resilient India. There are institutional mechanisms at the National, State & district level in the country to develop appropriate preparedness and prompt response mechanism for effective management of natural disasters. Central Government has established a robust early warning system and has significantly enhanced accuracy of weather forecasts. Forecasting agencies are continuing their efforts for the improvement of warning and dissemination systems vigorously. Mock exercises and community awareness programmes are being regularly conducted to educate people/ farmers at the time of natural calamities.--6--L.S.S.Q.NO. 54 FOR 25.06.2019The National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (NCRMP) is under implementation in 8 coastal states with a total outlay of Rs 4903 crore to mitigate the sufferings of the coastal community who are generally poor and vulnerable to various types of disasters. Cyclone shelters and early warning system created under this project proved to be of great help during cyclones ‘Phailin’ in 2013, ‘Hud-Hud’ in 2014, ‘Titli’ in 2018 and recent cyclone ‘Fani’. The measures taken by the Central and State Governments have significantly improved disaster management practices, preparedness, prevention and response mechanism resulting in significant reduction in casualties during natural calamities, including cyclones, in the country. Further, strengthening of the disaster management is a continuing and evolving process of the governance.  ******
