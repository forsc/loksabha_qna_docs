ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a): The salient features of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 are as follows:1.	Ensure Universal Access at All Levels of schooling from pre-primary school to Grade 122.	Early Childhood Care and Education:3.	Attaining Foundational Literacy and Numeracy4.	Introduction of  New Curricular and Pedagogical Structure5.	Reduction in curriculum content to enhance essential learning and critical thinking6.	Holistic development of learners7.	Multilingualism and the power of language8.	Transforming assessment for student development9.	Support for gifted students/students with special talents10.	Equitable and inclusive education11.	 Reforming Teacher Education recruitment and their continuous Professional Development12.	Efficient resourcing and effective governance through school complexes/clusters13.	Standard-setting and Accreditation for School Education14.	Vocational Education15.	Adult education and lifelong learning(b): NEP 2020 states that, to track progress throughout the school years, and not just at the end of Grades 10 and 12 - for the benefit of students, parents, teachers, principals, and the entire schooling system in planning improvements to schools and teaching-learning processes - all students will take school examinations in Grades 3, 5, and 8 which will be conducted by the appropriate authority. The Grade 3 examination, in particular, would test basic literacy, numeracy, and other foundational skills. The results of school examinations will be used only for developmental purposes of the school education system and for continuous monitoring and improvement of the schooling system. (c): NEP 2020 states that every student will take a fun course, during Grades 6-8, that gives a survey and hands-on experience of a sampling of important vocational crafts, such as carpentry, electric work, metal work, gardening, pottery making, etc., as decided by States and local communities and as mapped by local skilling needs. The policy also aims to overcome the social status hierarchy associated with vocational education and requires integration of vocational education programmes into mainstream education in all education institutions in a phased manner. Beginning with vocational exposure at early ages in middle and secondary school, quality vocational education will be integrated smoothly into higher education. It will ensure that every child learns at least one vocation and is exposed to several more. This would lead to emphasizing the dignity of labour and importance of various vocations involving /Indian arts and artisanship.(d): The NEP 2020 aims to redesign the Board exams to encourage holistic development and provide flexibility of subjects and test primarily core competencies rather that rote learning to make them stress-free.(e):   The policy has been formulated after a very detailed consultative process, unprecedented in depth and scale. Consultation involved over 2 lakh suggestions from 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats, 6600 Blocks, 6000 ULBs, 676 Districts. This Ministry had initiated a collaborative, inclusive, and  highly participatory consultation process from January 2015. Education Dialogue with MPs (AP, Kerala, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karnataka & Odisha) and Special Meeting of CABE was also organised on 21.09.2019. The Draft National Education Policy 2019 was uploaded on this Ministry’s website and at ‘MyGov Innovate’ portal eliciting views/suggestions/comments of stakeholders, including public. Valuable inputs were incorporated in the final document by the committee.*****
