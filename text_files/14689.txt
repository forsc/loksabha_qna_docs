Forest Survey of India, Dehradun, an organization under the Ministry carries out the assessment of forest and tree cover of the country biennially and the findings are published in India State of Forest Report (ISFR). The total forest and tree cover of the Gujarat, as per the ISFR 2019 is 21,769 km2 which is 11.09% of the total geographical area of the State.

To increase the forest and tree cover further in the country including State of Gujarat, Ministry has been taking several initiatives.

Compensatory Afforestation Fund Rules, 2018 also contain provisions for taking up assisted natural regeneration, artificial regeneration and Silvicultural operations in forests which contribute to increase in forest cover. Afforestation and tree planting activities, including non-forest areas, are also taken up under various programmes/funding sources of other ministries, such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana and under the schemes/plans of States and Union Territories (UTs).*****
