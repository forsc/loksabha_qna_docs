ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	There is no data available on reduction in size of dushari mango and other varieties owing to depletion of ground water. However, the size of fruit also depends on several agronomic practices. The water requirement of mango trees in most of the orchards is met through various irrigation sources like canal, tube well etc.(c):	In general, assistance is available for collection and conservation of water and creation of community tanks/on-farm ponds/on-farm water reservoirs under Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme (MGNREGP). The assistance is also available for efficient utilization of water for adopting drip irrigation under Pradhan Mantri Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY).(d):	There is no such information available. However, ICAR-CISH has developed and demonstrated IPM module for growing mango with limited number of pesticide sprays to help in reducing the pesticide-pollution.*******
