                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) to (c)  Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) was launched by Government of India on 25th December, 2000 for providing connectivity by way of an all weather road to the eligible unconnected habitations as per core-network with a population of 500 persons in plain areas. In respect of Special Category States (i.e. Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Uttarakhand), the Desert Areas (as identified in the Desert Development Programme), the Tribal (Schedule V) areas and Selected Tribal and Backward Districts (as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs and Planning Commission), the objective is to connect eligible unconnected habitations with a population of 250 persons and above (Census 2001). For most intensive Integrated Action Plan (IAP) blocks as identified by Ministry of Home Affairs the unconnected habitations with population 100 and above (as per 2001 Census) is eligible to be covered under PMGSY. As the programme unfolded, a need was felt for consolidation of the existing Rural Road Network to improve its efficiency not only as a provider of transportation services, but also as a vehicle of social and economic development. Accordingly, in the year 2013, PMGSY-II was launched for upgradation of selected Through Routes and Major Rural Links (MRLs) with a target to upgrade 50,000 Km in various States and Union Territories. Subsequently, in 2016, Road Connectivity Project for Left Wing Extremism Affected Areas (RCPLWEA) for construction/upgradation of strategically important roads was launched as a separate vertical under PMGSY. In the year 2019, Government launched PMGSY-III for consolidation of 1,25,000 Km Through Routes and Major Rural Links connecting habitations,  inter-alia, to Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs), Higher Secondary Schools and Hospitals. Since inception till date (18/03/2021), the details of works sanctioned and completed in all the states of the country under various verticals of PMGSY are as under-Verticals   No. of Road       Road Length     No. of Road     Road Length  No. of LSBs    No. of LSBs            works Sanctioned  sanctioned     works completed  completed     sanctioned     completed                               (in km)	                       (in km)	 	PMGSY-I	    1,64,735	     6,44,633	        1,56,971	6,02,788	7,379	    4,897PMGSY-II       6,711	       49,925	           4,708	41,790	          757	      434RCPLWE	         897	        9,286	             129	3,118	           73	       73PMGSY-III      6,206	       48,166	              39	7,019	          356	        4Total	    1,78,549	     7,52,010	        1,61,847	6,54,715	8,565	    5,408LSB = Long Span BridgeSince inception till date (18/03/2021), the details of works sanctioned and completed in the State of Uttar Pradesh under various verticals of PMGSY are as under- Verticals   No. of Road       Road Length     No. of Road     Road Length  No. of LSBs    No. of LSBs            works Sanctioned  sanctioned     works completed  completed     sanctioned     completed                                 (in km)	                (in km)	 	PMGSY-I	        17,576	          50,325	17,563	         49,347	         0	        0PMGSY-II	   963	           7,614	   962	          7,509	         2	        2RCPLWE	            25	             541	     6	            174	         11	        0PMGSY-III	   898	           6,287	     0	              0	          5	        0Total	        19,462	          64,767	18,531	         57,030	         18	        2Works under PMGSY-I & II are proposed for completion in March, 2022, while those under RCPLWEA are proposed for completion in March, 2023.
