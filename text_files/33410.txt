                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c): The Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, and Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, have specific provisions with respect to informal waste collectors or waste pickers and their role in solid waste management including plastic waste management. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has notified the draft Regulations on the Extended Producer Responsibility for plastic packaging under Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, as amended from time to time, in the Gazette of India vide GSR No. 722 (E) on 6th October, 2021for public consultation. As per the draft notification, the producers, importers &brand-owners are mandated to fulfil their extended producer responsibility obligations by providing certificates of plastic waste processing from recyclers and end of life disposal entities registered under Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016.The producers, importers and brand owners have also been obligated to register. The guidelines for extended producer responsibility will allow for development of the waste management sector and the formal/informal sector involved in waste management will get engaged. The enforceable obligation of minimum level of recycling of plastic packaging waste collected under extended producer responsibility on producers, importers &brand-owners in the draft notification will further strengthen circular economy of plastic packaging waste.****
