                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICUTLRURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ?? ????? ?????? ??????			                       (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	Yes, Sir. Investigations carried out under All India Coordinated Research Project on ‘Long Term Fertilizer Experiments’ over five decades at fixed sites have indicated that continuous use of nitrogenous fertilizer alone had  deleterious effect on soil health and crop productivity showing deficiencies of other major and micro nutrients. Even with recommended doses of NPK and more, deficiency of micro and secondary nutrients has become yield limiting factor over the years. Deficient nutrient may also affect plant growth and cause plant physiological disorders. There is also possibility of nitrate contamination in groundwater above the permissible limit of 10 mg NO3-N/L due to excessive/over-use of nitrogenous fertilizers, particularly in light textured soils that has consequence on human/animal health if used for drinking purpose.(c) 	ICAR recommends soil test based balanced and integrated nutrient management through conjunctive use of both inorganic and organic sources of plant nutrients to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers, preventing deterioration of soil health, environment and contamination of groundwater. Accordingly, the Government is implementing National Mission on Soil Health Card to provide soil test based fertilizer recommendations to farmers for promoting balanced and integrated nutrient management in the country.  (d) & (e):	Yes, Sir. The Government under National Mission on Soil Health Card is educating farmers on soil test based balanced and judicious use of fertilizers. The Government under Parampragat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North East Region (MOVCD-NER) is providing financial support to states to organize seminars, trainings, awareness camps on organic production, post harvest management, marketing etc. for the benefit of the farmers.  *************
