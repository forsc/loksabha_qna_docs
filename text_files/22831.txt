                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI) (a) to (d)	Initially, the work of project stretch from Km 402.000 to Km 440.000 including Dumaria Ghat Bridge on Gandak River was awarded in 2005 but contract was terminated in year 2016 due to non-completion of works. Thereafter, bids were invited for balance work of the said Bridge, but could not be awarded due to inadequate response from bidders. At present, Arbitration proceeding are in headway. Moreover, NHAI has appointed a new consultant to review the proposal of Balance work and preparation of Bid Documents. 	The project Highway from km 360.915 to km 402.00 (WB-09) was also awarded in 2005, but the same was terminated in 2013 due to slow progress. Thereafter, on Risk and Cost of the contractor, the contract was re-awarded for balance work in June 2015 and was completed in 2017 except the 4-lanning of the section in between Haziapur more and Banzari more falling in Gopalganj town area where the construction was stopped in demand of flyover by the public representatives. Earlier, there were no provision for construction of Flyover between Haziapur and Banzari in Gopalganj town under the scope of original project stretch. There was provision of two VUPs at both location i.e. Haziapur and Banzari. Based on representations received from public representatives and demand of locals for construction of flyover at said locations, the design has been changed and hence there is no default. Now, new DPR agency was selected for preparation of Detailed Project Report for elevated Corridor in Goplaganj town and bid invitation is targeted by 2021.The representations/suggestions received from State Government, from time to time, are duly considered.*****
