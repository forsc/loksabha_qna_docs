ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES (SHRI RAMESWAR TELI) (a) to (d): The Central Sector Scheme – PRADHAN MANTRI KISAN SAMPADA YOJANA - (PMKSY) was launched as a compressive package with the objectives of creation of modern infrastructure along with efficient supply chain management along the entire food processing value chain i.e. from farm gate to retail outlet. PMKSY provides a big boost to the growth of food processing sector in the country helping thereby the farmers in getting better prices for their produces due to higher demand for agricultural produce by the food processing industries as raw material. It is thus a big step towards doubling of farmers’ income in addition to creating huge employment opportunities especially in the rural areas, reducing wastage of agricultural produce and enhancing the export of the processed foods.   The PMKSY is expected to leverage investment of 31,400 crore, handle? 334 lakh MT agro-produce valuing 1,04,125 crore, benefit 20 lakh farmers and generate 5,30,500? direct/ indirect employment in the country by the year 2019-20. No Impact assessment of PMKSY has since been done.*****
