ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a)  & (b) :  Policy framework is already in place to promote generation of hydropower and electricity from bio-mass and bio-fuel. They are:(I)	For boosting the generation of Hydro Power, the Government of India on 8th March, 2019, approved a number of measures for promoting hydropower sector in the country which are as under:i.	Declaring Large Hydro Power (LHPs) (> 25 MW projects) as Renewable Energy source.ii.	Hydro Purchase Obligation (HPO) as a separate entity within Non-Solar Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO).iii.	Tariff rationalization measures for bringing down hydro power tariff.iv.	Budgetary Support for Flood Moderation/Storage Hydro Electric Projects (HEPs).v.	Budgetary Support to Cost of Enabling Infrastructure, i.e. roads/bridges.a)	 Rs. 1.5 crore per MW for projects upto 200 MW.b)	 Rs. 1.0 crore per MW for projects above 200 MW.(II)	For promotion of Biomass based generation, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy is implementing the following schemes:(a)               Biomass based cogeneration in sugar mills and other industries (up to March 2021). Under the scheme central financial assistance is provided to eligible projects producing power from all types of biomass like bagasse, rice husk, rice stubble etc. (b)               “Programme on Energy from Urban, Industrial, Agricultural Wastes/Residues and Municipal Solid Wastes'''' (upto March, 2021) for promotion of setting up of projects of Biogas/Bio-CNG/Power/Producer gas from Urban, agricultural and Industrial Wastes and Power generation project from Municipal Solid Waste. Under the scheme financial assistance is provided for setting up Waste to Energy plants(c) Biogas based Power Generation (Off-Grid) & Thermal energy application Programme (BPGTP) under decentralized Off-Grid Renewable Power Programme with the objective of providing clean energy solutions through biogas production to reduce consumption of diesel and kerosene by installation of medium size biogas plants of size ranging from 30 M3 to 2500 M3 per day with power generation installed capacity range of 3 KW to 250 KW.The schemes have recently been evaluated. Based on the recommendations of the evaluation, proposal for continuation of the above schemes beyond March 2021 has been initiated in the Ministry.In addition to this, Ministry of Power, Government of India has also brought out the policy for biomass utilization for power generation through co-firing in pulverized coal fired boilers. As per the policy, all fluidized bed and pulverized coal units (coal based thermal power plants) except those having ball and tube mill, of power generating utilities, public or private, located in India shall endeavour to use 5-10% blend of biomass pellets, made primarily, of agro residue along with coal after assessing the technical feasibility, viz. safety aspects, etc.(c) : 		Sufficient transmission capacity has been planned in the country for evacuation of power from generating stations to the load centres. Planning of transmission system (transmission lines and associated substations) for the period 2017-22, to meet the projected peak electricity demand of 225.7 GW (as per 19th Electric Power Survey Report) during 2021-22 has already been done.Transmission systems under operation are monitored by State/Regional/ National Load Dispatch Centers and the bottlenecks arising if any, are addressed as part of coordinated transmission planning process on a case to case basis.(d) : 		Electricity is a concurrent subject.  Most Distribution Companies are owned by the respective State Government.  It is the responsibility of distribution licensees to plan their distribution system so as to provide 24x7 reliable power to all the consumers and to achieve capacity utilization of their power Distribution Grids. Planning of transmission system is carried out for different load generation scenarios keeping in view the reliability aspects and the future load growth, while ensuring the optimum utilization of existing transmission assets.Further, Government of India through its various ongoing schemes in the rural and urban areas of Distribution Sector like Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (SAUBHAGYA) and Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) has facilitated strengthening and augmentation of sub-transmission & distribution infrastructure, including IT enablement of Urban distribution sector, construction of HT and LT lines, metering at distribution transformers, feeders and consumers and feeder segregation, etc. These schemes, at present, are at advanced stage of completion and are targeted for completion by 2022.************
