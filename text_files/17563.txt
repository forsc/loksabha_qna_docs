MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) : The National Policy on Education (NEP), 2020 states that “Knowledge of India” will include knowledge from ancient India and its contributions to modern India and its successes and challenges, and a clear sense of India’s future aspirations with regard to education, health, environment, etc. These elements will be incorporated in an accurate and scientific manner throughout the school curriculum wherever relevant; in particular, Indian Knowledge Systems, including tribal knowledge and indigenous and traditional ways of learning, will be covered and included in mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, yoga, architecture, medicine, agriculture, engineering, linguistics, literature, sports, games, as well as in governance, polity, conservation. (b) & (c) : Yoga is an integral part of Health and Physical Education.  Health and Physical Education is a compulsory subject from Class I to Class X and optional from Class XI to XII.   The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has already developed integrated syllabi on Health and Physical Education from Class I to Class X. The syllabus is available on NCERT website www.ncert.nic.in.      Under the Centrally Sponsored scheme of Samagra Shiksha, realizing the need for holistic development of children, Sports and Physical Education component has been introduced for the first time for encouragement of Sports, Physical activities, Yoga, Co-curricular activities, etc. Further, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has made Health and Physical Education compulsory in all classes from I-XII. It has been advised to schools that Health and Physical Education includes three areas i.e. Health Education, Physical Education and Yoga and all three areas are essential to achieve holistic health (physical, mental, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual).*****
