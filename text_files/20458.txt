ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) & (b) : 	Yes, Sir. 	The assessed Hydro-electric power potential from major/medium schemes (i.e. schemes having capacity above 25 MW) in North-Eastern region including Sikkim is 62604 MW.   No generation target in terms of Installed Capacity has been fixed by the Government of India, however, as on date 6.46% (4046 MW) of the existing potential in North East Region including Sikkim, has been harnessed. The State-wise details of potential and its status of development in North-Eastern region including Sikkim is enclosed at Annexure-I.  (c)	:		Government have taken several policy initiatives in the past to give a boost the hydropower development in the country viz., National Electricity Policy 2005, Hydro Power Policy 2008, Tariff Policy 2016, National Rehabilitation & Resettlement Policy (2007) and Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act 2013. Further, Government of India in March, 2019 has approved the following measures for promoting hydropower in the country and improving viability of the sector:i.	Declaring Large Hydro Power (LHPs) (> 25 MW projects) as Renewable Energy source.ii.	Hydro Purchase Obligation (HPO) as a separate entity within Non-Solar Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO).	iii.	Tariff rationalization measures for bringing down hydro power tariff in the initial years.iv.	Budgetary Support for Flood Moderation/Storage Hydro Electric Projects (HEPs).v.	Budgetary Support towards Cost of Enabling Infrastructure, i.e. roads/bridges.a)	Rs. 1.5 crore per MW for projects upto 200 MW.b)	Rs. 1.0 crore per MW for projects above 200 MW.These measures would be particularly beneficial for development of hydro projects in North Eastern Region which are located in remote and far-flung areas and require development of extensive associated infrastructure such as roads, bridges etc. for transportation of heavy, large sized equipment & machinery to the project site. The HPO trajectory, in this regard, has already been notified by the Government on 29.01.2021. (d) :  	Hydro Power Projects:-At present, 8 nos. of Hydro Electric Projects (HEPs) (above 25 MW) totaling to 3733 MW are under construction in the North Eastern Region (including Sikkim).  Out of these 8 nos. of HEPs, in 4 nos. of projects totaling 3196 MW works are ongoing and in 4 nos. of HEPs totaling 537 MW the works are held up due to various reasons.  The status of the aforementioned 8 projects is at Annexure-II.Thermal Power Projects:-The status of ongoing/proposed Thermal Power Projects in the North Eastern States is as per Annexure-III.**************
