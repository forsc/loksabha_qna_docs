                                                        THE MINISTER FOR MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND MINISTRY OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a)	and (b) 	No scheme has been formulated to setup electronic systems to measure the Intensity of an Earthquake. However, National Centre for Seismology (NCS) recently upgraded the Seismological Network with the state-of-the art systems for monitoring earthquake activity in and around the country. At present, the network has 115 observatories, spread over the country. All these observatories are equipped with the Accelerometer and Broadband seismometer sensors to record the ground acceleration and velocity due to earthquakes, which in turn can be used to calculate Intensity of the respective earthquake at the recording site. (c)	        The question does not arise.
