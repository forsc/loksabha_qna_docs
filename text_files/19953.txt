                                                        MINISTER OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(DR. THAAWAR CHAND GEHLOT)(a) to (f): A statement is laid on the Table of the House.Statement referred to in reply to part (a) to (f) of the Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 110 raised by Dr. Subhash RamraoBhambre and ShrimatiSupriyaSule regarding “Skill Training to Differently Abled” for answer on 09.02.2021.(a) The Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD) implements a "National Action Plan (NAP) for Skill Development of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)" which was launched in March, 2015. NAP is implemented under the umbrella scheme – “Scheme for Implementation of Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (SIPDA)” as per Common Norms guidelines of M/o Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE). It is a Central Sector Scheme implemented across the country under which training programme is conducted via a network of training partners (ETPs) empanelled from Government and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) as well as organizations of the Department such as National Handicapped Finance and Development Corporation (NHFDC), National Institutes (NIs) and Composite Regional Centres (CRCs).Release of funds in respect of Skill Training of PwDs under the scheme began from the year 2016-17 as the initial year was dedicated towards empanelment of Training Partners. A statement showing the number of PwDs, in respect of whom funds have been released during the last 03 years (2017-18 to 2019-20), State-wise including Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu are at Annexure ‘A’(b) The details of financial assistance provided by the Department to the ETPs for skill training of PwDs during the last three years (2017-18 to 2019-20) are as under:S No	Year	Funds released (in Rs. Crore)1.	2017-18	82.22.	2018-19	44.653.	2019-20	4.32(c) to (e) Yes Sir. It is a fact that COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected the skill training of persons with disabilities. Due to the outbreak of the pandemic, training commenced by some ETPs of the Department in March 2020 could not be completed, whereas some other ETPs which had planned to commence the training could not even start it.Training activities were not allowed till September 21, 2020. Thereafter, though training activities have been allowed, it is permitted in Non-containment zones only and that also as per Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) requiring maintenance of proper social and physical distancing. This has reduced the overall capacity of training centres by almost half of the normal capacity.The Department has taken various measures including online training to face the challenges arisen out of the pandemic which are as under:i. The ETPs are being allowed to conduct training in blended mode under which training is imparted online to the extent possible as per the course curricula and practical is conducted in offline/ physical mode. It is being considered on a case-to-case basis on receipt of proposals from ETPs and considering the feasibility of online training of the proposed courses.ii. The Department is also developing a dedicated Online Portal for providing online skill training to PwDs.iii. Management Information System (MIS) is also being developed which will enable the organization to submit the proposals for empanelment and training in online mode.iv. Skill Council of Persons with Disabilities (SCPwD) has also been advised to conduct online assessment of PwDs on completion of training.v. SCPwD has developed an exclusive online application for Centre inspection under NAP and also a Learning Management System (LMS) to facilitate the online trainings for the Trainers and Assessors (ToT and ToA). vi. Training partners whose validity of empanelment with the Department has expired are also being considered for extension of validity for one year with certain conditions.(f) No Sir. Training under NAP of the Department is conducted through ETPs and there is no plan to establish own skill development centres by the Department. Efforts are being made to strengthen the base of training partners by adding Sector Skill Councils and State Skill Development Missions as Programme Implementation Agencies (PIA).However, NHFDC, a Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE) of the Department has rolled out the concept of NHFDC Swavalamban Kendra (NSK) on pilot scale basis and aspires to convert it into a grandiose scheme, initially covering each district in the country at the rate of one NSK per district. NHFDC has already established 10 NSKs (04 in UP, 03 in MP, and 03 in Haryana). The NSKs are owned by PwD entrepreneurs through credit support from NHFDC and the handholding support to organize trainings is provided through NHFDC Foundation.The Department is also in the process to get the National Career Service Centres for Differently Abled (NCSC-DA) (erstwhile Vocational Rehabilitation Centres / VRCs) transferred from M/o Labour and Employment. Presently, there are 21 such VRCs functional and 03 more are proposed to be set up. The details of the VRCs are at Annexure ‘B’****
