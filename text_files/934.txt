A Sub Committee of the NCMS Committee has looked into the issue of developing a National Framework of Court Excellence to set measurable standards of performance for courts and a monitoring mechanism to measure these performance parameters.  The Sub-Committee has submitted its report to the NCMS.  There is no proposal at present to set up a Performance Appraisal Commission by the Government.****************
