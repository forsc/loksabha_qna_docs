                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (c): A statement is laid on the table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) TO (c) TO THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.269 FOR 06.12.2019 BY SHRI RAVI KUMAR D. REGARDING ‘MENOPAUSE POLICY’(a) to (c)The National Health Mission envisages achievement of universal access to equitable, affordable and quality health care services that are responsive to people’s needs. The strategy is based on provision of comprehensive care through the five pillars or thematic areas of reproductive, maternal, neonatal, child and adolescent health and is guided by central tenets of equity, universal care, entitlement, and accountability, and it has been developed to provide an understanding of ‘ continuum of care’ to ensure equal focus on various life stages.Menopause is a normal consequence of the ageing process and is a natural female hormone deficient state that occurs at the age of 45-55 years. In this stage, ovaries gradually become less active and reduce their production of sex hormone (estrogen and progesterone). As a result, menses cease permanently. Women are usually considered to be menopausal if they have not had a menstrual period for one year without any underlying cause. Some women experience mild problems or none at all but some women have severe symptoms in this period. It is an inevitable phenomenon in women''s lives who further spend many years of life in the postmenopausal phase.Currently there is no menopause policy for women employees in Government and private sectors. Before taking any decision on the issue of formulation of menopause policy for women employees in government and private sectors, besides consultations with stakeholders and experts, and careful consideration of all aspects of the matter, firm research findings relating to the subject area of physical and mental stress faced by such women employees as a result of menopause, may also be required. *****
