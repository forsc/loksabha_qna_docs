ANSWER




 ANSWERS MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) to (f) : Poorna Shakti Kendras were approved in pilot mode in selected districts under erstwhile National Mission for Empowerment of Women (NMEW) scheme.  A new scheme under the name Mahila Shakti Kendra (MSK), was launched in November, 2017, under which the earlier components of NMEW, namely Poorna Shakti Kendra (which was operational in 19 districts) and Village Convergence and Facilitation Service (which was operational is 53 districts) were replaced by District Level Centres for Women (DLCWs) under the MSK Scheme. However, the Ministry has decided to close the MSK Scheme in this financial year and, benefitting with the learnings from it, to launch a new and more comprehensive Umbrella Scheme for safety, security and empowerment of women under the name ''Mission Shakti'', including components such as National, State and District level Hubs for Empowerment of Women, Women Help Lines, One Stop Centres, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao etc. for protection and empowerment of women and capacity building in that regard. *****
