                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a):	Ministry of Food Processing Industries is implementing the Central Sector Scheme of Integrated Cold Chain and Value Addition Infrastructure as one of the component of Pradhan MantriKisan Sampada Yojana with the objective of arresting post-harvest losses of horticulture & non-horticulture produce and providing remunerative price to farmers for their produce. Under the scheme, Ministry provides financial assistance in the form of grant-in-aid @ 35% for general areas and @ 50% for North East States, Himalayan States, ITDP areas and Islands for storage and transport infrastructure and @ 50% and 75% respectively for value addition and processing infrastructure subject to a maximum grant-in-aid of ?10 crore per project for setting up integrated cold chain projects including irradiation facility without any break from the farm gate to the consumer. The integrated cold chain and value addition infrastructure can be set up by individuals, groups of entrepreneurs, cooperative societies, Self Help Groups (SHGs), Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), NGOs, Central/State PSUs, etc. The components covered under the cold chain scheme are (a) Farm Level Infrastructure (FLI) (b) Distribution hub (DH) (c) Refrigerated vans/ refrigerated trucks/ insulated vans/mobile insulated tankers and (d) Irradiation facility. To avail financial assistance under this scheme, the applicant has to set up Farm Level Infrastructure and any one or both of the components mentioned at (b) and (c) above. Considering the functional nature of the facility, irradiation component is treated as a standalone facility for the purpose of availing grant under the scheme. However, Standalone cold storage is not considered for financial assistance under the Scheme. The scheme is primarily private sector driven and proposals under this scheme are invited through Expression of Interest (EOI). Under the Scheme, 166 cold chain projects have been approved during the last three years from 2016-17 and 2018-19 creating cold storage capacity of 3.872 Lakh MT. The State-wise cold chain projects sanctioned under the Scheme during the last three years along with the cold storage capacity are at Annexure-I.Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) is implementing Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) for development of Horticulture in the country. Under this Mission, assistance for development of Post-Harvest Management infrastructure including establishment of cold storages is provided. The component is demand/ entrepreneur-driven from among entrepreneurs, private companies, cooperatives, farmers’ groups etc. through commercial ventures for which assistance ranging from at the rate 35% to 55% of the eligible project cost in general areas and hilly and scheduled areas respectively, per beneficiary is available as credit linked back ended subsidy through respective State Horticulture Missions. The State wise details of cold storage projects sanctioned during last three years under MIDH (National Horticulture Mission (NHM)) along with the capacity are at Annexure – II.National Horticulture Board (NHB) under the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare is providing credit linked back-ended subsidy @ 35% of the capital cost of the project in general areas and 50% in case of North East, Hilly States & Scheduled areas for cold storage capacity above 5000 MT and up to 10000 MT for construction/ expansion/ modernization of cold storage and Controlled Atmosphere (CA) store, under the Scheme for Capital Investment Subsidy for Construction/ Expansion / Modernization of Cold Storages and Storages for Horticulture Products.  In case of North East Region, the capacity above 1000 MT are also eligible for subsidy. The projects, which are set up in conformity with technical standards for energy efficiency and environmental safety energy and multi chambers, only are considered under the Scheme. The State-wise and year-wise details of cold storage sanctioned during last three years along with the capacity are at Annexure –III.(b) & (c): The utilization of cold chain facilities established under the Scheme for Integrated Cold Chain & Value Addition Infrastructure is being evaluated by conducting Impact Assessment study on cold chain projects funded by this Ministry. 	NHB does not monitor utilization rate after subsidy release. *****
