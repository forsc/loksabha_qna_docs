ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a)	As per the information available with the Ministry, at present there are 637 Indian fishermen imprisoned in foreign jails. Country-wise list is placed at Annexure–I. However, due to strong privacy laws prevailing in many countries, the local authorities do not share information on prisoners unless the person concerned consents to the disclosure of such information. Even countries which share information do not generally provide detailed information about the foreigners imprisoned. (b) to (d)	Government attaches high priority to the safety, security and welfare of Indian fishermen. Our Missions and Posts abroad extend all possible help and assistance like providing food, clothing, personal hygiene products, etc., to the imprisoned Indian fishermen, including when they are detained by local police/immigration authorities or put in jails for violation of immigration laws. After confirmation of nationality of such persons, our Missions and Posts also facilitate their repatriation to India. Consular Officers of Missions/Posts make regular visits to local jails and detention centers to ascertain the condition of Indian fishermen lodged there and provide requisite help and support, including legal and financial assistance in deserving cases.	The focus of the Government’s efforts is on securing the early release of fishermen as that is the central issue. ***
