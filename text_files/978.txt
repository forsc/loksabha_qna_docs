In order to assess the declining/rising trend in water level on a long-term basis, pre-monsoon water level data 2018 has been compared with the decadal average (2008-2017) water level. Analysis of data indicates decline in ground water level in about 52% of the wells being monitored. State-wise details are given in Annexure which includes States/UTs like Chandigarh, Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh & Uttarakhand where larger depletion has been observed.(d)  Water being a State subject, efforts to conserve and manage ground water is primarily States responsibility. A number of States have done notable work in this regard.  Of these, mention can be made of ‘Mukhyamantri Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan’ in Rajasthan, ‘Jalyukt Shibar’ in Maharashtra, ‘Sujalam Suflam Abhiyan’ in Gujarat, ‘Mission Kakatiya’ in Telangana, Neeru Chettu’ in Andhra Pradesh among others.Considering the importance of water conservation, the Hon’ble Prime Minister has recently written to all the Sarpanches in the country to ensure water conservation in a participatory mode.Other steps taken by the Central Government to control water depletion and promote rain water harvesting / conservation are at the following URL: http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf***** ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) to (c) of Starred Q.
