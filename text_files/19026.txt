ANSWER




                                                        and (b): Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has reached out to potential electronics manufacturing companies across the world, inviting them to set up manufacturing units in India. The potential of the Indian economy and the benefits of starting or expanding their manufacturing facilities in India have been highlighted. The new schemes launched by MeitY, viz., Production Linked Incentives Scheme (PLI) for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing, Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) and Modified Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC 2.0) Scheme were explained in detail and the queries replied to. Efforts are being made to clearly put across the message that Government of India intends to make India a global hub for electronics manufacturing and the companies should consider manufacturing in India for exports as well as cater to the large domestic market. Outreach activities have been carried out in coordination with Indian Embassies abroad, Embassies and High Commissions of other countries in India, Electronics industry associations in India, other stake holders like Invest India, International Banks (HSBC, Citibank etc.), International Consulting companies  and with global majors in electronics manufacturing along with their supply chain partners. A focused outreach plan has been carried out with companies from various countries which, inter-alia, include South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, USA and European Union.  (c) and (d): A number of companies from across the world have expressed interest and willingness to set up electronics manufacturing units in India. The new schemes launched by MeitY are acting as a catalyst in attracting the companies to India. MeitY, along with Invest India, the national investment promotion agency, is hand holding these companies in order to strengthen the electronics supply chain ecosystem in India. Since April 2020, over 70 meetings with international electronics manufacturing companies have been carried out at various levels, viz., Hon’ble Minister of Electronics and IT, Secretary, Joint Secretary and senior officials of MeitY. As a result, a total of 22 applications were received under the PLI Scheme, out of which 16 applications have been approved - Mobile Phones (Category - Invoice Value INR 15,000 and above): 5; Mobile Phones (Category: Domestic Companies): 5; Specified Electronic Components: 6. Under SPECS, more than 20 applications have been received.******
