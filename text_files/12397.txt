ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN MINISTRY OF FINANCE (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) and (b): There is no such proposal to withdraw Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax. 2.   With regards to Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) it may be noted that the Finance Bill, 2020, inter-alia,  has proposed to amend the Income tax Act, 1961( the Act) so as to provide that DDT shall not apply on any amount declared, distributed or paid after 31st March, 2020 by way of dividends by domestic companies or income distributed by specified company or mutual funds to the shareholders or unit holders respectively.   The dividend income or income from units will now be taxable in the hands of shareholders or unit holders at the applicable rate. 3.   In order to achieve the above, it has been proposed to, - (i)	amend section 115-O and clause (34) of section 10 to provide that DDT will be applicable only on dividend declared, distributed or paid after 1st April, 2003, but on or before 31st March, 2020 and dividend received on or after 1st April, 2020 will be taxed in the hands of the shareholder respectively. (ii)	amend section 115R and clause (35) of section 10 to provide that tax on income distributed by specified companies or mutual funds to its unit holder shall be applicable only on the income distributed on or before 31st March, 2020 and income, in respect of units, received on or after 1st April, 2020 will be taxed in the hands of the unit holders of mutual funds or specified companies respectively.(iii)    insert new section 80M in order to remove the cascading effect of imposition of tax on dividend on same profits by providing that where a domestic company declares dividend, out of dividend received from another domestic company, it shall be eligible to claim a deduction.3.   In addition to the above, consequential amendments to other related provisions of the Act have also been proposed.(c) and (d):  The month-wise details of Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) Net Investment since February, 2018 to January, 2020 are as below:Net FPI Investment from all countries (INR Cr.)Month	Equity	Debt	Hybrid	TotalFeb-18	-11,423 	-253 	3 	-11,674 Mar-18	11,654 	-9,044 	51 	2,661 Apr-18	-5,552 	-10,036 	27 	-15,561 May-18	-10,060 	-19,654 	-61 	-29,775 Jun-18	-4,831 	-10,970 	7 	-15,795 Jul-18	2,264 	43 	-43 	2,264 Aug-18	1,775 	3,414 	-44 	5,146 Sep-18	-10,825 	-10,198 	-11 	-21,035 Oct-18	-28,921 	-9,978 	-6 	-38,906 Nov-18	5,981 	5,610 	4 	11,595 Dec-18	3,143 	4,749 	-3 	7,889 Jan-19	-4,262 	-1,301 	7 	-5,556 Feb-19	17,220 	-6,037 	871 	12,053 Mar-19	33,981 	12,002 	2,769 	48,751 Apr-19	21,193 	-5,099 	634 	16,728 May-19	7,920 	1,187 	2,264 	11,370 Jun-19	2,596 	8,319 	2,196 	13,111 Jul-19	-12,419 	9,433 	-17 	-3,003 Aug-19	-17,592 	11,672 	49 	-5,873 Sep-19	7,548 	-990 	25 	6,582 Oct-19	12,368 	3,670 	31 	16,069 Nov-19	25,231 	-2,358 	126 	22,999 Dec-19	7,338 	-4,616 	40 	2,762 Jan-20 	12,123 	-11648		-46 	428Net	66,450	-42,083	8,873	33,2302.     It is apparent from the above, that there has been a net FPI investment to the tune of INR 33,230 cr. during the period from February, 2018 to January, 2020. Moreover, there has been net positive FPI investment in 15 out of the last 24 months after the introduction of LTCG.3.     Further, FPI investment depends on many factors which may include but not limited to the following:i.	Prevailing liquidity and volatility conditions across the globe;ii.	Global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors;iii.	Global outlook of the investors with respect to the concerned jurisdiction vis-à-vis other emerging/developed markets;iv.
