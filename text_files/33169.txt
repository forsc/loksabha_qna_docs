Two Covid-19 vaccines have received approval for Restricted Use in Emergency Situation in India for use in persons aged 12 years & above, namely Covaxin by Bharat Biotech International Ltd. and ZyCoV-D by Zydus Cadila. The administration of precaution dose to Health Care Workers, Front Line Workers and persons aged 60 years and above has started under National COVID-19 Vaccination Programme from 10th January 2022. Any decision on extension of eligible beneficiaries for precaution dose and vaccination of children below 15 years of age is as per the recommendations of The National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) on the basis of review of available scientific evidences.Regular review of COVID-19 vaccination is carried out at National, State and District level to identify various challenges for COVID-19 vaccination to devise corrective measures.(e) & (f) Union Ministry of Health & FW is keeping a close watch over evolving COVID-19 scenario in the country and has been in regular interaction with the States/UTs. Union Ministry of Health has coordinated and supported States to upgrade and strengthen the health infrastructure and requisite logistics to manage COVID-19 pandemic. Various initiatives have been initiated by the Government to provide technical guidance and further strengthen health infrastructure, clinical management of COVID-19, availability of essential logistics including drugs and medical oxygen supply to manage COVID-19.As on 1st February 2022, as reported by States/UTs, there are a total of 5,18,005 oxygen supported isolation beds and 64,737 ventilators earmarked for COVID-19 treatment. Omicron variant is the dominant variant in the country presently. The total number of COVID-19 cases in the month of December 2021 is 2,50,982 and January 2022 is 64,63,636 and deaths reported in the country during the months of December 2021 is 12,100 and January 2022 is 13,970.To ensure Covid-19 vaccination of bed-ridden persons and those with restricted mobility, advisory was issued to all States/UTs for vaccination at the place of residence of persons who might be bed-ridden or have extremely restricted mobility or disability and/or special needs that may hamper their accessibility even to Near to Home Covid Vaccination Centres (NHCVCs). In addition, Har Ghar Dastak vaccination campaign was initiated from 3rd November 2021, wherein missed beneficiaries for 1st dose and due beneficiaries for 2nd dose are identified and vaccinated through house to house activity.*******
