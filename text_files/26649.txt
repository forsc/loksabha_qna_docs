                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS                                                                   [RAO INDERJIT SINGH](a): The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) expenditure of previous financial years indicates a variation in the CSR funds spent by the companies in different States. As per the filings made by the companies in the MCA21 registry, the State-wise CSR spent by all the companies during the financial years 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 respectively is at Annexure. (b): The Government provides the broad framework for CSR through Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act’), Schedule VII of the Act and Companies (CSR Policy) Rules, 2014. The first proviso to Section 135 (5) of the Act provides that the company shall give preference to the local area and areas around it where it operates.  However, the emphasis on local area is only directory and not mandatory in nature and companies need to balance local area preference with national priorities. Under the Act, CSR is a Board driven process and the Board of the company is empowered to plan, decide, execute and monitor CSR activities based on the recommendation of its CSR Committee. The Government does not issue any specific direction to the companies to spend in any particular activity or geographical area.

All data related to CSR filed by companies in MCA21 registry is available in public domain at www.csr.gov.in. As per the filings made by the companies in the MCA21 registry, the CSR spent by all the companies in Delhi during the last five financial years 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 respectively is as follows: (Data upto 31.03.2021) [Source: National CSR Data Portal]            AnnexureANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2189 FOR 02.08.2021STATE/UT-WISE CSR EXPENDITURE DETAILS (IN RS.
