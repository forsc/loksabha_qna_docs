                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE    ???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		 (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	 to (b): Yes, Sir. The seed minikits of pulses are distributed to the farmers of major pulse growing States under the National Food Security Mission (NFSM). The State-wise distribution of seed minikits of pulses during last three years and allocation for Kharif 2021 is Annexed. The district wise allocation and distribution of seed minikits is managed by the respective State Governments. The seed minikits of pulses distributed in the districts of Rajkot and Sabarkantha during last 3 years and current year (Kharif) are as below:                                                                                            (Quantity in Nos.)Sl. No.	District	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21	2021-221	Rajkot	750	180	75	-2	Sabarkantha	1550	4642	1050	500(c)	to (d): The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) is implemented by the States under the National Food Security Mission (NFSM). The States transfer the benefit to the targeted beneficiaries through DBT by using Aadhar enabled system. Many states viz., Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra etc have reported Aadhaar enabled distribution of seed minikits. The production and productivity of pulses under seed minikits programme is primarily monitored by State Government field functionaries and State Food Security Mission Executive Committee (SFSM-EC) headed by Chief Secretary/Agriculture Production Commissioner. Besides, field visits of seed minikits fields are also undertaken by National Level Monitoring Teams (NALMOTS) constituted by The Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare. As a result of the various interventions under NFSM-Pulses programme, the production of pulses has increased from 16.32 million metric tonnes in 2015-16 to 25.56 million metric tonnes in 2020-21 (3rd Advance Estimates). The productivity of pulses has also increased from 655 kg/ha to 878 kg/ha during the same period.
