ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojna (PM-KMY), a Central Sector Scheme is being implemented in order to provide social security net for the Small and Marginal Farmers (SMF) by way of pension. Under this scheme, the eligible small and marginal farmers get a minimum fixed pension of Rs. 3,000/- subject to certain exclusion criteria, on attaining the age of 60 years.  The Scheme is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme, with entry age of 18 to 40 years. The eligible farmer may opt to become member of the Scheme by subscribing to a Pension Fund. The farmer is required to contribute Rs 100/ - per month at median entry age of 29 years. The Central Government also contributes to the Pension Fund in equal amount. The Contribution is made to a Pension Fund managed by the Life Insurance Corporation which is responsible for pension pay out. As PM-KMY Scheme is a voluntary and contributory pension Scheme, all the eligible farmers can get themselves registered under the Scheme. As on 13.12.2021, a total of 21,43,008 beneficiaries have been registered/enrolled under the Scheme.(b):	 The overall implementation of the PM-KMY is undertaken by the Project Monitoring Unit (PMU) set up for PM-KISAN Scheme viz National Farmers Welfare Programme Implementation Society (NFWPIS) at Central level in Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. The PMU undertakes publicity campaign (Information, Education and Communication-IEC) for the Scheme. Further, each State/UT has a Nodal Department for the implementation of the Scheme. Through regular V-C with the Nodal Officers, State/UTs are vigorously pursued to bring more farmers under the ambit of the Scheme through awareness campaigns. The PM-KISAN database is also being used for this purpose and beneficiaries of PM-KISAN Scheme, who can otherwise also be eligible for the PM-KMY Scheme, have been given the option to join the Scheme through voluntary contribution directly from the benefit drawn by him/her on account of PM-KISAN Scheme. (c):	Does not arise in view of above. ****
