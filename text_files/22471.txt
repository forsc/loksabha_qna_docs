                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a)	, (b) & (e): The Election Commission of India (ECI) has proposed to link the electoral roll with the Aadhaar ecosystem with a view to curbing the menace of multiple enrolment of the same person at different places. This would require amendments in the elections laws. The matter is under the consideration of the Government.(c): No, Sir.(d): The ECI has stated that it has taken multiple measures for the security and the safety of the electoral roll data platform. Electoral roll database system does not enter into the Aadhaar ecosystem and the system is used only for the authentication purpose keeping a tight air-gap between the two system. These measures effectively prevent theft interception and high jacking of the voter system.*******
