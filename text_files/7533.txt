ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b): Under the schemes namely Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS) and Article 275(1) of the Constitution , funds are released to State Government to undertake various activities as per proposals submitted by the respective State Government and approval thereof by the Project Appraisal Committee (PAC). The State Government implements these projects either through Integrated Tribal Development Projects (ITDPs) or through other agencies. During the last three years the details of activities were sanction to the State of Maharashtra for implementation by the ITDPs as per Annexure.                 Apart from above, State Governments utilize funds earmarked under State TSP for the development of tribals in the Integrated Tribal Development Projects (ITDP) area. The amount of fund allocated as State TSP by the Government of Maharashtra during 2015-16 to 2018-19 and utilization thereof is given below:                                                                             (Rs. in crore)Year	TSP Allocation	TSP Expenditure2015-16	5170.00	4562.552016-17	5357.71	4957.712017-18	6783.74	6162.932018-19	8969.05	7291.91(c) & (d):During the Project Appraisal Committee meetings, the State Governments share the progress made under different activities approved during the previous year. Apart from this, States are mandated to submit Utilization Certificates for the funds sanctioned. States also submit Physical Progress Report wherein activity wise progress details are highlighted. Senior Officers of the Ministry have also been allotted specific States and they periodically visit the States to review the progress of activities funded by the Ministry. The Ministry also conducts Review Meetings and Video Conferences to review the financial and physical progress of activities funded under the scheme.2.	   Further, an online monitoring system has been put in place by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs with web address http://stcmis.gov.infor monitoring of Tribal Sub-Plan since 2017-18. The framework captures data directly from Public Finance Management System (PFMS) and gives us inputs to see through expenditure vis-a- vis allocations in respect of Central TSP. Monitoring of physical performance and outcome of initiatives has also been introduced in the system.  A customized proforma has been developed in the MIS to capture location of the ongoing projects and beneficiary details. State Governments have been shared with the necessary credentials for filling up necessary data in the MIS. From the year 2018-19, the Ministry has started conducting mid-term review with the State Governments with a view to ensure expeditious utilization of funds under the schemes of Ministry of Tribal Affairs.3.       Efforts of Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) has so far yielded notable results as under:(i)	With the responsive support of State Governments, overall utilization of allocated funds under the Schemes of the Ministry has been over 90% since 2014-15 in general and almost 100% in the scheme ‘SCA to TSS’ and ‘Grant under Article 275(1) of the Constitution’ in particular. (ii)	Overall Budgetary allocation under Schemes of MoTA has substantially increased from Rs. 4279.00 crore in 2013-14 to Rs. 5957.18 crore in 2018-19.  (iii)	All the State Governments except Kerala have constituted Executive Committee under Chief Secretary for overall monitoring of TSP formulation and implementation by the line Departments.  (iv)	Rigorous persuasions of MoTA resulted in significant increase of 98% in expenditures of State TSP funds by States during the years block of 2010-13 (wherein a total of Rs. 165691 crore was expended) to 2014-17 (wherein a total of Rs.327574 crore were expended).4.	        While considering proposals received from State Government for funding during current year, the Project Appraisal Committee reviews the progress of projects already sanctioned during previous years.  Further, concurrence for release of funds is accorded keeping in view the following: (i) Availability of funds under the relevant scheme(s). (ii) Submission of UC by the State Government of the funds released during previous years. (iii) Physical progress report of already funded projects. 5.         Apart from above, Ministry of Tribal Affairs has entrusted the responsibility of evaluation of State TSP to Tribal Research Institutes (TRI) in the respective States including Maharashtra. For the purpose, an amount of Rs. 25.00 lakh has been sanctioned to TRI Maharashtra during the current financial year 2018-19.  ***** AnnexureAnnexure Referred in reply to part(a) &(b)  of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. †1238 for 25.11.2019 by SHRI SADASHIV KISAN LOKHANDE: DR.
