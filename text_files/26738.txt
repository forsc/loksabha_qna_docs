                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) & (b):	The details of human lives lost due to hydrometeorological calamities/ hazards including flash floods, cloudburst and landslide, as reported by the State Governments/ Union Territory Administrations, during 2018-19 to 2020-21 are at Annexure-I.  Further, as informed by Geological Survey of India (GSI), during       the monsoon period (April  –  October mainly; in Western Ghat terrains from-2-L.S.US.Q. NO.2412 FOR 03.08.2021 April to December, including the phase of Northeast monsoon), landslide incidences occur in almost all landslide-prone areas, some of which are disastrous leading to loss of lives in the country.  In most cases, these are triggered by extreme rainfall events or cloudbursts.  These types of fatal landslide events are common almost every year, mainly in the Himalayan States, in the Western Ghats, and Konkan areas.  When the rainfall becomes incessant and much higher than the threshold amount, major landslide events occur, which can cause loss of lives, if elements-at-risk (both static and dynamic) are exposed across its tracks.  However, it cannot be conclusively stated from the GSI’s inventory records that these types of fatal events are increasing in recent years.  (c):	The primary responsibility for disaster management rests with the State Government. The State Government concerned undertakes relief measures in the wake of natural disasters including flash floods, cloudburst and landslide from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) already placed at their disposal in accordance with the Government of India’s approved items and norms.  Additional financial assistance is provided from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), as per laid down procedure, in case of disaster of ‘severe nature’.  During the current financial year 2021-22, the first installment of Central share of SDRF amounting to Rs. 8873.60 crore has already been released in advance to all States on 29th April, 2021.  Beside this, Rs. 279.00 crore has been allocated towards J&K Disaster Response Fund (DRF), out of which, Rs. 108.81 crore has been released upto August, 2021 to the UT of Jammu and Kashmir.  State-wise detail of allocation and releases of Central Share from SDRF during 2021-22 is given in Annexure-II.******
