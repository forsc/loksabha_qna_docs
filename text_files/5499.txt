                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) to (e):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.452 FOR 24TH JULY, 2019 REGARDING FAST TRACK COURTS(a) to (c) & (e): The decision of setting up of Fast Track Courts (FTCs) and allocation of funds lies within the domain of the State Governments who set up such courts as per their need and resources, in consultation with the concerned High Courts. In its judgment in Brij Mohan Lal & Others v/s Union of India & Others on 19.04.2012, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India had, inter alia, directed the States that they shall not take a decision to continue FTCs on an ad-hoc and temporary basis. They (States) will need to decide either to bring the FTCs scheme to an end or to continue the same as a permanent feature in the State. A statement indicating State-wise number of FTCs reported functional is enclosed as Annexure-I.     In the Conference of Chief Ministers of States and Chief Justices of High Courts held in 2013, it was resolved that the State Governments in consultation with the Chief Justices of respective States, take immediate steps to establish a suitable number of FTCs relating to offences against women, children, differently-abled persons, senior citizens and marginalized sections of society and to sanction posts of Judicial Officers with corresponding infrastructure and support staff for these Courts. The State Governments shall provide adequate funds for the purpose of creating and continuing these FTCs.   Accordingly in order to strengthen the judicial system in States, the Union of India proposed setting up of 1800 FTCs for cases of heinous crimes; cases involving senior citizens, women, children, disabled and litigants affected with HIV AIDS and other terminal ailments; and civil disputes involving land acquisition and property/rent disputes pending for more than five years at a cost of Rs.4144 crore as a component of its Memorandum to the 14th Finance Commission (14th FC) which endorsed the proposal and urged the State Governments to use the additional fiscal space provided by the Commission in the tax devolution from 32% to 42% to meet such requirements, the details of which is enclosed as Annexure-II.(d):     An amount of Rs.870 crore was released to the State Governments for FTCs during a period of 11 years from 2000-01 to 2010-2011 and Central funding was discontinued beyond 31.03.2011. The Central grants released to the States for FTCs from 2000-2001 to 2010-2011 is given as Annexure-III. The Central Government decided to provide funds upto a maximum of Rs.80 crore per annum on a matching basis upto 31.03.2015 from the 13th Finance Commission Award for meeting expenditure on salaries of the 10% additional positions of Judges being created in the subordinate Judiciary following the direction of Supreme Court in the case of Brij Mohan Lal Vs. Union of India.  The State Governments and Chief Justices of the High Courts were requested to utilize these positions for creation of FTCs also. Further the 14th FC while endorsing the proposal of the Union of India to strengthen the judicial system in States which includes, inter-alia, establishing 1800 FTCs urged the State Governments to use the additional fiscal space provided by the Commission in the tax devolution from 32% to 42% to meet such requirements. The Union Government also urged the State Governments to allocate funds for the activities mentioned in the 14th FC recommendations from their State budgets from the Financial Year 2015-16 onwards and to strengthen the existing coordination and monitoring mechanism between the State Governments and the Judiciary for effective implementation of the recommendations of the 14th FC. The details of funds allocation by the States as per recommendations of 14th FC to strengthen the judicial system during the last five years is not maintained at Central Government level.
