                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(SHRI PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a) to (c) :	The name of places in the Country where fishing harbours/landing centres are located is at Annexure-I. It is to state that the handling capacity of such structures will vary depending on the size and type of vessels, frequency of arrival, available work force and machinery etc. The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying  has been implementing a flagship scheme namely Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) with a highest-ever investment of Rs. 20,050 crore in all States/Union Territories (UTs) including in the State of Tamil Nadu for development of fisheries with effect from financial year 2020-21. Development of fishing harbours and fish landing centres is one of the thrust areas under PMMSY and an investment of about Rs.3500 crore has been envisaged for this purpose. Under PMMSY, central financial assistance upto 60% of project cost for the States and upto 100% for the UTs is provided for the development of fishing harbours and fish landing centres. Further the entire cost for modernization of fishing harbours exclusively owned by the Central Government and its entities are borne by the Government of India. PMMSY also envisages suitable linkages and convergence with the Sagarmala Scheme of Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPSW) for development of fishing harbours/fish landing centres. The Department of Fisheries (DoF), Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying during 2021-22 has  accorded approval to  four fishing harbour proposals under PMMSY in a convergence mode of implementation by sharing the central financial liability equally between the PMMSY of DoF and Sagarmala of MoPSW. Details of the same are placed at Annexure-II. In addition, 14 Fishing Harbours of various States/UTs including Tamil Nadu have been approved for development/upgradation under the Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) in which interest subvention is provided by Government of India for the loans to be taken by State Governments to finance the projects. Details of the same are provided at Annexure-III.   (d) to (e): A Concept Note relating to  establishment of Multipurpose Seaweed Park has been received from the State Government of Tamil Nadu, at an estimated cost of Rs.296.43 crores under the PMMSY to be established in a hub and spoke model. The project aims to enhance the production of seaweed and to create viable alternative livelihood options for the coastal communities by introducing them to seaweed cultivation. However, a detailed project report along with firmed up cost with necessary approvals is yet to be received.****
