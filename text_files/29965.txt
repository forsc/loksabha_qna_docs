Some State Governments have extended their legislative and regulatory control over Online Games within their jurisdictions using these entries in the Seventh Schedule.This ministry does not have legislative jurisdiction over contents of Internet games except that it has the power to order blocking of public access to information on internet under specified conditions of section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and following the due process,  specified  in  the  Information  Technology  (Procedure  and  Safeguards  for  Blocking  for  Access of  Information  by  Public)  Rules,  2009.

The said Rules provide for removal of any information/ application violative of any extant law, as and when notified by an appropriate government or its authorized agency.*******
