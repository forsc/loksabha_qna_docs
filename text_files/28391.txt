ANSWER




                                                        (a)	& (b): The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) through its flagship programme, Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY 2.0) and PMKVY 3.0 provide skill development training to all sections of people including women. As on 10.07.2021, the State-wise details of women trained and placed under the Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed (CSCM) component of PMKVY 2.0 (from 2018-19 to 2020-21) and PMKVY 3.0 (2020-21 and 2021-22) are placed at Annexure-I and Annexure-II respectively. Third-party evaluation report of PMKVY 2.0 conducted by Sambodhi Research and Communications has found that the mean monthly income of individuals trained and certified under PMKVY 2.0–Short Term Training (STT) was 15 percent higher when compared to a comparison group of individuals who have not participated in PMKVY. Further, the average monthly income of Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)-certified individuals was found to be 19 percent higher than that of a comparison group of non-RPL certified individuals.The Directorate General of Training (DGT) of MSDE, under its Craftsmanship Training Scheme (CTS), has imparted long-term vocational training through a network of 14,604 Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs). As per the tracer study conducted by DGT in 2015 for ITI pass outs, 63.5 percent of the pass-outs were either wage or self-employed. The State-wise details of female candidates trained for the academic year 2018, 2019 and 2020 are placed at Annexure III. As far as apprenticeship training is concerned, third party evaluation report conducted by the National Productivity Council has found that 74 percent apprentices have obtained wage employment after completing Apprenticeship. The number of women apprentices trained under the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) during the last three years is given at Annexure IV.  In Jan Shikshan Sansthans, more than 240 centres have trained 800269 women in last 3 years (2018-21). Third-party evaluation study report (year 2020-21) has shown that this scheme is very effective for empowerment of women. The report says “Women representation has been recognized as 79 percent against the male (21%). The Scheme is women dominated and catering to the mandated target group.(c) & (d): Empanelled training centres of PMKVY are being monitored effectively through various methodologies including information technology (IT) interventions and measures namely; self-audit reporting, call validations, surprise visits and monitoring through the Skills Development Management System (SDMS), Skill Management and Accreditation of Training Centres (SMART), Aadhaar Enabled Biometric Attendance System (AEBAS), social media platform, etc. Under the scheme, PMKVY Monitoring Committee review and formulate framework on the critical cases related to monitoring issues of the stakeholders. Also, the Committee has formulated penalty grid (approved by Steering Committee for PMKVY) for taking action against erring / non-compliant training centres / stakeholders. Based on the penalty grid, National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), the implementing agency of PMKVY under MSDE, has suspended training centres for non-compliance of PMKVY guidelines on multiple parameters and periodically publishes the list on PMKVY official website. So far, 306 Training Centres (TCs) have been suspended across the different locations. The State-wise details of suspended TCs under PMKVY 2.0 are placed at Annexure V.   Similarly, action has been taken against 4 JSSs (since July, 2018), i.e., 4 JSSs have been closed, not having up to date information or against which complaints were received. Actions are taken against ITIs also, on similar grounds.
