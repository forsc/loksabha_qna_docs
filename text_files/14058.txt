                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW & JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a)	to (d) Article 39-A of the Constitution provides that the State shall secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice on the basis of equal opportunity, and shall in particular, provide free legal aid, by suitable legislation or schemes or in any other way, to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities.      The Legal Services Authorities (LSA) Act, 1987 provides free and competent legal services to the weaker sections of the society including beneficiaries covered under Section 12 of the Act to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities, and to organize Lok Adalats to secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice on a basis of equal opportunities.For this purpose, the legal services institutions have been setup from the Taluk Court level to the Supreme Court. During the period from April, 2019 to December, 2019, 8.96 lakhs persons have been provided with free legal services and 56.19 lakhs cases (pending in courts and disputes at pre-litigation stage) have been settled through Lok Adalats.In addition, the Government has launched Nyaya Bandhu (Pro-bono) programme to link the persons eligible to avail free legal aid under Section 12 of LSA Act, 1987 with the pro-bono lawyers. Tele-Law programme has been launched to provide legal advice to public including persons entitled for free legal aid under Section 12 of LSA Act, 1987, at pre-litigation stage by the Panel lawyers through the Common Service Centre (CSC) at the villages.
