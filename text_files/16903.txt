ANSWER




                                                            MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY                                          (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a)  to (d): Shramik Special trains were requisitioned by State Governments. In normal circumstances such special trains are booked by State Governments/any agency or by an individual on Full Tariff Rates which include normal fare for both directions, service charge, empty haulage charge, detention charge etc.     Indian Railways allowed booking of Shramik Specials on normal fare for one direction only. Special arrangements like enhanced sanitisation, special security, medical arrangement, rake sanitisation, free meals, water etc. for Shramik operations, further added to the overall cost of running these trains. --2/--2-   Railways have collected fare for Shramik Special trains from State Governments or their authorised representatives. Railways did not collect any fare directly from passengers.     Fare of `433 crore has been collected from State Governments and from the representatives of State Governments for running of Shramik Special trains for the period from 01.05.2020 to 31.08.2020.     Indian Railways could recover a small fraction of expenditure incurred on running of Shramik Special trains, thereby incurring a loss in the operation of these trains.*****
