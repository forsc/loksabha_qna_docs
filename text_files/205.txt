Towards this end, Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 provides for Advertising Code for monitoring the advertisements shown on TV. In 2015, the Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA) launched a portal - Grievances Against Misleading Advertisements (GAMA), to enable consumers to register their grievances against misleading advertisements. (c) to (e): The Ministry of Information & Broadcasting had constituted a standing and permanent Inter Ministerial Committee in 2005 under Section 20 of the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 to examine content related matters of programmes and advertisements telecast on TV. In so far as Print Media is concerned, the Press Council of India (PCI), set up under the Press Council Act, 1978 is mandated to maintain and improve the standards of newspapers and news agencies in India and also to inculcate principles of self-regulation among the press.  	 The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), a voluntary self-regulatory organization, looks into complaint across all media such as Print, TV, Radio, hoardings, SMS, e-mailers, Internet/ web-site, product packaging, brochures, promotional material and point of sale material etc.  ***********
