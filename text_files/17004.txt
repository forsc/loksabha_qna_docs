ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE					(SHRI SHRIPAD NAIK)IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE   (a) to (d):  In 2018, Ministry of Defence, Department of Defence Production has launched a programme ‘Mission Raksha Gyan Shakti (MRGS)’ to promote self-reliance and have an enabling framework for creation of Intellectual Property (IP) and management of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) in Indian Defence sector.  Since the launch of programme MRGS, a total of 1560 IP applications have been filed by the personnel of Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs)/Ordnance Factories (OFs).  A major IPR Awareness Program has been launched and a total of 25000 personnel have been trained till 31 August, 2020.  A nodal Intellectual Property Facilitation Cell (IPFC) has been set under Directorate General of Quality Assurance to create awareness about IPRs.  A comprehensive policy on creation of IP and Management of IPRs in DPSUs and OFs has been promulgated in November, 2019.  Innovative research in DPSUs and Ordnance Factories has enabled the development of certain materials, components/assemblies/sub-assemblies that result in performance upgradation of existing  systems/platforms and simultaneously reducing India’s dependence on imports.  Some of the challenges faced in attracting private and public sector entities for IPRs is the risk of leakage of classified information regarding defence technology due to mandatory disclosures associated with IPR filing and for combating IPR infringement.*****
