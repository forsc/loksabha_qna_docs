The assets created on Railway land shall revert back to Railways after completion of the specified lease period.(c): Redevelopment of stations is planned through leveraging commercial development of sparable land and air space in and around railway stations, i.e. station redevelopment projects shall generally be cost neutral to Railways.Station redevelopment program, at this scale, is first of its kind and complex in nature and requires detailed techno-financial feasibility studies and various statutory clearances from local bodies etc.  Therefore, no time-frame can be indicated at this stage.*****
