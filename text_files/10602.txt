NBCC (India) Limited has informed that at the time of technical possession, allottees are informed to take physical possession after 45-60 days, which is required for the final finishing such as final  coat  of  internal  painting, fixing of sanitary wares and kitchen fixtures and final cleaning. However, in Type- III flats, some of the flats have been handed over after 60 days as one of the contractors (Firm) engaged by NBCC (India) Limited, which is the executing agency for this project, faced Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) before National Company Law Tribunal. NBCC has made alternate arrangements to execute the remaining work by making direct payments to sub-contractors/vendors to avoid such delays.In order to contain air pollution at the construction site of Kidwai Nagar (East), the towers under construction are fully covered with nylon/ fibre net to control the dust; construction materialis stacked within the barricading and is covered; earth malba/other material is transported in covered manner and no construction material like cement, bricks and dust are dumped on the road.Further, continuous sprinkling of water is done on the area in and around the project site to control dust.Semi-hard pavementshave been provided for vehicular movement at project site.For speedy completion of redevelopment of GPRA Colonies at Sarojini Nagar and Netaji Nagar areas, construction technologies and processes such as monolithic construction and design, diaphragm wall, composite construction etc. are being adopted.                                    *****
