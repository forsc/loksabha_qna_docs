IITs duly follow guidelines, statutes, norms and directions issued by Central Government. IITs have taken various steps to fill up the PhD seats for SC/ST Students that include (i) Adherence of guidelines for implementation of reservation policy of the Government; (ii) Age relaxation upto 5 years; (iii) Relaxation in minimum qualifying marks; (iv) Exemption of tuition fee to SC/ST students; (v) Subsidized application fee; (vi) apart from Tuition fee waiver, assistant-ship is extended to SC/ST scholars of the Institute for the sixth year of their PhD programme to ensure that the students do not drop out due to lack of financial resources; (vii) More PhD applicants are shortlisted against the number of reserved category seats available for PhD admission to ensure that enough applicants are available for admission under reserved categories; (viii) wide publicity to attract more applications on various platforms including social media, newspapers, websites, etc. *****
