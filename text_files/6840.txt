                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) & (b) 	Yes sir, Department of Telecommunications has allocated a separate numbering series for the purpose of making marketing calls by the various companies. The separate numbering series starting with digits ‘140’ have been allotted to all the access service providers.(c) 	The Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018 have prescribed default timeline from 10.00 am to 9.00 pm for marketing calls to mobile users. However, option has also been provided to the consumer to choose any time band during which he wishes to receive communications as per his preference for any category/categories of communications.(d) & (e) 	As per the details of complaints lodged by consumers with the service providers and uploaded by the service providers on TRAI portal www.nccptrai.gov.in, 326264 numbers of complaints relating to voice Unsolicited Commercial Communications (UCC) have been lodged by consumers with their service providers during the period 1.07.2019 to 30.09.2019.  For addressing the menace of UCC effectively, TRAI had reviewed the framework for controlling UCC and laid down a revised framework for controlling UCC on 19.07.2018 through the Telecom Commercial Communication Customer Preference Regulation, 2018. The salient features of the regulation are:1)	Adoption of Distributed Ledger Technology (or blockchain) as the regulatory technology (RegTech) to ensure regulatory compliance while allowing innovation in the market. 2)	Co-regulation where Telecom Service Providers/ Access Providers establish and arrange the framework, which is legally backed by regulation. 3)	Enabling compliance through innovation in technology solutions that are demonstrated in a regulatory sandbox. 4)	Enhanced controls and new options for all entities to perform their functions and to carry on their businesses efficiently. 5)	Various detection methods are being used under the new ecosystem to curb unsolicited commercial communication.
