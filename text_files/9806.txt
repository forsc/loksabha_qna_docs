                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TOURISM (INDEPENDENT CHARGE)(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) to (d):	The Ministry of Tourism has launched the Swadesh Darshan and PRASHAD Schemes for the development of tourism related infrastructure and facilities in the country.  Recognising the potential for the development of rural tourism in the country, the Ministry of Tourism has identified “Rural Circuit” as one of the 15 thematic circuits under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme. Following projects under the Rural Circuit theme of the Swadesh Darshan Scheme has been sanctioned till date:<pre>State	Name of Circuit/Year	Project NameBihar	Rural Circuit (2017-18)	“Development of Gandhi Circuit: Bhitiharwa –Chandrahia Turkaulia in Bihar Kerala	Rural Circuit (2018-19)	Development of Rural Circuit: Malanad Malabar Cruise Tourism Project in Kerala  </pre>The projects under the scheme are at various stages of implementation/completion.  Further, it is seen that the tourism sector is an important source of employment in the country as it is a labour intensive activity.  Ministry of Tourism develops tourism related infrastructure and promotes India as a Tourism destination to increase tourist arrivals which in turn creates employment opportunities in the country.  The Swadesh Darshan Guidelines have a provision to create employment through active involvement of local communities.The Ministry also promotes the tourism destinations and products including ‘Rural Tourism’ through its websites, and publicity and promotional material produced by it from time to time.  The Ministry does not maintain data with regard to employment generated by implementation of its various schemes.  However, as per the 3rd Tourism Satellite Account of India (TSA) – 2015-16 and its subsequent estimates, the contribution of tourism employment to total  employment of the country during 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 was 12.20%, 12.13%, 12.75% respectively.The Ministry of Rural Development, Department of Rural Development is implementing Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 which provides at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every rural household in the country, whose adult members including youth volunteer to do unskilled manual work.  It provides livelihood security i.e., fall back option for livelihood for the rural households when no better employment opportunity is available.  ******
