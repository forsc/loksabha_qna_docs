                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	 to (c)  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. 302 BY SHRI VISHNU DATT SHARMA TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 17.03.2021 REGARDING INCONVENIENCE DUE TO NON-OPERATIONALISATION OF TRAINS.(a) and (b) To prevent the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, Indian Railways discontinued all regular passenger carrying trains w.e.f. 23rd March, 2020  and is presently operating only Special Trains keeping in view the suggestions and concerns of State Governments.  As on 12.03.2021, Indian Railways has started operation of a total of 8474 train services (approximately 64%) which includes 2328 Mail/Express trains and 784 Passenger trains.  Indian Railways is keeping a close watch on the situation by regularly monitoring the waiting list, undertaking temporary augmentation, operating clone trains(wherever required) and is gradually resuming train services in a phased manner.   (c) In the current year, due to suspension of passenger services during the lockdown period and partial resumption of passenger services in the post lockdown period, Railways’ passenger revenue decreased by  ? 36,399.91 crore to end of February, 2021 compared to corresponding period of previous year (COPPY- Corresponding Period of Previous Year).  Passenger revenue trends have, however, indicated progressive improvement in the post lockdown period.  Passenger revenue which had declined by 107.7% to end of May, 2020 over COPPY has now improved to a decline of 74.6% to end of February, 2021 over COPPY. 	Part of the passenger revenue decrease is getting offset by healthy recovery in the freight revenue trends. Freight revenue has increased by ? 996.62 crore to end of February, 2021 compared to COPPY.  Freight revenue which had witnessed a decline of 32.7% to end of May, 2020 over COPPY has now improved to an increase of 1.0% to end of February, 2021 over COPPY. *****
