                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):	The Government is aware of the reports appearing in the media from time to time about some such cases of overcharging by the private health care establishments. As per constitutional provisions, ‘Health is a State subject. It is the responsibility of the respective State Government to take cognizance of such instances and take action to prevent and control such practices. Complaints, as and when received, are forwarded to the concerned State/UT Government which regulate the hospitals/clinical establishments as per the provisions of Act and Rules applicable in the concerned State/UT. Details of such complaints are, however, not maintained centrally.(c) to (e):	The Government of India has enacted the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010 and notified Clinical Establishments (Central Government) Rules, 2012 for registration and regulation of clinical establishments (both Government and Private) in the country. In the States /UTs where the said Act is in force,  the clinical establishments are required to meet the norms such as minimum standards of facilities and services, minimum requirement of personnel, maintenance of records and reports  and displaying of rates at a conspicuous place, etc. The clinical establishments are also required to follow Standard Treatment Guidelines issued by the Central/State Governments and charge rates for each type of procedure and service within the range of rates determined from time to time. The National Council for Clinical Establishments has developed a standard list of medical procedures and a standard template for costing of medical procedures and shared the same with the States and Union Territories for appropriate action by them. The implementation and enforcement of the said Act is within the purview of the State/UT Governments.  The Central Government, under the National Health Mission (NHM), provides financial and technical support to the States/UTs for strengthening their healthcare system for provision of accessible, affordable and quality healthcare to all the people. This support includes support for free maternal & child health, immunization, communicable disease control programmes, prevention and management of non-communicable diseases, strengthening health systems such as physical infrastructure, augmenting health human resource on contractual basis, free ambulance services, free essential drugs & diagnostics, free blood, free dialysis services to the poor, mobile medical units, etc.   Further, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has started AMRIT (Affordable Medicines and reliable Implants for Treatment) stores where essential life saving medicines and implants are being provided at a substantial discount vis-à-vis the Maximum Retail Price.
