ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d) Control of illegal mining comes under the legislative and administrative jurisdiction of State Governments. Details of illegal mining cases and action taken in such cases are not maintained centrally.       The mining activities in Baby Betta Kavalu area have been taken note of by the Government of Karnataka. Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) on 25.09.2018 reported negligible impact of quarrying. Based on reports of CWPRS (Central Water and Power Research Station) & NIRM (National Institute of Rock Mechanics), Dam Safety Review Panel (DSRP) of the State recommended banning of mining activity in a radius of about 25 kms of Krishna Raja Sagara (KRS) dam. As per the report of KSNDMC, Deputy Commissioner, Mandya has imposed a ban on mining activities in 20 km radius of KRS dam. Further investigation of KRS Dam  for structural stability is in progress under the guidance of CWPRS, Pune.*****
