ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) to (c)   Rivers in the country are polluted mainly due to discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage from cities/towns and industrial effluents in their respective catchments, problems in operation and maintenance of sewage/effluent treatment plants, agricultural run-off, lack of dilution and other non-point sources of pollution.  It is the responsibility of States/Union Territories (UTs) and local bodies to ensure required treatment of sewage and industrial effluent, before discharging into recipient water bodies or land for prevention and control of pollution therein. This Ministry, through the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP), has been supplementing efforts of the States/UTs by providing financial and technical assistance in abatement of pollution in identified stretches of rivers excluding river Ganga and its tributaries, on cost sharing basis.  Proposal has not been been received from the Government of Maharashtra to rehabilitate and rejuvenate twenty one rivers in the State under NRCP. Proposals for pollution abatement works, received from the States/UTs from time to time for consideration under the NRCP, are sanctioned based on their prioritization, conformity with NRCP guidelines, independent appraisal, availability of Plan funds, etc.  *****
