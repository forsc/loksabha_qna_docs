ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (d): No Madam, the draft EIA Notification 2020 does not curb the right of any concern or affected person to report cases of violation.  Clauses 22 (1) and 23 (1) of the Draft EIA Notification, 2020 mention that the cognizance of violation or non-compliance shall be made on the basis of (a) Suo moto application of project proponent, (b) Report by any Government authority, (c) Violation/Non-compliance found during the appraisal by appraisal committee or while during processing of applications by any Regulatory Authority.  The public, NGOs and other affected persons can approach any of the government authorities, who after preliminary verifications, can refer the matter to the Ministry or respective States for taking further action in the matter.  The draft EIA Notification 2020 is not against the citizen’s right to healthy environment. Rather, the draft, inter alia, promotes the environmental cause; removes redundancies; encourages modernization and Ease of Doing Business; brings defaulters into the environmental regime with requisite action, penalty and remediation; and introduces standardization and a technology driven process.
