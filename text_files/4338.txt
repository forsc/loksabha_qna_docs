                                                        ???????? ??? ?????? ???????? ??? ???????????? ( ???? ??? ??????) THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE &INDUSTRY(SHRI SOM PARKASH)(a)to(e): Startup India initiative was announced by the Prime Minister on 15th August, 2015. The flagship initiative aims to build a strong eco-system for nurturing innovation and Startups in the country that will drive sustainable economic growth and generate large scale employment opportunities.  Further to this, an Action Plan for Startup India was unveiled by the Prime Minister on 16th January 2016. The action plan comprises of 19 action items spanning across areas such as “Simplification and handholding”, “Funding support and incentives” and “Industry-academia partnership and incubation”.    	 Many other initiatives beyond the Startup India Action Plan such as Regulatory Easing, Participation of States in Strengthening Startup Ecosystems, Startup Yatra, Grand Challenges, International Bilateral Cooperation and Encouraging Women Entrepreneurship have been undertaken for development of overall growth of Startup movement in the country.Currently, there are no loan instruments offered under Startup India initiative. As such, there are no bank wise targets under Startup India initiative. Recognised Startups under Startup India initiative have, however, access to financing through Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS). The Fund of Funds has been established with a total corpus of Rs 10,000 crore. The Fund of Funds for start-ups (FFS), operated and managed by SIDBI, do not invest directly in start-ups, but participate in the capital of Alternate Investment Funds (AIFs) registered with Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The FFS contributes to the corpus of Alternate Investment Funds (AIFs) for investing in equity and equity linked instruments of various Startups at early stage, seed stage and growth stages.  	 No targets have been fixed by the Department for women entrepreneurs. However, 10% of the total corpus of Fund of Funds amounting to Rs 1000 crore, has been reserved for women led start-ups. Special interaction sessions of women entrepreneurs with Venture funds and investors are being organized. Special efforts are being made for capacity building of women entrepreneurs and all the programs organised by DPIIT have at least one third of the beneficiaries as women.There are 19,747 recognised startups under the initiative across 513 districts  covering all 29 States and 6 Union Territories.******
