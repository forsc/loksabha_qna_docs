                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a) to (e):  A statement is laid on the Table of the HouseSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 100 FOR 7TH FEBRUARY, 2020(a) As per the Global Health Expenditure Database of WHO (GHED), for the year 2017, India ranks 166th out of 184 countries in Domestic General Government Health Expenditure as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). As per the Economic Survey 2019-20, General Government (Centre and States) expenditure on health as a percent of GDP in India during the last five years   is as follows: Year	General Government  expenditure on health as percentage of GDP2019-20(BE)	1.6%2018-19(RE) 	1.5%2017-18	1.4%2016-17	1.4%2015-16	1.3%(b) The National Health Policy, 2017, envisages raising public health expenditure to 2.5% of GDP by 2025. In 2018-19, Government announced 4% Health and Education Cess in place of 3% Education Cess on personal Income Tax and Corporation Tax, to cater to the education and health needs of poor and rural families.  In addition, Higher Education Funding Agency (HEFA) has started supporting infrastructure works of medical Institutions. In the Budget 2020-21, it has been proposed that Health Cess of  5%  on import of medical devices will be imposed and the proceeds of the Health Cess will be used for  financing health infrastructure and services. (c) As per National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates, the per capita Total Health Expenditure (Public + Private) and per capita Government Health Expenditure during the years 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17(latest available) is as follows:Per capita Health Expenditure ( in Rs)Year	Per Capita Total Health Expenditure	Per CapitaGovernment Health Expenditure2013-14	3638	10422014-15	3826	11082015-16	4116	12612016-17	4381	1418(d) & (e) Public health and Hospitals being a State subject, the primary responsibility of strengthening the health sector in the States lies with the respective State Governments. However, to improve the health outcomes of the population at large, Union Government has taken several steps to provide affordable healthcare facilities across the country. The Major steps taken are: Launch of Ayushman Bharat, with its two components: i)  to establish Health & Wellness Centres across the country to provide Comprehensive Primary healthcare, and  ii) Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana which  provides health cover of Rs. 5.00 lakh per family per year to around 10.74 crore poor and vulnerable families.  In addition, through the National Health Mission (NHM), Govt of India supplements the efforts of the State/UT Governments to provide accessible, affordable and quality healthcare to all those who access public health facilities especially in rural areas. NHM support is also provided for provision of a host of free services related to maternal health, child health, adolescent health, family planning, universal immunization programme, and control of Communicable and Non-Communicable diseases.  Further under NHM, Free Drugs and Free Diagnostics Service Initiatives, PM National Dialysis Programme are being implemented to provide essential medicines, diagnostics and dialysis services in public health facilities. Major expansion of facilities in Government hospitals has taken place in recent years.  21 new AIIMS have also been sanctioned.  157 Government Medical colleges have been sanctioned by upgrading district hospitals to improve healthcare facilities for poor citizens. In addition, free treatment is being provided to poor citizens by State Governments through Government hospitals using funds provided under NHM.  **
