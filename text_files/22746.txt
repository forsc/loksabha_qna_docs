ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) Yamuna River has almost no fresh water downstream of Wajirabad barrage in Delhi except monsoon season. There is a critical path of 22 km of river Yamuna in Delhi where 18 major drains discharges into River Yamuna. As per Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) report of January, 2021, estimated sewage generation in Delhi is about 3273 Million Litres per Day (MLD) (720 MGD) while installed sewage treatment capacity is about 2715 MLD (597 MGD), out of which about 2432 MLD (535 MGD) sewage is being treated in Delhi. Thus, about 941 MLD (185 MGD) of sewage is finding its ways in river through various drains. Besides, 13 Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) of 212 MLD capacity exist for 17 industrial clusters in Delhi and as per report, all these CETPs are non-compliant. Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) of river Yamuna at Palla (entry point of Delhi) is about 2.0 mg/l which falls in Class B (outdoor bathing) as per designated best use of water by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). BOD of River Yamuna in Delhi stretch increases to 4.8-40 mg/l downstream of Wajirabad barrage to Okhla which indicates that the sewage treatment capacity is not sufficient in the city.  (b)  Presently in Delhi, under Namami Gange Programme, a total of 13 projects have been taken up with a sanctioned cost of Rs.2419 crore to abate the pollution in river Yamuna. These projects are at various stages of implementation. Through these projects, a total of 1384.5 MLD (304 MGD) sewage treatment capacities will be created in Delhi.Contd…P/2//2//(c)  Directions were issued by the Ministry of Jal Shakti to Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) dated 16.8.2018 under Section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 against sub-optimal functioning of CETPs as well as reutilization of treated waste water in the State of Delhi. In addition, as reported by CPCB, directions were also issued to Delhi Jal Board (DJB) dated 19.02.2019 under the said Act against non-complying sewage treatment plants operating in Delhi.Central Monitoring Committee under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Jal Shakti has been monitoring the progress in implementation of Action Plan for the State of Delhi including sewerage projects for abatement of pollution in the river Yamuna in a time bound manner. The Committee has also directed the NCT of Delhi for completing their initiatives without any further delay.The matter of increased pollution levels in river Yamuna due to discharge of pollutants as petitioned by Delhi Jal Board (WP-Civil No.8/2021 DJB vs State of Haryana & Others) has been taken up as Suo Moto Writ Petition (Civil) ‘Remediation of Polluted Rivers’ no. 1/2021 by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India and the matter is being heard thereof.*****
