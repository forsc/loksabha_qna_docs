The Act mandates Child friendly practices in the processing of cases which includes fixed timelines for investigation and prosecution. It prescribes stringent punishment for sexual crimes against children. The POCSO Act 2012 provides for establishment of Special Courts for the purpose of ensuring speedy trial. Further, as per the Act, the evidence of the child shall be recorded within a period of thirty days of the Special Court taking cognizance of the offence and the Special Court shall complete the trial, as far as possible, within a period of one year from the date of taking cognizance of the offence.The Act was amended in 2019 to introduce more stringent  punishment  including death penalty for committing sexual crimes on children, with a view to deter the perpetrators & prevent such crimes against children. Further, Ministry of Women & Child Development notified POCSO Rules, 2020 replacing the previous POCSO Rules, 2012. POCSO Rules, 2020 include provisions for mandatory police verification of staff in schools and care homes, procedures to report child sexual abuse material (pornography), imparting age-appropriate child rights education, among other things. The POCSO Rules 2020 also  stipulate that the central government and every state government shall provide periodic training including orientation programmes, sensitization workshops and refresher courses to all persons,  whether regular or contractual, coming in contact with the children, to sensitize them about child safety and protection and educate them regarding their responsibility under the Act.
