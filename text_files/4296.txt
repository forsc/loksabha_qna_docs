ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3986 BY SHRI SUKHBIR SINGH JAUNAPURIA TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 17.07.2019 REGARDING INCREASE IN NUMBER OF SEATS UNDER TATKAL SCHEME(a) & (b): Power for earmarking of Tatkal accommodation in different classes has been delegated to Zonal Railways who decide the extent of Tatkal accommodation to be earmarked in the trains keeping in view the utilization pattern in that class during the previous financial year as well as availability of accommodation. The accommodation so earmarked, however, in no case should exceed the limit of 30% of the total accommodation in that train. All types of reservation quotas earmarked in the trains including Tatkal quota are reviewed on periodical basis and adjustments made, wherever required based on utilization. This is a continuous process. (c) & (d): There is no proposal under consideration to allow waiting list general as well as Tatkal passengers to travel in reserved coaches. However, with a view to providing confirmed accommodation to waiting list passengers and to ensure optimal utilisation of available accommodation, a scheme known as Alternate Train Accommodation (ATAS) known as “VIKALP” has been introduced to cover all types of trains on all sectors. The scheme aims at providing waiting list passengers accommodation in alternate train having vacant accommodation. For this facility, waiting list passenger has to give an option at the time of booking of ticket and passengers with waiting list status at the time of preparation of first reservation charts are shifted to other trains, subject to availability of vacant accommodation.*****
