                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                               (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a): 	No, Sir. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, however, is implementing “Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM)” to reduce poverty and vulnerability of urban poor households through its components.  Employment through Skill Training & Placement (EST&P) component intends to provide training to the urban poor as per skill demand from the market, so that they can set up self-employment ventures or secure wage employment. Self-Employment Programme (SEP) component of the Mission focuses on providing subsidized credit to individuals/groups of urban poor for setting up gainful self-employment ventures or micro-enterprises, suited to their skills, training, aptitude and local conditions. (b)	Funds under DAY-NULM are released to States/UTs in a consolidated manner, out of which appropriate amount is apportioned by States/UTs for various components, as per their requirement. A statement showing state-wise and year-wise details of funds released by Central Government and utilized by States/UTs during 2016-17 to 2018-19 under the Mission is at Annexure-I.(c)	A statement showing State/UT-wise details of beneficiaries under EST&P and SEP components of DAY-NULM, during 2016-17 to 2018-19, component-wise is at Annexure-II.                                              *****
