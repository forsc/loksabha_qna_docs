                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) & (b):	 In order to provide social security benefits to the workers in the unorganised sector, including agricultural labourers, Government enacted the Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008. This Act stipulates formulation of suitable welfare schemes for unorganised workers on matters relating to: (i) life and disability cover, (ii) health and maternity benefits, (iii) old age protection and (iv) any other benefit as may be determined by the Central Government. Life and disability cover is provided through Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) to the unorganised workers depending upon their eligibility. The health and maternity benefits are addressed through Ayushman Bharat scheme. For old age protection in the form of monthly pension, Ministry of Labour & Employment has launched Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-dhan Yojana which is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme for providing monthly minimum assured pension of Rs.3000/- on attaining the age of 60 years. The unorganised workers in the age group of 18-40 years whose monthly income is Rs.15000/- or less and not a member of EPFO/ESIC/NPS can join the scheme. Under the scheme, 50% monthly contribution is payable by the beneficiary and equal matching contribution is paid by the Central Government. On the similar lines, Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojana, a scheme meant for old age protection and social security of Small and Marginal Farmers (SMF) has also been launched through Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare. All Small and Marginal Farmers having cultivable landholding up to 2 hectares falling in the age group of 18 to 40 years, whose names appear in the land records of States/UTs as on 01.08.2019 are eligible to get benefit under the Scheme.*******
