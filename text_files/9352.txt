ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) FOR NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY, POWER and MoS for  SKILL DEVELOPMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP(SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) & (b) The details of progress made in implementation of solar energy schemes as reported by  the Government of Rajasthan are given in Annexure.(c) & (d) the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has launched Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyaan (PM-KUSUM) Scheme on 8.3.2019, which, inter alia, provides for:(A) installation of 10,000 MW capacity through renewable energy based small power plants each of capacity up to 2 MW in the rural areas;(B) installation of 17.5 lakh standalone off-grid solar water pumps; and(C) solarization of 10 lakh existing grid-connected agriculture pumps.Under Component-A, the concerned DISCOM is  eligible to get Procurement Based Incentive  (PBI) @ Rs. 0.40 per unit purchased or Rs. 6.6 lakh per MW of capacity installed, whichever is less, for a period of five years from the Date of Commissioning (COD). Under the Components-B and C of the Scheme, Central Financial Assistance of 30% of the benchmark cost or tendered cost for installation of standalone solar pump/ solarisation of existing agricultural pump, whichever is lower, is provided by MNRE and at least an equal amount is  to be contributed by the State Government. Under the Scheme, in the State of Rajasthan, 325 MW capacity has been sanctioned under Component-A, installation of 25,000 standalone solar pumps have been sanctioned under Component-B and solarisation of 12,500 agricultural pumps has been sanctioned under Component-C during the year 2019-20. District-wise allocation is open to the State. Further, the MNRE provides, under the Phase-II of the Grid Connected Roof Top (GCRT) scheme,  Central Financial Assistance (CFA) of 40% of the benchmark cost or tendered cost, whichever is lower for residential grid connected rooftop systems upto 3 kW and 20% of the benchmark cost or tendered cost whichever is lower for residential grid connected roof top systems of capacity 3 kW to 10 kW. For GCRT systems of more than 10 kW capacity  in residential sector, CFA remains limited to eligible CFA for 10 kW, since solar power for such category is cost effective compared to grid tariffs applicable for such category of consumers. The State Government of Rajasthan has informed that it has issued RfP for Work for Design, Supply, Installation, Testing, Commissioning and Maintenance Of Grid Connected SPV Power Plants Under “Rooftop Solar Power Generation Scheme” 2019-20 in Rajasthan on 25.10.2019.*****
