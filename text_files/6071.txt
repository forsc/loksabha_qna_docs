                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (e):	Health is a State subject. However, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is implementing a Scheme of Capacity Building for developing Trauma Care Facilities (TCFs) in Government Hospitals on National Highways under which financial assistance is provided to States/UTs for setting up of TCFs. Under this Scheme, during the 11th and 12th Five Year Plan (FYP), 116 and 80 TCFs were approved in different States/Union Territories (UTs) and central assistance released in part or in full. State/UT-wise details of TCFs approved during 11th FYP are at Annexure-I. Details of 80 TCFs of 12th FYP, alongwith the amount of central assistance approved and released are at Annexure-II.(b):	Evaluation Study in respect of the Trauma Programme was conducted in five states namely West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Mizoram and Punjab for Trauma which were randomly selected from each of the 5 Zones of India viz. North, South, East, West and North- East. The Study was conducted by National Institute of Health and Family Welfare, New Delhi in 2017.The following observations were made by the Evaluation Team. •	  Construction activity was either completed or was at  the verge of completion in most of the Trauma Care Facilities •	   Partial Equipments had been procured in most of the Trauma Care Centres and for rest of the centres procedure of procurement was ongoing. •	   There was a major shortfall of human resources in all the visited trauma care facilities. Delay in the recruitment of the Staff in almost all the facilities is because the process has to be routed through their State Governments.•	  All the facilities were using the services of existing ambulances of their hospitals along with 108 ambulances for shifting critical patient to the high referral trauma care facility.•	  Trauma Care Facilities were fully utilized by the patients through the existing services of Department of Orthopaedics and surgery. Signage for triage was available in the Triage area in most of the centres.•	  State Mass Media Unit had received a copy of Documentary file on “Good Samaritan and first aid on trauma care”. All the States had distributed Information, Education and Communication materials to the district media office under Chief Medical Officer and they were partially displayed in the Trauma Care Facilities.•	Overall concept of trauma care was clearly understood by all the States, and all facilities were aware of, and utilizing the Operational Guidelines issued by the Programme Division. The observations/suggestions of the Evaluation Teams have been sent to the respective State Governments for taking necessary action.(c) & (d):	Out of 116 trauma care facilities approved and funded during the 11th FYP, 105 TCFs have been reported as functional by the States (Annexure-III) and of the 12th FYP, 2 TCFs have become functional i.e Civil Hospital, Khanvel,  Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Agartala Govt. Medical College, Tripura. Health is a State subject. Deployment of manpower either on contract or regular basis in the TCFs is the administrative mandate of the respective State Government. However, considering the shortage of medical and paramedical personnel in trauma care facilities, the Central assistance provided under the scheme of Capacity Building for developing Trauma Care Facilities (TCFs) in Government Hospitals on National Highways includes financial support to the approved trauma care facilities for manpower component for a period of 3 years. Further, for capacity building of the existing manpower in the trauma care facilities, various training courses, like Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) for doctors and Basic Life Support (BLS) for nurses are also conducted. In addition, a Pre-Hospital Trauma Technician (PTT) course curriculum has also been developed for paramedics in ambulances.(e):	Reply to part (a) refers.
