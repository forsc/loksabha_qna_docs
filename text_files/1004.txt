The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit proposals at the time of bidding under RCS from time to time.;;Under RCS-UDAN version 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0, 106 airports/waterdromes (76 Unserved, 20 Underserved and 10 waterdromes) and 31 heliports have been awarded. Out of these, 39 RCS Airports (16 underserved & 23 unserved) have been revived/developed for operationalization of RCS flights. The list of these airports is at Annexure A.The list of airports/waterdromes and heliports alongwith timelines for their operationalization are at Annexure B and C.;(c) More than 20 lakhs passengers have flown on RCS flights under UDAN so far.
