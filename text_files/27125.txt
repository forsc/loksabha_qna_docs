                                                        THE MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT) (a) to (e) A statement is laid on the Table of the House.    *****   STATEMENT REFERRED IN REPLY TO PARTs (a) TO (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *243 TO BE ANSWERED ON 05.08.2021 ON “CONSTRUCTION OF DAM ACROSS MARKANDEYA RIVER” RAISED BY SHRI, A. RAJA AND DR. A. CHELLAKUMAR, M.Ps.  (a) to (e) Government of Tamil Nadu submitted a complaint dated 30.11.2019 under section 3 of the Inter-State River Water Disputes Act, 1956 (the Act), requesting the Union Government to constitute a Tribunal under section 4 of the Act for adjudication of water disputes of the inter-State river Pennaiyar, also known as Thenpennai/Ponnaiyar. In their complaint, Government of Tamil Nadu has also objected to construction of a dam across Markandeya river, a tributary of Pennaiyar river, inter alia mentioning that it would block and store the natural flows of Markandeya river and no water will flow to the downstream State of Tamil Nadu. The Detailed Project Report (DPR) of Ponnaiyar (Nedungal) - Palar intra-State link project (called as Thenpennai-Palar interlinking) was prepared by National Water Development Agency (NWDA) based on the request of Government of Tamil Nadu and circulated to party States in August 2018.  The proposal envisages diversion of waters from Nedungal anicut (located downstream of existing Krishnagiri dam across Ponnaiyar river) through a link canal to feed enroute system tanks for irrigation and for recharging the groundwater in the enroute area of the link etc.Subsequent to the complaint of Government of Tamil Nadu dated 30.11.2019, a negotiation committee under the chairmanship of Chairman, Central Water Commission (CWC) was constituted on 20.01.2020 under section 4 of the Act. Two meetings of the negotiation committee were held. The negotiation committee was of the considered view that any further negotiations by this committee would not be useful and as such, no further meeting of the committee was proposed. To proceed further on the issue, CWC, vide letters dated 16.03.2021 and 08.07.2021 requested party States i.e. Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Union Territory of Puducherry to furnish some additional information. The concerned States /UT are required to respond in the matter.*****
