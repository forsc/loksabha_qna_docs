                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	The data of number of farmers including small and marginal farmers given loan by the cooperative and regional rural banks for installing tubewells especially in backward and rural areas is not maintained.  However, loan disbursement for crop loan to farmers and especially for small and marginal farmers by the cooperative and regional rural banks for the year 2018-19 is at Annexure-I and Annexure-II.(b) to (d):	Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has introduced Banking Ombudsman Scheme, 2006 with an object of enabling resolution of complaints relating to services rendered by banks and to facilitate the satisfaction or settlement or such complaints. Though ‘irregularities in sanctioning of these loans’ is not a ground of complaints under the Banks Ombudsman Scheme, 2006, complaints pertaining to ‘delays in sanction, disbursement or non-observance of prescribed time schedule for disposal of loan applications’ and ‘non-observance of prescribed time schedule for disposal of loan applicants’ and ‘non-acceptance of application of loans without furnishing valid reasons to the applicant’ are covered under the said Scheme. The total number of complaints received under the said ground against Cooperative and Regional Rural Banks (in loan and advances excluding Housing) for the period from April, 2017 to November, 2019 is 422 out of which 400 complaints are against regional rural banks and 22 are against scheduled commercial banks.
