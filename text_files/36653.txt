ANSWER




                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT        (SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) : The details of funds allocated under the Nirbhaya Fund during the last three years are as under: Financial Year	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21Allocation(Rs.crore)	550.00	550.00	1355.23 (b) to (e) : The projects/ schemes under Nirbhaya Fund are demand driven. The projects/ schemes appraised by Empowered Committee (EC) under Framework for Nirbhaya Fund are having staggered implementation schedule. Further, some of the appraised projects are directly implemented by Central Ministries/ Departments. However, majority of the projects are implemented through State Governments/ Union Territory Administrations in which Central Government releases the funds to States/ UTs as per prescribed fund-sharing pattern of respective projects/ schemes. Thereafter, implementation on ground is done by the States/ UTs in the given timelines. Further, there are schemes, which require recurring expenditure for providing services, in respect of which, further funds are released upon receipt of Utilisation Certificates (UCs) and Statement of Expenditure (SoE) from the Implementing Agency/ authority. The UCs are required to be submitted within twelve months of the closure of financial year, in which grant was released. Hence, it is possible that more funds have been actually utilised, but Utilisation Certificates (UCs) and Statement of Expenditure (SoE), as required, as per provisions of General Financial Rules (GFR) have not been submitted by the concerned States/ Implementing Agencies (IAs). The States/ IAs are regularly followed up to submit UCs and SoEs. Various other  factors such as time taken in getting required approvals from competent authorities, procedure to be followed for award of contract, disruptions due to unforeseen reasons such as the one created by the Covid 19 etc., also affect implementation of schemes/ projects.  Under Nirbhaya Fund, so far approximately 70% of the fund released has been reported to be utilised. The State/ UT-wise details of funds released and utilized for various projects/ schemes under Nirbhaya Fund are at Annexure-I.  The details of proposals received under Nirbhaya Fund from FY 2016-17 onward are at Annexure-II.  The details of all projects/ schemes approved for implementation by (i) Central Ministries / Departments (ii) by all States / UTs and (iii) for specific States/ UTs are at Annexure-III. (f) :  An Empowered Committee (EC) of Officers constituted under the Framework for Nirbhaya Fund appraises and recommends the proposals for funding under Nirbhaya Fund and also reviews the status of implementation as also status of expenditure, of approved projects from time to time, in conjunction with the concerned Ministries/ Departments/ Implementing Agencies. Further, the concerned Ministries / Departments /IAs also monitor the progress of implementation at their levels.*****  Annexure-I Annexure referred to in reply to parts (b) & (c) of Lok Sabha Un-starred Question No. 3750 for answer on 25.03.2022 regarding ‘Budgetary allocation for Nirbhaya Fund’  The State/ UT-wise details of funds released and utilized for various projects/ schemes under Nirbhaya Fund(Rupees in Crore)Sl.
