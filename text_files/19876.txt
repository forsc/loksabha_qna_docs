ANSWER




                                                        (a) and (b)	Yes Sir. Under PMKVY 2.0 (2016-20), as on 19.01.2021, 1.07 crore candidates have been trained/oriented since 2016. The year-wise details are as follows: PMKVY 2.0 (2016-20)	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21	TotalTrained under ShortTerm Training (STT)	50,419	16,06,150	10,86,218	13,86,867	4,97,830	46,27,484Oriented underRecognition of PriorLearning (RPL)	171020	5,16,984	9,58,715	31,84,625	12,37,254	60,68,598Total	2,21,439	21,23,134	20,44,933	45,71,492	17,35,084	1,06,96,082 (c)        Under the scheme, placement opportunities are being provided to candidates certified under Short Term Training (STT). Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) does not mandate placement as it orients and certifies candidate with prior learning experience or skills. Under PMKVY (2016-20), as on 19.01.2021, 36.04 lakh candidates have been certified; out of which, 18.95 lakh candidates have been placed (2.81 lakh – self employed and 16.14 lakh – wage employed). (d)      NITI Aayog has done the quick assessment study of the scheme. Also, NITI Aayog has conducted an independent evaluation of Centrally Sponsored Schemes including PMKVY (2016-20). The report of NITI Aayog highlighted the mismatch between industry requirement and candidate expectation.   In addition, National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), an implementing agency of PMKVY (2016-20), has also engaged a third party agency, Sambodhi Research and Communications Pvt. Ltd., for the impact evaluation of Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana 2016-20. This report highlighted about 15% increase in average monthly salary under STT and 19% under RPL. Under RPL, 70% participants reported better chance of finding employment. This report also suggested for stronger role of State Skill Development Mission (SSDM) for better implementation of scheme.             Based on the above said studies and learning from the implementation of PMKVY 1.0 and 2.0, Ministry has launched the new and modified version of PMKVY i.e. PMKVY 3.0 (2020-21) on 15.01.2021 based on demand-driven and bottom-up approach. The scheme envisages greater roles of State/ SSDM. Under the scheme, informed choice / aspirations of the candidates have been given primacy and it also promotes candidates to opt for local skills with local jobs.
