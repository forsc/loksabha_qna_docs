The Act also provides for hours and limitation of employment regulating the working hours of workers employed in the plantations in the tea estates. The PL Act is implemented through the concerned State Governments. The workers of the tea industry are also covered by various industrial and social security legislations like Employees’ Compensation Act, 1923,  Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, Provident Funds & Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, (Assam Tea Plantation Provident Fund, Pension Fund and Deposit Link Insurance Fund Scheme Act 1955 – only for Assam), Payment of Bonus Act, 1965, Maternity Benefit Act, 1961, Payment of Wages Act, 1936, Equal Remuneration Act, 1976, Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, the Factories Act and Industrial Employment (Standing Order) Act, 1946.The Tea Board also supports and extends various welfare measures for the welfare of tea workers and their wards/dependants. The labour welfare measures are undertaken under the overall “Tea Development & Promotion Scheme’’. This aims at achieving improvements in the  life and living conditions of the Tea Plantation workers and their dependents under  the three broad areas viz. (i)	Improving the health and hygiene of workers and their dependants; (ii)	Education of wards of workers (iii)	Training to the wards/dependants on workers. The Tea Board has disbursed Rs. 3.07 crores for Assam tea gardens under this Scheme for the benefit of the workers and their wards/dependents from 2017-18 to 30.11.2021.(c) to (f):	The fixation of minimum wages for tea garden workers falls under the purview of State Governments which are the appropriate Government to fix/revise the minimum wages as per the provisions under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948.

In case of Assam, the negotiations are concluded at a Bi-partite level and thereafter the agreement is sent to the State Government. The same is examined by the State Government and notified thereafter.*******
