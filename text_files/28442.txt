                                                        (a)      As per the information received from M/o Health & Family Welfare, as on 25th November 2021, a total of 1,00,68,104 people (73.5% coverage of estimated adult population) have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine in 14 tribal districts of Odisha.(b) & (c)          Certain myths/misinformation have been reported regarding COVID-19 vaccination drive which have been promptly addressed by the Central Government.In order to raise awareness about safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines to address vaccine hesitancy and sustain vaccine confidence, a communication strategy is in place which is being implemented across all States/UTs including Odisha. Some key interventions as part of communication strategy include FAQs for general public and healthcare & frontline workers which have been developed & uploaded on Ministry of Health and Family Welfare  website (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/FAQsforHCWs&FLWs.pdf); media channels, radio jockeys, producers etc. have been oriented on correct information regarding COVID-19 vaccination; op-eds and articles by identified experts published to build vaccine confidence; dissemination of fact check videos by key experts to provide correct & factual information. Central Government has advised States/Union Territories to disseminate clear, consistent, transparent and factual information to general public to clear misconceptions and sustain vaccine confidence.(d)       The National COVID-19 Vaccination Program is going on across the country since 16th January 2021 where all adult citizens irrespective of their income status are entitled to free vaccination at government Covid Vaccination Centres (CVCs). All efforts have been made to ensure vaccination of beneficiaries, including tribal communities, some of which include registration through Common Service Centres, walk-in registration at COVID-19 vaccination centre, Near to Home Covid Vaccination Centres (NHCVC) for elderly & people with disabilities and Har Ghar Dastak vaccination campaign to identify and vaccinate missed beneficiaries for 1st dose and due beneficiaries for 2nd dose.(e)        The National COVID-19 Vaccination Program expects that eligible beneficiaries aged 18 years and above will be vaccinated by December 2021. *****
