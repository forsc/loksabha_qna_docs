                                                        (a) to (e): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. ******  *84. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. +*84 for 03.12.2021 ASKED BY SHRI KANAKMAL KATARA & SHRI CHIRAG KUMAR PASWAN REGARDING ‘CRIME AGAINST WOMEN’ (a) to (e): The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) publishes the data on crime against women which is available for the year upto 2020. The data published by NCRB shows a declining trend in the crime against women which was 3,71,503 in the year 2020, as against 4,05,326 in the year 2019.     For the first time, almost on all indicators related to marital and natal violence such as dowry death (S. 304B Indian Penal Code), cruelty by husband or his relatives (S. 498A Indian Penal Code), dowry harassment (the Dowry Prohibition Act), domestic violence (Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act) are on decrease as indicated in the following table:Marital Offences	2019	2020Cruelty by Husband or His Relatives (S. 498A)	1,24,934	1,11,549Dowry Harassment (under the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961)	13,307	10,366Dowry Death (S. 304B IPC)	7,141	6,966Domestic Violence (under The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005)	553	446 ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and the responsibility to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens including investigation and prosecution of crime against women rests primarily with the respective State Governments.The Constitution of India guarantees the right to equality and also provides for positive interventions by the State to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women and to ensure their holistic empowerment. Keeping in mind the vision articulated in Constitutional provisions, there has been enactment of various legislations such as the Indian Penal Code, 1860, the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 and the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006  which addresses the issue of gender inequality, discrimination and violence faced by women. In addition, Government of India has introduced various schemes and projects including One Stop Centres (OSCs) for violence affected women, Women Helplines (WHL) running on tollfree telephonic short code 181, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP), Swadhar Grehs for women facing difficult circumstances or destitution, Emergency Response Support System (ERSS) which is a pan-India single number (112)/ mobile app based system for emergency response, safe city projects in 8 cities (Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow and Mumbai), training and skill development programs for Investigation Officers, Prosecution Officers and Medical Officers, setting up/ strengthening of Women Help Desks (WHDs) at Police Stations etc to ensure safety of women across the country. Further, the National Commission for Women (NCW), in addition to handling complaints through regular mode, helps women in distress through a dedicated WhatsApp Number at 72177 35372 for reporting domestic violence cases. NCW also takes cognizance of the grievances relating to domestic violence reported in social media. The complaints received by NCW are acted upon by coordinating with victims, police and other authorities to provide immediate assistance.These measures have resulted in positive outcomes such as reduction in the percentage of women aged 18 to 49 years who have ever experienced spousal violence from 31.2% as per National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-4 (2015-16) to 29.3% in NFHS-5 (2019-20), increase in the sex ratio of total population (females per 1000 males) from 991 as per NFHS-4 to 1,020 as per NFHS-5, and extension of support to more than 4.5 lakh violence affected women through 704 One Stop Centres operationalized across the country.  *****
