The Ministry of AYUSH strives to promote these systems and to create awareness among the people. For this purpose an Information Education and Communication (IEC) Scheme, has been devised by the Ministry, activities under which include steps to reach out to people and to create awareness about Naturopathy and Ayurveda. IEC activities include programs on TV, Radio, Print-media etc.Also, Ministry of AYUSH through Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National AYUSH Mission (NAM) provides grant-in-aid to State Government in accordance with their State Annual Action Plan (SAAP) for AYUSH Wellness Centres including Naturopathy and Ayurveda. Further, to mark 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, 150 Naturopathy camps are being organised across the country from 2nd October, 2019 to 2nd October, 2020.Since Public Health is a State subject, initiating various steps for awareness about Naturopathy and Ayurveda in their respective domains also fall under the purview of the respective State/ UT governments. (c) to (e):     No study has been conducted by the Ministry in this regard specifically in Deoria and Balia districts of Uttar Pradesh. Also, there is no proposal presently with this Ministry to set up research centre or laboratory in Deoria and Balia.…………………
