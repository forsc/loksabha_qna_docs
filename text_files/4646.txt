ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) and (b): Govt. of india had granted ''in-principle'' approval to Govt. of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) for construction of new greenfeild airport at Orvakal in Kurnool district, Andhra pradesh. GoAP itself constructed the airport and the trial landing was completed in January, 2019. However, no schedule domestic airline has filed their plan to Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) for operating to/from Orvakal Airport. ;(c): With repeal of Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation has been totally deregulated. Airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type, free to select whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate. In this regard, Government has laid down route dispersal guidelines with a view to achieve better regulation of air transport services of different regions of the country. It is, however, up to airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability. As such, the airlines are free to operate anywhere in the country subject to compliance of route dispersal guidelines issued by Government.;
