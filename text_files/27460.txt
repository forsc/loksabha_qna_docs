                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FORMINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYAND EARTH SCIENCES(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a)-(b) India Meteorological Department (IMD) runs an operational Agrometeorological Advisory Service (AAS) viz., Gramin Krishi Mausam Sewa (GKMS) scheme for the benefit of farming community in the country. Under the scheme, medium range weather forecast at district level is generated and based on the forecast, Agromet Advisories are being prepared and communicated by the 130 Agromet Field Units (AMFUs) located at State Agricultural Universities, institutes of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) etc. (State/UT, location-wise details of AMFUs given in Annexure I), to the farmers on every Tuesday and Friday to take decision on day-to-day agricultural operations. AAS rendered by IMD is a step towards weather-based crop and livestock management strategies and operations dedicated to enhancing crop production and food security besides reducing crop damage and loss due to unusual weather.IMD is also running block level AAS in collaboration with Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in the country. District Agromet Units (DAMUs) have been established in the Krishi Vikas Kendra (KVKs) under ICAR network (Annexure II). Implementation of block level AAS would address the micro-level variation in weather and climate and hence, more number of farmers will be benefitted.State-of-art weather forecast models is used for generating 5-day medium range weather forecast at block and district levels. Monsoon Mission Coupled Forecast System version 2 (MMCFSv2) model is used for generating extended range weather forecast for taking strategic decisions in agriculture. These weather forecasts are shared with the AMFUs and DAMUs to generate suitable block and district level agromet advisories under GKMS scheme and communicate to the farming community.(c)   	Agromet advisories are communicated to the farmers through multichannel dissemination system like print and electronic media, Door Darshan, radio, internet etc. including SMS using mobile phones through Kisan Portal launched by Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare and also through private companies under Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. At present, 43.37 million farmers in the country receive the Agromet advisories through SMS directly.IMD is taking continuous efforts to popularize the service among the farming community by organising Farmers’ Awareness Programmes (FAPs) in collaboration with AMFUs and DAMUs in various parts of the country. IMD along with the experts from AMFUs and DAMUs also participate in KisanMelas, Farmers’ Day etc. to create awareness about the services, so that more farmers get benefitted.A mobile App named ‘Meghdoot’ has been launched by Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India to help the farmers to get the weather information and related agromet advisories specific to their districts.
