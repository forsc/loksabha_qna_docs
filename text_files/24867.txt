                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (d): Insurance Scheme for Health Care Workers Fighting COVID-19’ was launched on 30.03.2020 (old scheme) to provide comprehensive personal accident cover of Rs. 50 Lakh to 22.12 lakh health care providers including community health workers and private health workers who may have been in direct contact and care of COVID-19 patients and may be at risk of being impacted by this.To further expedite the processing of claims, the claim processing has been streamlined and simplified w.e.f. 28.05.2021 (new scheme) by circulating a proforma certificate in which the concerned District Collectors are to certify eligibility of the claims. The claims are now being verified and certified by the District Collectors and forwarded to the insurance company for release of payments to the claimants so as to expedite the claim settlement.  The State/UT wise position in respect of the claims received under the old and new schemes is at Annexure I and II.  Government of India has introduced a new category called ‘Wards of COVID Warriors’ in the guidelines for selection and nomination of candidates against Central pool MBBS seats for the academic year 2020-21. Five Central pool MBBS seats were reserved for this category for the academic year 2020-21. MBBS seats were allocated for Central pool MBBS seats for candidates from amongst the wards of “COVID Warriors”, who have lost life due to COVID 19; or died accidently on account of COVID 19 related duty.In addition, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has advised States/UTs to undertake various initiatives to recognize services rendered by healthcare workers engaged in COVID-19 related duties. Some of these include:•	All such professionals who sign up for minimum 100 days of Covid duty and complete it successfully will be given the Prime Minister’s Distinguished Covid National Service Samman from Government of India.•	State/UT Governments to consider giving preference in regular Government appointments of Health professionals through the respective Public Service Commission/ other recruitment bodies, for those Health Professionals under this special scheme, who complete a minimum of 100 days of Covid related duty.•	States/UTs may also consider giving suitable honorarium for distinguished Covid Service as per NHM norms.Further, realizing the criticality of human resources at the time of pandemic, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has taken a number of steps to improve wellbeing of healthcare workers. Few of the actions taken in this regard include:•	With the launch of COVID-19 vaccination initiative on 16th January 2021, Healthcare workers were identified as one of the first priority group. State Governments/ UT administrations have been repeatedly urged to ensure that the medical professionals engaged in Covid related work are suitably vaccinated.•	Ministry of Health and Family Welfare provided guidelines on Infection Prevention and Control practices to the State Governments to minimize the risk of infection to healthcare workers. •	For high-risk exposures, healthcare workers are being provided with a quarantine period initially for one week and thereafter taking the profile of the health worker a decision to be taken for further period of one week. An advisory to this effect for managing health care workers working in COVID and Non-COVID areas of the hospital was issued by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on 18th June 2020.
