PAARIVENDHAR AND SHRI THIRUMAAVALAVAN THOL REGARDING NATIONAL RECRUITMENT AGENCYAt present, candidates seeking government jobs have to appear for separate Tier-I examinations conducted by multiple recruiting agencies for various posts. Candidates have to pay fee to multiple recruiting agencies for appearing in Tier-I/first stage of Computer Based Test. Every year, approximately 2.5 crore candidates appear in multiple recruitment examinations for approximately 1.25 lakh vacancies. Candidates have to pay fee to multiple recruiting agencies for appearing in Tier-I/first stage of Computer Based Test and have to travel long distances to appear in such examinations. These multiple recruitment examinations are a burden on the candidates, as also on the respective recruitment agencies, involving avoidable/repetitive expenditure, law and order/security related issues and venue related problems.2.	Government has set up the National Recruitment Agency (NRA), vide order dated 28.08.2020, to conduct first level screening of candidates through a Common Eligibility Test (CET) at the Graduate, the Higher Secondary and the Matriculate levels for the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), the Railway Recruitment Boards (RRBs) and the Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS). Based on the screening of candidates done at the CET, final selection shall be made through specialized tests/examinations to be conducted by the respective recruitment agencies. The score obtained by candidates in the CET may also be used by the State Governments, the public sector and the private sector in their recruitments, based on a Memorandum of Understanding entered into with NRA. NRA is expected to conduct the first CET in 2021 itself.3.	NRA is an independent, professional and specialist agency registered as a Society under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 on 24.12.2020. The mandate of NRA is to conduct first level screening of candidates for recruitment to Group ‘B’ Non-Gazetted posts, Group ‘B’ Gazetted posts, which are exempted from consultation with UPSC, and Group ‘C’ posts for which recruitment is made by SSC, RRBs and IBPS.4.	NRA envisages to conduct CET with at least one examination centre in each District, affording an opportunity to a candidate to appear in exam in his District/State.*****
