ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ?????? (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d) :  Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) provides comprehensive risk insurance against non-preventable natural calamities from pre-sowing to post-harvest  crop losses.   Under PMFBY, coverage and settlement of claims is made on the basis of shortfall in Actual Yield as compared to the Threshold yield.  Actual Yield is arrived at on the basis of yield data based on requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) in a defined Insurance Units (IUs) and submitted by the concerned State Government.  Threshold Yield for a crop in a notified insurance unit is the average yield of best 5 years out of past seven years multiplied by applicable indemnity level for that crop.   Farmers are indemnified to the extent/percentage of crop losses against the defined Threshold Yield multiplied by sum insured as notified by the State Government.    Therefore, claims experience of each implementing State/UT is dependent on the shortfall in the yield due to natural calamities which occur in the notified unit area and may differ from State to State and even from one insurance unit area to another insurance unit area.State-wise details of insurance payouts/claims paid and the farmer applications benefitted i.e. to whom claims paid from 2017-18 to 2019-20 under the scheme are Annexed. Operational Guidelines (OGs) for PMFBY envisage use of technology to ensure timely settlement of farmers claims.  Therefore, different pilot studies with different approaches like use of Remote Sensing Technology (RST) including satellite data, drones based images etc., especially for Crop Cutting Experiment (CCE) planning, direct yield estimation at Gram Panchayat level, risk mapping of districts and for dispute/area discrepancy resolution etc. have been initiated through Mahalanobis National Crop Forecasting Centre (MNCFC) for leverage of technology for implementation of PMFBY.   The suitable technology based on the accuracy/standardization of results obtained through these pilot studies may be adopted at national level.
