                                                        (a) to (e) The Government has adopted a holistic approach for providing livelihood opportunities to tribal population, including tribal women through various schemes of Central Ministries as at Annexure 1. National Rural Livelihood Mission administered by Ministry of Rural Development aims at mobilizing all rural poor household into self help group, build institutions of poor by federating them at villages / cluster / Block level, provide long term support to attain appreciable increase in incomes through credit linkages and multiple livelihood options. Women SHGs under DAY-NRLM consist of 10-20 persons. At least one woman member from each identified rural poor household, is to be brought under the Self Help Group (SHG) network. The State wise details of tribal SHGs created so far are at Annexure 2. Ministry of Tribal Affairs strives to achieve inclusive and sustainable growth of tribal population in the country. The Centrally Sponsored Schemes/Grants administered by the Ministry which, inter-alia, supports livelihood and employment generation for tribal population are under:1        Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS)2         Grant-in-aid under Article 275(1) of the Constitution3.        Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)  State-wise details of beneficiaries (including Odisha) under these schemes are not centrally maintained in the Ministry. However, Ministry of Tribal Affairs has recently developed an online portal (https://grants.tribal.gov.in/adigram) to capture physical and financial progress including beneficiary details under various schemes being administered. Besides, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, through TRIFED and NSTFDC, is implementing the following programmes/Schemes which specifically cater to livelihood / income generation needs of the tribal population:1.

Under this programme, it is envisaged to set-up tribal community owned Minor Forest Produce centric multi-purpose Kendras in predominantly tribal districts. The Kendras would act as common facility centres for procurement cum value addition to locally available Minor Forest Produce. Value addition of raw produce is expected to increase the value of the MFP considerably and consequently the income of the gatherers.The National Scheduled Tribes Finance and Development Corporation (NSTFDC), under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, is implementing an exclusive scheme titled “Adivasi MahilaSashaktikaran Yojana (AMSY)” for economic development of Scheduled Tribes Women. Under the scheme, NSTFDC provides loan upto 90% for projects costing upto ?2.00 lakh. Financial assistance under the scheme is extended at highly concessional rate of interest of 4% per annum.
