ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a)  to (c) :	It is the primary responsibility of the State Governments to set up Courts and to provide Judicial Infrastructure / Court Rooms for District / Subordinate Courts.  The Union Government has been implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) for Development of Infrastructure Facilities for Judiciary by providing financial assistance to State Governments / UTs in the prescribed fund sharing pattern between Centre and States.  The Scheme is being implemented since 1993-94.  It covers the construction of court halls and court complexes and residential accommodations for Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Judiciary.  Till 10.03.2021, Rs. 8295crore have been released since the inception of the Scheme in 1993-94.  Out of this, Rs. 286.62  crore has been released to the State Government of Rajasthan. 1250 court halls have been made available for Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Courts under this scheme as on 28.02.2021. In addition, 217 court halls are under construction.  The year-wise funds released to the State Government of Rajasthan under the Scheme is at Annexure.As per information received from State Government of Rajasthan,there is no such proposal to set up courts in Bansara-Dungarpur in Rajasthan.(d): Disposal of cases in courts is within the domain of the judiciary. Timely disposal of cases in courts depends on several factors which, inter-alia, include availability of adequate number of judges, supporting court staff and physical infrastructure, complexity of facts involved, nature of evidence, co-operation of stake holders viz. bar, investigation agencies, witnesses and litigants and proper application of rules and procedures. Government has no role in disposal of cases in courts. No time frame has been prescribed for disposal of various kinds of cases by the respective courts.The Government is, however, fully committed to speedy disposal of cases. The Government has taken several initiatives to provide an ecosystem for faster disposal of cases by the judiciary.  The National Mission for Justice Delivery and Legal Reforms established by the Government has adopted a coordinated approach for phased liquidation of arrears and pendency in judicial administration through various strategic initiatives, including improving infrastructure for courts, leveraging Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for better justice delivery, and filling up of vacant positions of Judges in High Courts and Supreme Court.  The major steps taken during the last six years in the country including Rajasthan under various initiatives are as follows:(i)	Improving infrastructure for Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Courts: As on date, Rs. 8,295crores have been released since the inception of the Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) for Development of Infrastructure Facilities for Judiciary in 1993-94.

In addition, 2,463 court halls and 1,861 residential units are under construction. As far as the State of Rajasthan is concerned, 1250 court halls and 1016 residential units are available in the State as on 28.02.2021. In addition, 217 court halls and 146 residential units are under construction.  (ii)	Leveraging Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for improved justice delivery: Government has been implementing the e-Courts Mission Mode Project throughout the country for Information and Communication Technology enablement of district and subordinate courts.

New and user-friendly version of Case Information Software has been developed and deployed at all the computerized District and Subordinate Courts.  All stakeholders including Judicial Officers can access information relating to judicial proceedings/decisions of computerized District & Subordinate Courts and High Courts on the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG). As on 03.03.2021, litigants can access case status of over 18.28 crore cases and 13.88 crore order/judgements pertaining to these courts.eCourts services such as details of case registration, cause list, case status, daily orders & final judgments are available to litigants and advocates through eCourts web portal, Judicial Service Centres (JSC) in all computerized courts, eCourts Mobile App, email service, SMS push & pull services. Video Conferencing facility has been enabled between 3240 court complexes and 1272 corresponding jails. With a view to handle the COVID- 19 challenges better and to make the transition to virtual hearings smoother, funds have been provided for setting up 235 e-SewaKendras at court complexes to facilitate lawyers and litigants needing assistance ranging from case status, getting judgements/orders,  court/case related information and efiling facilities. Nine Virtual Courts have been set up at Delhi (2 courts), Faridabad (Haryana), Pune & Nagpur (Maharashtra) Kochi (Kerala), Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Guwahati (Assam) and Bengaluru (Karnataka) to try traffic offences. As on 20.01.2021, these courts have handled 41,98,095 cases and realised Rs.139.25cr in fines. In the State of Rajasthan, 1240 courts housed in 247 court complexes have been computerized under eCourts Project Phase-II. So far in Phase-II, an amount of Rs. 67.80 crore has been released to the High Court of Rajasthan. Currently, litigants of Rajasthan can access online case status information through NJDG in respect of over 73.97 lakh pending and decided cases and more than 8.57 lakh orders/judgements of district & subordinate courts of the State.
