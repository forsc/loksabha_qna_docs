ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a): 	The Central Government fixes the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane.  FRP is directly paid by sugar mills to sugarcane farmers on purchase of sugarcane.  However, with a view to improve liquidity position of sugar mills thereby enabling them to clear cane price dues of farmers for sugar season 2019-20, the Government has taken following measures: (i)	Created buffer stock of 40 LMT of sugar for a period of one year from 01.8.2019 to 31.7.2020 for which Government would be reimbursing carrying cost of about Rs.1674 crore towards maintenance of buffer stock.………..2/--2-(ii)	Extending assistance to sugar mills @ Rs. 10448/ MT to facilitate export of 60 LMT of sugar from the country in sugar season 2019-20, for which an estimated expenditure of Rs 6268 crore would be borne by the Government. (iii)	The Government has also allowed production of ethanol from sugar and sugar syrup; and has fixed the remunerative ex-mill price of ethanol derived from C-heavy molasses, B-heavy molasses and sugarcane juice/ sugar/ sugar syrup. (b) to (d):  	With a view to facilitate export of excess sugar from the country during the sugar season 2019-20, the Government has allocated mill-wise Maximum Admissible Export Quantity of sugar for export. To encourage export of sugar, the Government is extending assistance to sugar mills to facilitate export of sugar, as enumerated in para (ii) of part (a) of reply. The assistance would be credited directly into the accounts of farmers on behalf of sugar mills against their cane dues and the balance, if any, would be credited into the mills’ account.   However, there is no proposal to provide subsidy for sugar export directly to sugarcane farmers.****
