                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) and (b):  In the first round of bidding under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik), Airports Authority of India (AAI), the Implementing Agency, has awarded 29 proposals connecting 44 RCS Airports. Out of them, so far, 21 number of proposals are operationalized involving 33 airports. One airport namely Mithapur, a private airport, is still to be operationalized, as the same is yet to be taken over by the Government of Gujarat. Eight (8) number of proposals  involving 10 airports have been cancelled.  AAI, which is the Implementing Agency, has cancelled the remaining awarded routes of first round, due to non-compliance of Selected Airline Operator (SAO) agreement by the SAOs.
