The Ministry is implementing Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM), in order to reduce poverty and vulnerability of the urban poor households by enabling them to access self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities through training, formation of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and their federations, providing shelters equipped with essential services to the urban homeless and addressing livelihoods concerns of the urban street vendors.	Further, the Ministry is implementing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) [PMAY(U)] to provide all weather pucca houses to all eligible families/ beneficiaries primarily in the Economically Weaker Section in urban areas. (c):	Housing sector contributes significantly in the country’s Gross Domestic Product with direct impact on employment generation. The study titled “Impact of Investments in the Housing Sector on GDP and Employment in the Indian Economy” undertaken by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) in 2014 indicates that every additional rupee of capital invested in the housing sector adds Rs. 1.54 to the GDP. Every Rs 1 lakh investment in residential housing creates 2.69 new jobs in the economy. Further, as per study conducted by National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (2019) every investment of Rs. 1 lakh in housing sector creates direct employment of 54 person days and indirect employment of 108 person days.The total investment approved under PMAY (U), so far, is Rs. 6.16 lakh crore with committed Central Assistance of Rs. 1.65 lakh crore.                                       *****
