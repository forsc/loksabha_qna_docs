                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (d)	Ministry has not received any report indicating that blackbucks, sparrow, honey-bee are vanishing from the environment. Such wild animals which require protection owing to their ecological status including their relative abundance in nature are notified under the relevant schedule of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 so as to provide them the corresponding degree of protection. 	The following important steps have been taken to further conserve wildlife including  precious animals and birds: i.	Protected Areas, viz., National Parks, Sanctuaries, Conservation Reserves and Community Reserves covering important wildlife habitats have been notified all over the country under the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 to conserve wild animals, birds and their habitats. In order to further strengthen conservation of wildlife, eco-sensitive zones (ESZs) are also notified around National Parks and Sanctuaries.  ii.	The Ministry extends financial assistance to State Government/Union Territory Administration  under various Centrally Sponsored schemes(CSS) such as Development of Wildlife Habitats (DWH),  Project Tiger and Project Elephant, for providing better protection to wildlife including rare species of animals/birds and improvement of their habitat:- (a)	One of the major components of CSS-DWH is Recovery programme for critically endangered species and its habitats. This component is for affecting the recovery of critically endangered species in the country. 21 species have been identified under this component so far. (b)	Concerned at the primary need to restore the elephant habitats and reduce suffering of both elephant as well as the human population, the Government of India launched “Project Elephant” in 1991-92 as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme of the Ministry of Environment and Forests. It is intended to provide financial and technical support to the elephant range states of India for the protection of elephants, their habitats and corridors and address issue of human- animal conflict. It also promotes welfare of captive elephants. (c)	The Government of India has taken a pioneering initiative for conserving its national animal, the tiger, by launching the ‘Project Tiger’ in 1973.Project Tiger is an ongoing Centrally Sponsored Scheme of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change providing central assistance to the tiger States for tiger conservation in designated tiger reserves. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) is a statutory body of the Ministry, with an overarching supervisory / coordination role, performing functions as provided in the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.iii.	The Central Zoo Authority (CZA) has provided the financial assistance for carrying forward the ex-situ Conservation Breeding Programme of various species at identified zoos. The CZA has identified 73 endangered wild animal species for planned conservation breeding. The Conservation Breeding Programme has been launched for 23 species in identified zoos so far. iv.	 The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 provides for punishment for violation of its provisions. The Act also provides for forfeiture of any equipment, vehicle or weapon that is used for committing wildlife offence(s).v.	 Local communities in and around protected areas are also involved conservation measures for which incentive measures are provided under approved eco-development activities. ****
