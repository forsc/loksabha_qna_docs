ANSWER




ANSWER MINISITER OF CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS (SHRI D. V. SADANANDA GOWDA)  (a):      Six Plastic Parks in different States  are at various stages of implementation i.e. Assam (1), Madhya Pradesh (2), Odisha (1), Jharkhand (1) and Tamil Nadu (1) . One Plastic Park has recently been approved in Uttarakhand. The Plastic Park in Haryana was given “in-principle” approval in 2016, but the same was withdrawn in 2020 because of the lack of interest shown by the State Government of Haryana. (b):   Yes Sir. The Department had invited proposals from various States/UTs for setting up Plastic Park in their region and a total of five proposals have been  received from four States namely Uttar Pradesh (02 proposals), Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and Bihar. There was no proposal from Haryana. After due evaluation of the preliminary proposals the Department has decided to accord “in-principle” approval to the  proposals received from Govt. of Uttar Pradesh for setting up a Plastic Park at Gorakhpur and from Govt. of Karnataka for setting up a Plastic Park at Ganjimutt, Karnataka. (c) & (d):      No Sir, because Haryana has not submitted any proposal.  	*****
