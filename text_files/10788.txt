The published reports are available till the year 2017. Details of State/UT-wise number of acid attacks registered in the past three years is at Annexure.(b)  & (c)   ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibilities to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens rest with the respective State Governments. The State Governments are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provisions of laws. However, the Ministry of Home Affairs has issued a comprehensive Advisory on 20thApril 2015 on taking steps to implement the provisions of IPC, expediting cases of Acid Attack, and to provide treatment and compensation to victims. This advisory is available on www.mha.gov.in. The Ministry of Home Affairs has also circulated the Model Poison Rules on 30.8.2013 to all States/UTs for notifying the same to regulate the sale of acid in respective State/UT.As per Section 166B of IPC (read with Section 357C of Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.

Section 357C of Cr. P.C. also provides that free treatment is to be provided to the acid attack victims. Section 357A of Cr. P.C. provides that compensation under Victim Compensation Scheme is to be paid to the victims. Section 357B of Cr. P.C. further provides that compensation payable under section 357A shall be in addition to the payment of fine to victim. Further, all the State/Union Territories have notified victim compensation scheme in their respective State/UT. Under the Central Victim Compensation Fund (CVCF) scheme, financial assistance of Rs.200.00 Crores as one time grant has been released to all the States/UTs in 2016-17, funded from Nirbhaya Fund, to support their respective State Victim Compensation Scheme. On the direction of Hon’ble Supreme Court,   National Legal Service Authority (NALSA) prepared a “Sub-Scheme” namely“Compensation Scheme for Women Victims/Survivors of Sexual Assault/other   Crimes – 2018” to be included within the existing Victim Compensation Scheme for   women victims of sexual assault and other crimes, which also includes cases of acid attacks.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court directed the Government of India as well as all State Governments and the Administrations of the Union Territories to give wide publicity to the Scheme and to implement the Scheme in letter and spirit. The same was forwarded to all   States/UTs for implementation and to give wide publicity.(d)	The Government of India is implementing One Stop Centre (OSC) and ''Universalisation of Women   Helpline (WHL) schemes.  OSC aims to facilitate women affected by   violence with a range of integrated services under one roof such as Police   facilitation, medical aid, providing legal aid and legal counselling, psycho-social counselling, temporary shelter etc.''Universalisation of Women Helpline scheme'' through the short code 181 provides 24 hours emergency and non-emergency response to women affected by violence, both in public and private spaces by linking them with appropriate authority such as Police, One Stop Centre, Hospital, Legal Services etc. WHL also supports women in   distress with rescue van and counselling services in addition to providing   information about women welfare schemes and programs across the country.
