The Government is committed to address the issues of labour work force in India, protect and safeguard the interest of the workers with due regard to create a healthy work environment for higher production and productivity.

Such workforce also keeps shifting from one sector to another depending upon the opportunities (such as better wages, duration and continuity of work). In order to safeguard the interest of the migrant workers, the Central Government had enacted the Inter-State    Migrant   Workmen   (Regulation of   Employment  andContd..2/-:: 2 ::Conditions of Services) Act, 1979 which, inter alia, provides for payment of minimum wages, journey allowance, displacement allowance, residential accommodation, medical facilities and protective clothing. However, the   Inter-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Services) Act, 1979 has now been subsumed in the Code on Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions, 2020.(c):	 The Government has notified four Labour Codes, namely the Code on Wages, 2019; the Industrial Relation Code 2020; the Code on Social Security 2020 and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code 2020 after simplification, amalgamation and rationalization of 29 Central labour Laws, with an objective to strengthen the protection available to workers, including unorganised workers, in terms of statutory minimum wage, social security protection and healthcare of workers.(d):	 Recruitment to fill up the vacancies in Public Sector Undertaking is an on going process and is done in accordance with the relevant Recruitment Rules and guidelines issued by particular PSUs from time to time.*******
