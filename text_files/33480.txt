                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI GIRIRAJ SINGH)(a) to (c):   A statement is laid on the Table of the House.  STATEMENT IN REPLY TO PART (a) to (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *82 TO BE ANSWERED ON 08.02.2022 REGARDING BENEFICIARIES UNDER PMAY-G (a) to (c) In order to achieve the target of “Housing for All” in rural areas, the Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) with effect from 1st April, 2016 to provide assistance to eligible rural households with overall target to construct 2.95 crore pucca houses with basic amenities by March, 2024. The identification of beneficiaries under PMAY-G is based on the housing deprivation parameters and exclusion criteria prescribed under Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC)-2011 and due verification by the respective Gram Sabhas and completion of an Appellate Process. The target of 2.95 crore was arrived at on that basis.  The Government conducted Awaas+ survey during January 2018 to March 2019 to identify those beneficiaries which claimed to have been left out under the 2011 SECC and thus prepared an additional list of potential beneficiaries with a ceiling of 2.95 crore houses. The data of beneficiaries captured through Awaas+ is being utilized to fill the gap between overall target of 2.95 crore and eligible beneficiaries made available from PWL (approx.2.15 Crore). Based on the recommendation of Expert Committees, constituted for analysis of Awaas+ data, a target of 51 lakh houses has already been allocated to eligible States/ UTs during financial year 2020-21 & 2021-22.   Out of the total target of 2.95 crore houses, a target of 2.62 crore (88.81% of total) houses has been allocated to the States/ UTs, 2.18 crore (73.90% of total) beneficiaries have been sanctioned houses by the States/UTs, 1.71 crore houses have been completed as on 02.02.2022.  The Ministry is taking major steps such as timely allocation of targets to States/ UTs, Follow up with States on providing land to landless beneficiaries, micro monitoring of house sanction and completion using IT tools, timely release of funds to States, etc. for Completion of targeted houses by 2024.   *******
