ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) & (b) : 	No, Sir. The coal stock available with the power plants monitored on daily basis in Central Electricity Authority (CEA) was 28.9 Million Tonnes (MT) as on 31.03.2021, which increased to 31.1 MT as on 16th June, 2021. However, with increased demand and some interruption in supply of coal by coal companies mainly due to heavy rains, the coal stock at the power plants depleted to 7.2 MT as on 8th October, 2021. Subsequently, with the concerted efforts of Ministry of Power (MoP), Ministry of Coal (MoC), CEA, Coal India Limited (CIL) & Railways, the coal stock has started increasing and as on 10.03.2022, has reached about 26.6 MT which is sufficient to run these power plants for an average of 10 days at 85% PLF. The receipt and consumption of coal at the power plants in the country during last three years and current year are as under:       (Figs in MT)Year	Domestic Coal Receipt	Imported Coal Receipt	Total Coal Receipt	Total Consumption2018-19	582.1	61.7	643.7	628.92019-20	569.5	69.2	638.7	622.22020-21	550.8	45.5	596.3	615.42021-22(Apr 21-Feb 22)	605.1	24.2	629.3	631.5It can be seen that during last three years and current year (Apr-Feb’22), the receipt of coal was sufficient to meet the consumption except during 2020-21, wherein due to Covid-19 pandemic, power plants had requisitioned less coal and utilized the coal stock available with them.(c) : 		The Government has taken the following measures to increase the coal supply to power plants:(i)	To address the issues of coal supplies to power sector, an Inter-Ministerial Sub Group comprising of representatives from Ministries of Power, Coal, Railways, CEA, CIL and Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) meet regularly to take various operational decisions to enhance supply of coal to thermal power plants as well as for meeting any contingent situations relating to Power Sector including to alleviate critical coal stock position in power plants.(ii)	Ministry of Power has constituted a Core Management Team (CMT) on 28.8.2021 with members from MoP, Railways, CEA, CIL, National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) and Power System Operation Corporation Limited (POSOCO) to ensure close monitoring of coal stocks at thermal power plants (TPPs) and operational decisions are being taken in CMT to augment supply of sufficient quantity of coal to the TPPs.(iii)	Recently, an Inter-Ministerial Committee comprising of Secretary (Coal), Secretary (Power), Secretary (Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF & CC)) and Chairman, Railway Board has been set up to review the situation on fortnightly basis to ensure adequate supply to power plants in the country. (iv)	To help the power plants in enhancing their coal stock, CIL has offered 5.2 MT coal in October, 2021 and 6 MT coal in December, 2021 from its various subsidiaries to State/Central Gencos for lifting through Rail cum Road (RCR)/Road mode.(v)	Government has issued revised coal stocking norms, which mandate the power plants to maintain sufficient stock at all times to meet any contingent situation.  (vi)	Ministry of Power has advised power plants to import about 36 MT coal for blending during 2022-23 with a view to build sufficient coal stock at Power Plants.**************
