                                                    (a) whether the Khasi Language is in the list to be recognised as one of the languages in the eight schedule, if not, the reasons therefor;(b) whether the Government has got the recommendations and the resolution from the Legislative Assembly and the Government of Meghalaya for inclusion of the Khasi languages in the Eight Schedule; and(c) the steps taken by the Government to include the Khasi Language in the Eighth Schedule and the status thereof?






ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (c):	There have been demands from time to time for inclusion of Khasi in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution. Central Government had received a proposal in this regard. As the evolution of dialects and languages is a dynamic process, influenced by socio-cultural, economic and political developments, it is difficult to fix any criteria for languages, whether to distinguish them from dialects, or for their inclusion   in   the   Eighth Schedule to the Constitution.  The earlier attempts, through the Pahwa (1996) and Sitakant Mohapatra (2003) Committees, to evolve such fixed criteria have been inconclusive. Government of India is conscious of the sentiments and requirements for inclusion of other languages in the Eighth Schedule. Such requests have to be considered keeping in mind these sentiments, and the other relevant considerations. ******
