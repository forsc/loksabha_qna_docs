ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b) The Government attaches the highest priority to creating opportunities for Indian skilled workers to work abroad in European and other countries, including America. Towards this endeavour, Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreement was signed with France in 2018 and such agreements are under negotiation with several European countries. Many European countries have shown interest in hiring highly-skilled workers from India. Whenever there are issues related to visa for Indian workers, the Government also raises these issues and our concerns at various bilateral forums, including consular dialogue.  However, issuance of visas to Indian nationals is the prerogative of the Government of host country.(c) 	It is difficult to ascertain the number of persons engaged in the IT sector in foreign countries as such specific data is not available.(d) & (e) 	The Government provides all required assistance, including legal assistance, if a complaint of exploitation is received. Our Missions/Posts abroad liaise with host Governments and employers in case there is an issue relating to exploitation. Many host countries have a labour policy/law in place, aimed at attracting skilled migrants and safeguarding their rights. India also has bilateral social security and labour migration agreements with certain countries, aimed at safeguarding interests of Indian nationals abroad. All Indian Missions/Posts abroad have established 24x7 helplines to assist Indians in distress, including women, and also conduct Open Houses on a regular basis where workers can speak on their working conditions and seek redressal of their grievances. Pravasi Bharatiya Sahayata Kendras have been setup at Riyadh, Jeddah, Dubai, and Kuala Lumpur that provide guidance and counselling on all matters pertaining to overseas Indian workers. The online MADAD portal enables the emigrant workers and their family members to register their consular grievances online and track their redressal. Ministry constantly runs awareness campaigns through media and social media about safe and legal migration. Ministry also conducts Pre-Departure Orientation Training (PDOT) programme for emigrants across the country through PDOT centres.***
