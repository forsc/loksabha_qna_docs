ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS (SHRI DEVUSINH CHAUHAN)(a) 	BharatNet project is implemented in a phased manner to provide broadband connectivity to all Gram Panchayats (GPs) in the country including Bihar. As on 31-12-2021, the State/UT-wise status of Phase-I and Phase-II of BharatNet in the country, including Bihar, is given in Annexure-I. (b)	The time-line for providing connectivity to all villages including Gram Panchayats (GPs) in the country under BharatNet is August, 2023.  In Bihar, BharatNet project is almost completed as 8299 GPs, out of planned 8405 GPs, have been made Service Ready. (c) 	Under BharatNet Phase-II, about 65,000 GPs in 8 States are being implemented under State-led model. The implementation by some States are not meeting the targeted time-lines and is adversely affecting the completion of the Project. Further, the other problems faced in the implementation of the project are mainly on account of widely dispersed Gram Panchayats (GPs) across remote corners of the country, covering difficult terrains (including Hilly/ Rocky), Right of Way (RoW) issues and also difficulty of access in Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas.(d) & (e)	On 30.06.2021, the scope of BharatNet was extended upto all inhabited villages beyond GPs, along with approval for a revised strategy for implementation of BharatNet through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, covering 3.61 lakh villages including GPs across 16 States of the country. Request for Proposal (RFP) has been floated for implementing the project for 16 States under PPP model on 20.07.2021. Further, Cabinet has also given in-principle approval for extending village connectivity under BharatNet for all the remaining States/UTs. In Bihar, BharatNet connectivity upto villages is already under implementation through CSC e-Governance Services India Limited.
