ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) 	The total number of PIOs and NRIs living in foreign countries as on 25.12.2021 as per the data available with the Ministry is as follows:<pre>PIOs: 1.87 croresNRIs: 1.35 croresTotal: 3.22 crores</pre>(b) 	Several steps have been taken to ensure safety and security of Indians abroad. Indian Missions and Posts abroad are dedicated to the overall welfare including ensuring safety and security of Indians abroad. Any issue pertaining to Indians abroad is dealt by the Mission on priority basis. Missions/Posts conduct open houses for NRIs to discuss issues related to their safety and security. These issues are further highlighted and taken up with the host government wherever necessary for action on priority basis.Some other steps to ensure overall safety and security of NRIs are as follows:The Ministry organizes awareness workshops on safe and legal migration for the welfare of our workers and to generate awareness among them. A Pre-Departure Orientation Training (PDOT) is imparted to the workers before they migrate to foreign countries. Also a PDOT manual for prospective emigrants has been prepared, including its translation in regional languages. Online PDOT has also been launched to reach out to women and prospective migrants from remote areas. The Pravasi Bharatiya Bima Yojana (PBBY) provides insurance for workers.To facilitate the return of Indian nationals stranded in various countries due to restriction imposed in the wake of pandemic, the Vande Bharat Mission was started on 7th May, 2020.  During COVID-19 pandemic, our Missions/Posts abroad proactively helped distressed/stranded Indian nationals in terms of providing food, shelter, medicine and return back to India.Some other initiatives like MADAD Portal, Indian Community Welfare Fund (ICWF), E-migrate Portal, Pravasi Bharatiya Sahayta Kendra (PBSK), Rishta Portal, etc, help NRIs to get assistance and address their grievances and ensure their safety and security.Grievances are also registered and responded through various channels like calls, walk-in, e-mails, Twitter, Whatsapp, 24 x 7 Helpline and other Social Media accounts of Missions/Posts.***
