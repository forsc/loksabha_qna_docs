                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)   At present, there is no proposal to bring ‘Water’ under the Concurrent List of the Constitution of India.(b)  The Parliament has enacted Inter-State River Water Disputes (ISRWD) Act, 1956 for adjudication of disputes relating to waters of inter-State rivers and river valley thereof. When any request under the said Act is received from any State Government in respect of any water dispute on the inter-State rivers and the Central Government is of the opinion that the water dispute cannot be settled by negotiations, the Central Government constitutes a Water Disputes Tribunal for the adjudication of the water dispute. Currently, 5 Water Disputes Tribunals are under adjudication, details of which are given at Annexure- I.(c)  The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August 1980 for water resources development through transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. The improved water availability in water-deficit basins may address issues related to water disputes. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component and 14 under Himalayan Component). The details of above river linking projects is given at Annexure-II.*****ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred to in reply to part (b) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 2352 to be answered on 05.03.2020 on ‘Water Under Concurrent List’.Details of Water Disputes Tribunals currently under adjudicationS.No	Name of Tribunal	States concerned	Date of constitution	Present Status1		Ravi & Beas Water Tribunal	Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan	2nd April, 1986	Report and decision under section 5(2) of ISRWD Act given in April, 1987.
