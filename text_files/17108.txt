ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Yes, Sir. Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHCs), a sub-scheme under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) has been launched on 31.07.2020 for providing accommodation at affordable rent to urban migrants/ poor. This Scheme will be implemented through the following two Models:Model-1: Utilising existing Government funded vacant houses in cities by converting them into ARHCs under Public Private Partnership mode or by public agencies. Model-2: Incentivising Private/Public Entities to construct, operate and Maintain ARHCs on their own vacant land. (b)	Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has undertaken a study of property tax and identified best practices in property taxation.  A toolkit comprising best practices and other reforms identified has been prepared with actionable recommendations and step-wise implementation plan for undertaking property tax reforms in States and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).   These reforms are aimed at bringing efficiency and transparency in the system and enhance the resources available for ULBs.Further, in order to support States and ULBs in implementation of 	these reforms, MoHUA has launched a portal in June 2020 as a National portal on municipal finance to facilitate peer benchmarking and comparative analysis(www.cityfinance.in). This portal has already over 3,000 annual accounts of over 1,700 ULBs. (c)	Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance has reported that there is no such proposal under consideration.(d)& (e) MoHUA has suggested the States/Union Territories (UTs) to exempt or make provision for nominal charges against stamp duty to Economically Weaker Section (EWS)/Lower Income Group (LIG)houses under PMAY-U. In addition, States have been requested to 	exempt any Registration Charges or additional Stamp Duty on inclusion of female member of the family in existing registered title document of the house. So far, no response in this regard has been received from the States/ UTs. Further, in view of the impact on real estate sector due to COVID-19, States have been requested to reduce the conveyance deed to incentivise purchaser of houses and thereby boost economic activities.                                            *****
