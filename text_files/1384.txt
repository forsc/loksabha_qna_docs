ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a)	 & (b): No Sir. Government has been receiving proposals from States/UTs for construction of new Anganwadi buildings from time to time in the rural and urban areas.  Under the revised scope of Anganwadi Services implemented from 01.12.2017, the central assistance for construction of new Anganwadi Centre building is available in rural areas in convergence with Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). The total cost of construction of one Anganwadi building is Rs. 7 lakh. Central assistance for construction of new AWC buildings @ 1 lakh Anganwadi buildings per annum is Rs. 1 lakh per Anganwadi building for all States/UTs. This amount is reimbursable to States/UTs after completion of construction of Anganwadi building.(c): 		States/UTs have been advised to re-assess their requirement of Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) and relocate AWCs considering the need. While relocating, the aspect of availability of adequate land, building, water facilities, ease of access of pregnant women and children besides maximum travel distance not being more than 5 km in case of urban areas, 3 km in rural areas and 1.5 km in tribal areas for the AWWs is to be kept in view.  Besides, improved water and sanitation facilities, Pre-school education and Medicine Kits are provided at the AWCs.(d) 	& (e):  During XII Plan period, a provision was made to construct 2 lakh AWC buildings at a cost of Rs. 4.5 lakh per AWC building and cost norm for maintenance was decided @ Rs. 2000 per AWC per annum in the government buildings. However, the aforesaid scheme component for construction was discontinued as it was felt that this can best be done through convergence with Schemes like MGNREGS. Accordingly, joint guidelines were issued on 17.02.2016 for construction of AWC buildings in convergence with MGNREGS. *********
