(??????? ??????? ????????)(a)	to (c):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN ANSWER TO PART (a) TO (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *192 (12TH POSITION) FOR 2ND AUGUST, 2021 REGARDING UTILISATION OF CSR FUNDS.  (a):   As per the input provided by the Department of Financial Services, Public Sector Banks are established under the State Bank of India Act, 1955 and the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970/80 and are not companies incorporated under the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act) or under any previous company law. As such, the provisions of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) mentioned in Section 135 of the Act are not applicable to Public Sector Banks.       On the basis of the filings made by the companies in the MCA 21 registry, CSR funds spent by the companies, including private sector banks incorporated under the Act, in different States /Union Territories (UTs) during the last three financial years are annexed.(b):   Under the Act, CSR is a Board driven process and the Board of the company is empowered to plan, decide, execute and monitor CSR activities based on the recommendation of its CSR Committee. The CSR architecture is disclosure based and CSR mandated companies are required to file details of CSR activities annually in the MCA21 registry. The CSR mandated companies are required to provide additional information in its Profit & Loss Account regarding amount of expenditure incurred on CSR activities and the same is required to be audited by the statutory auditor of the company. Further, the Board of the company is also required to disclose the CSR Policy developed and implemented by the company in its Board report.  Thus, the corporate governance framework along with the existing legal provisions such as mandatory disclosures, accountability of the CSR Committee and the Board, provisions for statutory audit of accounts of the company etc. provide sufficient safeguards in this regard.(c):   Whenever any violation of CSR provisions is reported, action against such non-compliant Companies are initiated as per provisions of the Act after due examination of records and following due process of law. All CSR related defaults are compoundable.  So far, sanction for prosecution has been accorded in 366 cases. Of these, 148 applications for compounding have been made and 75 cases have been compounded.  Further, the non-compliance of CSR provisions have been made civil wrong w. e. f. 22nd January, 2021.  ******AnnexureANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 192 FOR 02.08.2021STATE/UT-WISE CSR EXPENDITURE DETAILS (IN RS.
