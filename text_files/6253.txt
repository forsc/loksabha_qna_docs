The Task Force has also recommended that an online loan sales portal to conduct auctions and sale process may be designed and also that RBI may consider permitting single loan securitization and allow Mutual Funds (MF’s), Pension Funds (PFs), Alternative Investment Funds (AIF’s), Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) and Insurance Companies to participate in these securities. These recommendations are currently being examined by the Reserve Bank.(e):  RBI has taken a number of measures to promote sale of corporate loans, which are as under: (i)	Permitting transfer of borrowal accounts from one bank to another (ii)	Issuance of inter-bank participation certificates (iii)	Transfer of assets through securitization(iv)	Issuance of guidelines on sale of stressed assets by banks(v)	Permitting banks to sell certain loans to eligible External Commercial Borrowing (ECB)         lenders
