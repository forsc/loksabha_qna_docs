It focuses on providing permanent shelters equipped with basic facilities for the urban homeless. 	DAY-NULM is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme under which funds are released to State/UT governments in a consolidated manner. The allocation for different components of DAY-NULM including SUH is done by respective States/UTs based on their local requirement and capacity. Due to high unspent balance available with Maharashtra, no fund has been released to State during the last three years i.e. 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20.(b)&(c): 	No targets have been set by Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. The State/UT level Project Sanctioning Committee (PSC) is responsible for assessing the requirement of shelters and approve proposals for their establishment. As reported by the State, the details for the last three years are as under:Year	Target	Shelters made Functional2017-18	56	182018-19	57	362019-20	19	9(d): 	The shelters under SUH are established with basic amenities which include ventilated rooms, water supply, sanitation, bathing and toilet facilities, standard lighting, fire protection measure, first-aid kit, regular cleaning of blankets, common kitchen, personal lockers, common recreation space and CCTV cameras at entry and exit points for security etc.                                                    *****
