                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	Government fixes Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) of 22 mandated crops and fair and remunerative prices (FRP) for Sugarcane on the basis of recommendations of Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned and other relevant factors. In addition, MSP for Toria and De-Husked coconut is also fixed on the basis of MSPs of Rapeseed/Mustard and Copra respectively. These major agricultural crops account for around 99 per cent of the agricultural output (excluding horticulture).(b)&(c):	 As per the existing arrangements, procurement is made of the crops for which MSPs are announced through Central and State agencies. In so far as cereals/nutri cereals are Contd…2/--2-concerned, they are procured through Food Corporation of India (FCI) and decentralized procurement system mainly for distribution under the public distribution system (PDS), for welfare schemes and buffer stocking for food security. Government also implements Price Support Scheme (PSS) under the Umbrella Scheme “Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA)” for procurement of oilseeds and pulses. Cotton is procured by Cotton Corporation of India.To strengthen the market infrastructure government is implementing various programs including e-National Agriculture Market (e-NAM), enacting the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2017 and promoting Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs). The Government is working on market architecture so as to ensure that farmers get remunerative prices on their produce. These include setting up of Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs) with a view to promote 22,000 number of retail markets in close proximity of farm gate; competitive and transparent wholesale trade at APMC through e-NAM; and a robust and pro-farmer export policy. (d):	The prices of agricultural produce are determined by supply and demand conditions in the market on a day-to-day basis. The prices of agricultural produce tend to fall immediately after harvest due to increase in market arrival of new crops in a lumpy manner. The wholesale prices of major agricultural commodities are given below:(in Rs.  per quintal)Crops/Commodity	MSP (2018-19)	Wholesale Prices		Apr-19	May-19Paddy	1750	1780	1793Bajra	1950	2171	2207Barley	1440	1745	1795Gram	4620	4679	4796Jowar	2430	2637	2625Maize	1700	1943	1973Ragi	2897	2715	2690Wheat	1840	2108	2120Arhar Whole	5675	5108	5557Masur Whole	4475	4768	4902Moong Whole	6975	5952	6211Urad Whole	5600	5230	5441Groundnut	4890	5035	5132Copra	7511	11148	10583Safflower/ Kardiseed	4945	3757	4047Mustard Seed	4200	3978	4073Nigerseed	5877	4732	4700Sesamum Seed	6249	9883	9782Soyabean	3399	3675	3742Sunflower Seed	5388	3705	3567Cotton/Kapas	5150	5785	5839Source: Directorate of Economics & Statistics(e)&(f):	 There is no study conducted in this regard by the government.********
