The work in Railway portion is in progress by Railway.  Work on approaches is at tendering stage by State Government. (ii)  ROB in lieu of  Level Crossing (LC) No. 28 at Km 28/7-8 on Sabarmati-Botad section was sanctioned in 2018-19. Presently State Government is not coming forward to take up the work. Railway is continuously pursuing with State Government.       Construction of ROB will depend upon availability of encroachment free land for approach roads, shifting of utilities, allocation of adequate funds by State Governments, public support etc. Therefore, it is not possible to fix timelines for completion of these ROBs.*****
