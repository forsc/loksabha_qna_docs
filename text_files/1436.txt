                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):	As per Rural Health Statistics (RHS) 2018, there are shortages in the availability of human resource of various categories in public health facilities of the rural areas of the country. Shortage of Doctors in public health sector varies from State to State depending upon their policies and context.         The details of availability and shortage of specialist doctors including surgeons, physicians, pediatricians, lab technicians, radiographers and gynecologists vis-à-vis requirements in public health facilities, State/UT-wise is given at Annexure-I to VI.(c):	Public Health & hospitals being a State subject, the primary responsibility to improve the overall infrastructure of Community Health Centres and other Public Health Centres especially in rural areas, lies with the State Governments. To address the healthcare challenges, particularly in rural areas, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in 2005 to supplement the efforts of the State/UT governments to provide accessible, affordable and quality healthcare to all those who access public health facilities. Currently, NRHM is a sub-mission of National Health Mission.This support under NHM includes provision of a host of free services such as maternal health, child health, adolescent health, family planning, universal immunisation programme, and for major diseases such as Tuberculosis, HIV/ AIDS, vector borne diseases like Malaria, Dengue and Kala Azar, Leprosy etc. Other major initiatives include Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) (under which free drugs, free diagnostics, free blood and diet, free transport from home to institution, between facilities in case of a referral and drop back home is provided), Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) (which provides newborn and child health screening and early interventions services free of cost for birth defects, diseases, deficiencies and developmental delays to improve the quality of survival), implementation of Free Drugs and Free Diagnostics Service Initiatives, PM National Dialysis Programme and implementation of National Quality Assurance Framework. Mobile Medical Units (MMUs) & Telemedicine are also being implemented with NHM support to improve healthcare access particularly in rural areas.As part of Ayushman Bharat, the Government is supporting the States for strengthening Sub Centres and Primary Health Centres as Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs) for provision of comprehensive primary health care that includes preventive and health promotion at the community level with continuum of care approach. Further, Ayushman Bharat, Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) provides health coverage up to Rs. 5.00 lakh per family per year to around 10.74 crore poor and vulnerable families as per Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC).(d) & (e):	The Government has taken various steps to incentivize the doctors and specialists, these efforts include:I.	Support to States/UTs in term of hard area allowance for specialist doctors who serve in rural and remote areas as well as for residential quarters for them.II.	The States are encouraged to adopt flexible norms for engaging specialists on even contractual basis at public health facilities. These include various mechanisms for ‘contracting in’ and ‘contracting out’ of specialist services, methods of engaging specialists outside the government system for service delivery at public facilities and the mechanism to include requests for these in the state Program Implementation Plans (PIP) under the National Health Mission.III.	States have also been allowed to offer negotiable salaries to attract Specialists. The States have flexibility to adopt strategies such as ''You quote, we pay".  Financial support is also provided to States for providing performance-based incentives, providing accommodation and transport facilities to human resource engaged in health in rural and remote areas, sponsoring training programmes etc to address the issue of shortage of doctors and other personnel in the public health facilities.
