ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (f):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. ***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (f) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1535 BY SHRI SANJAY BHATIA ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 28.07.2021 REGARDING PANIPAT-MEERUT RAILWAY LINE(a) to (c) : Meerut Cantt. is well connected directly to Ambala Cantt, Pathankot Cantt. and Jammu & Kashmir via double line Railway Track.  Existing route via Saharanpur is the shortest route and will remain to be shortest even after construction of Meerut – Panipat line.  Surveys for Meerut-Panipat new line have been carried out in past in 1999, 2009 and 2011. However, project could not be taken forward being financially unviable.    In view of persistent demand for this line, the work of Meerut-Panipat (104.4 km) new rail line has been included in Budget 2016-17 subject to requisite Government approvals.  Three possible alignments were examined in consultation with Public Representatives and State Government officials.  The alignment has been finalized and accordingly preparation of Detailed Project Report (DPR) has been taken up.  Further consideration is possible once DPR is received and results thereon are firmed up.(d) to (f) :  Do not arise, as the project is not sanctioned.*****
