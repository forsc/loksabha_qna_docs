However, the Act does not mandate setting up of Gram Nyayalayas because of this only 11 States have established Gram Nyayalayas. The Central Government has been requesting States and High Courts for establishment of Gram Nyayalayas in the respective States. As per the information made  available by  the various State Governments / High Courts there are 353 Gram Nyayalayas notified, out of which 221 are operational. The State-wise details including Jharkhand, are given as follows:Sl.

The Gram Nyayalayas Act provides for establishment of Gram Nyayalayas for every Panchayat at intermediate level or a group of contiguous Panchayats at intermediate level in a district or where there is no Panchayat at intermediate level in any State, for a group of contiguous group Panchayats. (c):	     As per Section 16 of the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, the District Court or the Court of Session, as may be notified by the High Court, may transfer all the civil or criminal cases pending before the courts subordinate to it, to the Gram Nyayalayas and that the Gram Nyayalaya may, in its discretion, either re-try the cases or proceed from the stage at which it was transferred to it.(d):  Funds allocated under the Scheme of Gram Nyayalayas are fully released to States. The details of funds released to States under the Scheme are given as follows:Sl.

It was decided in the Conference that the State Governments and High Courts should decide the question of setting up of Gram Nyayalayas wherever feasible, taking into account the local issues and situation. It is, therefore, upto State Governments and High Courts to set up Gram Nyayalayas accordingly.
