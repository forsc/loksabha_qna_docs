A National Commission to examine the issue of Sub-categorisation of Scheduled Castes (NCSCSC) in Andhra Pradesh had been set up in the year 2006-07. The NCSCSC in its report submitted on 01.05.2008 had recommended amendment of Article 341 of the Constitution to provide for sub-categorisation and de-sub-categorisation of SCs. No decision has been taken in the matter as the Government has decided to elicit views of the major stake holder''s viz. the State Governments and Union Territory Administrations on the recommendation of the NCSCSC.*****
