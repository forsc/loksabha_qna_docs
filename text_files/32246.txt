The total Central funds released by the Ministry under PMAY-G to the State of Maharashtra during each of the last three years is given as under:                                            (Rs. in crore)2018-19	              2019-20	        2020-211135.53	              1815.33	        1310.10(b)       The number of people benefited (to whom houses have been sanctioned), under the said Scheme in the State of Maharashtra and in Shirdi Parliamentary Constituency in Ahmednagar District during each of the last three years is given as under:                                                           (Houses sanctioned units in nos.)State/District	                    2018-19	2019-20	    2020-21Maharashtra	                   79198	249297	    296443Shirdi Parliamentary Constituency in Ahmednagar District*       	    1382	  5301	      6452*six blocks (Akola, Sangmner, Shirdi (Rahata), Kopargoan, Shrirampur and Nevasa) of Ahmednagar District.
