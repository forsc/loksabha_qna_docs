ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a)     As per the National Register of Large Dams (2019) maintained by the Central Water Commission based on the information provided by the project authorities, India has 1175 number of large dams (including one dam of Punjab, namely Nangal dam) which are more than 50 years old (constructed in or before 1971). Further, the Country is having 227 number of large dams having more than 100 years of service life (constructed in or before 1921). State-wise number of these dams is enclosed as Annexure-l.(b) & (c) Dams in India are owned and operated either by the State Governments or Central and State Public Sector Undertakings. A few dams are owned by private entities. The safety of dams in India is the principal concern of the State Agencies/Organizations who own the dams. Dam owners generally carry out pre-monsoon and post-monsoon inspection of their dams. Some States have also constituted Dam Safety Review Panels for comprehensive audit and required follow up action on their dams. The life of a dam is normally considered till such time that it performs its intended functions, without jeopardizing the safety of people living in its vicinity. The Dam Safety Bill, 2021 has been passed by both the Houses of Parliament. The Dam Safety Bill, 2021, inter alia, provides for surveillance, inspection, operation and maintenance of the specified dams for prevention of dam failure related disasters.(d)  Proposals for replacement of old dams, if required, need to be formulated by the dam owners.*****ANNEXURE-I ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3019 TO BE ANSWERED ON 16.12.2021 REGARDING ‘OLD DAMS’.State-wise Number of Large dams having more than 50 years and 100 years of Age S.N.
