ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR HEAVY INDUSTRIES(SHRI KRISHAN PAL GURJAR)(a) & (b):	The National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020 is a National Mission document providing the vision and the roadmap for the faster adoption of electric vehicles and their manufacturing in the country.  This plan was designed to enhance national fuel security, to provide affordable and environmentally friendly transportation and to enable the Indian automotive industry to achieve global manufacturing leadership. As part of the NEMMP 2020, the Ministry of Heavy Industries formulated a Scheme namely Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) Scheme in 2015 to promote adoption of electric/ hybrid vehicles (xEVs) in India. The Phase-1 of the scheme was available up to 31st March, 2019 with budget outlay of Rs 895 Cr.  This phase of FAME India Scheme had four focus areas i.e. technological development, demand generation, pilot project and charging infrastructure components. -2-In the 1st phase of the scheme, about 2.8 lakh xEVs were supported with total demand incentives of Rs. 359 Crore [Approx].  In addition, 425 electric and hybrid buses, as sanctioned under first phase of the scheme, are deployed across various cities in the country with Government Incentive of about Rs. 280 Cr.  The Ministry of Heavy Industries had also sanctioned about 520 Charging Stations/ Infrastructure for Rs. 43 Crore (approx.) under Phase-I of FAME-India Scheme.Projects worth about Rs. 158 Crores are sanctioned for the technology development projects like establishment of testing Infrastructure, setting up of ‘Centre of Excellence’ for Advanced Research in electrified transportation, Battery Engineering etc. to various organizations / institutions like Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), IIT Madras, IIT Kanpur, Non Ferrous Material Technology Development Centre (NFTDC), Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) etc.Based on outcome and experience gained during Phase-I of FAME India Scheme and after having consultations with all stakeholders, including Industry and Industry Associations, the Government notified Phase-II of FAME India Scheme for a period of five years commencing from 1st Apri1, 2019 with a total budgetary support of Rs. 10,000 crore.  This phase mainly focuses on supporting electrification of public & shared transportation, and aims to support through demand incentive 7090 eBuses, 5 lakh e-3 Wheelers, 55000 e-4 Wheeler Passenger Cars and 10 lakh e-2 Wheelers.Under Phase-II of FAME India Scheme, 2,31,257 Electric Vehicles have been supported till 01.02.2022 by way of Demand Incentive amounting to about Rs. 827 Cr. Further, MHI has sanctioned 6315 e-buses to 65 cities/STUs/CTUs/ State Govt. entities for intracity and intercity operations across 26 states/UT under the Scheme.  The Ministry has also sanctioned 2877 charging stations in 68 cities across 25 states/Uts under FAME India (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric Vehicles in India) Scheme Phase II.  Further, 1576 charging stations across 9 Expressways and 16 Highways are also sanctioned under phase-II of FAME India Scheme.(c):	Sir, as per the e-vahan portal (Ministry of Road Transport and Highways), the detailed list of electric vehicles and total vehicles on roads, State/UT-wise including Bihar is at ANNEXURE-I.(d):	The Ministry of Heavy Industries had also sanctioned 520 Charging Stations/ for developing charging Infrastructure under Phase-I of FAME-India Scheme.  Under FAME India Scheme I & II, a total of 475 charging stations have been installed as on 31st Jan 2022 as per ANNEXURE-II.(e):	The Government has approved Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme on 15th September, 2021 to encourage manufacturing of Advanced Automotive Technology (AAT) Products for Auto sector in India including electric vehicles.  Overseas companies having registered office in India are also eligible to apply under this scheme subject to meeting the eligibility criteria and establishing manufacturing facility for production of the eligible products under this scheme. (f):	No Such proposal is under consideration in the Ministry of Heavy Industries.-3-(g):	At present, investments in manufacturing and overall value addition for Advanced Chemistry Cells (ACCs) are negligible in India and almost entire domestic demand of ACCs is still being met through imports.  In order to reduce dependency of imported ACC battery for electric vehicles, the Government on 12th May, 2021 approved a Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for manufacturing of Advance Chemistry Cell (ACC) in the country. The total outlay of the scheme is Rs. 18,100 Crore for a period of 5 years.  The scheme envisages to establish a competitive ACC battery manufacturing set up in the country (50 GWh).  Additionally, 5GWh of niche ACC technologies is also covered under the Scheme. The scheme proposes a production linked subsidy based on applicable subsidy per KWh and percentage of value addition achieved on actual sales made by the manufacturers who set up production units.(h):	Sir, the Ministry of Heavy Industries formulated a Scheme for Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) Scheme in 2015 to promote adoption of electric/ hybrid vehicles (xEVs) in the country.  At present, Phase-II of FAME India Scheme is being implemented on pan India basis including in the State of Bihar for a period of 5 years w.e.f. 01st April, 2019 with a total budgetary support of Rs. 10,000 crores. 	Further, following steps have been taken by the Government for adoption of electric vehicles in the country:i.	The demand incentive for electric two wheelers has been increased to Rs. 15,000/KWh from Rs. 10,000/KWh with an increase in cap from 20% to 40% of the cost of vehicle from 11th June, 2021, thus enabling cost of Electric two wheelers at par with that of ICE two wheeler vehicles.ii.	The Government on 12th May, 2021 approved a Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for manufacturing of Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) in the country in order to bring down prices of battery in the country.  Drop in battery price will result in cost reduction of electric vehicles.iii.	Electric Vehicles are covered under Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for Automobile and Auto Components, which was approved on 15th September, 2021 with a budgetary outlay of Rs. 25,938 crore for a period of five years.iv.	GST on electric vehicles has been reduced from 12% to 5%; GST on chargers/ charging stations for electric vehicles has been reduced from 18% to 5%.v.	Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) announced that battery-operated vehicles will be given green license plates and be exempted from permit requirements.vi.	MoRTH issued a notification advising states to waive road tax on EVs, which in turn will help reduce the initial cost of EVs.*****-4-ANNEXURE IState wise number of electric vehicles including Bihar state as on 31-01-2022State Name	Grand TotalAndaman & Nicobar Island	159Arunachal Pradesh	20Assam	47,947Bihar	64,241Chandigarh	1,931Chhattisgarh	13,428Delhi	132,302Goa	1,686Gujarat	17,593Haryana	26,780Himachal Pradesh	711Jammu and Kashmir	1,527Jharkhand	12,171Karnataka	82,046Kerala	15,022Ladakh	5,496Maharashtra	58,815Manipur	540Meghalaya	28Mizoram	20Nagaland	171Odisha	12,282Puducherry	1,614Punjab	10,142Rajasthan	53,141Sikkim	2,425Tamil Nadu	50,296Tripura	7,593UT of DNH and DD	277Uttar Pradesh	276,217Uttarakhand	25,451West Bengal	44,291Grand Total	966,363Note: The details given are for digitized vehicle records as per centralized Vahan 4 and data for Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, and Lakshadweep are not been provided as they are not in centralized Vahan 4.*****-5-ANNEXURE-II1.
