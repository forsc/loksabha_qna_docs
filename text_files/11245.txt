                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d):	The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana (PM-Kisan) scheme was launched on 24.02.2019 with a view to provide income support to all small and marginal farmer families having cultivable land upto 2 hectares. The ambit of the scheme was subsequently enlarged and all landholding farmers'' families in the country, having cultivable land have been covered under the Scheme, with certain exclusions. Accordingly, funds are being released to all eligible farmers’ families. Under the Scheme an amount of Rs.6000/- per year is being released in three 4-monthly installments of Rs. 2000/- directly into the bank accounts of the eligible farmer families under Direct Benefit Transfer mode. Further, the Government has launched a pension scheme, namely, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan Dhan Yojana (PM-KMY) w.e.f. 12.9.2019 for all small and marginal farmers (SMF) in the country holding cultivable land upto 2 hectare, subject to certain exclusion clauses, with a view to provide them a social security net as they have minimal or no savings to provide for old age and to support them in the event of consequent loss of livelihood.  The scheme provides for payment of a minimum fixed pension of Rs. 3,000/- per month to eligible farmers on attaining the age of 60 years.  It is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme, with entry age of 18 to 40 years. Landholding is the basic criteria for the PM-KMY and hence only farmers holding cultivable land are eligible for the benefit under this Scheme, irrespective of whether they actually reside in the villages or not. The beneficiary can opt to become a member of the Scheme by subscribing to a Pension Fund, managed by the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC).                                                                                                                             Contd….2/-                                  2For example, the beneficiary is required to contribute Rs. 100/- per month in the pension fund at median entry age of 29 years, with matching contribution of Rs. 100/- by the Central Government.  As on 31.01.2020, a total of 19,43,727 farmers have joined the Scheme.Funds released to farmers under the PM-Kisan Scheme as on 29.1.2020 in installments are at Annexure-I.The entire responsibility of identification of beneficiaries rests with the State/UT Governments.  Financial benefits are released to beneficiaries on the basis of the data of farmers’ families prepared and uploaded by the State/UT Governments on the PM-Kisan web-portal.  The scheme is being implemented through the State Governments/UT Governments.
