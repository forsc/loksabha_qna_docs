                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) to (d):  A Task Force was constituted by the Government to examine the correlation of age of marriage and motherhood with (i) health, medical well-being and nutritional status of mother and neonate/ infant/ child, during pregnancy, birth and thereafter, (ii) key parameters like Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR), Total Fertility Rate (TFR), Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB), Child Sex Ratio (CSR) etc. and (iii) any other relevant points pertaining to health and nutrition in this context and to suggest measures for promoting higher education among women. The Task Force has since submitted its Report.           However, Ministry of Women and Child Development after examining the report has requested NITI Aayog that the evidence adduced regarding adverse impact of the early age of marriage on issues related to health, nutrition, education and economic empowerment etc. of women of India needs to be augmented in order to build a strong case in favour of the argument. The studies mentioned in its support are mostly of international and South Asian level and the extent to which these will be applicable to India needs to be carefully determined. NITI Aayog has also been requested to undertake a comprehensive study on the impact of the Prohibition of Child Marriage (Karnataka Amendment) Act, 2016. *****
