There is no such proposal.(c) & (d) Rankhar of Bhawatada, Rajasthan is about 4 km away from the route of Luni River, which is a declared National Waterway-48 (NW-48).   On the basis of feasibility study completed, NW-48 has been found unviable for navigation at present.   As such, there is no proposal to declare the waterway route from Rankhar to NW-48 as National Waterway or for construction of port at Rankhar.                                            *****
