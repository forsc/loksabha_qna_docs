ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (d) :   The information with regard to reservation in jobs and education is being dealt by Department of Personnel & Training and Ministry of Human Resource and Development respectively.As per the Department of Personnel & Training, vacant posts of reserved category candidates are not centrally maintained, as the recruitment process is carried out by the respective cadre controlling authorities through concerned recruitment agencies.Filling up of vacancies, including backlog reserved vacancies, is a continuous process. However, Department of Personnel and Training has already issued instructions to all the Ministries/Department to constitute an in-house committee to identify backlog reserved vacancies, study of the root cause of backlog reserved vacancies, initiation of measures to remove such factors and to fill up such vacancies through special recruitment drive.Department of Personnel & Training monitors the progress in respect of filling up of backlog reserved vacancies for Scheduled Caste (SCs,) Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) with ten Ministries/Departments, having more than 90% of the employees in Central Government.Out of these ten Ministries/Departments,  six Ministries/Departments have informed that as on 31.12.2017, out of 13968 backlog vacancies for SCs and 20044 backlog vacancies for OBCs, 6186 backlog vacancies for SCs and 9185 backlog vacancies for OBCs were filled up. As on 01.01.2018, 7782 backlog vacancies for SCs and 10859 backlog vacancies for OBCs remained unfilled.Besides the above six, three more Ministries/Departments have informed that as on 31.12.2018, out of 9624 backlog vacancies for SCs and 7293 backlog vacancies for OBCs, 7911 backlog vacancies for SCs and 5520 backlog vacancies for OBCs were filled up. As on 01.01.2019, 1713 backlog vacancies for SCs and 1773 backlog vacancies for OBCs remained unfilled.As per the Department of Higher Education, the information regarding vacant seats for Scheduled Castes & Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in Centrally Funded Educational Institutions is not centrally maintained. The Central Educational Institutions (CEI) (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006 provides reservation for students belonging to the Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) & Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in Central Educational Institutions (CEIs) established, maintained or aided by the Central Government. As per the CEI (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006 read with the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Amendment Act, 2012, out of annual permitted strength in each branch of study or faculty, 15% seats are to be reserved for Scheduled Castes, 7.5% for Scheduled Tribes and 27% for Other Backward Classes.  University Grants Commission (UGC) has issued a circular letter No. F. 1-5/2006 (SCT) dated 19.11.2012 regarding the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Amendment Act, 2012 to all Universities for compliance and necessary action. There is also a monitoring system in UGC and AICTE to monitor the implementation of the reservation policy.						*****
