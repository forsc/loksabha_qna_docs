                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES & PENSIONS AND PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR.JITENDRA SINGH):  (a)to(c) Nuclear power is clean and environment friendly, apart from having a huge potential to ensure the country’s long term energy security.  A large nuclear power expansion programme is being implemented towards this end. The present installed nuclear power capacity of 6780 MW is expected to reach 22480 MW on progressive completion of projects under construction and accorded sanction. This is also in line with India’s Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) announced by the country at the Paris Climate conference in 2015 and the recent commitment to a net zero economy involving transition to clean energy sources including nuclear power. Thus, there would be an increased emphasis on nuclear power generation.(d)	 Yes, Sir.(e)	The present capacity in operation at Kudankulam site is 2000 MW with Units1&2–KKNPP-1&2 (2X1000 MW) in operation. It will increase progressively to 6000 MW on completion of KKNPP-3&4 (2 X 1000 MW) and KKNPP-5&6 (2 X 1000 MW) which are presently under different stages of construction.*****
