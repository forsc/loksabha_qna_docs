MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a):  MoU of the current financial year i.e. 2020-21 is not finalized.(b): All the subsidiaries of CIL have taken initiatives for continuing production of coal during the monsoon months, details of such initiatives are as under :- 1.	Major monsoon activities such as preparation of sump of adequate capacity, cutting of garland drain around the periphery of mine to prevent inrush of water from outside mine boundary, cleaning of internal drains and approach road to pump/sumps.2.	Installation of pumps of desired capacity, where essential in open cast mines pumps have been installed over pontoons for smooth operation of pumps, laying of pipeline range, maintenance of O/H line & electrical appliances.3.	Major civil works/activities such as Haul road & Coal Transportation road repairing, Laying of Hume pipes as per requirement, cleaning of sidings & weighbridges on a regular basis during monsoon.4.	Establishment of Control rooms at company head quarter, as well as in all areas and units to function round the clock to deal with any eventuality arising during monsoon.5.	Prior to monsoon, all the electrical OH, distribution points, transformers/ transwitches, ACB/VCB/OCBs, earth systems, lighting arresters, switch gears, cable joints etc. are checked, repaired and maintained as a preventive measure for smooth and uninterrupted power supply to facilitate production during monsoon.6.	Dressing of trees and cleaning of bushes along the corridor of the over line to minimize the fault in power supply line.7.	Ensuring 100% availability of Road and Rail Weight Bridges. (c) and (d): Yes, subsidiary companies of CIL are facing problems related to following issues:•	Law and order issue at Magadh and Amrapali Area. Local villagers stopped Coal Production and OBR from Amrapali OC for 7 days (20.08.2020 to 26.08.2020).•	Due to nationwide lockdown because of COVID 19:-?	Contractual production was adversely affected due to shortage of manpower resulted in poor availability of Operators & Drivers.?	Supply of spares affected due to restricted interstate transport which in turn affected repair and maintenance works in the mines.?	Downtime of the machine increased due to non-availability of spares and technical support.?	Supply of explosives affected due to restriction in interstate movement.?	Decrease in demand of coal due to demand of power by about 30% and shut down of many industries in non-power sector due to lockdown further impacted the demand resulted in poor off take from CIL.?	Delay in departmental HEMM supply like Dozers, Graders and Excavators etc.?	Despatch by rail/road mode adversely affected.?	In addition to above, lockdown declared in the State by Govt. of Chhattisgarh from 23.07.2020 to 31.07.2020, which was further extended upto 06.08.2020.•	Strike called by all Central Trade Unions on 2nd, 3rd and 4th July’2020 adversely affected production.•	Cyclone Amphan affected production at ECL, BCCL and CCL during 20th and 21st May’2020.•	Incessant rainfall from 11th June’2020 affected Coal Production in all subsidiaries.* * * *
