To tackle the challenge of Non Communicable Diseases (NCD) including diabetes, 599 NCD Clinics at District level and 3,274 NCD Clinics at Community Health Centre level have been set up under the programme. Treatment for diabetes is also available at other health facilities run by the Central and State Governments. Population level initiative for prevention, control and screening for common NCDs (diabetes, hypertension and common cancers viz. oral, breast and cervical cancer) has also been rolled out under the National Health Mission (NHM) in over 215 districts.
