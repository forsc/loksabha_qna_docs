Mandate of ICAR Institutes and Agricultural Universities is mainly research, yet for promoting the newly released varieties of fruit crops,  during 2019 and 2020, total 744.73156 lakh planting material were propagated and distributed to the farmers by Agricultural Universities, ICAR Institutes and their Krishi Vigyan Kendras (Annexure-II) including 83049 plants of 12 fruit crops propagated by IARI (Pusa Institute), New Delhi and its Regional Stations.
