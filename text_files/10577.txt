                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b)	 The Parliament has enacted Inter-State River Water Disputes (ISRWD) Act, 1956 for adjudication of disputes relating to waters of inter-State rivers and river valley thereof. When any request under the said Act is received from any State Government in respect of any water dispute on the inter-State rivers and the Central Government is of the opinion that the water dispute cannot be settled by negotiations, the Central Government constitutes a Water Disputes Tribunal for adjudication of the water dispute.The Central Government has, so far, set up 09 tribunals to settle water disputes among the States under the ISRWD Act, 1956. The status of various inter-State water disputes Tribunals is at Annexure.  (c) to (e)	 A Bill namely, Inter-State River Water Disputes (Amendment) Bill, 2019 has been passed by Lok Sabha on 31.07.2019. The Bill seeks to streamline the adjudication of inter-State river water disputes and make the present legal and institutional architecture robust by amending the existing ISRWD Act, 1956. The proposed Bill seeks to provide for a single permanent Tribunal instead of multiple Tribunals. Enactment of the ISRWD (Amendments) Bill will facilitate faster adjudication of water disputes.***** ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) & (b) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. †4035 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 12.12.2019 REGARDING “INTEGRATED WATER DISPUTES TRIBUNAL”.Status of Inter-State Water Disputes Tribunals constituted under ISRWD Act, 1956S.No	Name of Tribunal	States concerned	Date of constitution	Present Status1		Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal	Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh &Odisha	10th April, 1969	Award given in July, 1980.2		Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal -I	Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka,	10th April, 1969	Award given in May, 19763		Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal	Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra	6th October, 1969	Award given in December, 19794		Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal 	Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Puduchery	2nd June, 1990	Report and decision under section 5(2) of ISRWD Act given on 5.2.2007 and published vide Notification dated 19.2.2013.
