ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a) Yes, Sir, the Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) under the Ministry have been allocating funds for taking up projects under the framework for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) during the last three years, as per the guidelines of Department of Public Enterprises and the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013.   (b), (c) & (d) The details of total CSR funds allocated and spent on projects area-wise during the last three years by CPSUs under the Ministry, may be seen at Annexure-I. The thrust of CSR spending under many projects is for upliftment of marginalized and under-privileged sections of society, including backward and scheduled caste dominated areas. The location-wise data on number of persons benefitted is difficult to compile for projects like common public utilities, contributions to public welfare funds etc. As per CSR provisions in Section 135 of Companies Act, 2013 and Companies (CSR Policy) Rules notified thereunder, the management of CPSUs may decide to undertake CSR activities, as per the eligible activities listed in Schedule-VII of the Act, in any part of the country, including for the socio economic development and relief and welfare of Scheduled Caste and other Backward classes etc.***** Annexure-I1.
