                                                        (a) to (c) The National Skill Development Mission (NSDM) was launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on 15th July, 2015, to provide a strong institutional framework to implement and scale up skill development efforts across the country.	Under this, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) (2016-2020). Under PMKVY (2016-2020), training is provided in various sectors including sports. Qualification Packs that have been developed for the sports sector are Fitness Trainer, Life Guard-Pool & Beach, Sports Masseur and Physical Activity Facilitator. As on 11.11.2019, 11,541 candidates have been trained under PMKVY (2016-20) under sports sector. MSDE through National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) formed the Sports, Physical Education, Fitness & Leisure Skills Council (SPEFL-SC) on 3rd July, 2015 for focused attention to the development of sports under the Skill India Initiative. The key objective of the SPEFL-SC is to create a robust and vibrant eco-system for quality education and skill development in the sports sector in the country. The mandate for SPEFL-SC, inter alia, is to carry out functional and occupational mapping and develop a catalogue of industry, develop occupations/ job roles in the sector, develop & put in place an assessment & certification mechanism for the trainers, assessors and trainees etc. NSDC has not conducted any skill gap study in Sports as yet.
