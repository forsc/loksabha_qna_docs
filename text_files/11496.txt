The Commission urged State Governments to utilise enhanced fiscal space provided through tax devolution (32% to 42%).  At present there are 828 numbers of FTCs functional in the country.  The status of FTCs as on 31.12.2019 is given at Annexure -IIn furtherance to the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, the Union of India has finalized a scheme in August 2019 for setting up of 1023 Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) across the Country for expeditious disposal of cases related to rape and Prevention of Children against Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act.
