ANSWER




                                                        The MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) & (b) As informed by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), 57.3 crore RuPay Cards have been issued as on 30.10.2019, out of which 43.02 crore cards (75%) have been issued by Public Sector Banks (PSBs) and their Regional Rural Banks (RRBs). The number of active RuPay cards is dynamic in nature and keeps on changing on real time basis. State-wise data on issue of RuPay cards and active RuPay cards is not centrally maintained.(c) & (d) Keeping in view the wider acceptability of RuPay card and the role it is playing in facilitating banking transactions by customers/merchants at an affordable cost, Public Sector Banks have been requested to issue RuPay card, in the event of customer not indicating any specific card preference.Also, as per Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) Master Direction on Know Your Customer (KYC) dated 25.02.2016 (updated as on May 29, 2019), Banks carry out authentication of the customer’s Aadhaar number using e-KYC authentication facility provided by the Unique Identification Authority of India upon receipt of the customer’s declaration that he is desirous of receiving any benefit or subsidy under any scheme notified under section 7 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 (18 of 2016) in his account. They also carry out Aadhaar authentication / off-line verification of an individual, who voluntarily uses his Aadhaar number for verification purpose. As informed by banks, as on 22.11.2019, approximately 86.9% of the Current Accounts & Savings Accounts (CASA) are Aadhaar seeded (excluding the states of Assam, Meghalaya and UTs of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh).*****
