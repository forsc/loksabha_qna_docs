Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has notified Food Safety and Standards (Packaging) Regulations, 2018 prescribing standards for materials coming in contact with food products, including packaging materials. FSSAI has been continuously working on the   packaging regulations to accommodate more environment–friendly materials and alternatives to plastics. Ministry of Food Processing Industries is implementing R&D schemes to fund the research and development in the field of food processing sector including packaging for processed food. Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology(IIFPT) has laid thrust on the development of biodegradable packaging materials such as bioplastics, edible cutlery, tableware from agriculture waste for packaging of processed foods such as snacks and confectionery packing.*****
