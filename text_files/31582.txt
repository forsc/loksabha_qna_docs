ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR HEAVY INDUSTRIES(SHRI KRISHAN PAL GURJAR)(a):	Since Industry is a State Subject, Ministry of Heavy Industries does not maintain any centralized data regarding pollution and emission due to Heavy Industries.  The notified standards for polluting industries are enforced by State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) / Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) in the consent to operate order issued under the Water Act and the Air Act, and disposal of hazardous wastes of such industries are handled under the Hazardous and other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016.(b) to (d):	As per information received from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), as such there is no scheme to incentivise heavy industries to adopt sustainable technologies to reduce their environmental impact by CPCB/SPCBs/PCCs. However, highly polluting industries have to provide Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) for effluent treatment and Air Pollution Control Devices (APCDs) to control source emission / fugitive dust emission to comply with effluent / emission standards /norms.  The units are encouraged to reduce their wastewater generation by reuse/recycle of wastewater and use of best available technology. Sustainable technology assures that the cost of pollution control measures will remain within the affordability of the industrial units i.e. the annual Burden (AB) to Annual Turnover (AT) ratio. However, this Ministry launched the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) Scheme in 2015 with an aim to reduce dependency on fossil fuel and to address issues of vehicular emissions.  At present, Phase-II of FAME India Scheme is being implemented for a period of 5 years w.e.f.  01st April, 2019 with a total budgetary support of Rs. 10,000 crores.  This phase focusses on supporting electrification of public & shared transportation and aims to support, through subsidies, 7090 e-Buses, 5 lakh e-3 Wheelers, 55000 e-4 Wheeler Passenger Cars and 10 lakh e-2 Wheelers.  In addition, creation of charging infrastructure is also supported to address range anxiety among users of electric vehicles.  Under FAME India Phase – I, about 2.8 lakh hybrid and electric vehicles are supported by way of demand incentive amounting to Rs 359 crore (Approx.).  This has resulted in saving of approximately 95 million litres of fuel and reduction of about 236 million Kg of CO2 as on 7 Dec, 2021.  The FAME-II scheme has currently incentivized about 176327 electric vehicles as on 07 Dec, 2021.
