ANSWER




(a) to (e): As per the 11th BRICS Summit 2019 declaration during the summit it was emphasized on the importance of our collective action in promoting research and development of medicines and diagnostic tools to end epidemics, to combat communicable diseases and to facilitate access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines, as well as activities to strengthen non-communicable diseases prevention. Considering the need to overcome barriers to access to affordable, efficacious, safe and quality medical products, vaccines and other health technologies and other aspects, BRICS regulators have agreed on the draft Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on co-operation in the field of regulation of Medical products. As per MoU the area of cooperation includes, Medical products regulation, GMP regulation and Overseas inspections, Clinical trial regulation, Medical devices regulation, Regulation of biological products, Quality of medical products etc. as well as Laying down modalities for exchange of regulatory and public health information for routine and/or emergency purposes.xxxxx
