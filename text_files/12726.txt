ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILZERS(D.V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a):    Government of India is reviving five closed units of Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd. (FCIL) and Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation Ltd. (HFCL) namely Talcher, Ramagundam, Gorakhpur and Sindri units of FCIL and Barauni unit of HFCL by setting up new Urea Ammonia plants of 12.7 LMPTA capacity each through formation of Joint Ventures / Special Purpose Vehicles of nominated PSUs. These projects are being regularly reviewed / monitored by the Secretary (Fertilizers) in the Department of Fertilizers as well as by NITI Aayog and Prime Minister’s Office to ensure commissioning of the above projects in time bound manner. (b):    Since these projects are being established on FCIL / HFCL’s land and no fresh land has been acquired, therefore, question for compensation of farmers for land does not arise. (c):	Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilizers Ltd (MFCL) has converted their Urea plant to operate on Gas as feed stock (from Naphtha as feed stock) in June, 2014. MFCL singed Gas Supply Agreement and Gas Transmission Agreement with IOC and GAIL respectively. However, the Plant has not got pipeline connectivity from Kochi to Mangalore so far.  After getting pipeline connectivity, MFCL will be supplied with RLNG at the price as per the Gas supply contract and PNGRB guidelines (not at subsidised rate) and pooled gas price shall be made applicable for subsidy mechanism as per the extant Policy dated 20th May 2015 for “Pooling of gas in Fertilizer (Urea) Sector.”********
