ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI AJAY KUMAR MISHRA)(a) to (f):	‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The  responsibilities  to  maintain  law  and order, protection of life and property of the citizens, including investigation, handling complaints on wrongful arrest of a person, and prosecution of crimes, rest with the respective State Governments. The State Governments are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provisions of laws and their respective police manuals. Data on wrongful arrests and false cases thereon, are not maintained centrally. The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, provides for arrest of persons, and compensation payable to persons arrested groundlessly. The Indian Penal Code 1860, provides for the States/ Union Territories to take action against police officials for falsely charging a person. ******
