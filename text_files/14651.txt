                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (e) Government of Kerala has noted the impact of climate change, including increase in temperature,as a serious issue for State development and sustenance. State Government is undertaking serious efforts for formulation of adaptation strategies in all sectors. Government of Kerala is revising its State Action Plan on Climate Change taking into account the increase in temperature and other extreme events. The State Government has also sanctioned modeling studies, as per Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change – Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC-AR5), to Directorate of Environment and Climate Change. An Institute of Climate Change Studies has been set up under Kerala State Council for Science and Technology for climate change related studies. Climate change is a global phenomenon. In India, the major GHG emission is from energy sector, while other sectors like agriculture, industrial processes and product use, waste etc. also contribute to it. However, Government of Kerala has noted the impact of increase in temperature and adaptation measures have been initiated by departments such as health and Disaster Management Authority.****
