                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a): 	The number of persons covered under the Act in the State of Madhya Pradesh, Union Territory (UT) of Jammu & Kashmir and Union Territory of Ladakh, at present, is as follows:Name of the States/UTs	Number of persons covered under the NFSA (In lakh)Madhya Pradesh	546.42Jammu & Kashmir	72.05Ladakh	1.44(b)& (c): 	Allocation of foodgrains to States/Union Territories (UTs) under the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) is made on the basis of State/UT-wise coverage of population determined by the then Planning Commission, identification of beneficiaries by States/UTs within the coverage, and foodgrains entitlement prescribed under the Act i.e. 35 kg per household per month for households covered under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana and 5 kg per person per month for Priority households. The Act further provides that if on the above basis, annual foodgrains allocation to any State/UT is lower than the average annual offtake during 2010-11 to 2012-13 under erstwhile normal Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), the same shall be protected. Thus, the question of gap between demand and supply does not arise.****
