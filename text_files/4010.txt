Further, with a view to ensure better transparency, accountability of all stakeholders including insurance companies and banks,  timely payment of claims to the farmers and to make the scheme more farmer friendly, Government has comprehensively revised the Operational Guidelines of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) which have become effective from Rabi 2018-19.    The accountability on insurance companies has further been ensured by the provision of imposing 12% penalty on insurance companies for delay/non-settlement of claims.  Provisions for performance evaluation of insurance companies with various punitive actions including de-empanelment of insurance companies have also been incorporated in revised Operational Guidelines implemented w.e.f. Rabi 2018-19 season.  Further, the banks have been made responsible to pay eligible claims, if any farmer is deprived from benefits under the scheme due to errors/omissions/commissions of banks. ********
