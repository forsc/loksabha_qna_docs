Further, Digital India has also helped in delivery of substantial services to citizens with no leakages and directly to the beneficiary. Digital India is an umbrella programme that covers multiple projects of various central Ministries/Departments & States/UTs. Each project has its own budgetary requirement and accordingly project-plan has been charted out by the implementing Ministries/Departments and budget details are being maintained by concerned Ministries/Departments & States/UTs. The status of some of the key initiatives undertaken by MeitY under Digital India programme in the state of Karnataka is as follows:•	Common Services Centre (CSC): The Common Services Centres project aims to set-up at least one CSC at 2.50 lakh Gram Panchayats(GPs) across the country, for delivery of various Government to Citizen(G2C) and other citizen centric e-Services.
