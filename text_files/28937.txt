ANSWER




MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ??????? ?????? (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b): Crops like tur/Arhar, groundnut, jowar and bajra are not cultivated substantially in Bihar. Market price of maize is almost at par with MSP of maize in October, 2021. Procurement of summer moong is not done by the state government since surplus was not available in the market. The harvesting of paddy is still going on in many districts of Bihar and  the procurement of paddy  has started since 01.11.2021.(c) & (d):   Government of India implements Price Support Scheme (PSS) under the umbrella scheme of PM-AASHA for procurement of Fair Average Quality (FAQ) of pulses & oilseeds at Minimum Support Price through Central Nodal Agencies as and when the market price of these commodities falls below the notified MSP and proposals are received from the State/UT Government. National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) is one of the Central Nodal Agencies for procurement of pulses & oilseeds under Price Support Scheme (PSS) at Minimum Support Price (MSP).The detail of procurement of pulses under PSS at MSP by NAFED since 2019 during Kharif and Rabi Seasons is at annexure.(e) & (f) : Government extends price support for paddy and wheat through the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and State Agencies. Under this policy, whatever food grains are offered by farmers within the stipulated period & conforming to the specifications prescribed by Government are purchased at Minimum Support Price (MSP) by the State Government agencies including FCI for Central Pool. It aims to service the National Food Security Act (NFSA) and other welfare schemes of the Government so that subsidized food grains are supplied to the poor and needy, and to build up buffer stocks of food grains to ensure food grain security. Further, different types of nutri-cereals and maize are also procured by State Governments itself in consultation with FCI to the extent that the concerned State Government may utilise the same for distribution under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) as well as Other Welfare Schemes (OWS).Oilseeds & pulses of Fair Average Quality (FAQ) are procured from registered farmers under Price Support Scheme under Umbrella Scheme of Pradhan Mantri AnnadataAaySanraksHan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA), as per its prescribed guidelines at MSP in consultation with the concerned State Government. Under PM-AASHA, States / UTs are offered to choose either Price Support Scheme (PSS) or Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) in a given procurement season with respect to particular oilseeds crop for the entire State. Further, States have the option to roll out Private Procurement and Stockist Scheme (PPSS) on pilot basis in district / selected APMC(s) of district involving the participation of private stockist for oilseeds.
