ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b)	According to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions since the pre-industrial era have driven large increases in their atmospheric concentrations. Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has monitored the glacier advance and retreat of 2018 glaciers, across the Indian Himalayan region using satellite data of 2000-01 to 2010-11. The study shows that 87% of glaciers showed no change, 12% glaciers retreated, and 1% glaciers have advanced. Recent mass balance studies for some Himalayan glaciers conducted by Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) under Department of Science & Technology (DST) and a study published in Science Advances have revealed that majority of Himalayan glaciers are melting or retreating at varying rates. The rate of the recession has seen an upward trend in the second half of the last century though no abnormal trend of melting has been documented. The studies have also shown that large glaciers with an area more than 10 km2 are unlikely to get affected appreciably in the coming years. However, small glaciers of area 1-2 km2 or less than 1 km2 may show rapid changes. Research projects have been funded in different parts of the Indian Himalayan Region to generate strategic knowledge on the current status and impact of climate change on the Indian Himalayan glaciers. (c)	The government is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) with a view to enhance the ecological sustainability of India’s development path and address climate change in all regions of the country. NAPCC comprises, inter alia, of eight National Missions including National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Eco-system (NMSHE). NMSHE is aimed at evolving management measures for sustaining and safeguarding the Himalayan glaciers and mountain ecosystem. The mission includes enhanced monitoring of the Himalayan ecosystem through the establishment of the monitoring network, promoting community-based management, human resource development and strengthening regional cooperation. Government has prepared guidelines entitled “Governance for Sustaining Himalayan Ecosystem”, (G-SHE), which have been shared with all state governments in the Himalayan region. All Himalayan states have also prepared their respective State Action Plans to address the state-specific issues.(d) and (e) The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy plans to set up solar power projects, one of 50 MW capacity in Leh by Solar Energy Corporation of India Ltd. and another with cumulative capacity of around 14 MW with battery storage capacity of 42 MWh in Leh and Kargil under the Prime Minister Development Package 2015 for Jammu and Kashmir. The Government has notified Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016 for environmentally sound management of plastic waste and to prevent plastic pollution in the country. Earlier, the Government of Jammu and Kashmir had notified on 18.06.2008 a complete ban on the use, storage and sale of plastic carry bags and a ban on disposable plates, disposable cups and tumblers, disposable spoons, forks and knives on 26.03.2019. Further, the Public Works Department of the Union Territory of Ladakh has decided to use plastic waste in the construction of bituminous roads.***
