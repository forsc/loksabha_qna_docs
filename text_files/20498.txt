                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c):	As per International Diabetes Federation, the estimated number of diabetes patients and juvenile diabetes patents in India are as under:Year	Total diabetes patients (20-79 years)	Juvenile diabetes patients (0-19 years)2015	69 million	NA2017	73 million	128,5002019	77 million	171,281The Government of India with the support from UNICEF has conducted the first ever Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) during the year 2016 to 2018 in 30 States.  As per survey report, the prevalence of diabetes was low among both children (1.2%) and adolescents (0.7%). However, 10.3% of school-age children (5-9 years) and 10.4% of adolescents (10-19 years) were found as pre-diabetic based on fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels in the blood.(d):	Public Health is a state subject. The Central Government, however, supplements the efforts of the State Governments. National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) is being implemented under National Health Mission (NHM) with focus on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, health promotion & awareness generation, early diagnosis, management and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. To tackle the challenge of Non Communicable Diseases, 638 NCD Clinics at District level and 4464 NCD Clinics at Community Health Centre level have been set up under the NPCDCS. An initiative of prevention, control and screening for common Non Communicable Disease (NCDs) (diabetes, hypertension and common cancers viz oral breast and cervical cancer) has also been rolled out under NHM, as a part of comprehensive primary healthcare. Under this initiative, frontline health workers such as Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANM), inter alia, are leveraged to carry out population based screening and generate awareness about the risk factors of NCDs among the masses. The initiative is under implementation in 682 districts across the country. Screening for common NCDs including diabetes is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centres. Under NHM, support is provided to States/UTs through their Programme Implementation Plans(PIPs) for primary and secondary health care needs. The treatment in Government Hospital is either free or highly subsidized for the poor and needy. Under National Health Mission, essential drugs and diagnostics are provided free of cost in public health facilities. Quality generic medicines are being made available at affordable prices to all, under “Jan Aushadhi Scheme in collaboration with the State Governments. Also, AMRIT (Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment) Pharmacy stores have been set up in hospitals, where essential life saying medicines including for diabetes are being provided at a substantial discount vis-à-vis the Maximum Retails Price.
