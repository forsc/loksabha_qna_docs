ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a)	Ministry of Minority Affairs has tied up with the apex body of handicraft exporters in the country as a part of the Hunar Haat to promote exports of products/handicrafts of artisans and craftpersons at a wider international level by strengthening the export orientation of artisans through training & capacity building, product & design development, e-commerce, marketing and export promotions. This Ministry hasnot undertaken any study on India''s competitiveness of the Handicrafts Sector at the global level, as the sector is unorganised in nature. (b) Hunar Haat is an effective platform wherein opportunity is given to artisans/craftsmen and culinary experts from across the country to showcase and market their handicrafts and indigenous products. Hunar Haat is helping in promotion and preservation of languishing traditional arts, crafts and indigenous products which is playing an effective role in the pledge of Swadeshi se Swavalamban’’ and ‘Vocal for Local’ thereby contributing to the objectives of Aatmanirbhar Bharat. Hunar Haat has generated employment and employment opportunities for artisans, craftpersons and associated persons and has further strengthened their market linkages. A total of 34 Hunar Haats have been organized since November, 2016, in New Delhi, Mumbai, Prayagraj, Lucknow, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Puducherry, Bhopal, Indore, Ranchi, Mysuru, Panaji, Dehradun, Vrindavan, Rampur, Surat etc and amount of Rs.89.24 crores has been sanctioned for the Hunar Haat. More than 7 lakh artisans, craftsmen and people associated with them have been benefitted through various Hunar Haats organized by the Ministry.(c) Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK) scheme of Ministry of Minority Affairs a total of 9 units of Hunar Hubs have been approved at a total cost of Rs.2396 Lakhs.*****
