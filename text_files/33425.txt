ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)and (b)India is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), its Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement (PA), which provide a global framework for countries to collectively address climate change.Global warming is a continuous process. Hence, the actions across ministries and departments are also evolving in keeping with new data and increased scientific knowledge on the subject. The Government has submitted its Nationally Determined Contributions under PA for combating climate change.These include, inter alia, quantified targets pertaining to reduce the emissions intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level, to achieve about 40% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, and to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2eq through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.The Government is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), which provides the overarching policy framework for mitigation in emission of greenhouse gases and for adapting to impacts of climate change. NAPCC comprises of National Missions in specificareas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan eco-system,sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. Further, 33States/Union Territories have prepared State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs) consistent with the objectives of NAPCC.Government is committed to sustainable development and low carbon transition across key economic sectors, at a pace and scale that is nationally determined and reflects a fair contribution to the global efforts for combating climate change. (c) Education and awareness on global warming and climate is undertaken at all levels by all concerned ministries and departments and their constituent organizations for the general public.Environmental Education has been made a part of the school curriculum. The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005 formulated by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)emphasizes environmental protection and generating awareness amongst school students and teachers. Environmental concerns and concepts, including climate change, have been incorporated in the curricula developed by the NCERT. Environment is one of the themes of the State level and National level Science exhibitions organized by the NCERT every year.The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) is implementing the Environment Education, Awareness and Training (EEAT) scheme with the objective, inter alia, of promoting environmental awareness and the mobilization of students’ participation for environmental conservation. Grants-in-aid are sanctioned under this scheme for two major programmes, namely, National Green Corps (NGC) Programme and National Nature Camping Programme (NNCP). Under the NGC programme, more than 1 Lakh Eco-clubs have been formed in schools and colleges to educate students and to spread awareness on environmental issues including climate change aspects. The Eco-clubs undertake various activities like plantation drives, cleanliness drives, celebration of important environmental days, awareness and capacity building on solid waste management through waste segregation, etc. The mantra of L.I.F.E (Lifestyle for Environment) shared by India at 26th Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC(COP 26), propagates the values of mindful and deliberate utilisation as opposed to destructive consumption, creating a movement for three Ps – “Pro Planet People”.Under the ambit of the Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav, MoEFCC is encouraging students to adopt Green Good Deeds. These are simple, practical steps that students can undertake in their day to day life  to adopt an environment-friendly lifestyle. A Green Pledge initiative undertaken by MoEFCC during October 4 to 10, 2021 saw the online participation of more than 7.5 Lakh students. *****
