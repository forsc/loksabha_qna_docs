ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE					(SHRI AJAY BHATT)IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE   (a) The details of soldiers martyred due to counter terrorist operations during last three years are as under:S. No.	Year	Security Forces killed in Terror attacks*(i)	2019	80(ii)	2020	62(iii)	2021 (upto June)	16	*incl CAPF(b)  Terrorists carry out violent actions to destabilize the situation in J&K.  The Security Forces are combating terrorist activities along the LC by eliminating the infiltration bids and in the hinterland by carrying out Counter Terrorist Operations/responding to Terrorist initiated incidents.	The Army carries out periodical review and refinement of the operating procedures and security arrangements of all its camps/garrisons/installations, based on threat assessment and analysis of past incidents.  Based on these reviews, suitable drills and procedures are adopted to counter such threats.  Some of the measures employed are as follows:(i)	Appraisal and upgradation of intelligence gathering capabilities.(ii)	Provision of suitable weapons and equipment to soldiers.(iii)	Drills to counter terrorist actions are refined and rehearsed.(iv)	Upgradation of perimeter defence and surveillance capability.(v)	Timely casualty evacuation and adequacy of medical facilities.(c)  The security situation in J&K is dynamic and ever-evolving.  Though fragile, the security environment has witnessed significant improvement in past two years and steps are being taken in all domains to effect irreversible damages on terrorist tanzeems and eliminate the scourge of terrorism.  However, laying down a time limit for elimination of the last terrorist may not be feasible as Pakistan continues to provide ideological, diplomatic and financial support to proxy war in J&K by infiltrating terrorists into the Valley and smuggling weapons, ammunition & narcotics across the LC including use of drones and other measures.*****
