ANSWER




MINISTERY OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a)   As per the Human Development Report 2020 of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), India is ranked 131 out of 189 countries with a score of 0.645. As per the Human Development Report 2019, India ranked 129th out of 189 countries with a score of 0.647. Human Development Index (HDI) ranks countries by HDI Values. HDI has three Dimensions, (i) Long and Healthy Life, (ii) Knowledge, and (iii) Decent Standard of Living. Therefore, overall performance on HDI depends on the performance on each of these three domains. As per the table given below, it can be observed that the overall score of India in the HDI has improved over the years:  Component	Human Development Report	2015	2016	2018	2019	2020HDI rank	130	131	130	129	131HDI score	0.609	0.624	0.640	0.647	0.645  (b) to (e): Malnutrition is not included as part of the dimension of the Human Development Index. However, the Government of India has accorded high priority to the issue of malnutrition and is implementing several Schemes/Programmes through State/UTs to address aspects related to nutrition. The Ministry of Women & Child Development implements the Anganwadi Services Scheme, POSHAN Abhiyaan, Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana and Scheme for Adolescent Girls under the Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services Scheme (ICDS) as targeted interventions for children upto the age of 6 years, Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers and Adolescent Girls, throughout the country.      In Budget 2021-22, Government has announced Mission Poshan 2.0 with focus on convergence, governance, capacity building and nutritional reforms to strengthen nutritional content, delivery, outreach and outcomes for addressing malnutrition. In addition, ''Poshan Tracker'', a robust ICT enabled platform, has been launched in March, 2021 to ensure real time monitoring of provisioning of supplementary nutrition by use of data analytics for prompt supervision and management of services. The system shall enable real-time monitoring and tracking of all AWCs, AWWs and beneficiaries on       defined indicators.      The National Health Mission (NHM), a flagship programme of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, addresses malnutrition by promotion of appropriate Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices, Anaemia Mukt Bharat, Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) supplementation, de-worming, promotion of iodized salt, Vitamin-A supplementation, Mission Indradhanush to ensure high coverage of vaccination in children, conducting intensified diarrhoea control fortnights to control childhood diarrhoea, management of severely malnourished children at Nutrition Rehabilitation Centers, monthly Village Health and Nutrition Days, Home Based New born Care (HBNC) and Home Based Young Child Care (HBYC) programmes, Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram, etc.  *****
