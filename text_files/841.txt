ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a)	The India Post Payments Bank has been incorporated as a Public Limited Company with 100% Government of India (GOI) equity on 17.08.2016, under Department of Posts, Ministry of Communications. (b)	IPPB was launched cross the country on Sept 1, 2018. IPPB has enabled more than 1,35,000 Banking Access Points, out of which 1,10,000 are in rural areas, thereby increasing the rural banking infrastructure by 2.5 times. More than 2,00,000 Doorstep Banking Service Providers (Postmen and Gramin Dak Sevaks) have been trained and certified to provide a comprehensive suite of banking services including completely paperless and instant Account Opening, Cash Deposits/ Withdrawal, Money transfers, Bill Payments and Government to Citizen (G2C) Payments.  The benefits provided by India Post Payments are at Annexure I(c)	As per the approved plan 650 IPPB branches (almost one in each district) have been set up and functional across all the States and Union Territories, details of which are at Annexure – II.(d) 	IPPB is focused towards building a less cash and digital economy and enabling digital financial inclusion at the last mile. With these objectives, IPPB has enabled approximately 200,000 doorstep banking service providers with micro-ATM devices (Smartphone and biometric device) to provide a full suite of banking services (including Cash Deposits/ Withdrawal, Account Opening, Money transfers, Bill Payments and DBT distribution) at the customer’s doorstep. Therefore, IPPB has not invested in physical ATMs.Further considering low penetration of ATMs in rural India, IPPB has established linkages with all the interoperable Payment and Settlement Systems (UPI, IMPS, NEFT etc.) to enable digital transactions and hence has not issued any Debit Cards.(e)	 IPPB is in early stages of discussion with various global & domestic institutions to enhance its product suite, as per the Payment Bank guidelines governing third party products.
