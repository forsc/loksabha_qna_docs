                         THE MINISTER OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                                 (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) & (b): Yes, Sir. Land and Colonization are State Subjects. Therefore, Schemes on housing are implemented by States/ UTs. However, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs under the vision of ‘Housing for All’ by 2022, is supplementing the efforts of States/ UTs by providingcentral assistance under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana- Urban (PMAY-U) for construction of houses for all eligible families/ beneficiaries since 25.06.2015. There are no targets under PMAY-U Scheme. Based on the demand, State/UT Government prepares project proposals under PMAY-U and after due approval of State Level Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee (SLSMC) submits to the Ministry for sanctioning. Against the demand of 1.12 crore houses as validated by States/ UTs in 2017, so far 1.14 crore have been sanctioned by the Ministry under PMAY-U. The State/ UT-wise demand and sanction of houses including Rajasthan is at Annexure.(c) to (e): The Ministry has sanctioned all project proposals for providing houses to eligible beneficiaries as proposed and duly approved by States/UTs. No fresh demand is pending with the Ministry for further approval. The Ministry is open to sanction proposals received from States/UTs till the Mission period.
