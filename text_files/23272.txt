The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) has partnership with UAE and Japan for skill development of the Indian youth.A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between MSDE and the National Qualifications Authority, UAE on 29th April 2016 to collaborate in mutual recognition of qualifications to benefit Indians who aspire to work overseas. National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) is working with Ministry of Human Resource and Emiritization (MoHRE) and Abu Dhabi Quality & Conformity Council (ADQCC) for benchmarking qualifications, assessment & certification.Under the India – UAE Skill Harmonization Program, a pilot program to operationalize the benchmarking of 16 UAE skill qualifications to 13 Indian skill qualifications in construction and automotive has been successfully conducted. Incentives like visa rebates to employers for hiring certified workers from India are being provided by Government of UAE.    	Organisations from Kerala, West Bengal and Jharkhand were involved in the operationalisation of the pilot for India – UAE Skill Harmonisation Program conducted in 2019. Under the collaboration between NSDC, Emirates Driving Institute (EDI) and Youth Chamber of Commerce (YCC), a pilot program for 100 bike/car drivers is being operationalised at Ajmer Driver Training Institute, Rajasthan in collaboration with Learnet Skills Limited.	In November, 2016, this Ministry and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, Government of Japan signed a Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) for a period of ten years on the Manufacturing Skill Transfer Promotion Programme. Under this MoC, the Japanese companies based in India have launched  13 Japan India Institutes for Manufacturing  (JIMs) and 5 Japanese Endowed Courses (JEC) in various States viz. Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Kerala, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Assam.  Under the Technical Intern Training Programme (TITP), in which Indian youth are sent on internship to Japan after providing a basic training in India, 220 candidates have been sent to Japan under various sectors such as Agriculture, Construction, Manufacturing, and healthcare. There is no proposal under consideration for opening of new Centres in the near future in States/UTs including Bihar.
