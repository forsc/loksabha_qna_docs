ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TOURISM (INDEPENDENT CHARGE)(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) & (b):	Yes, Sir.  The Ministry of Tourism (MoT) has recognized Adventure Tourism as a Niche Tourism product to promote India as a 365 days’ destination and attract tourists with specific interest. A Task Force on Adventure Tourism was set up in 2016 to act as a forum for development and promotion of Adventure Tourism in the country. Development and promotion of tourism is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments/UTs Administration. However, Ministry of Tourism provides Central Financial Assistance to State Governments/UT Administrations for development of tourism infrastructure which also include Adventure Tourism destinations in the country under the Swadesh Darshan scheme for Integrated Development of Tourism circuits.The MoT under its voluntary scheme grants approval to bonafide Adventure Tour Operators as per Guidelines laid down in this respect. Further, Adventure Tourism is regularly highlighted for promotion as part of the Incredible India Campaign in the print, electronic, online and outdoor media in India and abroad as well as at the various travel trade exhibitions overseas. In order to minimize the risk associated with adventure activities and for the safety of the tourists, the Ministry of Tourism along with the Adventure Tour Operators Association of India (ATOAI) has launched the “Indian Adventure Tourism Guidelines (Version 2.0) – 2018” on ''Safety and Quality Norms for Adventure Tourism in India''. The guidelines list the basic minimum standards for adventure tourism and covers 31 verticals involving the land, air and water-based activities. All the State Governments/UT Administrations have been advised to adopt and implement these Guidelines in order to minimize the risk associated with such activities and provide a system of search and rescue for tourism activities. The Ministry of Tourism had launched a campaign ‘777 days of Incredible Indian Himalayas’ on 27th September 2013 to promote the tourism potential of the Indian Himalayas. The Adventure Tour Operators Association of India has appreciated this initiative of the Ministry of Tourism. The Ministry of Tourism also extends financial support for capacity building/training programmes in the adventure tourism sector.(c) & (d):	The Govt. of India, Ministry of Tourism has not received any proposal in this regard from the State Govt. of Telangana for financial grants.********
