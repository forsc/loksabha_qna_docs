ANSWER




                                                        ???????? ??? ?????? ?????? (???? ????? ????) THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI  PIYUSH GOYAL)(a):	Yes Sir. Owing to the cross cutting nature of e-Commerce, different laws and  regulations across sectors govern the present e-Commerce activities, some of which are; Income Tax Act, 1961, Consumer Protection Act, 1986, Information Technology Act, 2000, Foreign Exchange Management Act, 2000, Payment And Settlement Systems Act 2007, Companies Act, 2013 and laws related to Goods and Services Tax. (b):	Yes Sir. Competition Act, 2002, lays down the framework for regulating predatory pricing and anti-competitive agreements, including vertical restraints. Conduct of e-Commerce players enjoying a position of dominance in the relevant market, and proposed merger or amalgamation of e-Commerce firms, whether in India or off-shore,  having an impact on competition in India is subject to the scrutiny under this Act.(c):	A draft National e-Commerce policy has been prepared and placed in public domain. Comments from various stakeholders (companies, Industry associations, think tanks, foreign governments) have been received. Meetings have been held under the chairmanship of Minister for Commerce & Industry with industry stakeholders, e-Commerce companies, associations of kirana stores, traders and retailers to discuss matters relating to e-commerce. They have been asked for their inputs/ suggestions on the draft e-Commerce Policy. *****
