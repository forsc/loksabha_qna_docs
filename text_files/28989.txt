ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL) (a) to (d) Ministry of Panchayati Raj has undertaken intensive engagement and consultations with the States/Union Territories to revitalize the Gram Sabhas, which are Constitutionally mandated bodies, so that they may be strengthened to overcome poor attendance and poor representation and empowered to oversee implementation of various developmental programmes of the Government. A discussion paper on the subject "Making Gram Sabhas Vibrant" was circulated to all States/Union Territories, which was followed by several consultations through Video Conference meetings with States/Union Territories. During these meetings various aspects of the discussion paper were deliberated upon and valuable suggestions were received from States/Union Territories such as increasing frequency of holding Gram Sabha meetings, ensuring maximum attendance in the Gram Sabha, strengthening the role of Ward Members and formation of standing sub-committees of the Gram Panchayat. In pursuance of the decisions taken in these meetings, advisories were issued in August 2021 to all States/Union Territories emphasizing increase in frequency of Gram Sabhas, ensuring quorum, preparation of schedule of meetings, compulsory participation of senior officers in the Gram Sabha meetings, strengthening the role of Ward Members and formation of standing sub-committees of the Gram Panchayat.***
