                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (d) Central Ground Water Board is periodically monitoring the ground water levels throughout the Country on a regional scale, through a network of monitoring wells. In order to assess the decline in water level on a long-term basis, Pre-monsoon water level data collected by CGWB during Pre-monsoon 2019 has been compared with the decadal average (2009-2018). Analysis of water level data indicates that about 61% of the wells monitored have registered decline in ground water levels (Annexure). Hon’ble Prime Minister has written a letter to all Sarpanchs on 08.06.2019 regarding the importance of water conservation and rain harvesting and exhorted them to adopt all appropriate measures to make water conservation a mass movement.An ‘Inter Ministerial Committee’ under the Chairmanship of Secretary (WR, RD & GR) has been constituted to take forward the subject of ‘Water Conservation Related Activities for Optimum Utilization of Monsoon Rainfall’ which meets from time to time to discuss the issue of water conservation. The Committee includes officers from different States/UTs. Last meeting of the Inter-Ministerial Committee was held on 01/05/2019.Cabinet Secretary discussed the issue of water conservation with the Chief Secretaries of the States through video-conference on 21.05.2019.The issue was also discussed with the concerned Ministers and officials of the State Governments by Minister Jal Shakti in a meeting held on 11.6.2019.Government of India has launched the Jal Shakti Abhiyan which is a time bound campaign with a mission mode approach intended to improve water availability including ground water conditions in the water stressed blocks.
