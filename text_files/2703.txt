ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d)	 Under the Skill India Mission, there are about 20 Central Ministries/Departments including Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) involved in the implementation of more than 40 schemes for various skill development programmes.Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is implementing a flagship scheme called Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) 2016-20 with an objective to provide skilling to one crore prospective youth for four years i.e. 2016-2020 under Short Term Training (STT) courses and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) across the country. STT is being imparted to school/college dropouts/ unemployed youth at accredited and affiliated Training Centres (TCs). Under RPL, individuals with prior learning experience or skills are assessed and certified. It aims to align the competencies of the unregulated workforce of the country to the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF).Orientation of candidates under RPL component of PMKVY 2016-20 is being implemented through four types of projects namely RPL Camps, RPL at Employer’s Premises, RPL centres and Best-in-Class Employer. RPL in Camp mode is suitable where a certain group / cluster of candidates with particular skill sets are concentrated. These candidates are provided with a mandatory orientation of 12 hours. Under RPL Camps, as on 12.06.2019, 7,66,399 candidates have been oriented across the country, out of which, 96,454 candidates are in State of Maharashtra. Further, under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) 2016-20, Kaushal Melas, a camp based approach, is being organized periodically by Training Providers (TPs) / Training Centres (TCs) for building awareness, counselling and mobilization of candidates. Local administration, local municipal and Panchayat bodies have been involved in this activity to ensure widest possible reach and create an environment for skilling in the country. During Apr’18 to May’19, 845 Kaushal Melas were organized across the country, out of which, 31 were organized in State of Maharashtra.
