ANSWER




(a)& (b): Yes Sir. As per the information received from the port offices of CDSCO, the quantity of raw materials imported for the formulation of antibiotic medicines in the country during each of the last three years is as follows:Year	Quantity of raw materials imported for the formulation of antibiotic medicines in the country (in MTs)2019	11230.502018	12006.112017	5591.44(c) & (d) The policies formulated by Government from time to time are designed to minimize country’s dependence on imports and to give fillip to indigenous manufacturing. In this direction, the Government has withdrawn exemption of customs duty on certain categories of Bulk Drugs/APIs which are used in the manufacture of some of the Antibiotics, to provide a level playing field to the domestic manufactures. The Department of Pharmaceuticals has formulated a Scheme namely ‘Assistance to Bulk Drug Industry for Common Facility Centre’ for providing assistance to Bulk Drug Industry for Common Facility Centre in any upcoming bulk drug park promoted by State Governments/State Corporations. An Inter-Ministerial Task Force was also constituted under the Chairmanship of the Minister of State (Chemicals & Fertilizers) on 18.04.2018 to formulate a roadmap for the enhanced production of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) in the country. Further, The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and CDSCO have taken following measures to encourage indigenous manufacturing of drugs:-(i)	Drug manufacturing license, sale license and approval of drug testing laboratory shall remain valid, if licensee deposits a license retention fee as prescribed, before the expiry of a period of every succeeding five years from the date of its issue, unless it is suspended or cancelled by the licensing authority.(ii)	Vide Notification No. G.S.R. 1193 (E) dated 12/12/2018, amended the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 wherein application fees have been increased for grant of various Import Registration certificate as well as Overseas Inspection.xxxxx
