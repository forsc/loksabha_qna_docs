The total outlay of the scheme is Rs. 18,100 Crore for a period of 5 years.  The scheme envisages to establish a competitive ACC battery manufacturing set up in the country (50 GWh).  Additionally, 5GWh of niche ACC technologies is also covered under the Scheme.  The scheme proposes a production linked subsidy based on applicable subsidy per KWh and percentage of value addition achieved on actual sales made by the manufacturers who set up production units.(c): 	Sir, the Ministry of Heavy Industries supported 520 Charging Stations/ Infrastructure under the phase-I of FAME India Scheme.  Out of 520 charging stations, 452 charging stations have been installed as on 03.12.2021.
