SADANANDA GOWDA)(a) to (c):    The Department of Pharmaceuticals has recently launched following five schemes for promoting domestic manufacturing of Pharmaceutical drugs including bulk drugs and medical devices by attracting large investments in the sector to ensure their sustainable domestic supply and thereby reduce India’s import dependence on other countries:-  (I)    Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for promotion of domestic manufacturing of critical Key Starting Materials (KSMs)/ Drug Intermediates (DIs) and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) In India: Under the scheme, financial incentive will be given for manufacturing of 41 Key Starting Materials (KSMs)/ Drug Intermediates (DIs) and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs).
