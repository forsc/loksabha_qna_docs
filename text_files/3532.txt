The water quality is assessed for various parameters, including physico-chemical, bacteriological, heavy metals, pesticides, etc.CPCB has identified 351 polluted river stretches in the Country based on the water quality monitoring in the years 2016 and 2017. Also, during year 2015, CPCB had carried out a survey on the sewage generation and treatment    capacity available in Class – I and Class – II towns of the country. It was estimated that around 61,948 Million Litres per day (MLD) sewage is being generated from these towns against which total sewage treatment capacity available was 23,277 MLD (37%). 	The Government has taken various initiatives to check water pollution which inter alia, include  formulation and notification of standards for effluents from industries, operations or processes; enforcing of these standards by State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) through consent mechanism and regular monitoring; installation of Online Continuous Effluent Monitoring systems (OCEMS) to check the discharge of effluent directly into water bodies; creation of sewage treatment capacity of 2522.03 mld (million litres per day) under the National River Conservation Plan; promotion of cleaner production processes; installation of Common Effluent Treatment Plants for cluster of Small Scale Industrial units; issuance of directions under Section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and under Section 18(1)(b) of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, etc. Sewage treatment capacity of 2522.03 mld (million litres per day) has been created so far under the NRCP.(c ) to (e ) CPCB is monitoring and inspecting industrial units based on alerts generated from Online Continuous Effluent/ Emission Monitoring System (OCEMS) and taking appropriate action against non-complying industries as per the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. During 2016-17, CPCB has started a scheme of inspection of 17 categories of highly polluting industries based on the computer generated alerts. Industries for inspection are selected on the basis of Short Message Service (SMS) alerts generated from the online monitoring systems. A total of 592 industries have been inspected till 14.06.2019 and 347 directions issued under Section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to non-complying industries and 1 direction issued under Section 18(1)(b) of the Air and Water Acts to State Pollution Control Board. Further, CPCB has identified a total of 2743Grossly Polluting Industriesdischarging effluent into water bodies. Out of these, 2497 industries are operational and 246 industries are self-closed. Number of complying and non-complying units are 2222 and 275, respectively. ****
