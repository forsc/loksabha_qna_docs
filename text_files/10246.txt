 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)  (a):  Coal mining, like any other developmental activity, does have impacts on Environment. However, such impacts in case of coal mining is generally contained within the project area itself.(b) to (d): In order to minimize the adverse effect of coal mining on environment, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has notified the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006, as amended from time to time, under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 which deals with the process to grant Environmental Clearance. The projects of Coal Sector, as per schedule in the EIA Notification, 2006, require prior environmental clearance.               The environmental clearance is a process which involves four stages which are: Stage (1) – Screening; Stage (2) – Scoping i.e. prescribing Terms of Reference (TOR) for undertaking detailed Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Studies; Stage (3) – Public Consultation to be conducted by the respective State/ UT Pollution Control Board/ Committee and Stage (4)- Appraised by the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) as per the provisions prescribed in the EIA Notification, 2006 notified under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.
