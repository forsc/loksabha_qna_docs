ANSWER




A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b): 	India imports about 85% of its crude oil requirement. Domestic bio-fuels like ethanol reduce the nation’s dependence on imported fossil fuels; in addition its use reduces vehicular pollution, increases farmers’ income, brings new investment opportunity in rural areas thereby helping to achieve goal of Atmanirbhar Bharat.Ethanol is being produced mainly from molasses/sugarcane and damaged food-grains; but availability of these feedstocks as well as ethanol production capacity is not sufficient to achieve blending target fixed by the Government. Therefore, with a view to increase production of fuel grade ethanol for blending with petrol, Government is encouraging distilleries to produce ethanol from surplus rice available with FCI; and maize. ………2/--2-The FCI rice is sufficient in stock for food security purposes and it will continue to remain robust as procurement of paddy/rice at Minimum Support Price (MSP) continues at expected levels to meet Public Distribution System (PDS) requirement. For the period of December’2020-November’2021, 78844 MT of FCI rice has been allocated to distilleries @ Rs. 20/kg ex-FCI godown for production of ethanol out of which 22716 MT has been lifted by distilleries till 14.7.2021.(c): 	Yes Sir. During the current Ethanol Supply Year (ESY) 2020-21(Dec-Nov), the Government has targeted to achieve 8.5% blending of ethanol with petrol. Against the requirement of 332 crore litres of ethanol for achieving 8.5% blending with petrol, contracts have been signed for supplying about 335 crore litres of ethanol by distilleries to Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) for blending of ethanol with petrol; against which about 190 crore litres of ethanol have been supplied to OMCs by distilleries till 12.7.2021 thereby achieving 7.93% blending which is the historically highest figure.**
