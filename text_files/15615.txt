                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (c):  The statement is laid on the Table of the House.  STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *383 FOR ANSWER ON 20.03.2020 (a) to (c):	Handloom is a household activity which caters to personal as well as commercial requirements of the weaving community. Each of the states where Handloom is a prominent activity has dedicated Government Machinery to cater to the sector requirements. Government of India Schemes for Handloom Sector are implemented on the basis of proposals received from the State Governments and in close cooperation with the State Governments.  The year-wise outflow of funds under the various schemes depends on the number of such proposals for release of funds and utilization of previously released funds.  This leads to variations in the annual figures.  The office of Development Commissioner for Handlooms works with the State Governments and Weavers’ Service Centres through regular correspondence, interaction and by holding meetings for optimum and timely utilization of funds allocated for various schemes. To facilitate and promote the Handloom Sector in the states, the Central Government implements the following schemes:1. National Handloom Development Programme (NHDP)2. Comprehensive Cluster Development Scheme (CHCDS)3. Handloom Weavers Comprehensive Welfare Scheme (HWCWS)4. Yarn Supply Scheme Details of scheme-wise budgetary allocation made and funds utilised out of it in last three years and the current year are as under: SN	Name of Scheme	2016-17(Rs.
