The Pilot offered a Basic Course and an Advanced Course of 3 months’ duration each to skill the youth as Biodiversity Conservationists and Para-taxonomists, respectively. 94 trainees successfully completed the Basic Course qualifying as skilled Biodiversity Conservationists and the Advanced Course was completed by 154 candidates, qualifying as Parataxonomists. Based on the success of the pilot, the Programme was extended to pan-India level with 43 courses conducted in 2018-19 covering diverse fields - pollution monitoring (air/water/soil), emission inventory, Sewage Treatment Plant (STP)/Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP)/Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) operation, waste management, environmental impact assessment, water budgeting & auditing, bamboo management & livelihood generation, etc.  Overall, 135 training programmes were conducted at 87 locations throughout the country including Gujarat and 2315 youth have been successfully trained under various courses during 2018-19. The training imparted under GSDP endeavours to enhance technical knowledge of the skilled workforce with a focus on hands-on training.(d): The GSDP is being funded under the ongoing ENVIS Scheme of the Ministry, apart from the regular activities under the Scheme. The Budget allocation (BE) for the ENVIS Scheme was Rs. 23 crore for 2017-18 and Rs. 24 crore for 2018-19 respectively. Out of which, the actual expenditure was Rs. 20.12 crore (87.48%) and Rs. 23.84 crore (99.33%) in 2017-18 and 2018-19 respectively. A budget of Rs. 25 crore has been provided exclusively for the GSDP for FY 2019-20, under the ENVIS Scheme.(e): The ENVIS Hubs/Resource Partners and other Institutions imparting training under the GSDP invite applications from all over India and the placements take place based on employment opportunities available within or outside the State/Union Territory. In Gujarat, out of 147 candidates successfully completing the training programmes in 2018-19, 102 have been gainfully employed. In West Bengal, out of 86 candidates successfully completing the training programmes during the years 2017-18 and 2018-19, 46 have been gainfully employed. ****
