                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment had received a letter in July, 2019 from a Hon''ble Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha), enclosing therewith a representation dated 10.06.2019 of Minister for Welfare of Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes & Backward Classes, Law, Culture, & Parliamentary Affairs, Government of  Kerala addressed to Hon''ble Minister, Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India. The request in the representation was for providing special central assistance of  Rs. 260 crores to take up the construction work of 13000 study rooms for Scheduled Caste students in Kerala.(b)&(c) Yes, Sir. The Ministry, keeping in view the fact that it has no  scheme for providing grants for construction of study rooms, expressed its inability to provide central assistance to the Government of  Kerala for the same.(d)&(e): As per the guidelines issued by the erstwhile Planning Commission , the States/UTs are obligated  to apportion a part of their total Plan outlay annually to SCSP in the proportion of their SC population,   and formulate and implement such schemes which extend direct and quantifiable benefits to Scheduled Caste persons. The States can  increase the funds under SCSP, if it is so required.					       *****
