ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) & (b): Yes Sir. The Ministry is aware that Special Rapporteurs to the United Nations had expressed their views on the draft EIA Notification 2020. However, as against the views expressed by the Special Rapporteurs, the draft EIA Notification, 2020, inter alia, does not (a) give any exemptions from public consultation for large industries and projects; (b) no change in the provisions with respect of public consultation in respect of projects or activities involving other strategic considerations; (c) there is no provision for ex-post facto clearance of violation cases. Such cases shall be liable for punitive action under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and in addition shall be liable for damage cost, etc.  (c) & (d): No Sir. The draft EIA is not in contravention to the stand taken by India as a party to international law (conventions). As envisaged in these conventions, the draft EIA Notification 2020, inter alia, promotes the environmental cause and sustainable development; removes redundancies; encourages modernization and less polluting options; brings defaulters into environmental regime with requisite action, penalty and remediation; and introduces standardization and a technology driven process.  ****
