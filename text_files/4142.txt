Coverage under this scheme has been expanded thrice since then i.e. during 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2005-06 covering additional 50 lakh households each time. Thus the total coverage under AAY was raised to 2.50 crore AAY families. The identification of AAY families within the target of AAY families allocated to each State/UT is the responsibility of concerned State/UT Government. Against the targeted number of 2.50 crore AAY families, State/UT Governments have reported identification 2.38 crore AAY families. A State/UT – wise statement indicating the number of targeted and actual beneficiaries including Tamil Nadu is at Annexure.(c):	No request has been received from State Government of Tamil Nadu in 2018 to increase the number of families covered under AAY.
