ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (d): The Central Universities had been issuing their advertisements for teachingposts since 2006 after preparing the reservation rosters taking ‘University’ as a unit inaccordance with University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines of 2006.An advertisement of Banaras Hindu University for the post of teachers waschallenged before Hon’ble Allahabad High Court by way of the W.P. No. 43260 of 2016contending that reservation for the SC/ST/OBC ought to have been applied by treatingthe post of different levels in each subject/department as a unit and not the wholeuniversity as a unit.The Hon’ble Allahabad High Court in its order of W.P.No.43260 of 2016 dated07.04.2017 quashed these guidelines of UGC and instructed that the unit for reservationroster should be Department/ subject. Implementation of these orders would have led tograve miscarriage of justice for the SCs/ STs/ SEBCs. Hence, challenging the orders ofthe Hon’ble Allahabad High Court, SLP Nos. 14318 dated 16.04.2018 and 14099 dated12.4.2018 were filed by Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) andUniversity Grants Commission respectively in the Hon’ble Supreme Court. These SLPswere dismissed on 22.01.2019. Subsequently both MHRD and UGC had filed reviewpetitions, which were dismissed on 27.02.2019.In order to protect the rights of the SCs, STs and SEBCs, and to ensure theiradequate representations in teaching positions, the Central Educational Institutions(Reservation in Teachers’ Cadre) Ordinance, 2019 was promulgated by the Hon’blePresident on 7th March, 2019 to ensure preparation of the reservation roster consideringthe University/ College as a Unit. Hence the unit of reservation will be University/Institution and not Department/ Subject.The Notice for replacement of the Ordinance by the Bill has already been given inthe Lok Sabha.In pursuance to the Ordinance, on 7th March, 2019, the Ministry of HumanResource Development has issued directives to the University Grants Commission tostart the recruitment with immediate effect. The University Grants Commission hasreiterated the instructions to all the University on 8th March, 2019 to implement thereservation of posts in direct recruitment by considering the University/College/Institutionas one unit.******
