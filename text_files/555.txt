                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (e):	  The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme is a single Scheme   aimed   at  providing  income   support   to all landholding farmers’ families across the Contd…2/--2-country, subject to certain exclusions relating to higher income strata. The Scheme provides a payment of Rs.6000/- per year, in three 4-monthly installments of Rs.2000/-, to the farmers’ families. The objective of the Scheme is to enable the farmers to take care of expenses related to agriculture and allied activities to ensure proper crop health and appropriate yields commensurate with anticipated farm income as well as domestic needs, so as to protect them from falling in the clutches of moneylenders for meeting such expenses and ensure their continuance in the farming activities. There are no State-wise objective of the Scheme. The ambit of the Scheme has now been extended to cover all landholding farmers in the country, whose number is projected to be about 14.5 crore. A Statement showing State/UT-wise number of beneficiaries successfully registered on PM-Kisan Portal and who have received the financial benefits under the Scheme till date is enclosed at Annexure. In Siddharth Nagar District of Uttar Pradesh, 1st installment to 130667 and 2nd installment to 127236 beneficiaries have been paid so far. (f):	Yes, Sir. The Government has approved a pension scheme for all Small and Marginal Farmers (SMF) in the country, subject to certain exclusion clauses, with a view to provide them social security net as they have minimal or no savings to provide for old age and to support them in the event of consequent loss of livelihood. The scheme provides for payment of a minimum fixed pension of Rs.3,000/- per month to the eligible farmers on attaining the age of 60 years. It is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme, with entry age of 18 to 40 years. The beneficiary can opt to become member of the Scheme by subscribing to a Pension Fund, managed by the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC). The farmers have the option to allow his/her voluntary contribution to the Scheme from the benefit drawn by him/her on account of PM-KISAN Scheme directly. The Central Government’s share is 50% of the monthly contribution. For example, the beneficiary is required to contribute Rs 100/ - per month in the pension fund at median entry age of 29 years, with matching contribution of Rs.100 by the Central Government. On death of the subscriber, the spouse / heir may continue to subscribe to the Scheme. On death of the pensioner farmers, his / her spouse is entitled to receive 50% of the pension as family pension, provided he/she is not already an SMF beneficiary of the Scheme.(g):	PM-Kisan is a continuous and ongoing Scheme, in which the financial benefits is transferred to the bank accounts of the identified beneficiaries as and when their correct and verified data is uploaded by the concerned States / UTs on PM-Kisan web-portal. The data of beneficiaries uploaded by them have to undergo a multi-level verification and validation by various concerned agencies, including the banks, and only then the amount is released into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. The Government has also already taken an in-principle decision of implementing the farmers’ pension scheme througout the country.(h):	 An exclusive single web-portal, namely, www.pmkisan.gov.in has been created for uploading of beneficiaries’ data for PM-Kisan Scheme by all State / UT Governments. There are no State/UT-wise portal.
