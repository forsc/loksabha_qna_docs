                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                            (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) The selection process of Smart Cities was based on co-operative and competitive federalism. For the first time, cities were selected for a Government of India urban development program through a competition which was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, States/UTs shortlisted potential Smart Cities based on predefined scoring criteria. In the second stage, competing cities prepared their Smart City Proposals (SCPs) as per guidelines and submitted them as part of the National competition. In Stage-I, all States/UTs shortlisted 98 potential Smart Cities to participate in Stage-II. Further, on the basis of requests received from States, 12 new potential Smart Cities (left out Capital cities and equal scoring cities) were also included to participate in All India Competition (Stage-II) of the Smart City Challenge Process. Thereafter, 100 cities were selected as Smart Cities in Four Rounds of Stage-II Challenge from January, 2016 to June, 2018.(b)	The details of 100 Cities selected for developing as Smart Cities is given in Annexure-I.(c)	As per Smart Cities Mission Statement and Guidelines, the Central Government proposes to give financial support to the extent of Rs. 48,000 crore over five years i.e. an average of Rs. 500 crore per city over the Mission period. An equal amount on a matching basis, is to be provided by the State/Urban Local Bodies. Apart from these funds, various cities have proposed to use funding from Public-Private Partnerships, loans, other resources, convergence with other Government Porgrammes/Mission as part of the SCPs. (d)	The Smart Cities are expected to implement their SCPs in 5 years from the date of their selection.                                       ****
