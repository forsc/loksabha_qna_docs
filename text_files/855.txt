ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c): Safety is accorded the highest priority by Indian Railways and all possible steps are undertaken on a continuous and ongoing basis to ensure safe running of trains.  However, no separate 22 point action plan has been notified. Indian Railways have taken several key measures, as a result of which the consequential train accidents have decreased from 135 in 2014-15 to 59 in 2018-19. These are lowest ever figures in the history of Indian Railways.          Steps are being undertaken on continuing basis for upkeep of tracks to prevent accidents, which include replacement of over-aged assets and adoption of suitable technologies for up-gradation and maintenance of track. Safety drives and inspections at regular intervals are carried out to monitor and educate staff for observance of safe practices. Different preventive and predictive maintenance measures are also being undertaken to ensure safe train operations. Indian Railways has already adopted technological upgradation in safety aspects of coaches and wagons by way of introducing Modified Centre Buffer Couplers, Bogie Mounted Air Brake System (BMBS), improved suspension design and provision of Automatic fire & smoke detection system in coaches. These modifications are being provided in newly manufactured coaches and wagons on a regular basis.	Zonal Railways have been advised to ensure proper compliance of maintenance instructions/guidelines to ensure safe running of Rolling Stock.*****
