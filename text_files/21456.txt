ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION(RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a)	& (b) For determination of the poverty line and poverty ratio, Expert Committees are set up from time to time. The erstwhile Planning Commission had constituted Expert Committees for this purpose under the chairmanship of Dr. Y.K.Alagh in 1977, Prof D.T.Lakdawala in 1989, and Prof. Suresh Tendulkar in 2005. The last poverty estimates for the year 2011-12 were released in 2013 following the methodology recommended by the Tendulkar Committee. The poverty line was defined on the basis of Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure (MPCE) as the criterion. For the year 2011-12, the poverty line at all India level was estimated as Monthly Per-capita Consumption Expenditure of Rs. 816 for rural areas and Rs. 1000 for urban areas.(c)	& (d):  A  Task Force on Elimination of Poverty in India was constituted by NITI Aayog on 16th March, 2015 under the Chairmanship of Dr. Arvind Panagariya, former Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog. The Terms of Reference for the Task Force inter alia included to “Develop a working definition of poverty”. The Task Force in its recommendation on estimation of poverty, stated that as a consensus in favour of either the Tendulkar or a higher poverty line did not emerge, the matter may be considered in greater depth by the country’s top experts on poverty before a final decision is made. Accordingly, it was recommended that an expert committee be set up to arrive at an informed decision on the level at which the poverty line should be set.*****
