ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (c): Studies abroad is a matter of individual will and choice. Moreover, thereare no restrictions on cross-border students mobility and such mobility can beowing to variety of reasons such as affordability, access to bank loans, exposure toforeign society, aptitude for particular branch of studies, inability to gainadmission to top Indian Institutes due to capacity limitations etc. Ministry ofHuman Resource Development does not maintain the information regarding thenumber of Indian students going abroad.Government of India is very keen to improve the global standards/ Internationalranking of the Indian Higher Education Institutions. In this regard, one of thelatest initiatives of Ministry of Human Resource Development is the declarationof Educational Institutions as Institutions of Eminence (IoE) to provide worldclass education to the Indian Students within the country. The Government hasapproved the Regulatory Architecture in the form of University GrantsCommission (Declaration of Government Institutions as Institutions of Eminence)Guidelines, 2017 for public Institutions and University Grants Commission(Institutions of Eminence Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2017 forprivate Institutions for setting up / upgrading of 20 Institutions (10 from publicsector & 10 from private sector) as world class teaching and research institutionsknown as Institutions of Eminence (IoE). Six such institutions have beenaccredited the status of IoE by the Ministry of Human Resource Development. Itis expected that the above selected Institutions will come up in top 500 of theworld ranking in 10 years and in top 100 of the world ranking eventually. Toachieve the top world ranking, these Institutions shall be provided with greaterautonomy viz. to admit foreign students up to 30 % of admitted students; to recruitforeign faculty upto 25% of faculty strength; to offer online courses upto 20% ofits programmes; to enter into academic collaboration with top 500 in the worldranking Institutions without permission of University Grants Commission; free tofix and charge fees from foreign students without restriction; flexibility of coursestructure in terms of number of credit hours and years to take a degree; completeflexibility in fixing of curriculum and syllabus, etc. These Institutions areexpected to provide world class education to Indian Students at an affordable rate,which may also bring down the number of students going abroad.Similarly, the Global Initiative of Academic Networks (GIAN) in highereducation launched on 30th November, 2015 has been hugely successful. Underthis programme, distinguished academicians from premier institutions across theworld are invited to conduct short term courses of one week or two week at Indianinstitutions. More than 1800 courses have, so far, been approved under thisProgramme. Other details may be accessed on https://gian.iitkgp.ac.in.The University Grants Commission (UGC) has granted autonomy to 76Educational Institutions which have maintained high academic standards. UGChas categorized Universities into three categories: Category-I, Category-II, andCategory-III. Universities coming under Category-I and Category-II may hire,without approval of UGC, foreign faculty upto twenty percent over and above oftheir sanctioned faculty strength. They shall also be free to admit foreign studentson merit, subject to a maximum of twenty percent over and above of the strengthof their approved domestic students.Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC) aimsat improving the research ecosystem of India’s higher educational institutions byfacilitating academic and research collaborations between Indian Institutions[overall top-100 or category-wise top-100 in NIRF (including Institutions ofEminence and such Private Institutions which are recognized under 12(B) ofUGC Act)] and the best foreign institutions in the world (top-500 overall and top-200 subject-wise institutions listed in QS World University Ranking) from 28selected nations to jointly solve problems of national and international relevance.This involves the mobility of students/faculty for long term research and teachingactivities. So far, 394 research projects under this scheme have been approved.More details are available on https://sparc.iitkgp.ac.in.Besides, Ministry of Human Resource Development has launched the ‘Study inIndia’ programme, with the objective to attract more number of foreign students tostudy in Indian Institutions, and thereby promoting the balanced mobility ofinternational students; growth in India’s global market share of Internationalstudents; and increase the global ranking of Indian Educational Institutionseventually resulting in bringing down the number of Indian students going abroadfor higher studies.*****
