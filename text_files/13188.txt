Similarly, pests and diseases are managed by eco-friendly farming practices of crop rotation, trap crops, bio-pesticides like neem based formulations, bio-control agents, mechanical traps, etc. there by contributes for reducing the environmental pollution and maintaining clean environment. The Organic Farming Policy, 2005 seeks to promote technically sound, economically viable, environmentally non-degrading, and socially acceptable use of natural resources in favour of organic agriculture.
