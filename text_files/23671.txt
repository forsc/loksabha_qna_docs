                                                        THE MINISTER OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS(DR. SUBRAHMANYAM JAISHANKAR)(a)  & (b)	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) & (b) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *411 REGARDING “ORANGE PASSPORT” FOR ANSWER ON 24.03.2021With a view to manufacture e-Passports, India Security Press, Nashik has awarded the contract for procurement of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)-compliant electronic contactless inlays along with its operating system necessary for chip-enabled e-Passports. Issuance of e-Passports will commence on the successful completion of the procurement process by ISP, Nashik. As regards Orange Passports, the Ministry considered issue of passport with orange colour jacket to passport holders with Emigration Check Required (ECR) status, with a view to help and assist them on priority basis.  On subsequent receipt of individual and collective representations, Ministry reviewed this decision.  Following comprehensive discussions with various stakeholders, Ministry decided on 29 January, 2018 not to issue a separate passport with orange colour jacket to ECR passport holders.***
