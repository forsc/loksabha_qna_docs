                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) & (b): As reported by Public Sector Banks (PSBs), no cases of suicide by students specifically linked to pressure for repayment of education loans has been reported. However, the banks have been sensitized to adopt a non-coercive strategy for recovery of education loans.(c): The Model Educational Loan Scheme introduced by IBA is a source of financing higher education for credit constrained students. The Scheme, inter-alia, provides for relief to students post completion of the education course and while seeking jobs, in terms of liberal repayment of loan in equated monthly instalments for a period of 15 years, and repayment holiday/moratorium of 12 months after completion of course with facility for additional period of moratorium in case of underemployment/ unemployment. There is also a moratorium for the incubation period if the student wants to take up a start-up venture and a provision of telescoping of repayment to provide for lower salary levels at the start of the career.Education Loans sanctioned by PSBs during the last three years are as under:Financial Year	Number	Loan Amount (Rs in Crore)2017-18	2,17,688	15,852.922018-19	1,75,181	15,641.722019-20	1,98,298	19,746.55Source: Indian Banks’ Association(d) There is no proposal currently under consideration of the Government for waiver of education loans.******
