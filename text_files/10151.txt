In accordance with these guidelines, a CPSE having negative networth is considered ‘sick’. As per Public Enterprises Survey 2017-18, 56 CPSEs are having negative networth belonging mainly to Cognate Groups:  Heavy& Medium Engineering, Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals, Industrial & Consumer Goods, Trading & Logistic Services, Textiles, etc. As per extant guidelines, the concerned Administrative Ministry/ Department is responsible for formulating revival/ restructuring/ closure road map for sick CPSEs as per the principles outlined therein.
