MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ''Nishank'')(a) to (c) At present there is no proposal to set up a new Central University at Namakkal district ofTamil Nadu. From 12th Plan (2012-17) as approved by National Development Council (NDC), thethrust is on consolidation of the higher education system. Expansion is to be done mainly by scalingup capacity of the existing institutions in place of setting up new institutions. Besides, the CentralGovernment has launched Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) on cost sharing basis toassist States to upgrade existing institutions to Universities provided they are eligible as per norms.Further, ‘Education’ is a concurrent subject, the State Government also takes various initiative toenhance the access to higher education in the respective States along with other PrivateUniversities/Institution.*****
