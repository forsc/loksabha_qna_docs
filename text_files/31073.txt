ANSWER




                                                        (a): Under the PMGDISHA scheme, more than 2.32 lakh training centres are currently operational at the Gram Panchayat level. The State-wise details of these centres are at Annexure.(b): During the peak of Covid-19 pandemic, the Training Centres were not operational in line with the guidelines/directives issued by the respective Central/State/District Administration. In line with the relaxation provided by these authorities in the lockdown conditions, the Centres have been made operational in a graded fashion by the implementing agency. Following measures were taken by the Implementing Agency to resume the training:a.	Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in-line with the Covid-19 protocols were created and shared with all Training Centres for training and examination. b.	Virtual sessions and workshops were conducted with the Training Centres to motivate them to re-start their activitiesc.	Refresher training were provided to registered/ trained candidates, who were unable to appear for training and/or certification.d.	A Chatbot was created with basic information on PMGDISHA portal which was made available in both in Hindi and English languages.e.	Training Centres were encouraged to join groups on popular social media platforms and share relevant training material through these groups.f.	PMGDISHA content was uploaded on the DigiShala channel so that candidates could refer to these on their own and become ready for registration and assessment after minor training/revision. (c):  The scheme is aimed at imparting basic digital literacy skills to the digitally illiterate population in rural India through a 20 hour training programme. The trained persons are expected to be able to operate computers/digital access devices (like tablets, smartphones, etc.), send and receive emails, browse the internet, access Government Services, search for information, undertake cashless transactions, etc. However, as the Scheme is aimed at providing digital literacy to the rural citizens, it enables them for further employment opportunities, especially for the younger beneficiaries.  (d):   The scheme implementation is continuously reviewed through central as well as state teams of the implementing agency under the overall supervision of the Ministry. Some of the measures undertaken in this regard are given below:•	Standardized multimedia content in 22 Languages has been made available and accessible in multimodal format for all candidates. •	Only those who possess prescribed educational qualifications are engaged as Trainers.•	Requisite/prescribed IT infrastructure is ensured at the Training Centres. •	The training centres are monitored, trained and re-trained for maintaining quality. •	Banking/Insurance/G2C/B2C and other services are made available at the centres for use by trainees. ******* AnnexureS.N.
