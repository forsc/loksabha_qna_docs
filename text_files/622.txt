ANSWER




MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D. V. SADANANDA GOWDA)                               (a)and (b): Presently, seven National Institutes of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPERs) are functioning in various parts of the country. During the year 2015-16, the Government did propose to set up three more NIPERs – one each in the States of Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. (c) and (d): The NITI Aayog, after conducting evaluation of the existing NIPERs, has recommended for consolidation of the existing Institutes rather than setting up new NIPERs. Subsequently, the Expenditure Finance Committee (EFC) in its meeting held on 26.03.2018 has also recommended for deferring the setting up of the proposed new NIPERs. As such, the Government is not proposing to open up any new NIPER at this juncture. *****
