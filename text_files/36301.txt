SINGH)(a) to (c) :	As per Section 7 of the Electricity Act 2003, any generating company may establish, operate and maintain a generating station without obtaining a license/permission under this Act, if it complies with the technical standards relating to connectivity with the grid. Accordingly, sanction of the Government is not required for setting up of thermal power projects (TPPs). However, as per Section 8 (1) of the Electricity Act, 2003, any generating company intending to set up a hydro generating station shall prepare and submit to the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) for its concurrence, a scheme estimated to involve a capital expenditure exceeding such sum (presently, ?1000 crore), as may be fixed by the Central Government, from time to time, by notification.No Detailed Project Report (DPR) of any Hydroelectric Scheme of State Sector projects has been received in CEA for examination during current year and last three years.(d) : 		DPR of one Hydroelectric Scheme of Central Sector Project namely Dugar HE project in the State of Himachal Pradesh with an installed capacity of 500 MW has been received for technical clearance in CEA. Details are placed at Annexure. No Central Power Projects are pending for Environment Clearance.(e) :		In order to expedite examination of DPRs by various appraising groups of CEA, regular review meetings are held by Member (Hydro), CEA wherein issues with Hydroelectric Project Developers and appraising groups are resolved. Further, guidelines for examination of DPRs have also been simplified and an Online Single Window Clearance system having interface with all appraising groups for submission and examination of DPRs has been made operationalized to cut short the processing time.**************
