Andhra Pradesh contributed 33% of fisheries exports from India in FY 2019-20. The Government of India through Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA) takes various steps for export promotion activities i.e. training on sustainable farming, Best Management Practices, special training programs for SC/ST beneficiaries, demonstration programs on diversification of export-oriented fisheries other than shrimp, campaigns against Antibiotic usages, etc. MPEDA has signed an MoU with the Govt. of Andhra Pradesh for providing technical assistance for setting up of Hatcheries for diversified species. During 2017-2020, MPEDA has provided financial assistance of Rs. 19.55 Crore to the beneficiaries from Andhra Pradesh. MPEDA has established a Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia (GIFT) seed production hatchery at Vijayawada, a Broodstock Multiplication Centre at Vishakhapatnam for supply of quality disease free seeds to farmers.To ensure traceability, 47,763 farms and 238 hatcheries in Andhra Pradesh, have been enrolled by MPEDA. MPEDA has also introduced the Certification of Aquaculture for the production of antibiotic free shrimp called “SHAPHARI”, with the participation of 11 hatcheries in Andhra Pradesh.MPEDA through its extension arm, National Centre for Sustainable Aquaculture (NaCSA) stationed at Kakinada, helps the small scale aquaculture farmers by forming clusters/societies and providing them with necessary technical and financial assistance. In 2020, MPEDA launched a multilingual call centre for aqua farmers at Vijayawada to address the technical issues of farmers and to impart knowledge about Best Management Practices.                             *****
