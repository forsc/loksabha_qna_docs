ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (d):  Apportionment of manpower between Union territory of Jammu & Kashmir and Union territory of Ladakh is governed in terms of Section 89 of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act, 2019 in respect of substantive Government employees. The apportionment of such category of employees has been finalized where under 11189 employees have been apportioned to Union territory of Ladakh.Further, the apportionment of employees of autonomous bodies, public sector undertakings, agencies etc, is governed in terms of Section 92 of the said Act, which  provides  for  determining  the modalities for distributing  the personnel between the successor Union Territories by the concerned bodies. The Sher-I-Kashmir   institutes of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), Saura, Srinagar is  an Autonomous Tertiary Healthcare Institute. There is no equivalent organization in the UT of Ladakh to accommodate the employees of the SKIMS and hence, the apportionment of manpower of the employees of the Institute, in terms of Section 92 of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act, 2019, may not be feasible.*****
