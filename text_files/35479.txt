ANSWER




                                                        (a)       Under Skill India Mission, Ministry is implementing its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) to impart skill development training to youth of the country, including the States of Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan. PMKVY has two training components, namely, Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL).RPL enables individuals to obtain skill certification. Individuals with prior learning experience or skills can register themselves and get assessed and certified. RPL mainly focuses on the individuals engaged in unregulated sectors. The training/orientation duration under RPL ranges between 12-80 hours.(b)       Under PMKVY-RPL, since inception, i.e., 2015 as on 31.12.2021, orientation has been provided to 1.45 lakh candidates in 31 sectors in the State of Andhra Pradesh. Major sectors in Andhra Pradesh are Logistics, Handicrafts & Carpet, Media & Entertainment, and Textiles & Handlooms.             Similarly, orientation has been provided to 6.03 lakh candidates in 35 sectors in State of Rajasthan. Major sectors in Rajasthan are Green Jobs, Media & Entertainment, Tourism & Hospitality, and Handicrafts & Carpet(c)        Under PMKVY-RPL, 11,047 and 2,259 candidates have been oriented in Textile and Handloom sector in the States of Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan, respectively. Under PMKVY, till date, no special RPL project has been undertaken for Kalamkari in the State of Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan.(d)       Yes, Sir. PMKVY 2.0 was evaluated by NITI Aayog in October 2020 under jobs and skills sector. As per the evaluation study, 52 percent of the candidates who were placed in full time/part time employment and had completed training under the RPL component received higher salary or felt that they will get higher salary compared to their peers who have no certification. Also, as per third-party impact evaluation of PMKVY 2.0 (2016-20) conducted by the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA), more than 75% of the RPL certified respondents have acknowledged that the RPL program helped them in improving their chances to get another employment and in improving their technical and soft skills for their current employment.
