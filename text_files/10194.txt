ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b): The sowing choices of farmers depend on weather conditions, rainfall situation, irrigation facilities, inter-crop profitability, soil conditions, expectation of better remuneration from other competing crops etc. However, Government has taken several measures to increase the area coverage and productivity of pulses. Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) of pulses has been substantially increased to encourage pulses production. Government is implementing National Food Security Mission-Pulses (NFSM-Pulses) in 638 districts of 28 States and 2 Union Territories (Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh) of the country to encourage production of pulses. 	     Resultantly, the acreage of pulses in the country increased to 29.45 million hectares during 2016-17 as compared to 24.91 million hectares during 2015-16 and further achieved a record of 29.81 million hectares during 2017-18. During 2018-19 (as per Fourth Advance Estimates), total acreage of pulses in the country is estimated at 29.03 million hectares which is higher by 2.44 million hectares than the previous five years’ (2013-14 to 2017-18) average acreage of pulses.*******
