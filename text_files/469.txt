It enhances productivity besides reducing human drudgery and cost of cultivation. It also helps in improving utilization efficiency of other inputs. Taking into consideration the above, to boost the farm mechanization in the country, a special dedicated scheme  Sub Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) has been introduced , under which subsidy is provided for purchase of various types of Agricultural implements and machinery used for tillage, sowing, planting, harvesting, reaping, threshing, plant protection, inter cultivation and residue management.             Funds of Rs.20.34,15.96, 15.00, 34.13 and 145.5 crore have been released under SMAM to Government of Maharashtra during the period of 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 respectively for distribution of agricultural machinery and equipment and establishment of Custom Hiring Centers.
