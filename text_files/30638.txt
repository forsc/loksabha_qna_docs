BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a): Preventive aspect of Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs) is strengthened under Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Ayushman Bharat Health & Wellness Centre scheme, by promotion of wellness activities and targeted communication at the community level. Other initiatives for increasing public awareness about NCDs and for promotion of healthy lifestyle includes increased physical activity and yoga and use of print, electronic and social media for continued community awareness. Fit India movement is implemented by Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, and various Yoga related activities are carried out by Ministry of AYUSH. Various health days are observed by the Government regularly.(b) to (e): Health and public hospitals is a state subject. The Central Government, however, supplements the efforts of State Government. Arthritis is managed by orthopaedicians, general physicians, rheumatologists etc. depending upon the type of arthritis.There is no specific programme for prevention and control of arthritis. However, the National Programme for Healthcare of Elderly (NPCHE) addresses the issues of arthritis in elderly. Arthritis is diagnosed and treated at various levels in the health care facilities. The treatment in Government Hospitals is either free or highly subsidized for the poor and needy.There is also focus on arthritis in its various aspects in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojna (PMSSY). Under Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), health insurance cover of Rs. 5 lakhs per family per year for secondary or tertiary care hospitalization to over 10.74cr. beneficiary families identified from Socio Economic, and Caste Census 2011 (SECC 2011) database is provided. AB-PMJAY provides treatment corresponding to a total of 1,669 procedures under 26 different specialities for NCDs. The treatment packages under AB-PMJAY are very comprehensive covering various treatment related aspects such as drugs and diagnostic services. Besides, quality generic medicines are made available at affordable prices to all, under Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) in collaboration with the State Governments. Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment (AMRIT) Pharmacy stores have been set up in some hospitals/institutions, with an objective to make available drugs at a substantial discount vis-à-vis the Maximum Retail Price. All orthopaedic doctors in Central Government hospitals are trained regularly for managing rheumatoid arthritis.
