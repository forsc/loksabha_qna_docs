                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  The details of amount released to State Governments /State Programme Management Groups/CPSUs/ Other Executing Agencies during 2014-2020 and in current year i.e. 2020-21 (till 31 July 2020) are indicated below: -  Funds released	From Financial Year (FY) 2014-15 to FY 2019-20 (Rs. in crore)	In current Financial Year  i.e. 2020-21* (Rs. in crore)	Total (Rs. in crore)Funds released by Government of India to National Mission for Clean Ganga	8,917.02	53.00	8,970.02Funds disbursed by National Mission for Clean Ganga	8,761.04	154.16	8,915.20(* up to 31 July 2020)(b)  The cleaning of rivers is a continuous process and the Government of India is supplementing the efforts of the States for checking the rising level of pollution of rivers by providing financial assistance to different States. As per Cabinet approval dated 13.5.2015, the Namami Gange Programme is to be implemented by December, 2020 at a budgetary outlay of Rs.20,000 crore. However, as a part of this programme, the Government of India will continue to support the cost of Operation & Maintenance (O&M) of assets for a period of 10-15 years from the date of completion.Contd…P/2//2//(c)  The measures for flood management including desilting/ dredging of rivers are formulated by the State Governments as per their priority. The Government of India supplements the efforts of State Governments by providing technical advice and also promotional financial assistance for critical areas.A Committee for preparation of guidelines on de-siltation from Bhimgauda (Uttarakhand) to Farakka (West Bengal) was constituted by NMCG under the Chairmanship of Shri Madhav Chitale Expert Member, National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA). Some of the major observations made by the Committee are as follows: (i)      A reconnaissance of main River Ganga reveals that different reaches are in a dynamic equilibrium phase. Sedimentation is mainly seen downstream of Bhimgauda barrage and near the confluences of tributary rivers with Ganga. (ii)    Though de-siltation works can improve hydraulic performance of the river and this itself can justify undertaking de-siltation, these have no direct role in improving environment flow in the river. On the other hand, indiscriminate de-silting or sand mining would cause adverse impacts on river e-flow.(iii)   The proposed desilting of any river reach needs to be justified bringing out clearly the flooding caused due to siltation along with technical comparison of the alternative flood mitigation measures with “do nothing” or “proposed desilting/ dredging” being other options. It should invariably be associated with sediment flux studies and morphological studies to confirm no significant adverse effect on downstream or upstream reach of the river including the safety and effectiveness of river crossings, water intakes, existing river bank / flood protection measures etc.(iv)  The dredging/de-siltation/mining activities may result into some adverse impacts, i.e. (a) River bed degradation; (b) Bank erosion; (c) Channel widening; (d) lowering of water surface elevations in the river channel; (e) lowering of water table elevation adjacent to the river; (f) a reduction in the structural integrity of bridges, pipelines, jetties, barrages, weirs, foundations supporting high tension lines, existing bank protection works and other manmade structures; and (g) a loss of environmental values resulting from (a) through (e). As such, restrictions need to be enforced before planning and executing any dredging/ de-silting / mining activities.(d)  Under the Namami Gange Programme, diverse set of interventions meant for cleaning of river Ganga and its tributaries have been taken up. These include treatment of municipal sewage, treatment of industrial effluents, drain bio-remediation, river surface cleaning, rural sanitation, river front development, ghats and crematoria development, afforestation & biodiversity conservation, public outreach programme etc. Under this programme, a total of 315 projects have been sanctioned at a cost of Rs 28,854 Crore for conservation and pollution abatement of the River Ganga and its tributaries. Contd…P/3//3//For pollution abatement in river Ganga, 151 sewerage projects (113 on Ganga stem & 38 on tributaries) at a cost of Rs. 23120.63 crores have been approved for creation of 3758 MLD new STP capacity, rehabilitation of 1072 MLD STP capacity and construction of 5065 km sewerage networks. For 97 Ganga towns, against sewerage generation of 2953 MLD, 113 projects have been sanctioned on main stem of Ganga for creation of about 3300 MLD along with rehabilitation of old STPs. Through construction of new STPs and rehabilitation of old STPs, a capacity of 2180 MLD has already been created. To improve performance and ensure effective functioning, long term operation & maintenance has been included in the project cost. Public Private Partnership through Hybrid Annuity Mode (HAM) has been introduced in sewerage sector projects for performance based contracts and effective project implementation for long term (15 years).Some of the other interventions under taken for abatement of pollution of river Ganga are given below:(i)	Stringent monitoring and regulation of industries and pollution sources is undertaken to assess the compliance status of Grossly Polluted Industries (GPIs) for enforcing regulatory framework on the polluting industries. Stringent action is taken by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)/State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) against the GPIs discharging into main stem of Ganga River & its tributaries which are non-complying with respect to the prescribed norms.(ii)	Besides, the identification and assessment of quality and quantity of major drains joining river Ganga and its tributaries, establishment/upgradation of Wastewater Treatment Plants (STPs and CETPs) for the towns located on Ganga main stem and its tributaries, performance evaluation of those STPs and CETPs are undertaken.*****
