                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) & (b) The stretch from Anmod to Londa is part of Khanapur to Karnataka / Goa Border project. Earlier, a Writ Petition was filed to stop the road widening work of Khanapur to Karnataka / Goa Border project. The writ petition  was disposed by the Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka and National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) was directed to commence the work after getting necessary extension of valid Stage-I clearance from MoEF&CC. The EPC Contractor to whom the work was awarded has completed about 67% work. Due to the considerable time taken in the matter of the Writ Petition, the Contractor had requested for foreclosure of contract and the same was agreed in-principle by NHAI. The bidding for taking up balance work has been initiated with expected completion by December, 2022.  *****
