                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)  (a)	 to (e):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 253   FOR ANSWER ON 10th JULY,2019  REGARDING “AGRICULTURAL EXPORT”.(a) India, with a large and diverse agriculture, is among the world’s leading producer of cereals, milk, sugar, fruits and vegetables, spices, eggs and seafood products. Recent growth rates show that agri-food production is rising faster than growth in domestic demand, and volume of surplus for export is witnessing accelerated growth. This offers scope and opportunity for capturing overseas markets to earn foreign exchange and enable producers to earn higher prices for farm produce.(b) Under the Agriculture Export Policy, several unique product-district clusters have been identified for a more focused pre and post-harvest management of the production as well as for upgrading the supply chain to attain much higher levels of export from these clusters. These clusters have been identified based on the existing production contributing to exports, exporters operations, scalability of operations, size of export market / India’s share, awareness about SPS requirements, and potential for increase in export in short term. The list of such clusters, including the clusters identified in Maharashtra, is at Annexure-I.(c) The Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare has signed 65 MoUs with 61 countries in the field of agriculture and its allied sectors. The areas for cooperation in these MoUs/Agreements inter alia include enhancing investment in agriculture, cooperation in research and development, increasing productivity, enhancing trade, post-harvest management, value-addition/food processing, plant protection, animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries. (d) Investments in the agriculture sector in the areas of Research & Development, development of infrastructure and marketing would result in increase in productivity, quality fetching better price for the produce.(e) The Government is taking a number of measures to increase the income of farmers. In the Minimum Support Price (MSP) policy announced in 2018-19 season, the farmers are assured of a minimum of 50 percent as margin of profit. Government has been implementing/reorienting various schemes for betterment of agriculture sector with four key elements: reducing input costs; ensuring fair price for the produce; reducing wastage; and creating alternate sources of income. Some of the major initiatives of the Government towards welfare of the farmers are Soil Health Cards (SHC), production and availability of quality seeds, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY), e- National Agriculture Market (e-NAM), Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), National Programme for Dairy Development (NPDD), National Dairy Plan-I (NDP-I), Dairy Entrepreneurship Development Scheme (DEDS), Dairy Processing and Infrastructure Development Fund Scheme (DIDF), Supporting Dairy Cooperative and Farmer Producer Organizations engaged in dairy activities (SDCFPO), Blue Revolution etc. Moreover, Government is also promoting allied activities like dairying, poultry, beekeeping and fisheries, which will mitigate risks associated with dependence on agricultural crops through income supplementation. The Government has also approved a new Umbrella Scheme ‘Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan’ (PM-AASHA). The Scheme is aimed at ensuring remunerative prices to the farmers for their produce as announced in the Union Budget for 2018, which envisages scaling up procurement significantly from the current Kharif marketing season.In the Interim Budget 2019-20, a new programme named “Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN)” was announced. Under this programme, vulnerable landholding farmer families, having cultivable land up to 2 hectares, were to be provided direct income support at the rate of Rs. 6,000 per year. Now, all the landholding farmers in the country (subject to certain exclusions) have been brought under purview of the scheme.***** Annexure-IList of ClustersProduct	Region	State	DistrictBanana	South	Kerala	Thrissur, Wayanad, Thiruvananthapuram		Andhra Pradesh	Kadapa, Anantapur		Tamil Nadu	Trichy, Theni, Pollachi	West	Maharashtra	Jalgaon, Kolhapur, Solapur		Gujarat	Bharuch, Narmada, SuratPomegranate	South	Andhra Pradesh	Anantapur, Kurnool		Karnataka	Belgaum, Mysore	West	Maharashtra	Solapur, Ahmednagar, Pune	Central	Madhya Pradesh	Khargone, Khandwa, BurhanpurMango	West	Maharashtra	Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg		Gujarat	Junagarh, Valsad, Kutch, Navsari	North	Uttar Pradesh	Saharanpur, Meerut, Lucknow	South	Telangana	Rangareddy, Mehboobnagar, Warangal		Andhra Pradesh	Krishna, Chittoor, KurnoolGrapes	West	Maharashtra	Pune, Nasik, SangliRose Onion	South	Karnataka	Bangalore Rural, ChikkaballapuraOnion	West	Maharashtra	Nasik	Central	Madhya Pradesh	Indore, Sagar, DamohPotato	North	Uttar Pradesh	Agra, Farukkabad		Punjab	Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala, Navashehar	West	Gujarat	Banaskantha, SabarKantha	Central	Madhya Pradesh	Indore, GwaliorTea	East	Assam	Tinsukia, Sibsagar, DibrugarhCoffee	South	Karnataka	Chikkamagaluru, Kodagu, HassanMarine products	South	Andhra Pradesh	East Godavari, Vishakapatnam, West Godavari, Nellore	East	Odisha	Jagatsinghpur, Bhadrak, Balasore	West	Gujarat	Kutch, Veraval, Navasari, ValsadChilli	South	Telangana	Khammam, Warangal		Andhra Pradesh	GunturTurmeric	South	Telangana	Nizamabad, Karimnagar		Kerala	Wayanad, Alleppy	EastEast	Meghalaya	West Jaintia Hills		Odisha	KandhamalCumin	West	Gujarat	Banaskantha, Mehsana	North	Rajasthan	Jalore, Jodhpur, Barmer, Nagaur, PaliPepper	SouthSouth	Kerala	Wayanad		Karnataka	ChikmagalurCardamom	South	Kerala	IdukkiIsabgol	North	Rajasthan	Jodhpur, Nagaur, Barmer, JaisalmerCastor	West	Gujarat	Banaskantha, Kutch, Patan, Sabarkantha, MehsanaOrange	West	Maharashtra	Nagpur, Amravati, Wardha****
