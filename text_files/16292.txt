ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)*****(a)	As per inputs received from the Election Commission of India (ECI), ECI has not issued any instruction regarding taxation of the left over money in the bank account to be opened for the purposes of fighting 2019 Parliament elections and subsequent assembly election in Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand etc in 2019 and 2020 by contesting candidates exclusively for election expenditure purpose in pursuance of the Commission’s letter no. 76/Instructions/2013/EEPS/Vol.IV, dated 15th October, 2013 (copy enclosed). However, it is informed that under Section 78 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, the contesting candidate has to lodge account of his election expenses with the district election officer within 30 days from the date of election. Commission does not have jurisdiction on liability of tax. (b)	As per the Income Tax Act, 1961 the left over funds in such bank accounts are not taxable in the hands of the candidates till such time as claimed by the political party as advance given to the candidates & the candidate returns the same to the political party. However, the same is treated as “income” and is taxable in the hands of the candidate if the same is appropriated, not returned, and used for non election purposes by the candidate. Hence, the accounting treatment will depend upon the facts and circumstances of that particular case and will be governed by the IT Act, 1961.(c)	As in (b).(d)	As in (b). (e)	As in (b).
