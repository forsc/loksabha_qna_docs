ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)	   to (c)  Flood management schemes are formulated and implemented by concerned State Governments as per their priority. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. 	The Government of India has been making regular efforts to assist the State Governments in effective flood management and it had taken several important actions, including setting up of Various Expert Committees / Task Forces/ Commissions from time to time, which studied the flood problems and recommended suitable flood management measures for implementation by the State Governments. A gist of important initiatives is as under:(i)	The Government of India issued National Water Policy-2012 which emphasizes construction of large storage reservoirs and other non-structural measures for integrated flood management. (ii)	Ganga Flood Control Commission (GFCC) was set up at Patna in 1972 to address the flood and erosion problems of Ganga basin States. It has prepared 23 Comprehensive Master Plans for the Ganga Basin States and circulated them to concerned States for implementation. (iii)	Rashtriya Barh Ayog (RBA) was set up in 1976 which submitted its report in 1980 recommending various measures of flood control. Contd…P/2//2//(iv)	Brahmaputra Board was set up in 1980 to address the flood erosion problems in the North Eastern States including North Bengal and Sikkim. It has prepared 57 Master Plans and circulated them to concerned States for implementation. (v)	The Task Force-2004 on Flood Management / Erosion Control, set up in August, 2004, submitted its Report in December, 2004 recommending immediate, short-term and long-term measures for flood management and erosion control in the States of Assam & neighbouring North-Eastern States, Bihar, West Bengal, Eastern Uttar Pradesh.(vi)	The Government of India is having continuous dialogue with neighbouring countries viz. Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and China on flood management aspects in India, besides other issues related to water resources.(vii)	As a non-structural measure, Central Water Commission (CWC) has established a flood forecasting network across the country and issues flood forecasts at 325 stations. The level forecasts help the user agencies in deciding mitigating measures like evacuation of people and shifting people and their movable property to safer locations. The Inflow Forecasting is used by various dam authorities in optimum operation of reservoirs for safe passage of flood downstream as well as to ensure adequate storage in the reservoirs for meeting demand during non-monsoon period. (viii)	Government of India launched Flood Management Programme (FMP) during XI Plan for providing central assistance to the State Governments for taking up works related to river management, flood control, anti-erosion, drainage development, flood proofing works, restoration of damaged flood management works and anti-sea erosion works which was continued during XII Plan. A total of 522 projects costing Rs.13238.36 crore were approved and included under FMP. Since start of XI Plan, total Central Assistance released to States under FMP up till March, 2019 is Rs.5863.95 crore. (ix)	During XII Plan, Government of India approved implementation of the Central Sector Scheme “River Management Activities and Works related to Border Areas (RMBA)” for carrying out activities relating to investigation of projects, flood forecasting, flood management works on common/border rivers with neighbouring countries.(x)	FMP and RMBA schemes have been merged into a single scheme "Flood Management and Border Areas Programme" (FMBAP) for the three year period from 2017-18 to 2019-20 with an outlay of Rs. 3342 Crore. *****
