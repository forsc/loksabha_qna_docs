ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) No Sir, the Central Government has taken several initiatives to address theissue of timely and accurate data dissemination on public educationsystem. To collect timely and accurate data, a well-functioning andsustainable Educational Management Information System called UDISE+(UDISE plus) has been launched in 2018-19. It covers 1.54 million schoolsand 8.9 million teachers of 36 States and UTs.(b) & (c) For post 2015-16 period, the report titled “School Education in India,U-DISE Flash Statistics 2016-17” provides information, inter alia, onstudents’ access, availability of infrastructure and teachers in schoolsacross all 36 states and UTs. MHRD has designed a 70 indicators basedmatrix Performance Grading Index (PGI) to grade the States/UTs. Reporton PGI for 2017-18 is available in public domain.Analysing and assessing the quality of education across all levels fromprimary to university level is a continuous and ongoing process. Severalinitiatives are currently being undertaken in this direction. Since 2011-12,the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE), which wasan annual census of schools and teacher, had been instrumental inaligning the ‘supply of data’ to the ‘information demand’ in the schooleducation sector. Since 2018-19, the UDISE+ has been launched by theMHRD adding value to the system namely UDISE. Further, the NationalAchievement Survey (NAS) was conducted throughout the country onNovember 13, 2017 for Classes 3, 5 and 8 in Government andGovernment aided schools across the country to assess LearningOutcomes of students. The District Report Cards generated through NAS2017 has also been released by the MHRD and is available in publicdomain.**********
