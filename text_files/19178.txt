This has caused difficulties to the passengers. However, international travel is being catered to by the flights under Vande Bharat Mission and Air Bubble arrangements.;(d) to (g): All efforts have been made to provide maximum connectivity to Indian expatriates desirous to fly back to their respective countries of employment. India has formalized Air Bubble agreements with 24 countries. These Air Bubble agreements provide access directly or through transit facility to more than 100 countries. Despite the entry restrictions, strict health protocols enforced by significant number of foreign countries and limitations on the number of flights, most countries are accessible through these Air Bubble agreements. In addition to the connectivity provided by Air Bubble agreements, the Vande Bharat Mission flights also carry passengers to other foreign countries with whom direct Air Bubble arrangement does not exist.
