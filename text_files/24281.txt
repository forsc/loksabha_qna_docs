ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c)	Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) promotes establishment of model and aspirational skill development centres known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras (PMKK) in every district of the country. During the last two financial years (2019 – 20 and 2020-21), 123 proposals were received out of which 30 proposals were accepted from North East states of India. Since the concerned PMKKs were self-funded, no funds were released from MSDE in the North East States of India during the last two financial years (2019 -20, 2020-21). No proposals were received from the State of Assam during the last two financial years.
