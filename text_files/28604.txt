                                                        THE MINISTER OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS         (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) to (c):     A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.                       *****                          STATEMENTStatement as referred to in part (a) to (c) in reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No 62 due for answer on 02 December,2021 regarding ‘Development of Shirdi as Modern/Smart City’(a)	to (c) :	Urban Development is a State subject. Ministry facilitates and  assists State Governments/ Administration of Union Territories  through its   Mission / Schemes for urban infrastructure  development projects -  Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) 2.0, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana -Urban (PMAY-U), Smart Cities Mission (SCM), Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U) 2.0,  and Urban Transport (UT). Smart Cities were selected through a two-stage competition.  Stage-1 of the competition was conducted by States / Union Territories (UTs) and Stage-2 by the Union Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs.  Eight cities from Maharashtra have been selected for development as Smart Cities.  Shirdi city was not a part of the initial shortlist prepared by the State Government of Maharashtra. Presently, there is no proposal for adding more number of cities under Smart Cities Mission. Further, Smart Cities Mission (SCM) is aimed at creating replicable models in the 100 Smart Cities which can act as `lighthouses’ for other aspiring cities of the country. In order to support States / UTs and cities in their journey towards Smart Cities, a workbook titled ‘Making a City Smart: Lessons from the Smart Cities Mission’ has been released by the Ministry recently. The workbook encapsulates learnings from on-ground implementation of SCM over the past five    years, and can be used by State Governments to handhold all their cities through the learning of What, Why and How to make a city ‘Smart’. The workbook is available online at : https://smartnet.niua.org/content. The details of projects being taken up under various urban Missions / Schemes in the city of Shirdi are given in the Annexure.                         *****
