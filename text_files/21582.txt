ANSWER




                                                        (a):	As per information provided by the National Medical Commission (NMC), 12.89 lakh allopathic doctors are registered in the country as on 31st December, 2020. Assuming 80% availability, it is estimated that around 10.31 lakh doctors may be actually available for active service.The details of number of doctors registered with the concerned State Medical Council, State/UT-wise,is at Annexure-I. Besides, there are 5.65 lakh AYUSH doctors available in the country. Considering the above, the doctor – population ratio in the      country is 1:845.  Further, as per records of the Indian Nursing Council (INC), there are around 22,72,208 Registered Nurses and Registered Midwives (RN&RM),9,34,583 Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANM) and 56,842 Lady Health Visitors (LHV) in the Country. The detail of total number of nurses registered across the country, State/UT wise is at Annexure - II. (b) & (c):	Public health and hospitals being a State subject, the primary responsibility to ensure availability of doctors in public health facilities lies with the State/UT Governments.However, under the National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their healthcare systems including support for engagement of doctors, based on the requirements made by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs).  The Government runs a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for establishment of new medical colleges attached with district/referral hospitals, under which establishment of 157 medical colleges has been approved in three phases, of which 47 have become functional. The Government also runs two Centrally Sponsored Schemes for strengthening/ upgradation of existing State Government/Central Government Medical Colleges to increase MBBS and PG seats.	Further, the Government has taken various steps to increase the availability of doctors in the country which include: -I.	Relaxation in the norms for setting up of Medical College in terms of requirement for faculty, staff, bed strength and other infrastructure. II.	Enhancement of maximum intake capacity at MBBS level from 150 to 250.III.	DNB qualification has been recognized for appointment as faculty to take care of shortage of faculty. IV.	Enhancement of age limit for appointment/ extension/ re-employment against posts of teachers/dean/principal/ director in medical colleges upto 70 years. V.	Provision has been made in the Regulations to offer less number of seats to the applicant medical college, in case, it falls short of minimum prescribed requirements of applied intake to avoid wastage of human resources. VI.	A Consortium (a group of 2 or upto 4 private organizations) has been allowed to establish a medical college.VII.	Viability Gap Funding Scheme for establishment of new medical colleges in Public-Private Partnership mode. As far as allied and healthcare professionals are concerned, there is no Central Regulatory body at present for allied and healthcare professionals. The Government has introduced the National Commission for Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2020 in the Rajya Sabha to regulate and standardise the education and practice of allied and healthcare professionals.(d):	The policy of compulsory rural services of MBBS/PG doctors is decided by the concerned State Government. Each State has its own bond policy for the medical graduates passing out from the medical colleges, keeping in view of the healthcare needs of the State.(e) To increase availability of doctors in the rural areas, the following steps have been taken:I.	Two years post MBBS Diploma courses in eight disciplines have been started by the National Board of Examinations to be run mostly in the District hospitals, thereby improving availability of trained healthcare manpower at district level. II.	Postgraduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000 have been amended to include District Residency Scheme for compulsory three months training of PG medical students at District Hospitals.  Under the Scheme, the second/third year PG students of medical colleges would be posted in the district hospitals for a period of three months. 	Further, to encourage doctors working in remote and difficult areas, under the Regulations it has been provided that: - I.	50% of the seats in Post Graduate Diploma Courses shall be reserved for Medical Officers in the Government service, who have served for at least three years in remote and/or difficult and/or rural areas. After acquiring the PG Diploma, the Medical Officers shall serve for two more years in remote and/or difficult and/or rural areas.II.	Incentive at the rate of 10% of the marks obtained for each year in service in remote and/or difficult or rural areas as upto the maximum of 30% of the marks obtained in the entrance test for admissions in Post Graduate Medical Courses.III.	50% seats in Diplomate National Board (DNB) courses have also been reserved for in-service doctors of the State.
