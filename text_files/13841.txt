                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a):	As per the information provided by the Board of Governors in supersession of Medical Council of India(MCI), enhancement of MBBS & PG seats is dependent on availability of adequate faculty and infrastructure as per prevalent regulations of MCI. The Central Government has taken several steps to increase the number of MBBS and PG seats in the country. These include:I.	Establishment of New Medical Colleges attached with district/referral hospitals in underserved districts of the country.II.	Strengthening/ upgradation of existing State Government/Central Government Medical Colleges to increase MBBS and PG seats.III.	Relaxation in the norms for setting up of Medical College in terms of requirement for faculty, staff, bed strength and other infrastructure.IV.	Minimum requirement of land for establishment of medical college in metropolitan cities as notified under Article 243P(c) of the Constitution of India has been dispensed with.V.	Enhancement of maximum intake capacity at MBBS level from 150 to 250.VI.	DNB qualification has been recognized for appointment as faculty to take care of shortage of faculty.VII.	Enhancement of age limit for appointment/ extension/ re-employment against posts of teachers/dean/principal/ director in medical colleges upto 70 years.VIII.	The ratio of teachers to students for Professor has been revised from 1:1 to 1:2 for all MD/MS disciplines and 1:1 to 1:3 in all clinical subjects in Government funded medical colleges and in Private medical colleges with 15 years standing. Further, for Associate Professor, the said ratio has been revised from 1:1 to 1:2 and 1:3 if he/she is a unit head in all clinical subjects in Government medical colleges and in Private medical colleges with 15 years standing. This would result in increase in number of PG seats in the country.IX.	By amending the regulations, it has been made mandatory for all medical colleges to start PG courses within 3 years from the date of their MBBS recognition /continuation of recognition.X.	Colleges are allowed to apply for PG courses in clinical subjects at the time of 4th renewal. It will serve to advance the process for starting PG courses by more than 1 year.XI.	Provision has been made in the regulations to offer less number of seats to the applicant medical college, in case, it falls short of minimum prescribed requirements of applied intake to avoid wastage of human resources.XII.	A Consortium (a group of 2 or upto 4 private organizations) has been allowed to establish a medical college.(b):	As per the information provided by the Board of Governors appointed in supersession of Medical Council of India, there are 80448 MBBS seats and 40408 PG seats in the Country, out of which 1850 MBB seats and 843 PG seats are available in Odisha.
