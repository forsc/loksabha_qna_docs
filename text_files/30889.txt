ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)     There is no established study for India providing a quantified attribution of climate change leading to increased outbreak of floods. While many studies monitor disasters such as floods, drought and heat, the science of attribution of these changes particularly to climate change is far more complex and currently an evolving subject. Most studies so far have relied on mathematical modelling of climate change impacts but these are yet to be empirically verified. The occurrence of floods can be attributed to various factors, including wide variations in rainfall both in time and space with frequent departures from the normal pattern, inadequate carrying capacities of rivers, river bank erosion and silting of river beds, landslides, poor natural drainage in flood prone areas, snowmelt and glacial lake out-bursts.(b) to (d)Climate change is a global collective action problem. India with more than 17% of the global population has contributed only about 4% of the global cumulative greenhouse gas emissions between 1850 and 2017.Reports from various sources, including Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, highlight that the challenges faced due to global warming are mainly due to cumulative historical and current greenhouse gas emissions of the developed countries. Even though, we are not part of the problem, India is part of the solution and has done more than its fair share. India firmly believes in the global cooperation to deal with climate change challenge through multilateral processes. The Government stands committed to combating climate change through its several programs and schemes. This includes implementation of the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), which comprises missions in specific areas of solar energy, energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan ecosystem, sustainable habitat, green India, and strategic knowledge on climate change. The NAPCC provides an overarching framework for all climate actions. Thirty-three States/Union Territories have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) in line with NAPCC taking into account the State specific issues relating to climate change. These SAPCCs outline sector-specific and cross- sectoral priority actions, including adaptation. The Government is also implementing the scheme, ‘National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change’ to support adaptation measures of States/UTs in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate Change. India is a Party to the Paris Agreement and has ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for combating climate change. India is on track to meet its NDCs, which are compatible with a well-below-2°C scenario. Further, the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India at the recent 26thsession of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 26) offered India’s vision to the global brainstorming on meeting the challenge of climate change by presenting to the world the following five nectar elements (Panchamrit) of climate action by India:(i)	India will reach its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030.(ii)	India will meet 50 percent of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030.(iii)	India will reduce the total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes from now onwards till 2030.(iv)	By 2030, India will reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by less than 45 percent.(v)	By the year 2070, India will achieve the target of Net Zero. *****
