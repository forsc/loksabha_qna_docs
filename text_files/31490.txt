ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ??????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):     Government implements Price Support Scheme (PSS) for procurement of pulses and oilseeds as and when proposals are received from the State Governments as per the scheme Guidelines. All the proposals received from States have been sanctioned immediately and there are no pending proposals at present. Government also undertakes procurement of paddy and wheat at MSP from farmers through Food Corporation of India (FCI) and State Agencies. Further, different types of nutri-cereals and maize are procured at MSP from farmers by State Governments itself in consultation with FCI to the extent that the concerned State Government may utilise the same for distribution under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) as well as Other Welfare Schemes (OWS). Further, due to the announcement of Minimum Support Price (MSP) by the Government & procurement operations, the overall market also responds which results in private procurement on or above the MSP. Hence, It is very difficult to assess the exact number of farmers benefitted under MSP operation. However, the details of farmers benefitted under Government procurement operation at MSP & percentage of procurement to production at MSP crop-wise, since 2016-17 at Annexure-I.
