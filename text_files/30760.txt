ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE(DR. BHAGWAT KISHANRAO KARAD)(a)&(b): The Government notified in February, 2021 the New Public Sector Enterprise (PSE) Policy. Under New PSE Policy public sector commercial enterprises have been classified as Strategic and Non-Strategic sectors. Following four broad Strategic Sectors have been delineated based on the criteria of national security, energy security, critical infrastructure, provision of financial services, and availability of important minerals:(i) Atomic Energy, Space, and Defense;(ii) Transport and Telecommunication;(iii) Power, Petroleum, Coal and other minerals; and(iv) Banking, Insurance, and Financial Services.In Strategic sectors, bare minimum presence of the existing public sector commercial enterprises at Holding Company level will be retained under Government control. The remaining enterprises in a strategic sector, will be considered for privatisation or merger /subsidiarization with another PSE or for closure. PSEs in non-strategic sectors shall be considered for privatisation, where feasible, otherwise such enterprises shall be considered for closure.The new policy intends to minimise the presence of Government in the PSEs so as to make available newer investment opportunities for private sector  and allow infusion of private capital, technology, innovation and best management practices. (c): As per the information available in the Public Enterprises Surveys, the details of total revenue from operations of CPSEs for the period from 2011-12 to 2020-21 is given in Annexure-I. The CPSE-wise information on total revenue from operations is available in Volume II of the Public Enterprises Survey  brought out by Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) every year and available on the  website  of the DPE at www.dpe.gov.in.The year-wise details of government investment in joint stock/government companies for the period from 2011-12 to 2020-21 is given in Annex-II. PSU wise details are available in Statement no. 11 of Union Government Finance Accounts, on the website of the Office of the Controller General of Accounts (CGA)  at cga.nic.in. (d) &(e ): Under the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), certain core infrastructure assets of selected Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) under respective central line Ministries/Departments have been identified for monetization over the NMP period from FY 2022-2025.During the period FY 2022-2025, under NMP, the PSUs whose infrastructure assets have been identified for monetization include NHAI, AAI, PGCIL, NTPC, NHPC, NLC India. FCI, GAIL, IOCL, HPCL, BSNL, MTNL, BBNL, etc. This has been done so as to unlock value from built infrastructure for accelerated new infrastructure creation and to bring efficiencies in infrastructure operation and maintenance for a multiplier impact on the economy.
