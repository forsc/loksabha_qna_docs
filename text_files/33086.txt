Studies have been conducted by College of Defence Management, Secunderabad and Headquarter Western Command of Indian Army in respect of Short Service entries to improve the intake.(c)	The Government has taken a number of measures to reduce the shortages. These, inter-alia, include sustained image projection, participation in career fairs and exhibitions and publicity campaign to create awareness among the youth on the advantages of taking up a challenging and satisfying career.  Further, the Government has taken various steps to make the job in the Armed Forces attractive including improvement in promotion prospects in the Armed Forces and to fill up vacancies.The number of officers commissioned in the Indian Army in the last four years is as under:2018	14562019	12412020	12722021	1192State/UT-wise recruitment details of officers are not held with the IHQ of MoD (Army).  However, the State/UT-wise details of officers recruited in Indian Navy and Indian Air Force during the last four years are at Annexure.(d)	Time Scale promotions are granted upto rank of Colonel in Indian Army.  The reckonable commissioned service for promotion to various posts subject to meeting requisite Qualitative Requirements [except Army Medical Corps (AMC)] including AMC Non-Technical, Army Dental Corps, Remount and Veterinary Corps & Army Postal Service are as follows:(i)	Lieutenant	On commissioning(ii)	Captain	2 years(iii)	Major	6 years(iv)	Lieutenant Colonel	13 years(v)	Colonel (Time Scale)	26 yearsColonel and above are selection grade ranks in Indian ArmyPromotion upto the rank of Commander/Captain (Time Scale) in Indian Navy is undertaken as ‘Time Scale’ promotions as follows:Rank	CriteriaSub Lieutenant	On commissioningLieutenant	02 years as Sub-Lieutenant(A maximum of 12 months seniority can be gained towards promotion to Lieutenant)Lieutenant Commander	04 years from date of promotion to Substantive LieutenantCommander	11 years from date of promotion to Substantive LieutenantCaptain (Time Scale)	Substantive Commanders who have completed 26 years of reckonable commissioned servicePromotion by Selection: Promotion of officers to Captain (select) and above are undertaken based on select rank vacancies available.  Rate of promotion is subject to the availability of vacancies.The promotion policy for officers of each service is peculiar to the requirement of the specific service and is therefore not uniform. The parameters for substantive promotion in IAF for officers other than Medical/dental branches are stipulated in AFI (Air Force Instructions) 3/87 which were approved and issued by the Government of India.As per existing policies and relevant instructions, the timelines (including ante-date) for promotions upto rank of Gp Capt (TS)/(S) are as tabled below:-Rank	Reckonable Commissioned ServiceFg Offr	On commissioning Flt Lt	2 yearsSqn Ldr	6 yearsWg Cdr	13 yearsGp Capt(S)	16 to 18 yearsGp Capt (TS)	26 yearsAir Ranks:(i)	Officers are promoted to the Air Ranks through Promotion Boards (PB) on the basis  of available vacancies and merit.(ii)	Since the vacancies are variable, the approximate timelines with respect to reckonable commissioned service (including ante-date) for promotion to Air Ranks is as follows:(a)	Air Commodore	: 26 to 30 years(b)	Air Vice Marshal	: 32 to 34 years(c)	Air Marshal		: 35 to 36 yearsThe promotion policies in respect of officers is reviewed periodically and changes considered necessary are incorporated to further improve the promotion policy so as to ensure that only the most meritorious rise to the top and ensure highest standards of leadership in the IAF.(e) 	Qualified candidates may join Indian Army as Other Ranks (OR), Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs) and officers in various arms and services.

However, due to COVID-19 pandemic, all recruitment activities have presently been put on hold since July, 2021.The Navy provides equal opportunities to the capable youth to join the Indian Navy, during the induction/recruitment process.  The response from youth to join the Indian Navy has been very encouraging.  The Navy has a robust publicity programme extending to rural areas for attracting the eligible youth to join Indian Navy.  As a part of Digital India initiative, the Government has set up Common service Centres (CSC) in Panchayts across the country.  These CSC provide high quality and cost effective video, voice and data services including web enabled e-governance services in rural areas. Indian Navy has concluded an MoU with CSC which has enabled to extend its recruitment reach to remote and rural areas of the country.The IN website (www.joinindiannavy.gov.in) has been migrated to Cloud Server of NIC with improved infrastructure and enhanced functionalities, look & feel as well as increased capacity to make it more user friendly and attractive.The sustained and aggressive publicity campaign has resulted in the increased awareness about Navy in rural areas which is evident by the upward trend in the response received from the candidates applying for various entries of Navy.Selection of officers and airmen cadre in the IAF is carried out Pan India to ensure equitable representation of all regions of India through online Air Force Common Admission Test (AFCAT) and Scheduled Test for Airmen Recruitment (STAR).  In addition, recruitment rallies are also conducted for recruitment in airmen cadre.  The selection is thus open to all eligible citizens of the country without any discrimination / reservation on the basis of caste, creed, sex, tribe, religion or region (state) and is based purely on merit.(f) 	Post Hon’ble Supreme Court order dated 17th February, 2020, Women Officers are being granted Permanent Commission in 10 Arms/Services of Indian Army subject to their meeting the Qualitative Requirement (QR) alongwith the Short Service Commissioned Men Officers.

The induction of women has commnenced from the year 2020.  First batch of women Military Police personnel have completed their training and reported to units. The Defence Forces have opened entry for women candidates in NDA, allowing girls to appear in NDA entrance exams from July 2022 courses onwards.  For the first batch, written exam has been conducted on 14th November, 2021.  The Indian Air Force (IAF) undertakes various induction publicity measures to encourage youth including women to join IAF.  Modules like direct contact programme, print and electronic media is extensively used to create awareness about IAF and educate students about various mode of entries.Women officers in Indian Navy are appointed onboard warships.  Until 2019, women officers were being commissioned as Pilots and Observers only for shore based aircraft.  However, in order to employ women at par with male officers, women officers have also been streamed as specialist Observers into helicopters commencing 2020.  Provost specialisation has been opened up for women officers since 2020 and the first women Provost officer has joined the specialisation in March 2021 after successful completion of At-Arms course.The Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) stream has been opened up for women officers.
