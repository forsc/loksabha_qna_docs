As per reservoir storage bulletin dated 27.06.2019, live storage available in these reservoirs is 26.272 Billion Cubic Meter (BCM) which is 86% of average live storage for last ten years of these reservoirs. (c) to (e)  De-siltation of reservoirs to increase its storage capacity is primarily the responsibility of dam owners who are generally State Governments or Central/ State PSUs.	Usually de-silting of large reservoirs is not techno-economically feasible. Under the World Bank assisted Dam Rehabilitation & Improvement Project (DRIP)  there is a need based provision for desiltation of dams and desiltation works of three dams viz. Kundahapalam (Tamil Nadu), Papanasam (Tamil Nadu) and Asan Barrage (Uttarakhand) has been taken up. *****
