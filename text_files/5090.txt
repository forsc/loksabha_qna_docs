                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR) (a to c) Fourteenth Finance Commission (FFC) for its award period 2015-20 has observed at para 14.49 of its Report that “the aggregate debt and deficit indicators of all States are well within the target threshold suggested by the Thirteenth Finance Commission. However, there are variations among States in fiscal consolidation when the debt sustainability is measured on a multiple indicator approach like debt as percentage of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) and interest payment relative to revenue receipts”. Hence, FFC has not identified any State as debt burdened State. However, as gleaned from State’ Finance Accounts published by Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), State-wise details of outstanding debt (both principal and interest) at the end of March of 2017 are given in Annex. Annex to reply to part (a to c) of Lok Sabha unstarred question No. 4615 for 22.07.2019State-wise details of Outstanding Debt(As at the end of March of 2017)State	Amount(Rs. in crore)Andhra Pradesh	           2,01,314 Arunachal Pradesh	                5,625 Assam 	              43,981 Bihar	           1,38,722 Chhattisgarh	              43,431 Goa	              16,900 Gujarat  	           2,43,146 Haryana 	           1,46,371 Himachal Pradesh  	              47,244 Jammu & Kashmir  	              62,207 Jharkhand 	              66,827 Karnataka	           2,11,071 Kerala    	           1,89,769 Madhya Pradesh 	           1,55,139 Maharashtra 	           3,95,858 Manipur 	                8,808 Meghalaya 	                8,984 Mizoram 	                6,725 Nagaland 	                9,557 Odisha 	              71,623 Punjab 	           1,82,526 Rajasthan 	           2,55,002 Sikkim      	                4,671 Tamil Nadu 	           2,83,394 Telangana	           1,34,738 Tripura	              11,259 Uttar Pradesh	           4,14,455 Uttarakhand 	              44,583 West Bengal 	           3,37,682 Total	         37,41,612 Source: Statement No. 6 of respective State’s Finance Accounts published by CAG.
