ANSWER




(a)&(b): The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme namely ‘Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission, since September, 2013 in statutory towns of country to reduce poverty and vulnerability of urban poor households by enabling them to access gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities. The Mission also aims to build strong grassroot level institutions of the urban poor, provide shelters equipped with essential services to the urban homeless and address livelihoods concerns of the urban street vendors.In pursuance of the Government’s vision of “Housing for All” by 2022, MoHUA is also implementing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) since 25.06.2015 for providing assistance to States/UTs for addressing the housing requirement of the people belonging to Economically Weaker Section, Lower Income Group and Middle Income Group in urban areas. Central assistance is provided to States/UTs through four verticals of the Scheme namely “In-situ” Slum Redevelopment; Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme; Affordable Housing in Partnership and Beneficiary-led individual house construction/ enhancements.A respondent-based survey to collect information regarding various individual and household characteristics was carried out by respective State Government/ UT Administration as Socio-Economic Caste Census-2011 in both rural and urban areas. The population of urban poor and beneficiaries of Food Security Act, however, are not based on this survey.The National Food Security Act, 2013 provides for coverage of upto 50% of urban population for receiving highly subsidized food grains. The coverage under the Act is substantially high to ensure that all vulnerable and needy sections of the society are covered. It also contains provisions for nutritional support to pregnant women and lactating mothers and children up to 14 years of age. Coverage under the Act is under two categories - (i) households covered under Antyodaya Anna Yojana scheme to the extent specified by the Central Government and (ii) the remaining households as Priority Households to be identified by the State Governments/ Union Territories (UTs) as per criteria evolved by them, within the coverage determined for the State/UT.                                       ******
