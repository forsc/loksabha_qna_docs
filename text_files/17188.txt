ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a):	Yes. The theme for International Day of Yoga (IDY) 2020 was adopted as ‘Yoga at Home, Yoga with Family’, in view of the restrictions on mass gatherings arising from the contagious nature of COVID-19. The Ministry of AYUSH made various online resources available on its digital platforms like the Yoga Portal and the social media handles like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to provide ample opportunities for the people to learn Yoga from their homes. The Ministry also organized the ‘My Life, My Yoga (MLMY)’ i.e. the Jeevan Yoga video blogging contest with attractive prizes for the winners and runners-up. Additionally, the Ministry of AYUSH, in association with Prasar Bharati, telecasted a trainer led Yoga session on DD National on the sixth International Day of Yoga. Numerous online discourses on Yoga by prominent Yoga gurus and experts were also organized as a part of the promotional campaign for IDY 2020. 16 Yoga gurus and experts delivered their discourses from the 5th of June 2020 to the 20th of June 2020, which were streamed live on the official Facebook page of the Ministry of AYUSH. To facilitate training from home, daily telecast of the Common Yoga Protocol (CYP) was organized on DD Bharti for making more and more people familiar with CYP and preparing them for the main event. Prominent celebrities from the entertainment industry gave promotional messages on Yoga, encouraging the people to be active participants from their homes in the IDY. (b):  No.(c) & (d):   Since Public Health is a State subject, initiating various steps for awareness about Yoga in their respective domains fall under the purview of the respective State/ UT governments. Further to this, at the Central level, Ministry of AYUSH also strives to promote the system and to create awareness for the benefit of the people including rural areas. For this purpose an Information Education and Communication (IEC) Scheme, has been devised by the Ministry, activities under which include steps to reach out to people and to create awareness about Yoga. IEC activities include programs on TV, Radio, Print-media etc. Also, as a part of observation of IDY 2020, this Ministry had reached out to Gram Pradhans with suggested plan of action for Yoga promotion in villages. Common Service Centers (CSCs) of the Ministry of Electronics & IT have also been roped in for promotion of Yoga in rural areas.
