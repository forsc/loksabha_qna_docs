ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b):  The implementation/execution of projects approved under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) {PMAY (U)} Mission is the responsibility of the concerned State/UT and Urban Local Body (ULB). The State/UT authorities concerned engage Third Party Quality Monitoring Agencies (TPQMA) to ensure quality of construction under various components of the Mission. On the basis of quality assurance report by such agencies and also reports of their own technical staff, States/UTs and ULBs take further necessary action to ensure that standard quality houses and infrastructure are constructed under the Mission. Selection/Identification of beneficiaries for the projects taken up under PMAY (U) Mission comes within the purview of State/UT Governments. However, the Ministry has put in place the following monitoring mechanisms for implementation of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) [PMAY(U)] in a transparent and time bound manner:i.	Payment through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) Mode and Aadhaar seeding of beneficiaries for transparency and accountability. ii.	Use of Information/Space Technology through PMAY(U)-MIS (Management Information System), Bhuvan Portal, PFMS (Public Financial Management System) and Geo-tagging/Geo-fencing of sanctioned houses for effective monitoring. iii.	The Ministry monitors progress of the Mission through periodic review meetings, video-conferences and field visits.iv.	Central Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee (CSMC) constituted under Chairmanship of Secretary, MoHUA meets every month to sanction central assistance for new projects and reviews the progress of the Mission.   v.	State Level Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee (SLSMC) under Chairmanship of Chief Secretary of the concerned State/UT reviews the progress of implementation of the Mission at the State level.                    ******
