The District Authorities issued sanction in February 2019 for sharing  25% cost from MPLADS funds for complete 2000 SSLs in case of Garhwal and Nainital Parliamentary Constituencies, however, in case of Almora Parliamentary Constituency sanction was issued by District Authorities in July 2019 only for 500 SSLs.EESL has further reported that Hon’ble MPs of Garhwal and Nainital Parliamentary Constituencies have provided the list of villages/areas covered with exact locations for 1042 and 1600 numbers of SSLs respectively during June/July 2019 against which so far 100 SSLs have been installed in Garhwal Parliamentary Constituency and 625 SSLs in Nainital Parliamentary Constituency. List of villages/areas covered with exact location of SSLs is yet to be received in case of Almora Parliamentary Constituency.As per Guidelines of the Scheme the SSLs are normally installed within six months from issue of sanction by District Authorities and receipt of list of villages/areas covered with exact locations of SSLs from Hon’ble MP.*****
