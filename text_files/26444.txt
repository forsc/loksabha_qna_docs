MINISTER OF EDUCATION (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) & (b): Recently 12 posts of Vice Chancellors have been filled up in Central Universities.

The Search-cum-Selection Committee comprises nominees of Executive Council/ Board of Management/ Court of the concerned Central University as well as Visitor’s nominees.The State-wise data of Vice Chancellors belonging to SC/ ST/ OBC/ General Category in Central Universities is not maintained centrally.(e) & (f): State-run Universities are governed by various acts of states.*****
