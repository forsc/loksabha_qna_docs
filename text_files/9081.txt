ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) & (b): Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) levies service charge as per market conditions since the introduction of online ticketing facility over Indian Railways in 2002. In order to incentivize digital payments, the aforesaid service charges were temporarily withdrawn in November, 2016. However, IRCTC incurs substantial expenditure on providing online ticketing facility. Further, many initiatives like Alternate Train Accommodation Scheme ‘VIKALP’, Artificial Intelligence based Passenger Name Record (PNR) confirmation predictor etc. have been introduced on the IRCTC website to enhance passenger convenience and user-experience.  In order to defray the cost incurred in maintenance, upgradation and expansion of ticketing infrastructure, a convenience fee of `15/+ GST per ticket for Non-AC Classes and `30/- + GST per ticket for AC Classes is being levied by IRCTC w.e.f.  01.09.2019. (c) & (d): At present, there is no proposal to reduce the convenience fee. However, to promote Unified Payments Interface (UPI) as a payment option among the online users, 1000 users are being given a cash prize of `500/- each on daily basis through a lucky draw scheme.(e): Does not arise.*******
