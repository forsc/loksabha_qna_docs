ANSWER




(a) to (c) 	Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 (earlier known as Umbrella Integrated Child Development  Services)  is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme and the administration, management & monitoring regarding implementation of the Scheme is being done by the concerned State Government/UT Administration. Complaints, if received, with respect to irregularities/ corruption in implementation of the Scheme are taken up with concerned States/ UTs for appropriate action. Reports on complaints which are serious in nature are sought from State Governments/ UT Administrations. Action for any misconduct or involvement of any employee in any corrupt practice is taken by the respective State Governments/ UT Administrations as per their service rules.Further, a robust ICT enabled platform named Poshan Tracker has been designed to capture real-time data on implementation and monitoring of Anganwadi Services across the country. The Poshan Tracker management application provides a 360 - degree view of the activities of the Anganwadi Centre (AWC), service deliveries of Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and complete beneficiary management.  *************
