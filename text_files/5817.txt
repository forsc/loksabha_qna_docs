ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Yes Sir. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Passenger and Cargo Services between India and Maldives was signed on June 8, 2019 in Male to improve people to people contact by providing an alternate, direct and less expensive means for transport of people and goods.  (b)& (c) The MoU has been signed for advancement of economic, social and cultural ties between the two countries. The MoU envisages a regular Passenger and Cargo ferry service between Kochi and Male/ Kulhudhuffushi in Maldives or any other ports mutually agreed. Connectivity between India and Male by sea would help to promote inbound tourism, particularly health and wellness tourism.(d)	A feasibility study is being undertaken to ascertain the trade/ cargo potential, infrastructure/ superstructure facilities, vessel deployment & service pattern etc. Based on the findings of the feasibility study, further action would be taken.(e)	Yes Sir. The MoU signed between the two countries envisages a regular passenger and cargo ferry service between Kochi and Male/Kulhudhuffushi in Maldives or any other ports mutually agreed. Connectivity between India and Male by sea would help to promote inbound tourism, particularly health and wellness tourism. The proposed ferry service, however, does not envisage calling at Andaman & Nicobar Islands.                                             ********
