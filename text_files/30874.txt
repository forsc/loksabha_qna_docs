                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) and (b)	Nine species of vultures are recorded from India. They are Oriental White-backed Vulture (Gyps bengalensis), Long-billed Vulture (Gyps indicus), Slender-billed Vulture (Gyps tenuirostris), Himalayan Vulture (Gyps himalayensis), Eurasian Griffon (Gyps fulvus), Red-headed Vulture (Sarcogyps calvus), Egyptian Vulture (Neophron percnopterus), Bearded Vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) and Cinereous Vulture (Aegypius calvus).As per information available in the Ministry, the population of three species of Vultures, viz., Gyps indicus, Gyps bengalensis and Gyps tenuirostris, had drastically declined during the 1990s. The major cause of mortality of vultures was found to be the veterinary non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ‘Diclofenac’, given to cattle in pain and inflammation. However, due to the concerted efforts by the Government, the population of these vulture species has stabilized now. The population estimation of other species of Vultures is not collated in the Ministry.(c), (d) and (e) Oriental White-backed Vulture, Long-billed Vulture and Slender-billedVulture are endangered and have been listed in Schedule I of the Wild Life(Protection) Act, 1972 according them the highest degree of protection.The important steps taken by the Government to save the vultures andincrease their number include:(i)	All the species of Vultures have been listed in the Schedules of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.(ii)	The vial size of the drug diclonofec has been restricted to 3ml to prevent its use in livestock.(iii)	Safety testing of various veterinary non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, available in the market to identify theirtoxicity to vultures.(iv)	Establishing vulture safe zones in different parts of the countryfor conservation of the remnant population of vultures. (v)	Raising awareness especially among users of veterinaryformulations. (vi)	Ministry sponsored films ''The Last Flight'' and ''VanishingVultures'' are frequently telecasted on radio and television inorder to raise awareness on vulture conservation. States havebeen requested to develop education and awareness materials,keeping the Animal Husbandry sectors and farmers in mind. (vii)	Eight Vulture Conservation Breeding Centers have beenestablished in India.(viii)	The Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) led a researchstudy to identify a safe alternative to diclofenac by carrying outsafety-testing of the shortlisted drug meloxicam on vultures, incollaboration with BNHS and the Royal Society for theProtection of Birds, an international bird conservationorganization based in the United Kingdom. Meloxicam wasproved to be safe for vultures and was promoted as analternative to diclofenac.(ix) India has launched an Action Plan for VultureConservation (2020-2025) on 9th November, 2020.(x) Government of India provides funding support to the Statesunder Centrally Sponsored Scheme- Development of WildlifeHabitats for conservation of Vultures under the SpeciesRecovery Programme. *****
