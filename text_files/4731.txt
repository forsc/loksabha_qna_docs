                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a) to (e):  A statement is laid on the Table of the HouseSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 397* FOR 19TH JULY, 2019(a)	There are 3108 licensed blood banks in the country. Detailed information regarding numbers of Government and private blood banks functioning in the country, State/UT wise is given in Annexure – I.(b) & (c)	There are 76 districts in the country without blood banks and the details thereof are given in Annexure – II. However given the fact that due to various administrative reasons, State Governments carve out new districts periodically, blood needs of such districts continue to be catered through licensed blood banks in nearby districts and through blood storage centres set up in First Referral Units at Community Health Centres and select 24 hour Primary Health Centres. The Government is not in receipt of any information regarding people dying due to lack of blood from the States. Such information is also not maintained at national level.(d)	Government of India has formulated a policy to have at least one Blood Bank in every District. Public Health, being a State subject, it is the primary responsibility of the State Government to ensure the establishment of Blood Banks as per their need. However, support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their healthcare system including strengthening existing blood banks/establishing new blood banks based on the proposals submitted by the States through National Health Mission. (e)	The National Blood Transfusion Council and the Blood Transfusion Councils in each State facilitate the mechanism aimed at coordinating between the Government on the one side and public sector voluntary organizations, and the private sector on the other.  The National Blood Transfusion Council and State Blood Transfusion Council, in collaboration with public sector voluntary organizations, professional associations and private entities, etc does advocacy for  Voluntary Blood Donation, organizes local and pan-India blood donation drives and does Information Education and Communication activities.  Under National Health Mission, support has been provided to States to set up 74 blood banks and 1583 blood storage centres. National Blood Policy prohibits the sale and purchase of blood since it is a voluntarily donated commodity of human origin. Only licensed blood banks are permitted for collection, processing, storage and transportation of blood and blood components. At licensed blood banks, safety and quality of blood and blood components is ensured by Food and Drug Authority at State and National level through licensing and periodic inspections. All licensed blood banks are instructed to follow the guidelines for processing charges for blood and blood components and not levy any additional charges. They are also directed to display the charges prominently in the blood bank premises for public viewing. All hospitals are instructed to obtain blood only from licensed blood banks against such approved processing charges.****
