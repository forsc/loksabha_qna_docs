                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a): As per the information received from The Ministry of Statistics &Programme Implementation, National Statistical Office (NSO) conducts nationwide survey on Household Consumption Expenditure at regular intervals. The last survey for which the information on the same is available, is the National Sample Survey (NSS) 68th Round (July, 2011-June, 2012).  As per this survey, the State-wise Average Monthly Per Capita Consumer Expenditure (MPCE), which is a measure of average per capita monthly income  is given at Annexure-I.(b) & (c): Multi-pronged strategies are being taken by the Ministry of Rural Development to address rural poverty and improve the economic well-being of the people in rural areas with the main focus on increasing livelihood opportunities, empowering rural women, providing social safety net, skilling of rural youth, infrastructure development etc through its programmes viz. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), DeendayalAntyodayaYojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), DeenDayalUpadhyay – GraminKaushalyaYojana (DDU-GKY),  PradhanMantriAwaasYojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), PradhanMantri Gram SadakYojana (PMGSY), Shyama Prasad Mukherjee National RuRBAN Mission and National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP). DeendayalAntyodayaYojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission(DAY-NRLM) aims to reduce poverty by organizing the rural poor women into Self Help Groups (SHGs), and continuously nurturing and supporting them to take economic activities till they attain appreciable increase in income over a period of time. There are also two skill development programmes for rural poor youth under DAY-NRLM, namely, DeenDayalUpadhyayaGrameenKaushalyaYojana (DDU-GKY), and Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs).  Both these schemes are aimed at increasing employability of rural poor youth either for wage or self-employment. Under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) which is a demand driven wage employment programme, at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year is provided to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. State/ UT-wise average wage per personday of the people in the rural areas in various parts of the country during the last three years is given at Annexure-II. National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) is a social welfare programme for the aged, widows, disables and in the case of death of the primary breadwinner belonging to Below Poverty Line (BPL) Households. It is 100% centrally funded Central Sponsored Schemes (CSS) implemented in the entire country including rural and remote areas.  Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Grameen (PMAY-G) aims to provide a pucca house with basic amenities to all rural houseless households and households living in kutcha and dilapidated house in rural areas by 2022. Besides, the Government of India has rolled out Rural Mason Training (RMT) Programme under PMAY-G. The initiative is being assisted by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC).  Pradhan Mantri Gram SadakYojana (PMGSY) was launched in the year 2000 as a measure towards alleviation of poverty in rural areas by providing access to basic services to the rural population by providing them good quality roads. PMGSY has helped in better access of market place for the rural masses and generate employments in various forms.  Shyama Prasad MukherjiRurban Mission (SPMRM) is a unique programme, designed to deliver catalytic interventions to rural areas on the threshold of growth. 300 Rurban Clusters with thematic economic growth points, are being developed across the country under this Mission.
