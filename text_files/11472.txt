ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) to (f):To sustain the reforms brought in by the scheme on ‘End-to-End Computerization of Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) Operations’ and to introduce new reforms, the Department in association with States/UTs is implementing another scheme namely “Integrated Management of Public Distribution System (IM-PDS)” w.e.f. April 2018. The main objective of the scheme is to introduce nation-wide portability of ration card holders under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), through ''One Nation One Ration Card'' system. This system enables the migratory ration card holders/beneficiaries to lift their entitled foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) of their choice in the country by using their existing/same ration card issued in their home State/UT after biometric/Aadhaar authentication on electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices installed at the FPSs. There is no need to print/issue new ration card for portability under One Nation One Ration Card plan.............2/--2-	Under this scheme, the facility of inter-State/national portability of ration card holders through ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ system was initially launched in two clusters of two adjoining States of Andhra Pradesh & Telangana and Gujarat & Maharashtra w.e.f. August 2019. Further, two more clusters of two adjoining States each of Haryana & Rajasthan and Karnataka & Kerala w.e.f. October 2019. However, the facility of national/inter-State portability under One Nation One Ration Card is now available in a single cluster of 12 States, covering about 40% of total NFSA population in the country. Further, integration of remaining States/UTs depends on the readiness of States/UTs to implement the same.****
