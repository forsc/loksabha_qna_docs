One new Central University has been established at Motihari (Bihar) in 2016 and 2 Central Universities in Andhra Pradesh in 2019. Also 3 Central Sanskrit Sansthans have been given status of Central Universities in the year 2020.(c) to (e): As per Economic Survey (2020-21), India’s gross expenditure on Research & Development is 0.65 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
