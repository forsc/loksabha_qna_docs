The beneficiaries under the Scheme are children in the age group of 0-6 years, pregnant women and lactating mothers.The ICDS Scheme offers a package of six services, viz. (a) Supplementary Nutrition (b) Pre-       school non-formal education (c) Nutrition & health education (d) Immunization (e) Health check-up and (f) Referral services. The last three services are majorly related to health and are financially and technically supported by Ministry/Department of Health and Family Welfare implemented through the State.iii.
