ANSWER




MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D. V. SADANANDA GOWDA)                               (a) & (b): Yes, Sir. The details of India’s imports of Bulk Drugs, Drug Intermediates from China are as under:Years	Total import(US $ mn)	Imports from China(US$ mn)2016-17	2738.46	1826.34 (66.69%)2017-18	2993.25	2055.94 (68.68%)2018-19	3560.35	2405.42 (67.56%)(Source: DGCIS Kolkata)As per DGCIS Kolkata, during the year 2018-19, the share of China in the total bulk drugs imported into the country was approximately 67 per cent.The country imports Bulk Drugs/Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) for producing medicines including certain essential medicines. As India is a signatory to the WTO and TRIPs agreement, as such the import restrictions have been removed. It may be mentioned that most of the imports of the Bulk Drugs/APIs being done in the country are because of economic considerations.(c) : The Government is committed to make India sufficiently self-reliant in end to end indigenous drug manufacturing by making Indian Pharma Industry globally competitive. The policies formulated by Government from time to time are designed to minimize country’s dependence on imports and to give fillip to indigenous manufacturing. In this direction, the Government vide its notification dated 28th January, 2016 has withdrawn exemption of customs duty of certain categories of Bulk Drugs/APIs. Further, the Department of Pharmaceuticals has prepared an umbrella scheme namely ‘Scheme for Development of Pharmaceutical Industry’ with the objective to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of domestic pharmaceutical industry so as to enable it to play a lead role in the global market and to ensure availability, accessibility and affordability of quality pharmaceuticals of mass consumption. The umbrella scheme includes a sub-scheme for providing assistance to Bulk Drug Industry for Common Facility Centre.xxxxx
