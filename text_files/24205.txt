ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(DR. BHAGWAT KISHANRAO KARAD)(a) and (b):  The Revised Estimate (RE) for disinvestment receipts in 2020-21 was Rs. 32,000 crore. The actual disinvestment receipts during the year was Rs.32,845 crore. Due to volatile market conditions arising from COVID-19, the Revised Estimates were significantly lower than the Budget Estimates for 2020-21. (c): As on 31.03.2021, Government has realized disinvestment receipt of Rs. 32,845 crore which is around 103% of Revised Estimate (RE) in 2020-21.  (d) to (f):During the period 2014-15 to 2020-21, disinvestment receipts as a proportion of total budget has varied. Disinvestment of GOI equity in CPSEs depends largely on market sentiment, investor interest, and market valuation of CPSE stocks. With disinvestment over a period of time, the scope of minority stake sale has declined. Going forward, privatization would be the primary mode for disinvestment receipts. The details of disinvestment receipts as a proportion of total budget receipts (revenue and capital receipts) for each financial year since 2014-15 are as follows:       	(Rs. in crore)Year	Disinvestment Receipts 	Total Budget Receipts (revenue+capital)	Disinvestment Receipts as % of total receipts2014-15	24349	1585921	1.54%2015-16	23997	1774434	1.35%2016-17	46247	1984089	2.33%2017-18	100057	2137882	4.68%2018-19	84972	2316434	3.67%2019-20	50299	2681360	1.88%2020-21	32845	3467663	0.95%*****
