ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) and (b) In 2012-13, the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) was launched by integrating the District Information System for Education (DISE) and Secondary Education Management Information System (SEMIS). Since then the UDISE reports contain both absolute numbers and percentages. Similar practice has been followed in UDISE+ 2019-20 Report. As per usual practice, absolute numbers have been reported for number of schools, number of teachers and students enrolment.(c) and (d) Since UDISE was launched in 2012-13 by integrating the DISE and the SEMIS, comparison of indicators was made with respect to the year 2012-13 as well as recent data namely, 2018-19 and 2019-20 at all-India level. The indicators compared were enrolment of students, number of teachers, school infrastructure, gross enrolment ratio (GER), gender parity index (GPI) and pupil teacher ratio (PTR).*****
