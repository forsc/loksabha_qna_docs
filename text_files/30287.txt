ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a)	  State Government of Gujarat has informed that rainwater of rivers namely Bhadar, Ozat, Madhuvanti, Minsar, Venu and Sabli passes in SorthiGhed and Vartu, Sorthi, MotiKamadh, NaniKamadh river passes in BardaGhed area and run in to sea. Heavy rains causes flood in all these rivers and its tributaries.(b) As per the information received from State Government of Gujarat, all the villages of neighboring area are not turned into wetland but some pockets of Ghed area gets inundated. Looking at past years scenario of monsoon pattern, heavy to very heavy rainfall occurs in short period and this results in heavy flood situation and inundation of flood water in Ghed Area for a short period. Indirect benefit of this situation is also taken by farmers of surrounding areas to produce agriculture products by ground water recharge.(c) Flood management including erosion control falls within the purview of the States. Flood management and anti-erosion schemes are formulated and implemented by concerned State Governments as per their priority. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and also promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. State Government of Gujarat is of the view that it is techno-economic unviable to construct protection wall on all the bank of all rivers passing in Ghed Area.*****
