                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING (RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a) and (b) Yes Sir. The relevant paras of the MPLADS guidelines as amended vide circular dated 12.03.2020 with regards to transfer of funds not committed by the predecessor MP to incumbent MP and timeline for completion of works / settling of accounts opened by Nodal District Authority and  are as under:-  "4.7-  In respect of elected Members of Lok Sabha, the balance of MPLADS funds left by the predecessor MP in a Lok Sabha Constituency (funds not committed works of the predecessor MP) would be passed on to the successor MP from that constituency (in case of fresh delimitation, separate orders will be issued).  4.8 In respect of elected Members of Rajya Sabha, the balance of funds (funds not committed works) left in the Nodal District by the predecessor Member in a particular state on his demitting office will be equally distributed by the State Government among the successor elected Rajya Sabha Members in that state. The unspent balance of even earlier elected Rajya Sabha MPs if not already distributed, will be equally distributed among the sitting Rajya Sabha Members of the States concerned by the State Government.  4.9. the balance of funds (funds not committed for the recommended and sanctioned works) left by the nominated Members of Rajya Sabha in the Nodal District will be equally distributed amongst the successor nominated Members of Rajya Sabha by the State Government with the approval of Government of India.  4.10 The balance of funds (funds not committed for the recommended and sanctioned works) left by Anglo Indian nominated Lok Sabha MPs will be equally distributed among the successor Anglo Indian nominated Lok Sabha MPs by the State Government with the approval of Government of India.  4.10.1 Completion of works/ setting of accounts: The work of MPLADS shall be completed within 18 months from the date of demitting office in case of Rajya Sabha MPs or dissolution of the Lok Sabha. District Authorities shall settle and close the account of the concerned MP after completing all other formalities in another 3 months time, under intimation to the Government of India and with detailed information in the monthly progress report (MPR). If the District Authority does not finish the project within 18 months of demitting of an MP or dissolution of Lok Sabha, the District Authority will be required to complete the balance work out of State/ District funds. In no case, any extension will be given and District Authority shall be held responsible in case of any lapses in this regard."       In pursuance of the above paras, The Ministry has issued instructions dated 14-05-2020  on  Settlement and closure of savings bank accounts of former Members of Parliament after elapsing of stipulated time-period of 21 months. This was followed by reminders on 16.07.2020 and 31.08.2020. The copies of instructions and reminders are enclosed. (Annexures of these instructions / instruction may kindly be accessed on web-portal of mplads).   (c)  In respect of 15th Lok Sabha, total entitlement of Rs. 19.00 crore of Nagaur Lok Sabha constituency has been released by the Ministry. Out of this Rs. 19.00 crore, Rs. 15.28 crore has already been settled against the completed works; and an amount of Rs. 1.25 crore which was uncommitted by predecessor MP has been transferred to the incumbent MP of 17th Lok Sabha in two instalments. The remaining uncommitted balance, if any, will be transferred to incumbent MP on completion of ongoing works and settlement of account, in due course of time.         In respect of 16th Lok Sabha, the last instalment (second instalment of 2018-19) has not been released by the Ministry due to non-fulfilment of eligibility criteria / incomplete documentation by the Nodal District Authority. The account of 16th Lok Sabha will be settled in due course of time on completion of required formalities prescribed in the MPLADS guidelines.   (d)  As per the information received from the State, show-cause notices have been issued by the Rajasthan State Government against the erring officers and employees responsible for the delay. (e)  As referred to in the reply of part (c) above.                                                     *****
