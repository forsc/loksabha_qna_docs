ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)  The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation compiles data on time and cost overruns of on-going Central Sector Infrastructure Projects costing Rs. 150 crore and above, on the basis of information provided by the project implementing agencies on the On-line Computerized Monitoring System (OCMS). As on 01.01.2021, a total of 1687 projects were on the monitor of this Ministry. The State wise details of Central sector projects being monitored by the Ministry is at Annexure-I. (b) Yes sir, the Government has chalked out the completion schedule of each of Central Sector projects. The details and the status of these projects are available in the flash report at www. cspm.gov.in/publications. (c) Yes sir, several projects in various states are running behind schedule resulting in cost/time overruns. (d)  The details and the status of these projects are available in the flash report at www. cspm.gov.in/publications. The reasons for time and cost overruns are project-specific, depend on a variety of technical, financial and administrative factors, and differ from project to project. However, as reported by the project implementing agencies on this Ministry’s OCMS, the main reasons for increase in cost of the projects are: Under-estimation of original cost; Changes in rates of foreign exchange and statutory duties; High cost of environmental safeguards & rehabilitation measures; Spiraling land acquisition costs; Shortage of skilled manpower/ labor; Changes in Project scope; Monopolistic pricing by vendors of equipment services; General Price rise / inflation and Time Overruns and the main reasons for delay in timely completion of the Projects are: law and order problems, delay in land acquisition, delay in environment and forest clearances, funding constraints, rehabilitation and resettlement issues, local body / municipal permissions, utility shifting, contractual issues, etc. (e) The monitoring mechanism put in place by the Government to avoid the cost/time overrun of these projects are : Periodic review of projects under PRAGATI through video conferencing by Hon’ble Prime Minister; rigorous project appraisal; On-line Computerized Monitoring System (OCMS) for better monitoring; setting up of Revised Cost Committees in the Ministries for fixation of responsibility for time and cost overruns; regular review of infrastructure projects by the concerned administrative Ministries; and setting up of Central Sector Projects Coordination Committees (CSPCCs) in the States under the Chief Secretaries for removal of bottlenecks and for facilitating the speedy implementation of major projects.                                                  ***
