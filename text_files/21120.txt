                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c) :	Under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) comprehensive risk cover for crops is provided to farmers against all non-preventable natural risks including locust from pre-sowing to post-harvest.     As the major part of the scheme is being implemented on Area Approach basis and season-end claims are worked out on the basis of yield data submitted by the concerned State Government, therefore, particular reasons for crop loss/ claims are not looked into or not known. Hence, risk/peril-wise details i.e. due to locust, flood, drought, pest attack, etc., of claims are not maintained for wide spread calamities/season-end claims under the scheme.  In view of the considerable damage of crops due to locust attack, mid-season adversity provision of the scheme was invoked in locust affected districts to provide immediate relief to the affected farmers.   Details of final claims paid and farmers benefitted (to whom claims paid) in four locust affected districts of Rajasthan in 2019-20 under PMFBY are given below :District	Claims Paid (Rs. in crore)	Farmers BenefittedJodhpur	7.85	13718Jalore	127.22	60650Jaisalmer	21.97	18045Barmer	70.05	52117*******
