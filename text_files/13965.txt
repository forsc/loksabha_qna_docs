                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) The Anganwadi Services [erstwhile Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme] is a unique programme for early childhood care and development. It offers a package of six services, viz. Supplementary Nutrition, Pre-School Non-Formal Education, Nutrition and Health Education, Immunization, Health Check-Up and Referral Services. The beneficiaries under the Scheme are children in the age group of 0-6 years, pregnant women and lactating mothers. The objectives of the scheme are to improve the nutritional and health status of children in the age-group of 6 months-6 years; to lay the foundation for proper psychological, physical and social development of the child; to reduce the incidence of mortality, morbidity, malnutrition and school dropouts; to achieve effective co-ordination of policy and implementation amongst the various departments to promote child development; and to enhance the capability of the mother to look after the normal health and nutritional needs of the child through proper nutrition and health education. These services are delivered through 13.79 lakh operational Anganwadi Centres. At present, there are 795.87 lakh beneficiaries availing these services as on 30.09.2019. State-wise statement of beneficiaries under Anganwadi Services is placed at Annexure.(b)	 No, sir.(c) 	No, sir.(d) 	Does not arise.(e)	 Anganwadi Services aim to improve the nutritional and health status of children in the age-group of 6 months-6 years, pregnant women & lactating mothers and reduce the incidence of mortality, morbidity and malnutrition. Under the Scheme, a package of six services is provided through a network of 13.79 lakh Anganwadi Centres in the country as on 30.09.2019. The scheme is universal, open to all the covered beneficiaries and is self selecting.   	For effective implementation of the Anganwadi Services, a number of reforms have taken place in the recent past i.e. increasing the cost norms for Supplementary Nutrition (SN) given to beneficiaries, improving the availability of water and sanitation facilities at the AWCs, improving the service condition of Anganwadi Workers/Anganwadi Helpers by giving them better opportunities in their career progression and revision of their honorarium, release of funds based on the Annual Programme Implementation Plan (APIP) of the States/UTs, introducing Early Childhood Care & Education (ECCE) policy, Curriculum and Standards for ECCE, age appropriate activity books under ECCE, etc.	The Government has set up POSHAN Abhiyaan which has a number of new components contributing to the improved services delivery under the Anganwadi Services i.e. monitoring of the scheme through Common Application Software (CAS) by providing Smart phones to the Anganwadi Workers & lady Supervisors as job aid, introducing incentive for better performing States, provision of performance based incentives for Anganwadi Workers and Anganwadi Helpers. *****   Annexure to Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 2576 for 06.03.2020 asked by Shri Basanta Kumar Panda regarding "Restructuring of ICDS"Anganwadi Centres Sanctioned and Operational under Anganwadi Services  Scheme Quarter Ending 30 September 2019                                                 S.No	State/Uts	No. of ICDS Projects	No. of Anganwadi Centres 	Beneficiaries of Supplementary Nutrition	Beneficiaries of Pre-school Education		Sanctioned 	Operational 	Sanctioned 	Operational 	Children      (6 months -
