                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b)  Ground water levels in various parts of the Country are declining because of continuous withdrawal due to reasons such as increased demand of fresh water for various uses, vagaries of rainfall, increased population, industrialization & urbanization etc.  Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) carries out ground water monitoring four times a year in different States.  In order to assess the declining/rising trend in water level on a long-term basis, pre-monsoon water level data 2018 has been compared with the decadal average (2008-2017) water level.  Analysis of data indicates decline in ground water level in about 52% of the wells being monitored. State-wise details including Maharashtra are given in Annexure.  In Maharashtra, out of the total 353 assessment units (Taluks) in the State, 9 units have been categorized as ‘Over-exploited’, 1 unit have been categorized as ‘Critical’, 19 units as ‘Semi-Critical’ and 324 units as ‘Safe’, which includes all the assessment units (Taluk) of the Aurangabad District.(c) to (e)   Water being a State subject, efforts to conserve and manage ground water is primarily States’ responsibility. However, other steps taken by the Central Government to control ground water depletion are at the following URL: http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf*****  ANNEXURE Annexure referred to in reply to part (a) & (b) of Unstarred Question No.1065 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 27.06.2019 regarding “DARK ZONES OF DEPLETING WATER LEVEL”CATEGORIZATION OF BLOCKS/ MANDALS/ TALUKAS IN INDIA (2013)Sl.No.	States / Union Territories	Total No. of Assessed Units	Safe	Semi-critical	Critical	Over-exploited	Saline			Nos.	%	Nos.	%	Nos.	%	Nos.	%	Nos.	% 	States	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 1	Andhra Pradesh	670	497	74	54	8	17	3	61	9	41	62	Arunachal Pradesh	11	11	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	03	Assam	27	27	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	04	Bihar	534	520	97	14	3	0	0	0	0	0	05	Chhattisgarh	146	125	86	18	12	2	1	1	1	0	06	Delhi	27	5	19	7	26	0	0	15	56	0	07	Goa	12	12	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	08	Gujarat	223	175	78	9	4	6	3	23	10	10	49	Haryana	119	30	25	11	9	14	12	64	54	0	010	Himachal Pradesh	8	6	75	0	0	1	13	1	13	0	011	Jammu & Kashmir	22	22	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	012	Jharkhand	260	244	94	10	4	2	1	4	2	0	013	Karnataka	176	98	56	21	12	14	8	43	24	0	014	Kerala	152	131	86	18	12	2	1	1	1	0	015	Madhya Pradesh	313	228	73	58	19	2	1	25	8	0	016	Maharashtra	353	324	92	19	5	1	0	9	3	0	017	Manipur	9	9	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	018	Meghalaya	11	11	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	019	Mizoram	22	22	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	020	Nagaland	11	11	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	021	Odisha	314	308	98	0	0	0	0	0	0	6	222	Punjab	138	26	19	3	2	4	3	105	76	0	023	Rajasthan	248	44	18	28	11	9	4	164	66	3	124	Sikkim	 -	 -	 -	 -	 -	 -	 -	 -	 -	 -	 -25	Tamil Nadu	1139	429	38	212	19	105	9	358	31	35	326	Telangana	443	311	70	74	17	12	3	46	10	0	027	Tripura	39	39	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	028	Uttar Pradesh	820	603	74	45	5	59	7	113	14	0	029	Uttarakhand	18	16	89	1	6	1	6	0	0	0	030	West Bengal 	268	191	71	76	28	1	0	0	0	0	0 	Total (States)	6533	4475	68	678	10	252	4	1033	16	95	1 	Union Territories	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 1	Andaman & Nicobar	34	34	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	02	Chandigarh	1	1	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	03	Dadra & Nagar Haveli	1	1	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	04	Daman & Diu	2	1	50	0	0	1	50	0	0	0	05	Lakshadweep	9	6	67	3	33	0	0	0	0	0	06	Puducherry	4	2	50	0	0	0	0	1	25	1	25 	Total (UTs)	51	45	88	3	6	1	2	1	2	1	2 	Grand Total	6584	4520	69	681	10	253	4	1034	16	96	1*****
