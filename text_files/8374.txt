                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b) Government is taking various steps for citizens’ involvement and creating awareness about climate change, which include inter alia:i)	Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) is implementing Environment Education, Awareness and Training scheme with the objective to promote environmental awareness among all sections of the society and to mobilize people’s participation for conservation of environment. Under the National Green Corps (NGC) programme, about one lakh schools have been identified as Eco-clubs, wherein, nearly thirty lakh students are actively participating in various environment protection and conservation activities. ii)	India’s biggest climate change awareness programme was the ‘Science Express Climate Action Special Train’ (SECAS) – a mobile exhibition on climate change aimed to create awareness among various sections of society, especially students. SECAS intends to increase understanding of the science of climate change, observed and anticipated impacts and different possible responses. During 15 October, 2015 to 07 May, 2016, the train travelled a distance of about 19,800 km and more than 23.24 lakh visitors viewed its thematic content on global warming. Due to the unprecedented response received by the train, it was run again from 17 February, 2017 to 08 September, 2017 with the aim to cover a distance of 19,000 km.iii)	To involve citizens in adopting sustainable lifestyles, MoEF&CC launched a social movement ‘Green Good Deeds’ to bring focus on small steps like saving energy, conserving water, planting trees, reduce reuse and recycle, carpool where possible, and use public transport, by which individuals can contribute to combating climate change and environmental challenges. iv)	Further, MoEF&CC has also been involved in promoting environment education to all sections of the society through various outreach activities, theme-based exhibition galleries, etc. organized from time to time by the National Museum of Natural History, New Delhi and its four Regional Museums, located in Mysuru, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar and Sawai-Madhopur. v)	Under the National Mission on Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem (NMSHE) and National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change (NMSKCC), 25 State Climate Change Cells in 25 States/ Union Territories have been supported, and providing awareness about the threat of global warming is one of the tasks assigned to State Cells. During last five years 1.5 lakh people have been given exposure as part of public awareness programme conducted by State Climate Change Cells. vi)	India was the global host of the World Environment Day 2018. During the event, 10,000 school children from 200 schools of Delhi-NCR attended Envithon – The Green Run. vii)	The Government is also implementing a scheme to support adaptation measures in its States and Union Territories which, inter alia, include capacity building of stakeholders and local agencies.(c) To ascertain the impact of climate change, Government of India has devised a study “Climate Change and India: A 4X4 Assessment – A Sectoral and Regional Analysis for 2030s”. The study covers four major regions in India, namely, Himalayan region, North-Eastern region, Western Ghats and the Coastal Region in regard to observed climate and climate change projections for the year 2030s on four key sectors i.e. agriculture, water, natural ecosystem, biodiversity and health. As part of the National Communications, the Ministry conducted studies on impact of climate change in India which are summarized in the ‘Vulnerability Assessment and Adaptation’ chapters. The Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) under National Innovations on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) Project has also carried out studies on the impacts of climate change on agriculture.  (d) and (e) Creating awareness among citizens about the threat of global warming forms an intrinsic part of India’s national framework to deal with the issue of climate change, including the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC), National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC) and Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP).****
