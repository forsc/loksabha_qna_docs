ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)  The Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, as per the mandate of Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), encourages ex-situ conservation of Rare Endangered Threatened (RET) species and endemic plants through botanic gardens, protected areas and biosphere reserves. Financial assistance for conservation is extended by the Ministry under various schemes such as Assistance to Botanic Garden (ABG) scheme, Project Tiger scheme and Environment Education, Awareness and Training (EEAT) scheme. Under EEAT scheme, Eco-clubs in schools and colleges are supported to promote environmental awareness and mobilize students’ participation for environment conservation. Also, the Central Zoo Authority has flagged off the outreach campaign on 12th March, 2021 entitled ''Conservation to Co-existence: the people connect'' which is a 75-week long initiative where 75 conservation priority species and 75 zoos across India are highlighted (one species and zoo per week). (b) & (c) As per information provided by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the research at ICAR has been re-oriented in farmers’ participatory mode and developing location specific, cost effective, eco-friendly, and socially acceptable scientific farming practices keeping in view the farmers’ resource availability, traditional indigenous technology knowhow and grass root farm innovations. ICAR has developed technologies for efficient soil health management, agricultural water management, watershed management, enhancement of nutrient and water use efficiency, resource conservation, crop diversification, integrated farming system including agroforestry, dryland farming, arid, coastal and hill agriculture, climate resilient agriculture, etc. Organic farming package of practices for 62 crops/cropping systems have also been developed. Under the National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA),climate resilient technologies, namely, drought tolerant short duration varieties, crop diversification, integrated farming systems, soil & water conservation measures etc. have been demonstrated in 151 most vulnerable districts in the country to minimize vulnerability against climate change. Agricultural Contingent Plans for 650 districts have also been prepared to cope up with any climatic adversities. Further, benefits of successful research are popularized among the farmers throughout the country through training and Front Line Demonstrations (FLDs). *****
