                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b) The Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) is implementing Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), Deen Dayal Upadhayay – Gramin Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP), Shyama Prasad  Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM) and Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana(SAGY) to bring about overall improvement in the quality of life of the people in rural areas, strengthening of livelihood opportunities, promoting self-employment, skilling of rural youths, infrastructure development, provision of social assistance and other basic amenities.  The details of allocation/ utilization/ expenditure incurred under difference schemes of MoRD to Chhattishgarh and the districts of Rajnandgaon and Kabirdham for the financia years 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 are at Annexure.  However, DDU-GKY and RSETI Schemes are demand driven schemes and funds are allocated to States as per demands against approved Action Plans. No district/region-wise allocation of funds is made under both the schemes. Similarly, Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is also a demand driven scheme and no separate allocation to the State/district is made. Under the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana framework, the development of Gram Panchayats is envisaged through convergence and implementation of existing Government Schemes and Programmes under the administrative control of respective Ministries without allocating additional funds. Under NSAP funds are allocated to States but no district wise allocation is made. Under SPMRM, funds are being released to the States/ UTs based on fulfillment of certain conditions mentioned in the Mission guidelines. Under SPMRM in Rajnandgoan district of Chhattishgarh, one Tribal cluster Murmunda has been indentified and in Kabirdham district, two Non-Tribal clusters namely, Birkona and Kunda have been identified.  Under DAY-NRLM, funds are released to the States and not to the districts which is done by the State.  Under PMGSY, funds are released to the State as a whole as per annual allocation depending upon the absorption capacity of the State and does not release funds to the district directly.******Annexure Annexure referred in statement in reply to part (a) & (b) of Lok Sabha Question No. 2509 due for answer on 09.03.2021 regarding the funds allocated and expenditure incurred under the Scheme of Department of Rural Development during financial year 2018-19 to 2020-21. 1.
