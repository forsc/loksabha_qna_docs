The details of selection are as below:S.No.	City	Round	Selection as Smart City1.	Jaipur	 1	January, 20162.	Udaipur	 1	January, 20163.	Ajmer	 2	September, 20164.	Kota	 2	September, 2016(b):	Works have been started in all 100 Smart Cities. The State-wise list of cities is attached at Annex-1. (c) to (e): As per Smart Cities Mission(SCM) Guidelines, Central Government allocates Rs. 500 crore to every city over the Mission period and releases in instalments. An equal amount of Rs. 500 crore, on a matching basis, is to be provided by the State Government/Urban Local Body(ULB). Balance funds required for the implementation of Smart City Proposals (SCP) are arranged through convergence with different Schemes/Missions of the Central/State Governments, loans, land value capture, Public-Private Partnerships(PPPs) and local bodies’ own resources. The implementation of the Smart Cities Mission at the city level is done by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) created for the purpose. The SPVs plan, appraise, approve,  implement, manage, operate, monitor and evaluate their Smart City projects.Government of India has released a total of Rs. 196 crore to Ajmer (Rs. 2 crore in 2015-16, Rs. 92 crore in 2016-17 and Rs. 102 crore in 2017-18). So far, city SPV has reported utilization of Rs. 93.54 crore. As on 19th July, 2019, 80 projects worth Rs. 909 crore have been tendered; out of this, works have been grounded for construction for 69 projects of Rs. 846 crore; and  29 projects of Rs. 129 crore have been completed by Ajmer Smart City. Ministry is regularly interacting with the States / Smart Cities through video conferences, review meetings, field visits, regional workshops etc. at various levels to assess the performance of the cities and to handhold them for improving the same. Apart from the guidance of domain experts participating in the regional workshops, cities also benefit from peer-to-peer learning during these interactions. At the national level, the implementation of Smart Cities Mission is being monitored by an Apex Committee headed by Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.  At State level, State level High Powered Steering Committee (HPSC) chaired by the Chief Secretary has been established to review the progress of its Smart Cities. Further, Government Nominee Directors of Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, on the Boards of SPVs, are  monitoring the progress in respective cities on a regular basis.                             *****
