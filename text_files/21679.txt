ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c):	TRIFED has executed MOU with National Medicinal Plants Board, Ministry of AYUSH for establishment of Van Dhan Vikas Kendras specially for Medicinal plants, creation of Van Dhan SHGs clusters for undertaking primary value addition of the MFPs and medicinal plants available in the areas, setting up of primary processing facility, infrastructure support for medicinal MAPs, streamlining its supply chain and establishment of herbal gardens, etc.In order to provide 12 month activity to the Van Dhan beneficiaries, TRIFED has included income generating activities such as, “Floriculture, Agriculture, Medicinal and Aromatic plants etc” for these Van Dhan Kendras, for which arrangements have been made with various Departments and Ministries like MSME, MoRD, ICAR, CSIR, IIT, Delhi, etc., including National Medicinal Plant Board (NMPB) for leveraging their schemes for the benefit of the Van Dhan beneficiaries. TRIFED has been implementing MSP for MFP scheme and Van Dhan Yojana (VDY) across the country. VDY is a composite program, meant for forest-based tribes, which aims to take the ‘MSP for MFP program’ to the next level through establishing tribal enterprises, generating livelihoods leading to income enhancement. It is a program for gathering, value addition, processing, packaging, branding & retail-marketing of forest products through tribal entrepreneurs in the form of tribal owned SHGs. The idea is to optimize the tribal income, locally, only through their existing skillsets and using non-timber forest produces. This is done through establishment of common-use-facilities & infrastructures for value addition, to be called Van Dhan Vikas Kendras (VDVKs). Under Van Dhan Yojana, TRIFED has so far sanctioned 1770 Van Dhan Vikas Kendras (VDVKs), associated with 5.27 Lakhs beneficiaries in 22 States & 1 Union Territory for promotion of tribal entrepreneurship and livelihood generations.
