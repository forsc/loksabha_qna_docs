ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) and (b) The Central Road and Infrastructure Fund (CRIF) is earmarked for various infrastructure sectors such as Transport (Road and Bridges, Ports, Shipyards, Inland Waterways, Airports, Railways, Urban Public Transport), Energy, Water and Sanitation, Communication, Social and Commercial Infrastructure, etc., as per the provisions of CRIF Act, 2000 amended by the Finance Act, 2019. The funds for various infrastructure sectors are to be earmarked as per the provisions of the above mentioned Act. As per amendment to the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961 in July, 2018, the subject matter pertains to the Ministry of Finance.  This Ministry is primarily responsible for development and maintenance of National Highways (NHs). Apart from this, it also allocates funds for development of State Roads under Central Road Fund (CRF)/ CRIF and Economic Importance & Inter State Connectivity (EI&ISC) schemes. The details of Cess collected under CRF/CRIF during last three years are as follows:-Amount in Rs. croreYear	Total Fund Collected under CRF/ CRIF 2016-17	72,399.532017-18	83,116.422018-19	1,13,000.00The State/UT wise details of Accrual/Allocation and Release/Expenditure for development of State Roads under CRIF and EI&ISC schemes during 2016-17 to 2018-19 are placed at Annexure-I & Annexure-II respectively.(c) and (d)  The Ministry identified and prioritized the projects , schemes or activities for release of funds under the CRF and EI&ISC schemes in consultation with the State Governments/ Union Territories (UTs) as per the extant policies.	The projects not considered for sanction/approval under these schemes during a financial year are not treated as pending. With the amendment of CRF Act, 2000 through Finance Act, 2018 and replacing earlier Act with the CRIF Act, 2000, sanction of schemes for the State Roads is no longer a function of the Central Government. However, the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) has initiated consultation with this Ministry for finalization of Criteria for development of State Roads as per the CRIF Act, 2000, amended vide the Finance Act, 2019.
