The State/UT-wise coverage of eligible beneficiaries with 1st and 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine is placed at Annexure-1. 	      The Government of India has made all arrangements to secure COVID-19 vaccines for the eligible beneficiaries as per production and the availability of COVID-19 vaccines in the country. It is expected that adequate quantity of Covid vaccine will be available between January 2021 to December 2021 to vaccinate eligible beneficiaries aged 18 years and above.
