SINGH)(a) & (b) The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) on 18th February 2020 notified setting up of “Renewable Energy Standardization Cell (RESC)” to coordinate development, updation and adoption of standards for quality assurance in renewable energy sector. The objectives of the cell are as follows;I.	to identify the areas in renewable energy sector where standards need to be developed /updated/ adopted.II.	identify and peruse international standards such as ISO, IEC, etc. for applications in Indian climatic conditions. In case modifications are needed, the same should be done and tried in test labs for revision suitable for Indian climatic conditions.III.	Initiate the process of developing standards involving experts from R&D institutions, test labs and industry. (c)Yes, Sir. Testing and standardization facilitate industrial participation, and hence boost commercialization of renewable energy across the globe. In view of fast developments in technologies particularly in solar and wind sectors, developing and updating of standards of renewable energy systems and components is critically essential for reliability and quality assurance of renewable energy supply to utilities. (d) The MNRE on 7.12.2017 notified the Lab Policy for Testing, Standardization and Certification for Renewable Energy Sector, which mandates developing/updating and adopting standards for renewable energy systems and components, and setting up a robust quality infrastructure for quality assurance in renewable energy supply in the country. Regular interaction are done with experts, industry and the Bureau of Indian Standards(BIS) for development, up dation and adoption of standards. International Standards are perused for the purpose.For quality control in SPV power projects, the MNRE on 5th September 2017 notified technical regulation for quality control of SPV Systems, Components and Devices under BIS Act (Compulsory Registration Scheme). As per the said order products, namely, SPV Modules, Solar Inverters and Battery storage have to conform to the specified Indian Standards which correspond to International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Standards, listed in the order. In wind energy, IEC Standards are followed by stakeholders. In small hydro power projects, comprehensive guidelines based on standards are followed. As follow up to RESC, action has been initiated to consolidate the status of standards in order to develop/update Indian Standards in all areas of renewable energy.  (e) Well defined programmes and policies covering framework, target, guidelines and ecosystem for commissioning of renewable energy projects, involving state governments with commitment from DISCOMS to purchase RE power with timely payment to RE generators are essential to create enabling environment for investors and industry for investment  in the renewable energy sector in the country.(f) The steps taken by the government streamlining policies and guidelines to encourage investment for promotion of renewable energy on a large scale in the country, interalia, include the following: -•	Target of installing 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by the year 2022;•	Permitting Foreign Direct Investment(FDI) up to 100 percent under the automatic route;•	Waiver of Inter State Transmission System (ISTS) charges and losses for inter-state sale of solar and wind power for projects to be commissioned up to December 2022;•	Notification of standard bidding guidelines to enable distribution licensees to procure solar and wind power at competitive rates in cost effective manner;•	Declaration of trajectory for Renewable Purchase Obligation(RPO) up to the year 2022;•	Implementation of Green Energy Corridor project to facilitate grid integration of large scale renewable energy capacity addition;•	 Setting up of Ultra Mega RE Parks;•	 Opening of LCs by all DISCOMS/distribution licenses for all independent RE producers;•	Launching of new Schemes, such as, PM-KUSUM, Solar Rooftop Phase-II, 12000MW CPSU Scheme Phase-II, etc.•	Quality control order on SPV Systems and Components with guidelines for testing of SPV Modules, Inverters and Storage battery.*****
