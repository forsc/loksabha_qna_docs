ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (d) :  As per Electricity Act 2003, the generation is a de-licensed activity. Thus, the investment in setting up of power projects is made by the concerned developers. Therefore, no funds are sanctioned/allocated by the Government of India in this regard, except contribution in equity of the Central Public Sector Units for setting up of such projects on a case-to-case basis.		As far as solar and wind energy projects in the country are concerned, Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) publishes the results after e-Reverse Auction (e-RA) and list of commissioned projects under Solar, Wind, Hybrid and Rooftop schemes under the "RTI" section of SECI''s official website, www.seci.co.in, and the same is updated on a monthly basis.  Once award is placed, the project comes under on-going category. The details of under construction thermal power projects in the country are given in Annexure-I.  The details of under construction/ongoing solar and wind power projects are given at Annexure-II and Annexure-III respectively.  ****************
