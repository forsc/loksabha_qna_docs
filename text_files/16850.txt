                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (e) :	Government of India had launched Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana –“Saubhagya” in October, 2017 with an outlay of Rs.16,320 crore including Gross Budgetary Support (GBS) of Rs.12,320.00 crore from Government of India with the aim to achieve universal household electrification by providing last mile connectivity and electricity connections to all households in rural and all poor households in urban areas across the country.All the States had declared on Saubhagya portal that all the willing un-electrified households had been electrified as on 31.03.2019, except 18,734 households in LWE affected areas of Chhattisgarh. Since the launch of Saubhagya scheme, 2.63 crore households were electrified across the country up to 31.03.2019.   State-wise list such households electrified is at Annexure-I.Subsequently, seven States reported 19.09 lakh un-electrified households which were un-willing earlier, but later willing to get electricity connection, identified before 31.03.2019.  States have been asked to electrify these households under Saubhagya.  Out of these, 15.65 lakh households have been electrified up to 31.08.2020.  State-wise list of such households electrified is at Annexure-II.There is no upfront allocation of funds for any State/District under Saubhagya scheme. Funds are released for sanctioned projects in installments based on the reported utilization of the amount released in the previous installment(s) and fulfillment of stipulated conditionalities. Accordingly, Rs.5,117 crore, has been disbursed as grant, under Saubhagya during the last three years and the current year up to 31.08.2020. The State/UT-wise grant disbursed under Saubhagya, is at Annexure-III.************
