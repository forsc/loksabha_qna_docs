ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b): The Directorate General of Training (DGT), under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), has entered into collaborations with many digital industry leaders like IBM India Pvt. Ltd., Microsoft Corp. (India) Ltd., SAP India, Cisco Systems India Pvt. Ltd., Accenture Solutions and Quest Alliance, Adobe India, etc., to enable the students to become industry-ready. Further, DGT in collaboration with IBM is offering Advanced Diploma (Vocational) in ‘IT, Networking and Cloud Computing’ in 16 National Skill Training Institutes (NSTIs). (c) to (f): Leveraging industry and academia partnerships can help speed up skill development in the country. The National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), under MSDE, is working with 37 Sector Skill Councils (SSCs), which are industry-led bodies helping to ensure that short-term skill training meets the requirement of the industry. These SSCs are responsible for undertaking skill gap study, developing qualification packs for various industry job roles, setting occupational standards, and conducting training of trainers’ programs. Moreover, to connect with industries for partnership under the Skill India Mission, NSDC has a single-window facilitation system. NSDC has collaborated with more than 15 companies. These partnerships demonstrate the opportunity for skilling in participation with the private sector. In the long-term skilling eco-system, the DGT has adopted the Dual System of Training in the Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), under which theoretical training is imparted through ITIs while practical training takes place in the Industry. Also, DGT has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Institute of Open Schooling for academic equivalency of vocational qualification of ITI students to attain Class X/ XII certificates.
