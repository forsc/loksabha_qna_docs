                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) to (c)  Yes Sir. The Union Finance Minister in her budget speech for FY 2022-23 has announced that 80 lakh houses will be completed during the financial year for the identified eligible beneficiaries of Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana, both rural (52 lakh) and urban (28 lakh); and Rs. 48,000 crore has been allocated for this purpose.In order to achieve “Housing for All” in rural areas, the Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana - Gramin (PMAY-G) with effect from 1st April, 2016 to provide assistance to eligible rural households with overall target to construct 2.95 crore pucca houses with basic amenities. The eligibile households were those who were either houseless or had houses upto 2 kachcha rooms and figured either in Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) based Permanent Wait List or Awaas Plus Survey. As on 16th March, 2022, cumulative 2.28 crore houses have been sanctioned by the States/Union Territories (UTs), out of which 1.75 crore houses have already been completed. During FY 2022-23, a total of 52.78 lakh PMAY-G houses are projected for completion.The Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs under the vision of ‘Housing for All’, is supplementing the efforts of States/UTs by providing Central Assistance under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Urban (PMAY-U) for construction of houses for all eligible families/ beneficiaries especially Economically Weaker Sections (EWSs), since 25.06.2015. Eligible beneficiaries can avail the benefit of PMAY-U through four verticals, i.e. Beneficiary-led Construction or enhancement (BLC), Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP), ‘In-Situ’ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) and Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS). So far, around 1.15 crore houses have been sanctioned under PMAY-U, out of which, nearly 55.45 lakh have been completed/ delivered to beneficiaries and 28 lakh houses are slated for completion during FY 2022-23.*****
