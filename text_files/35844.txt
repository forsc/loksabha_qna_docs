ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ?? ????? ?????? ??????       ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a): The production of horticulture crops in the country has increased by about 10% over the last five years from 2016-17 to 2020-21. The year-wise annual production of horticulture crops for the last five years is as under: -Year	Production of Horticulture Crops(in ‘000 Tonnes)2016-17	300642.822017-18	310674.802018-19	311052.302019-20	320471.212020-21 (3rd Advance Estimates)	331047.87(b): Government implements the Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) for procurement of agricultural and horticultural commodities which are perishable in nature and are not covered under the Price Support Scheme (PSS). The condition is that there should be either at least a 10 percent increase in production or a 10 percent decrease in the ruling market prices over the previous normal year. This scheme is implemented at the request of a State/UT government which is ready to bear 50 percent of the loss (25 percent in case of North-Eastern States), if any, incurred on its implementation. The extent of total amount of loss to be shared on a 50:50 basis between the Central Government and the State Government is restricted to 25 percent of the total procurement value which includes cost of the commodity procured plus permitted overhead expenses. Under the scheme, in accordance with MIS guidelines, a pre- determined quantity at the fixed Market Intervention Price (MIP) is procured by the agencies designated by the State Government for a fixed period or till the prices are stabilized above the MIP whichever is earlier.	Under the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), a Centrally Sponsored Scheme implemented since 2014-15 for holistic growth of the Horticulture sector, farmers are mobilised into Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) for aggregation and economies of scale. Efforts are being made to link FPOs to market by way of direct marketing farmer consumer markets/ Apni Mandi and e-markets. Assistance is also provided for post harvest management and marketing infrastructure such as cold storage, cold room, packing and grading house, reefer vehicles, primary and wholesale markets, Kisan Mandis, etc. Farmers are also made aware of the processing facilities/ mega food parks rearby and processable varieties of horticulture crops.In order to ensure farmers remunerative prices for their produce, including horticulture produce, the Government has taken several other steps as under:(i)	The Government has implemented National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) scheme, an online virtual trading platform, to provide farmers and Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) with opportunity for transparent price discovery for remunerative prices for their produce through competitive online bidding system.(ii)	The Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure (AMI), a sub- scheme of Integrated Scheme for Agricultural Marketing (ISAM), is meant for the holistic development of agricultural value chain critically focussing each linkage of post-harvest value chain including promotion of value addition and processing at farmers level so as to enhance their income by selling more marketable and processed produce in the market. Under this scheme, assistance is provided for construction/ renovation of godowns/warehouses in the rural areas in the States and for developing Gramin Haats into Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs) (iii)	The Government is implementing a central Sector scheme namely “Formation and Promotion of 10,000 Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs)” to enhance cost effective production and higher net incomes to the member farmer producers through better liquidity and market linkages for their produce and become sustainable through collective action.
