ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a) to (c):	 Under “Districts as Export Hubs” Initiative of the Department of Commerce, various activities are undertaken including One District One Product(ODOP). The focus under ODOP was manufacturing and marketing of the products within the country with identification of largely one product in a district. The “District as Export Hubs” is a broader initiative that covers exports of multiple products and services from all the districts in the country.  This included setting up an institutional mechanism in State/UT by forming State Export Promotion Committee (SEPC) and District Export Promotion Committee (DEPC) at the District level.  The products and services for all districts under the “Districts as Export Hubs” have been identified on the basis of consultation with the States/UTs. Regular updation of the products and services is being carried out in consultation with the State/UTs. District Export Action Plans under “Districts as Export Hubs” in more than 450 districts detailing the existing bottlenecks in the supply chain and identifying possible interventions to mitigate the existing gaps have been prepared. These outline the support required by the local exporters and manufacturers to seamlessly export the identified products and services by supporting new businesses to export and generating employment opportunities in the districts. (d) : To encourage exports from the districts under “Districts as Export Hubs”, export promotion outreach events are being held in various districts. This includes handholding sessions with exporters and export related awareness sessions with exporters along with representatives of various related agencies/departments such as Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), Banks, Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), Export Promotion Councils, Local Trade Association/Chambers of Commerce, District Industries Centres, etc. Government has taken various steps in addition to ongoing schemes to boost domestic investments in India. These include the National Infrastructure Pipeline, Reduction in Corporate Tax, easing liquidity problems of NBFCs and Banks, trade policy measures to boost domestic manufacturing.
