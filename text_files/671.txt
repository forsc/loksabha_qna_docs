Further, under Article 239(1) of the Constitution of India, the Administrators of the Union Territories have also been directed to discharge the functions of the Central Government pertaining to detection, detention and deportation of illegally staying foreign nationals.      	 Law enforcing agencies maintain a vigil to intercept the foreigners overstaying in India. In genuine cases, where overstaying is unintentional or because of ignorance or under compelling circumstances, the period of overstay is regularized after charging the penalty and fees for the overstay period and visa is extended if required. Where the overstay is found to be intentional, the foreigner is served with Leave India Notice and penalty/visa fee for the period of overstay is charged  as  per  instructions.  Legal  action  under   Foreigners  Act, 1946  is  also -3/…-3-LS.US.Q.NO.508 FOR 25.06.2019taken based on merits of each case which includes placing the names of the foreigners in the Black List after ensuring their deportation from India. Detection and deportation of such over-staying foreign nationals is a continuous process.*****
