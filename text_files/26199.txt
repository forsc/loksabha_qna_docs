However, the Central Govt. has taken several initiatives for supplementing the efforts of the States for providing quality and affordable healthcare services to the people. Some of the major initiatives include National Health Mission, Ayushman Bharat (AB)-Health & Wellness Centres (HWCs), Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) and upgradation of medical colleges.      The current year budget (2021-22) has announced Pradhan Mantri Atma Nirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana (PM-ASBY), a new Centrally Sponsored Scheme, with an outlay of about Rs. 64,180 crores. This will develop capacities of primary, secondary, and tertiary care Health Systems, strengthen existing national institutions, and create new institutions, to cater to detection and cure of new and emerging diseases. This will be in addition to the National Health Mission.***
