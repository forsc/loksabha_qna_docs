Later, the revised AMI sub scheme of ISAM has been approved for implementation w.e.f. 22.10.2018. It is a demand driven, credit linked, back ended subsidy scheme. Subsidy support @ 25% and 33.33% is available for beneficiaries viz. Farmers, Individuals, Agri-preneurs, FPOs, Cooperatives, state agencies etc.       Since inception of the scheme and up to 30.06.2021, a total of 40,461 storage infrastructure projects of beneficiaries including farmers with storage capacity of 69.93 million MT have been assisted under the scheme. The State wise details including Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu is at Annexure-I (d):	 During the last three years (2018-19 to 2020-21) and current year 2021-22 (up to 30.06.2021), subsidy of Rs. 333.83 crore has been released for 1705 storage infrastructure projects across the country, of which, subsidy of Rs. 39.01 crore has been released for 81 storage infrastructure projects in Maharashtra State. The state-wise detail is at annexure-II.(e) & (f):	 Under constituent component schemes of PRADHAN MANTRI KISAN SAMPADA YOJANA(PMKSY),  the Ministry of Food Processing Industries(MoFPI) provides mostly credit linked financial assistance (capital subsidy) in the form of grants-in-aid to the individuals, farmers, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), Entrepreneurs, Cooperatives, Societies, Self Help Groups (SHGs), Private Companies and Central/ State PSUs etc. for setting up of food processing/preservation industries. Financial assistance to the eligible applicant is provided as per the Scheme guidelines and against the Expression of Interest issued by the Ministry from time to time to enable them to set up various food processing/preservation projects.

Number of such projects approved in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu under component schemes of PMKSY is enclosed at Annexure-III. 		Further, the AMI sub-scheme of ISAM has been implemented to promote creation of scientific storage capacity for storing farm produce, processed farm produce and agricultural inputs etc. to reduce post-harvest & handling losses.
