                                                    (a) whether the Government is intending to frame comprehensive guidelines to ensure that persons who are blacklisted and are not permitted entry into the country despite having been issued a valid visa/entry permit/Overseas Citizen of India card, are informed of the decision promptly;(b) if so, the details thereof;(c) whether the Government is in consultation with various Indian overseas representatives and organizations through embassies and consulates to seek opinion in this matter; and(d) if so, the details thereof?






ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (d):	Visa is granted to a foreigner only after checking his blacklisted status from the system.  However, a foreigner holding an OCI card or a long-term multiple entry visa, does not have to apply for visa again and may, therefore, be denied entry into the country if he has in the meanwhile been blacklisted.  No foreigner has an absolute right to entry into India even after a visa or an OCI card has been issued to him.  He can be refused entry into India due to considerations such as national security.  There is no proposal to frame any guidelines to inform a foreigner of the decision to blacklist him. ******
