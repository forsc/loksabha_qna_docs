(c) and (d): Procurement policy of Government of India (GOI) is transparent, uniform and open ended, under which paddy offered by farmers within the stipulated period (conforming to specifications prescribed in advance by GOI) are purchased for Central Pool at Minimum Support Price (MSP) by Food Corporation of India/ State Governments/ State Government Agencies to help farmers get remunerative  price and prevent distress sale.
