                        Will the Minister of

                        be pleased to state:-















 (a)	whether the Union Territory (UT) of Puducherry is yet to be included under the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission, despite repeated requests from the Government of Puducherry and if so, the details thereof ; (b)	whether the Government of UT of Jammu and Kashmir which is also a UT with Legislature has been included under the ambit of the 15th Finance Commission and if so, the details thereof ; and (c)	whether the Union Government will come forward to include the UT of Puducherry under the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission and if so, the details thereof? 






ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (c)	No Sir. The terms of reference of the Finance Commission are framed under Art 280 (3) of the 		Constitution. Article 280 (3) of the Constitution envisages that the Commission make 		recommendations  on sharing of taxes, grants-in aid of revenue in respect of States. 		Puducherry being a Union Territory therefore does not fall under the ambit of Art 280(3). 		15th Finance Commission as per its Terms of Reference has submitted its report 			pertaining to Financial Years 2021-22 to 2025-26 to the Hon’ble President of India on 9th		November, 2020. An Explanatory Memorandum as to the Action Taken on the 			recommendations made by the 15th Finance Commission was laid in the Parliament on 		1.2.2021.(b)		No, Sir.
