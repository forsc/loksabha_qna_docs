ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) and (b): The price buildup of petrol and diesel as on 1st July, 2019 (as per IOCL at Delhi) is given below:(in Rs. per litre) S. No. Elements Petrol Diesel1.Price charged to Dealers (excluding Excise Duty and VAT)33.9438.482.Central Excise Duty [A]17.9813.833.Dealer Commission3.542.494.State VAT [B]14.989.475.Retail Selling Price [C]70.4464.276.Total Tax incidence percentage [(A+B)*100/C]46.836.3The overall tax incidence comes out as 46.8% for petrol and 36.3% for diesel being sold at Delhi. Similarly, for other states/UTs, the rate of state VAT is different and the overall tax incidence changes accordingly.(c): The taxes on petrol and diesel are not being levied only on the ground of subsidy.(d): The details of gross Central Excise duty collected through taxes on petrol and diesel is as follows:(in Rs. Crores)Source: DG-System-CBIC/PrCCAThe details of subsidies/under-recoveries on PDS kerosene and domestic LPG since 2016-17 (on accrual basis) are given below:-(in Rs. Crores)Particulars2016-172017-182018-19 (P)PDS Kerosene7,5954,6725,950Total DBTL related subsidies12,90520,90531,539Total PMUY related subsidy2,9992,5595,683DBTK Subsidy11113117Total Subsidy/ Under-recovery23,51028,24943,289(e): same as (a) above(f): Prices of petrol and diesel have been made market-determined by the Government with effect from 26.06.2010 and 19.10.2014 respectively. Since then, the Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) take appropriate decision on pricing of petrol and diesel in line with international product prices and other market conditions. The Government continues to modulate the effective price to consumer for Subsidized Domestic LPG and retail selling price of PDS Kerosene. The prices of petroleum products are linked to the price of respective products in the international market. Oil Marketing Companies take a decision on retail selling price after considering various aspects including international product prices, exchange rate, tax structure, inland freight and other cost elements.As regards subsidized domestic LPG (up to the cap of 12 cylinders per annum to each household) and PDS kerosene, the prices continue to be modulated by the Government in order to insulate the common man from the impact of rise in international oil prices and the domestic inflationary conditions and the consumers continue to get these products at subsidized rates. The prices of non-subsidized domestic LPG are however determined by the OMCs in line with changes in international markets.*****Particulars 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 (P)Petrol71,91674,43168,929Diesel151,214150,836144,471
