State Governments have been requested to propose minimum 10% of total length of annual proposals under mainstream technologies such as cement stabilization, lime stabilization, cold mix, waste plastics, cell filled concrete, paneled cement concrete pavement, fly ash etc. and 5% of total length of annual proposals using IRC accredited technologies such as coir, jute geo textiles, commercial stabilizers etc. Adoption of new technology in rural roads is a continuous process and regular interactions and webinars are organized to orient various stakeholders.  ******
