(b) & (c) 	Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) connections are facilitated through the Licensed Internet Service Provider (ISP) and their franchisee or entities registered under the Prime Minister Wireless Access Network Interface (PM-WANI) framework. The   Government has implemented adequate mechanism to ensure privacy of user data and security of free and public Wi-Fi connections being provided at many places in the country such as railway stations, airports and other public places through the compliance to following measures by these entities in their networks:  i.  	Intentionally damaging or tampering with telegraphs or unlawfully attempting to learn the contents of messages or making away with or altering, or unlawfully intercepting or disclosing messages, or divulging purport of signals are punishable offences as per the Section 24, 25 & 26 of The Indian Telegraph Act - 1885ii. 	Clause no. 37.1 to 37.4 chapter V of the Unified License (UL) mandates ISP to deploy appropriate mechanism to meet the requirements of confidentiality, security and privacy of user data. iii.	The Security Guidelines for PM-WANI provides for following:a.	Provisions by Public data Office Aggregator (PDOA) for storage of user data for one year to ensure compliance with legal provisions, as required. b.	User data privacy is to be ensured by App Providers and PDOA with complete user data and usage logs to be stored within India. c.	Provisions by the App Provider, PDOA and Central Registry Provider to safeguard the privacy and confidentiality of any information about a third party to whom it provides the service.    	DoT has issued a document in February 2009 titled ‘instructions under the internet service license regarding provision of Wi-Fi Internet services in the delicensed frequency band’ for secure use of Wi-Fi services followed by a document in August 2015 on ‘Security in Public Wi-Fi Implementations-Best Practices.’ ********
