The programme aims to empower adolescent learners to acquire knowledge of their needs and concerns related to the period of adolescence and develop life skills that enable them to practice informed and responsible behaviours. The target groups of AEP are all learners studying at the secondary and senior secondary level in government, local body and government-aided schools and learners of open schooling systems. Orientation and sensitization is also provided to identified out-of-school adolescents and youth for awareness regarding life skills education.(b):	Under School based approach of Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK), there is emphasis on preventive and promotive activities among school going adolescents. A dedicated 24-hour curriculum has been developed for roll-out in the country in a phased manner by training two teachers in every school as Health & Wellness Ambassadors. 	Besides this, there is comprehensive integration of the adolescent health needs and concerns into the school education and teacher education system(c):	Under National Health Mission, Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK) is implemented to address the need and concerns of more than 25 crore adolescents of the country.  RKSK is a paradigm shift from the existing clinic-based services to promotion and prevention and reaching adolescents in their own environment, such as in schools, families and communities. The various themes covered under RKSK include Nutrition, Sexual Reproductive Health, Violence including Gender based violence, Mental Health, Non Communicable Diseases and Substance Abuse.The interventions under RKSK are as below:a.	Community based interventions- include the provision of Weekly Iron Folic Supplementation, sanitary napkins to adolescent girls, selection and training of peer educators and conducting Adolescent Health Days to involve the communities and parents to create awareness on adolescent health issues.b.	Facility based interventions include the Adolescent Friendly Health Clinics (AFHCs) with trained healthcare providers who provide appropriate, non-judgemental, accessible services and counselling to the adolescents. c.	School based interventions- incorporated as a part of the Health and Wellness component of the Ayushman Bharat Programme of the Government. These activities combine health education, health promotion, disease prevention, and improve access to health services in an integrated, systematic manner at the school level.d.	Besides these, under National Health Mission, all contraceptives including newer contraceptives as Injectable contraceptive (Antara) and Centchroman (Chhaya) are available to women. The Scheme for Home delivery of contraceptives by ASHAs at doorstep of beneficiaries has also been introduced to increase the access of beneficiaries to contraceptives.  Counsellors, placed at various levels of health institutions are specially trained to provide services and information about contraception.The details of adolescents accessing services and counselling at AFHCs, adolescent girls provided Sanitary napkins and distribution of IFA for the past three years are placed at Annexure I, II and III.
