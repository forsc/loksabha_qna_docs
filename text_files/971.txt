ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c)    The development of new Major Port at Duggirajupatnam in Andhra Pradesh is included in Schedule XIII of the Andhra Pradesh Re-organisation Act, 2014. NITI Aayog had examined the proposal for development of new Major Port at Duggirajupatnam in consultation with Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Finance and Government of Andhra Pradesh and it has been concluded that the project will not be viable due to strong competition from nearby Ports of Krishnapatnam, Ennore and Chennai which are 40, 80 & 80 KMs away respectively from the proposed Port. Ministry of Shipping has requested Government of Andhra Pradesh to furnish comments on the recommendations of NITI Aayog along with suggestions for alternate site(s) for development of a Major Port in Andhra Pradesh. Ministry of Shipping in the meanwhile has constituted an Expert Committee to examine the proposal for development of new Major Port in Andhra Pradesh and recommend further course of action. Hence, no funds have been earmarked/ released so far for the development of Duggirajupatnam Port.                                             *****
