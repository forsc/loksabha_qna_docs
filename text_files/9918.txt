ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) Proposals for opening of new Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) are considered only ifsponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments/ Union Territories Administrations thereby committing resources for setting up a new KVas well as the availability of necessary sanction of the Government. The proposalsreceived from various sponsoring authorities for opening of new KVs also have tocompete among other proposals under the “Challenge Method”. 45 KVs are alreadyfunctioning in Gujarat. Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan has informed that no proposal inthe prescribed proforma has been received from the State Government of Gujarat foropening of a new KV at Kutch.The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme provides for opening of one JawaharNavodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country. Opening of new JNVs is acontinuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned StateGovernment to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction ofschool buildings and the required temporary accommodation (free of rent) to start theVidyalaya. However, actual sanction and opening of the JNV depends on the availabilityof funds and approval by the Competent Authority. All the districts of Gujarat have beencovered under Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme.One JNV has been sanctioned at Kutch in1987-88 and is presently functioning from its permanent building.(b) No such proposal is under consideration at present. 23 IITs already exist in India.*****
