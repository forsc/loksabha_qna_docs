A portion of the unprocessed and littered plastic waste can finds its way through surface waste bodies like rivers into the sea. The National Centre for Coastal Research, Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India, conducts research at select locations along the Indian Coast to quantify marine litter in beach, surface sea water, and seafloor on a regular basis. Studies have been undertaken to characterize marine litter in coastal areas. In one of the studies, multilayer large and medium size packets of snacks, monolayer plastic packaging used for food, detergent etc., synthetic woven bags and polythene bags have been reported.The Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, as amended, provide the statutory framework of plastic waste management in the country. The Rules prohibits manufacture, import, stocking, distribution, sale and use of carry bags and plastic sheets less than fifty microns in thickness in the country. There is complete ban on sachets using plastic material used for storing, packing or selling gutkha, tobacco and pan masala. The Ministry has notified the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021, vide GSR NO. 571 (E) on 12th August 2021, in the Gazette of India, prohibiting identified single use plastic items, which have low utility and high littering potential, by 1st July 2022.As far as, plastic carry bags are concerned, the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021, prohibits manufacture, import, stocking, distribution, sale and use of plastic carry bags having thickness less than seventy five microns with effect from 30th September, 2021, and having thickness less than thickness of one hundred and twenty microns with effect from the 31st December, 2022.Further, over and above the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, as amended, thirty four states/UTs have issued notifications/orders to introduce regulations pertaining to complete or partial ban on plastic carry bags and/or identified single-use plastic items.

As per the draft notification, the producer, Importers &brand-owners respectively shall ensure minimum level of recycling (excluding end of life disposal) of plastic packaging waste collected under Extended Producer Responsibility. The enforceable prescription of minimum level of recycling of plastic packaging waste collected under Extended Producer Responsibility to producer, Importers &brand-owners in the draft notification will further strengthen circular economy of plastic packaging waste. The Government has also been taking measures for awareness generation towards elimination of single use plastics and effective implementation of Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016.  Separately, through the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 2011 several activities are prohibited in the CRZ areas like setting up and expansion of units or mechanism for disposal of wastes and effluents, except for some essential activities.	 The Government of India has initiated several programmes such as Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban and Grameen), National Mission for Clean Ganga and Smart Cities Mission” in order to develop clean and sustainable environment.The Ministry has also constituted a Steering Committee on 14th May 2019 in order to harmonize the efforts of various ministries/departments and agencies towards marine litter particularly due to plastic waste.***
