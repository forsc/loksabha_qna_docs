                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		 	  (SHRI NARENDRA  SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (e):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.  135   DUE FOR REPLY ON 11TH FEBRUARY, 2020.(a):	As on 06.02.2020, a total of 96,073,451 farmer families have been successfully registered under PM-KISAN out of which 84,472,629 beneficiaries have received benefits under the Scheme. The State-wise details of the same are given at Annexure-1.(b):	Budgetary allocation of Rs. 20,000 Crore and Rs. 75,000 Crore have been provided in Financial Year 2018-19 & 2019-20 respectively for the implementation of PM-KISAN Scheme, out of which, as of 06.02.2020, an amount of Rs. 50522.2 Crore has been transferred in the bank accounts of beneficiaries across the country since inception of the Scheme.(c):     PM-KISAN is a continuous and ongoing Scheme, in which the financial benefits are transferred to the bank accounts of the identified beneficiaries as and when their correct and verified data is uploaded by the concerned States / UTs on PM-Kisan web-portal.  The data of beneficiaries so uploaded by the concerned States/UTs undergoes a multi-level verification and validation by various concerned agencies before making payment to the beneficiaries, hence, merely registration on the Portal does not ensure benefit transfer to the beneficiaries.(d): 	In order to release PM-KISAN benefits, Ministry receives verified details i.e. details of land holdings, villages, bank related details, Aadhar card number etc. of the beneficiaries from the concerned States/UTs. These details are required to verified by the PM-KISAN Portal, initially the account validation is done through Public Finance Management System (PFMS). From December, 2019 onwards AADHAR authentication of beneficiaries data is also made mandatory. In case, any mismatch of provided details has been noticed by the above   mentioned  agencies,    details related   to concerned beneficiaries are required to be Contd…2/-corrected or amended by the concerned States/UTs.  For this purpose details of concerned beneficiaries are made available to the concerned States/UTs. This way, Ministry ensures benefit transfer to the beneficiaries only on the basis of verification of the concerned State/UT Governments. In the cases of self-registration through the Farmers Corner in the portal, Ministry seeks verified data of the beneficiaries from the concerned State/UT Governments before transfer the benefit under PM-KISAN. (e):	Agriculture is a State subject. The prime responsibility of development of Agriculture rests with the concerned State/UT Governments. Government of India, however, through its various Schemes/Missions, supplements the efforts of the State/UT Governments for the development of agriculture and welfare of the farmers. With a view to provide income support to all landholding farmer families across the country, to enable them to take care of expenses related to agricultural & allied activities and to save them from the clutches of the moneylenders, PM-KISAN was launched. The Scheme was launched on 24.02.2019 and the same is in nascent state.  As such, no formal study of the Scheme has been done yet.
