                                                        ???????? ??? ?????? ?????? (???? ????? ????) THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI  PIYUSH GOYAL)(a): 	FDI data on NRI Investment in Andhra Pradesh Financial year wise is as under:<pre>Period	FDI Inflow in Rs. Crore2016-17	42.432017-18	9.422018-19	14.792019-20 (Sept 2019)	8.19 Source: Reserve Bank of India based on FC-GPR Form filed by the Indian investee companies, FC-TRS Form as filed by the resident transferor/transferee in RBI.</pre>(b): 	Government does not fix targets for FDI inflows as FDI is largely a matter of private business decisions. Government of India has put in place a liberal and investor friendly FDI policy. FDI inflows depend on a host of factors such as availability of natural resource, market size, infrastructure and investment climate as well as macro-economic stability and investment decision of foreign investors. It has been the endeavor of the Government of India to put in place an enabling and investor friendly FDI Policy.  Measures taken by the Government on FDI Policy reforms have resulted in increased FDI inflows in the country.  The year-wise increase in FDI inflow can be seen in the following table:<pre>Sl. No.	Financial Year	Total FDI Inflow (in US $ billion)1.	2014-15	45.152.	2015-16	55.563.	2016-17	60.224.	2017-18(P)	60.975.	2018-19(P)	62.00	Source: Reserve Bank of India 	(P)- Figures are provisional</pre>(c) & (d):	Government has put in place an investor-friendly policy under which FDI up to 100% is permitted under the automatic route in most sectors/activities including investments from Non-Resident Indians (NRIs). Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy is reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to making it more investor friendly, including for NRIs. The extant FDI policy allows special dispensation for NRI investments in various sectors such as Construction Development, Civil Aviation etc. Further, investments made under Schedule IV of FEMA (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019 on non-repatriation basis by NRIs, OCIs and Companies, Trusts and Partnership Firms incorporated outside India and owned by such NRIs and OCIs are deemed to be domestic investment at par with investment made by residents.*****
