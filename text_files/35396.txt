                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) Water being a State subject, it is for the State Governments to take up rejuvenation of water bodies, including formulation of action plan for rejuvenation of dry ponds, puddles and wells in their jurisdiction. Role of Government of India is limited to being catalytic, providing technical support and in some cases partial financial assistance in terms with the existing schemes under implementation. However, in order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, many initiatives have been taken by Government of India in this regard. Some of the key measures taken recently in this regard are listed below:1. Government of India is providing financial assistance to the identified schemes under Repair, Renovation and Restoration of Water Bodies component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) - Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP).2. In 2019, Jal Shakti Abhiyan was launched by the Government. This was followed in 2021, by “Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch The Rain” (JSA:CTR) campaign. Focused interventions under these annual campaigns taken up by the Government of India and the State Governments, inter-alia, include renovation of traditional and other water bodies/ tanks, enumeration, geo-tagging and making inventory of all water bodies, and removal of encroachments of tanks/ lakes, and de-silting of tanks.3. Government has launched the first Census of Water bodies in convergence with the Sixth round of Minor Irrigation Census (reference year 2017-18), under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme- “Irrigation Census”. The objective of the Census of Water bodies is to develop a national database of all water bodies in the country. 4. Rejuvenation of water bodies is also a component under Water Supply sector of Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) Scheme under Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs. Such projects having total estimated cost of Rs.1878.19 crore are ongoing/completed, with 106 number of water bodies have been rejuvenated under this scheme. Further, AMRUT 2.0 launched in October, 2021, with a total outlay targets to promote circular economy of water through development of city water balance plan for each city focusing on recycle/reuse of treated sewage, rejuvenation of water bodies and water conservation 5. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS) has provisions for public works relating to natural resource management, water conservation and water harvesting structures to augment and improve ground water like underground dykes, earthen dams, stop dams, check dams and roof top rain water harvesting structures in public buildings.  (b) Water being a State subject, it is for the State Governments concerned to take up programmes and schemes for revival and recharge of ground water. However, in order to supplement the efforts of State Governments, Government of India has taken up a number of important measures for conservation, management of ground water, effective implementation of rain water harvesting including increasing the groundwater level in the country, which can be seen at http://jalshaktidowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_ depletion_Feb2021.pdf.  Further, under Ground Water development component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana – Har Khet Ko Pani (PMKSY-HKKP), financial assistance is being given to States for assured ground water irrigation in favorable areas to small and marginal farmers. State-wise details in this regard, are at annexure-I  *****ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY OF PART (b) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. +2692 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 17/3/2022 REGARDING “REJUVENATION OF DRY PONDS”STATUS OF PMKSY-HKKP-GWI FUND RELEASED TO STATES SO FARSl.
