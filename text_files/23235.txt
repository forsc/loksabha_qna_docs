ANSWER




MINISTER FOR CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D.V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a)	: Sir, the demand and supply of fertilizers in the country is annexed as per Annexure.(b)	: No Sir, there has been no shortage of fertilizers in any part of the country in recent time.(c)	:	Question does not arise.(d) & (e): The meetings with the Fertilizer Industry and officials of Fertilizer Association of India is a regular process and various issues are discussed from time to time and addressed suitably.(f)	: The following steps are being taken by the Government to meet the demand of fertilizers timely in the country: - i.	Before the commencement of each cropping season, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), in consultation with all the State Governments, assesses the requirement of fertilizers. After assessment of requirement, DAC&FW projects month-wise requirement of fertilizers and convey it to the Department of Fertilizers.ii.	On the basis of month-wise & State-wise projection given by DAC&FW, Department of Fertilizers allocates sufficient/ adequate quantities of fertilizers to States by issuing monthly supply plans and continuously monitor the availability.iii.	The movement of all major subsidized fertilizers is being monitored throughout the country by an on-line web based monitoring system called integrated Fertilizer Monitoring System (iFMS);iv.	The State Governments are regularly advised to coordinate with manufacturers and importers of fertilizers for streamlining the supplies through timely placement of indents for railway rakes.v.	Regular Weekly Video Conference is conducted jointly by Department of Agriculture & Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) and Department of Fertilizers (DoF) with State Agriculture Officials and corrective actions are taken to ensure comfortable availability.vi.	The gap between demand (requirement) and production in case of urea is met through imports. The import for the season are finalized timely to ensure comfortable availability. Thus, with the steps as indicated above, Department of Fertilizers ensures availability of fertilizers at the State level and the distribution to the farmers within the State is the responsibility of the respective State Governments. Further with regard to reasonability, Urea is being provided to the farmers at a statutorily notified Maximum Retail Price (MRP), which is subsidized. The MRP of 45 Kg bag of Urea is Rs 242 per bag (exclusive of charges towards the neem coating and taxes as applicable). The difference between the delivered cost of urea farm gate and net market realization by the urea units is given as subsidy to the urea manufacturer/importer by the Government of India. Accordingly, all farmers are being supplied subsidized urea. For P&K fertilizers, the Department has issued reasonableness guidelines dated 15.11.2019 wherein the reasonableness of MRP of P&K fertilizers is checked in order to make them available at reasonable rates to the farmers.With regard to quality, the specification of various fertilizers is specified under the Fertilizer (Control) Order 1985. The Order strictly prohibits the sale of fertilizer which are not of prescribed standards. Therefore, it is mandatory for every manufacturer /importer to provide good quality of fertilizers to farmers. The state Government are enforcing authorities and are adequately empowered to enforce the provisions of Fertilizer (Control) Order 1985. Further the enforcement authorities randomly draw the samples from various sources for ensuring the quality of fertilizers.******
