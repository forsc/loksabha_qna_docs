All the cities with a population of one lakh or more as per Census 2011, all other capital cities of States/ Union Territories (UTs), all HRIDAY cities, identified cities on the stem of the main rivers, from hill states, islands and tourist destinations have been included in the Mission.Under AMRUT, selection, appraisal, approval and implementation of individual project is done by States/UTs themselves. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs only approves State Annual Action Plan (SAAP) submitted by the States/UTs and releases Central Assistance as per Mission guidelines.  The Ministry has already approved SAAPs of  all   States/ UTs for entire Mission period for Rs.77,640 crore, including Central Assistance of Rs.35,990 crore.Out of the total SAAP size of Rs.77,640 crore, Rs.39,011 crore (50%) has been allocated to water supply projects, Rs.32,456 crore (42%) to sewerage & septage management projects, Rs.2,969 crore (4%) towards storm water drainage projects, Rs.1,436 crore (2%) for non-motorized urban transport and Rs.1,768 crore (2%) has been allocated for green spaces and parks.(b)	List of AMRUT cities including those of Tamil Nadu is placed at ANNEXURE.(c)	State of Tamil Nadu has taken up 444 projects with appraised cost of Rs. 13,519 crore under AMRUT.Additional cost of projects taken in excess of approved SAAP will be borne by the State itself.

Government of Tamil Nadu has awarded contracts for 441 projects worth Rs. 11,478 crore, of which 413 projects worth Rs.728 crore have been completed and 28 projects worth Rs,10,750 are being executed.
