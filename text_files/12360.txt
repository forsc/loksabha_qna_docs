                                                        (a) & (b):	Section 29 (2) (f) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 states that “medium of instruction shall, as far as practicable, be in child’s mother tongue”. The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 emphasizes the importance of imparting primary education in the mother tongue of the child. Since education is in the Concurrent List of the Constitution, States have the liberty to decide the medium of instruction in schools. The NCF clearly states that the Three-Language Formula is an attempt to address the challenges and opportunities of the linguistic situation in India. As per the “Three Language Formula” the first language to be studied must be the mother tongue or the regional language.Ministry of Tribal Affairs extends support to State Governments / UTs for mother tongue-based education and development of bilingual Primers for enhancement of learning achievement level amongst the Scheduled Tribe Students. So far 82 language primers have been developed by various State Governments as detailed below:State	Primers Details	Language / tribe coveredTripura	14 Primers	Kokborak, halam, Mog, Garo, Kuki, MizoOdisha	5 Primers	Juang, Kisan, Koya, Oram, SaoraMaharashtra	11 Primers	Gondi, Halbi, Kokni, Kolami, Korku, Madiya, Mavchi, Pardhi, Pawari, ThakriMadhya Pradesh	15 Primers	Halbi, Kudhukh, Bhili, Gondi, Korku, Kerala 	6 Primers	Kattunaikan, PaniyanChhattisgarh	5 Primers	Kukudu, Praja, Halbi, BhariaJharkhand	5 Primers	Kukudu, Khadia, KhoratTelangana	5 Primers	Gondi, Koya, Kolami, Kondh, BanjaraWest Bengal	16 Primers	Olchiki, Kuduk(c):	As reflected in U-DISE: Flash Statistics 2016-17, details of the student enrolment and student retention ratiosof boys and girls by social category at Primary and Secondary level school are as under:EnrolmentSocial Category	Primary	Secondary	Boys 	Girls 	Total	Boys 	Girls 	TotalGeneral	16168128 	14426317 	30594445	5565226 	5017546 	10582772SC	12530869 	11782642 	24313511	3759773 	3454067 	7213840ST	6762313 	6318480 	13080793	1683257 	1593313 	3276570OBC	28783449 	27035694 	55819143	9372215 	8378457 	17750672DropoutSocial Category	Primary	Secondary	Boys 	Girls 	Total	Boys 	Girls 	TotalGeneral	4.48 	4.96 	4.71	15.14 	16.27 	15.68SC	8.30 	7.86 	8.09	23.06 	21.99	22.55ST	8.57 	8.51	8.54	27.41	26.51 	26.97OBC	6.10	5.79	5.95	20.28	19.77	20.04(d) & (e):	Ministry of Tribal Affairs has been issuing advisories to engage local teachers to overcome shortages and to enhance the teacher student responsiveness and employment opportunities.
