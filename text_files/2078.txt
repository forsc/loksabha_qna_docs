ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) 	Sir, with regard to impact of Electromagnetic Field (EMF) emissions from mobile phones on health, DoT has been following relevant International agencies/ organizations such as World Health Organization (WHO), International Commission on Non Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), International Advisory Committee (IAC) on EMF, International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and various Study Groups under ITU for monitoring global developments.	No such study, conducted in the United States, is in the knowledge of Department of Telecommunications (DoT). However, WHO has referred to approximately 25,000 articles published around the world over past 30 years, and based on an in-depth review of scientific literature, has concluded - “current evidence does not confirm the existence of any health consequences from exposure to low level electromagnetic fields”.(b) & (c) 	To ensure safeguards of citizen, DoT has been monitoring global developments and has already taken necessary steps and adopted stricter norms for safety from EMF emission from mobile towers and handsets. In the year 2008, DoT adopted the ICNIRP guidelines that are recommended by WHO for basic restriction and limiting reference levels of electromagnetic emission from mobile towers and handset. Further, based on the recommendations of an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC), DoT has made the norms for exposure limit for the Radio Frequency Field (Base Station Emissions) ten times more stringent than the existing limits prescribed by ICNIRP and recommended by WHO. The Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) level for Mobile Handsets have also been made stringent and revised to 1.6 Watt per Kg averaged over a mass of one gram human tissue. These limits were further reviewed in 2014, based on recommendation of a committee that was setup at the behest of High Court Allahabad, Lucknow bench. The Committee comprised of members from Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) Kharagpur, Kanpur, Delhi, Roorkee, Bombay and from other scientific institutions of the country including Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) Delhi. This Committee has also referred to various studies carried out in this regard and has observed that the Department of Telecom has taken adequate steps to impose stricter precautionary limits for EMF radiation from mobile towers as well as from mobile handset/phones. After due consideration of the human health concerns on account of EMF radiation being raised in public and the Report of the Committee, the Government has decided, in February 2014, that the present prescribed precautionary EMF safe exposure limits are adequate and need no further change at this stage.	In addition, a joint initiative has been launched by Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) under Department of Science & Technology (DST) and Department of Telecommunications (DoT), wherein nineteen research proposals, have already been initiated to study possible impact of EMF exposure from mobile towers and handsets on life. i.e. Humans, Living Organisms, Flora & Fauna.
