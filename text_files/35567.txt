                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) to (c): Ministry of Education has conducted the National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2021 all across the country on 12.11.2021 and has covered (a) Government Schools (Central Government and State Government); (b) Government Aided Schools; and (c) Private Unaided Schools. Subjects covered are Language, Mathematics & EVS for class 3 &  5; Language, Mathematics, Science & Social Science for class 8 and Language, Mathematics, Science, Social Science and English for class 10.About 34 lakh students of 1.18 lakh schools from both rural and urban areas, have appeared in NAS 2021, which was conducted in 22 mediums of instruction. The objective of NAS 2021 is to evaluate children’s progress and learning competencies as an indicator of the health of the education system, so as to take appropriate steps for remedial actions at different levels. National, State/UT and District Report cards are released to enable analysis of results and remedial action at the appropriate levels.Ministry of Education has taken several initiatives to improve the education standards. A comprehensive initiative called PM eVIDYA has been taken which unifies all efforts related to digital/online/on-air education to enable multi-mode access to education. The initiative includes, the following components: ?	DIKSHA the nation’s digital infrastructure for providing quality e-content for school education in states/UTs: and QR coded Energized Textbooks for all grades (one nation, one digital platform).?	One earmarked Swayam Prabha TV channel per class from 1 to 12 (one class, one channel). ? 	Extensive use of Radio, Community radio and CBSE Podcast- Shiksha Vani. ? 	Special e-content for visually and hearing impaired developed on Digitally Accessible Information System (DAISY) and in sign language on NIOS website/ YouTube .Further, an Alternate Academic Calendar has been prepared for providing learning solutions for grade 1 to 12 and ‘Students’ Learning Enhancement Guidelines prepared by NCERT suggest models for the following three types of scenarios to ensure that no child is deprived of reach of education:a)	Learning Enhancement during COVID-19 for students without digital devices;b)	Learning Enhancement during COVID-19 for students with limited accessibility to digital devices &c)	Learning Enhancement during COVID-19 for students with digital devices.Also, PRAGYATA guidelines issued to States/UTs to facilitate continued education through various modes. The guidelines inter-alia includes situations where internet connectivity is not available or available with very less bandwidth where resources are shared through various platforms like television, radio etc. that do not depend on internet.Where the digital facility (mobile device/ DTH television) is not available, Ministry of Education has taken many initiatives like Community Radio Stations and a podcast called Shiksha Vani of CBSE, Textbooks, worksheet supplied to residence of learners, Handbook on 21st Century Skills and community/mohalla classes. Innovation Funds under Samagra Shiksha are used to set up mobile schools, virtual studios, virtual classrooms in schools, pre-loaded tablets, in various states and UTs in remote/rural areas where online classes are difficult. Further in order to provide continuous professional development opportunities to the teachers at the elementary level, this Department launched the NISHTHA online training programme using DIKSHA platform in October 2020. NISHTHA online for elementary level covered 18 modules in 11 languages, including use of ICT in teaching-learning. A comprehensive learning recovery plan (LRP) has been issued on 01.02.2022 to support States/UTs under Samagra Shiksha to provide a multipronged & holistic approach to ensure that children received suitable support. Under this, support is provided to States/UTs for various interventions including Learning Enhancement Programme (LEP), Teacher Resource Package (TRP), Oral Reading Fluency Study (ORF), ICT facility to Block Resource Centers (BRCs), Strengthening of Clusters Resource Centers (CRCs), etc.*****
