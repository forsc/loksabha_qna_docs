                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)  The details of roads constructed under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) during the last three years and current year, State/ UT-wise, including in Odisha are given at Annexure-I.(b)  The criteria for road construction targets are set annually in consultation with the States, keeping in view the balance works left with the States, capacity of the State Executing Agencies and anticipated sanction of projects during the year. (c) to (d) Maintenance of roads constructed under the programme is the responsibility of the State Governments and all road works are covered by initial five year maintenance contract to be entered into along with the construction contract, with the same contractor, as per the Standard Bidding Document. Maintenance funds are to be provided by the State Government. Maintenance of roads beyond 5 years is also to be done by the State Government.  Since 2016-17, financial incentives are being given to top performing States, which show higher achievement in the year on the basis of set parameters. These funds are to be used by the States for renewal of roads after 5 year Defect Liability Period (DLP). The current parameters for determining the best performing States for grant of financial incentives under PMGSY, which are applicable since 2020-21 are as under:- (i)	Achievement of Target Length during the year.(ii)	Achievement of Target Habitations during the year.(iii)	Length constructed using New Technology during the year.(iv)	Expenditure on maintenance of roads within Defect Liability Period (DLP)(v)	Road Length renewed during the year post DLP.(vi)	Quality of maintenance works as brought out by National Quality Monitor Inspections.The details of financial incentive released to States during the last 4 financial years and the current year are given at Annexure-II.(e)    As a measure of enhancing the focus on maintenance of roads during the defect liability period (five years from the date of completion of road) and streamlining the delivery of routine maintenance of PMGSY roads on the basis of performance based maintenance contract, eMARG has been implemented in all the states. eMARG is an online platform, used by all the states, that monitors maintenance of PMGSY works for five years since the date of completion (i.e. under Defect Liability Period -DLP)eMARG is currently getting utilized across 27 states and 2 UTs by 1,254 (97%) PIUs. 11,466 (89%) contractors have been onboarded on eMARG. Out of 42957 roads under DLP, 93% have been registered on eMARG. Since FY 2019-20, payment of 4,27,810 bills amounting to a total of Rs. 970 crore has been made to contractors through eMARG. Out of which, Rs. 444.00 crore has been paid during FY 2021-22. *****
