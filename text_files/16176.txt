ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a): Yes Sir, The implementation of Section 12(1)(c) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education(RTE) Act, 2009  is monitored through regular reporting mechanism from the States, Review meetings, Annual Work Plan appraisal etc. The information provided by the States and Union Territory (UTs) indicates a consistent increase in the number of children admitted/ studying under Section 12 (1)(c). (b): States and UTs are using different methodologies for grievance redressal mechanism.While Delhi, Rajasthan and Maharashtra have developed Online Mechanism for addressinggrievances, Gujarat, Assam and Uttarakhand are using Toll Free Number for addressinggrievances under Section 12(1) (c). There is offline mechanism in place in other States.(c) &(d):  All States and UTs except the State of Telangana, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh have notified the disadvantaged groups and weaker sections eligible for admission under Section 12(1)(c) of the RTE Act. Section 12(1)(c) of the RTE Act is not applicable to Lakshdweep as it does not have any private unaided schools. For implementation of Section 12(1)(c) of the RTE Act, the respective State and UT Governments are required to notify the disadvantaged groups and weaker sections, notify per child cost and start admissions in private un-aided schools as per the procedure laid down by them. The per-child cost notified by the States and UTs is at Annexure. Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) has requested States/UTs to carry out a ground assessment of private schools across the country to ensure compliance with the Section 12 (1)(c) of RTE Act, 2009. (e) & (f): RTE Act envisages the role of National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) at national level and State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) at State level to : 	a) examine and review the safeguards for rights provided by or under this Act and recommend            measures for their effective implementation; 	b) Inquire into complaints relating to child’s right to free and compulsory education; and        c) take necessary steps as provided under Sections 15 and 24 of the said Commissions for            Protection of Child Rights Act.****
