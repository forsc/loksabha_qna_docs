The scheme envisages production-linked incentive to companies registered under the Companies Act, 2013, which qualify through the application process given in the guidelines and achieve committed incremental production prescribed for each product sub-category and make minimum prescribed investment in creating new capacity for manufacturing the applied product sub-category. Ministry organized a seminar on the scheme on 25th October, 2021 in which all major domestic steel companies including Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) participated. Decisions regarding investment are taken by various companies including SAIL on commercial considerations and market dynamics. Various arrangements have been made for inviting applications from the interested parties.********
