ANSWER




                                                        (a), (b) & (c): The Ministry through the Sagarmala Development Company Limited (SDCL) issued Expression of Interest (EoI) on 23 December 2020 to elicit the interest of private operators/ investors for the development of product specific warehouses/ silos at various Major and Non-major ports, Multimodal Logistic Parks located near port area and alongside the National Waterways.	Total 26 companies had submitted their applications in response to EoI and 71 interests received for the development of warehouses/ product specific warehousing at various locations across the country.  The information received in response to the EoI has been forwarded to the relevant Port Authorities for taking the projects forward in discussion with the interested companies.  As of now there is no requirement of a separate policy for implementation of these projects as the existing policies are sufficient to deal with the related matter.                                      ******
