ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING [RAO INDERJIT SINGH](a) to (d): The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation has carried out an all-India survey on Household Consumption Expenditure during NSS 75th round (July 2017 - June 2018). The survey generates estimates of household Monthly Per Capita Consumer Expenditure (MPCE) and the distribution of households and persons over the MPCE classes. It is designed to collect information regarding expenditure on consumption of goods and services (food and non-food) consumed by the households. The results, after release, are also used for rebasing of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) series and other macro-economic indicators. The Ministry follows a rigorous procedure for vetting of data and reports which are produced through surveys. The results of this survey was examined and it was observed that there was a significant variation in the levels in the consumption pattern as well as in the direction of the change while comparing with other administrative data sources. The matter was also referred to a Committee of Experts which has recommended refining the survey methodology and improving the data quality aspects on a concurrent basis. As per the Press Release dated 15.11.2019, the Ministry has decided not to release the Consumer Expenditure Survey results of 2017-2018.                                              *****
