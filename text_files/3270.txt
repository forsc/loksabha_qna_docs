                                                    (a) 	whether the Government has fixed any timeline for the completion of the river port over river Gomti of Tripura at Sonamura and if so, the details thereof and if not, the reasons therefor; and(b) 	whether any plan has been drawn up within which the movement of Cargo ship from the Sonamura river port would start through the river system of Bangladesh and if so, the details thereof and if not, the reasons therefor?






ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b)  	No timeline has been stipulated for establishment of Inland Water Terminal at Sonamura in Tripura, as the stretch of Gomti river in Bangladesh through which shipping and navigation is proposed is not yet part of the Indo-Bangladesh Protocol Route.   As per decision at the 19th meeting of Standing Committee of Protocol on Inland Water Transit and Trade (PIWT&T) and Shipping Secretary Level Talks held between India and Bangladesh in October, 2018, a Joint Technical Committee (JTC) comprising of India and Bangladesh officials has undertaken hydrographic survey and given a positive report on the feasibility of navigation in both Indian and Bangladesh portions of Gomti river.   However, prior to undertaking development of the waterway for navigation through the river system of Bangladesh (Meghna), it has been decided to seek approval of Bangladesh for declaration of Sonamura-Daudkhandi route as part of the Protocol route between India and Bangladesh. The Government of Bangladesh has been requested, through Ministry of External Affairs, to accord their ‘in-principle’ approval to this proposal.                                             *****
