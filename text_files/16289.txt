ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) & (b): No. The Central Government / Ministry of Finance allocates budgetary fund to different Ministries/ Departments demand wise for Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) and Central Sector Schemes (CS). In case of Centrally Sponsored Scheme, the respective Ministry / Department in turn allocates the Central Government share of Centrally Sponsored Scheme to the States/UTs through the Consolidated Funds of the States. The utilization of the budgetary allocations is monitored by the Financial Adviser (FA) and Chief Controller of Accounts (CCA) of the respective Ministry/Department. The release of funds/ installment is based on the furnished Utilization Certificate (UC) of the penultimate (last to last) installment. For avoiding the back-loading of expenditure towards the end of the year, there is a ceiling of 33% and 15% of budgetary outlay for respective scheme in the last quarter and the last month of the financial year respectively. To establish an efficient fund flow system, the funds of CSS and CS are released through the Public Financial Management System (PFMS). ****
