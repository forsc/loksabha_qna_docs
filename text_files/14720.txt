                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a):The Ministry of Women & Child Development is implementing a centrally sponsored scheme, namely Child Protection Services (CPS) scheme (erstwhile Integrated Child Protection Scheme), for supporting the children in difficult circumstances, as envisaged under Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act). Under CPS, financial assistance is provided to State Governments /UT Administrations for setting up and managing Child Care Institutions (CCIs) by themselves or in association with Voluntary Organisations/Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). The primary responsibility of execution of the Act and implementation of the Scheme lies with the States/UTs. The total number of Children Homes including Specialised Adoption Agencies (SAAs) and Open Shelter being run by NGOs across the country including Andhra Pradesh supported under CPS is Annexed.(b) to (d): The JJ Act and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rule, 2016 framed thereunder mandate regular monitoring and inspection of CCIs.Under Section 41 of the JJ Act, registration of institutions including Homes for children in need of care and protection has been made mandatory with a provision of penalty in case of non-compliance. As per Section 54 of the JJ Act, the State Governments/UT Administrations are required to conduct regular inspections and monitor CCIs to ensure that the institutions are run as per the provisions of the Act and the Model Rules, 2016 framed there-under.All the State/UT Governments have been asked to close the CCIs who have declined to register under the JJ Act, 2015 and to rehabilitate the children in registered Institutions. The Ministry has requested the Chief Secretaries of all States/UTs to monitor all the CCIs under the supervision of District Magistrates and issued an advisory to the States and UTs regarding the action to be taken in case of disruption to the life of children in case of any untoward incidence of abuse in any CCI.Besides, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and State Commissions for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) have been constituted as statutory bodies under the Commissions for Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005 (CPCR), to oversee implementation of the JJ Act in the country. *** AnnexureAnnexure referred in reply to part (a) of the Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.3341 for answer on 13.03.2020 raised by Shri Rajeshbhai Chudasama & Shri Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy regarding “Juvenile Justice Act”.The total number of Homes including SAAs and Open Shelter being run by NGOs across the country including Andhra Pradesh supported under CPS (as on Feb, 2020)S.
