                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                            (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)	& (b): Yes, Sir.  Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has informed that keeping in view area, number of rooms and higher specifications of the flat,  it was decided to treat these flats as One Bed Room/Lower Income Group (LIG) flat and the cost was accordingly charged on the basis of weighted average of Plinth Area Rates.  In majority of cases the applicants have not provided any specific reasons for surrender of the flats. However, some of the reasons as reported are as under:(i)	Applicants did not like the location of the allotted flats; and(ii)	Size of the allotted flats was small.DDA has taken following corrective steps: (i)	DDA has decided to refund 50% of the ‘Maintenance Fund’ charged for undertaking maintenance works for 30 years from the allottees of one bedroom/LIG flats of Housing Scheme 2014/ Awasiya Yojana 2017.(ii)	DDA has started shuttle bus service from the nearest Bus Terminal and Metro Station from the 1st Week of December, 2018 at Narela, Siraspur and Rohini Sector 34 & 35, free of cost to the residents of these DDA flats.(iii)	DDA has allotted 23 shops for daily needs to NAFED at Dwarka Sector-23B, Rohini Sector-34 and Narela G-2 and G-8. (iv)	DDA has handed over Porta Cabins to Mother Dairy and Safal for starting sales outlets at Narela.  (c) & (d): DDA has informed that the Authority has approved  execution of Conveyance Deed for allottees of Housing Scheme 2014 after payment of balance 10% cost of the flat (since only 90% of the cost of the flat has been deposited at the time of possession) along with simple interest @ 10% per annum as per the terms and conditions of the scheme.  However, no such interest is being charged from the allottees of Housing Scheme 2017, as they have already deposited the full cost of the flat. (e): DDA has informed that no relaxation has been granted/approved by the Authority.                       *****
