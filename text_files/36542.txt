ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (d)	India, Sri Lanka and Japan had signed a trilateral Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) in May 2019 to develop and operate the East Container Terminal (ECT) of Colombo Port. It has been reported that the Cabinet of Ministers of Sri Lanka in a meeting held on 01 February 2021 approved a proposal to operate the ECT as a wholly owned container terminal of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. The Cabinet of Ministers of Sri Lanka also approved the proposal to take necessary steps to develop and operate the West Container Terminal of the Port of Colombo as a public-private partnership with foreign parties on BOT basis.	The matter was taken up by High Commission of India with Government of Sri Lanka and the importance of adhering to international commitments in the context of the tripartite MoC was emphasized.	It has been stressed to Government of Sri Lanka that the development of infrastructure in Sri Lanka in areas such as ports and energy with foreign investment from India would be a mutually beneficial proposition, especially since most of the transhipment at Colombo Port is to and from India.	India’s relations with other countries stand on their own footing and are independent of the relations of those countries with third countries. However, Government carefully monitors any developments having a bearing on India’s security and economic interests, and takes all necessary measures to safeguard them.***
