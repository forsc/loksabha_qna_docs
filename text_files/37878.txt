(a) & (b):	Under the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, the Central Government and the State Governments, as appropriate Government, fix, periodically review and revise the minimum wages of the employees employed in the Scheduled employments including agriculture under their respective jurisdiction. Accordingly, the minimum rates of wages in the scheduled employments in the Central sphere were last revised by the Central Government in 2017. Further, in order to take care of the rising prices, the Central Government revises the Variable Dearness Allowance (V.D.A) on basic rates of minimum wages every six months effective from 1st April and 1st October of every year on the basis of Consumer Price Index for Industrial workers. V.D.A. was last revised w.e.f. 01.10.2021. A statement showing increase in the rates of wages on account of increasing V.D.A payable to the employees engaged in the Scheduled employments including agriculture in the Central Sphere is at Annexure-I. The details of periodic revision of minimum rates of wages in the Scheduled employments in the State sphere are not centrally maintained. (c) & (d):	Enforcement of the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, including payment of the minimum wages, is done by the authorities statutorily appointed for the purpose by the appropriate Governments, i.e. the Central Government and the State Governments, in their respective jurisdiction. The enforcement in the Central sphere is secured through the inspecting officers of the Chief Labour Commissioner (Central) commonly designated as Central Industrial Relations Machinery (CIRM) and in the State Sphere through the State Enforcement Machinery. The designated inspecting officers conduct regular inspections and in the event of detection of any case of non-payment or under-payment of minimum wages, they direct the employers to make payment of the shortfall of wages. In case of non-compliance, penal provisions prescribed under Section 22 of the Act are taken recourse to. The details in regard to enforcement of the minimum wages in the Scheduled employments in the Central Sphere are furnished at Annexure-II. Details of enforcement of the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, in the State sphere are not centrally maintained.
