The problems of migration/migrant workers is sought to be addressed through multi dimensional course of action through rural development, provision of improved infrastructural facilities, equitable dispersal of resources to remove regional disparities, employment generation, land reforms, increased literacy, financial assistance etc. So far as the Ministry of Rural Development is concerned, the Ministry is implementing various rural development schemes for creating employment opportunities and rural infrastructure. All these measures encourage people to stay in rural areas, earn their livelihood and raise their quality of life near their places of residence and hence act as a deterrent to distress migration of rural population to cities.  The details are as under: i.	Under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), guaranteed wage employment of 100 days in a financial year is provided to a rural household whose adult members are willing to take up manual work. Further, an additional 50 days of wage employment is provided over and above 100 days in the notified drought affected areas or natural calamity affected areas in the country on recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.ii.	Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) is implemented with the objective of providing self-employment to the women members of the rural poor families by mobilizing them into Self Help Groups(SHGs). iii.	Rural Self Employment and Training Institutes (RSETIs) provides for skill development programme for self employment. This training with access to Bank loans helps in creating self-employment opportunities at local level. iv.	Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM) is aimed at developing 300  rural growth clusters called ‘Rurban Clusters’ which have latent potential for growth, in all  States and UTs with the objective to bridge the rural urban divide and reduce migration from rural to urban areas and eventually facilitate reverse migration.v.	Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana  (PMGSY) is aimed at providing connectivity by way of an all-weather road to eligible unconnected habitations in rural areas so that these habitations can have access to basic health services, education and markets for their produce.******
