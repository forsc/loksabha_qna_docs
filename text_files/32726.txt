ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES(SHRI NARAYAN RANE)(a)	to (d):  	Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises does not maintain the data with respect to closures of MSMEs. However, as informed by Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEFCC), the notification on ash utilization from coal and lignite based thermal power plants was published vide S.O.5481(E) dated 31.12.2021 and mandates thermal power plants to utilize current generation ash and legacy ash in prescribed timelines. The thermal power plants failing to meet prescribed utilisation timelines will be imposed environmental compensation on unutilised quantity. The supply of ash is based on mutually agreed terms between thermal power plant and user agency to meet the utilization timelines. The supply of ash free of charge is applicable only when a notice is served by the Thermal Power Plant to specified users such as road laying activities, construction of road and flyover embankments, shoreline protection structures in coastal districts, dams, and mixing of ash in overburden dumps and backfilling in mines”.        The National Small Industries Corporation Limited (NSIC), a Public Sector Undertaking under this Ministry, facilitates Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) to meet their raw material requirement by making arrangements with bulk manufacturers for procuring the materials and supplying the same to MSMEs.
