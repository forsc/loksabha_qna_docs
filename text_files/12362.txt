ANSWER




                                                        (a): There are certain tribal communities who have declining or stagnant population, low level of literacy, pre-agricultural level of technology and are economically backward. These groups are among the most vulnerable section of our society as they are few in numbers, have not attained any significant level of social and economic development and generally inhabit remote localities having poor infrastructure and administrative support.  75 such groups in 17 States and 1 Union Territory have been identified and categorized as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups.(b): As per Census 2011, the State/UT wise Scheduled Tribes whose population is less than 2000 is given at Annexure.(c): For the protection and safety of tribal communities in the entire country Government of India has legislated various Acts, like Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 (22 of 1955) and the Scheduled Castes and the Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (33 of 1989). Further, besides other schemes being implemented by this Ministry for the development of STs, this Ministry is exclusively implementing a Central Sector Scheme namely “Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups” for overall development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). Under the Scheme, State Governments submits Conservation-cum-Development (CCD) Plans on the basis of their requirement. The scheme is extremely flexible because it enables every State to focus on areas that they consider to be relevant to their PVTGs and their Socio-cultural environment including their identity and culture. 100% grants-in-aid are made available to States as per the provisions of the scheme.AnnexureAnnexurereferred to in reply to part (b) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.1352 for 10.02.2020 regarding ‘Decline in the Population of Tribal Communities’State/UT wise Scheduled Tribes (STs) whose population is less than 2000State/UTs	Scheduled TribesANDAMAN & NICOBAR ISLANDS	Andamanese,   Chariar,   Chari,   Kora,   Tabo,   Bo,   Yere, Kede,   Bea,   Balawa,   Bojigiyab,   Juwai,   Kol	Jarawas	Onges	Sentinelese	Shom PensANDHRA PRADESH	Bhil	Hill Reddis	Kattunayakan	Kulia	ReddiDhoras	Rona, Rena	Dhulia, Paiko, Putiya (in the districts of Vishakhapatnam and Vijayanagaram)ARUNACHAL PRADESH	Abor	Khowa, Bugun	Hrusso	Khamba	Adibori	Ashing	Bagi	Bangni	Bogum	Bomdo	But Monpa	DarokTangsa	Degaru/Taraon Mishmi	HaisaTangsa	HaviTangsa	Hill Miri	HotangTangsa	Karka	KemsingTangsa	Khamiyang	Komkar	KorangTangsa	LangkaiTangsa	Libo	LichiTangsa	LijuNocte	LonginTangsa	LongphiTangsa	LongriTangsa	LongsangTangsa	LowangTangsa	Meyor	Mikir	Mishmi	Morang Tangsa	Muktum	NamsangTangsa	NgimongTangsa	Laju	Nonong	Dalbing	Pailibo	Panchen monpa	Pangi	Pasi	Phongtangsa	Ponthainocte	Ramo	Adiramo	Rangaitangsa	Rongrangtangsa	Sanketangsa	Siram	SulungBangni	TaginBangni	TaisenTangsa	Tangam	Jugli	Taram	Thai Khampi	TutchaNocte	YongkukTangsa	YougliTangsaASSAM (In the autonomous district)	Hajong	Lakher	Man (Tai speaking)	Any Mizo (Lushai) tribes	Pawi	SynthengASSAM (In the State of assam excluding the autonomous district)	Hojai	KhamptiBIHAR	Baiga	Bathudi	Bedia	Binjhia	Birhor	Birjia	Gorait	Ho	Karmali	Khond	Korwa	Parhaiya	SauriaPaharia	Savar	KawarCHHATTISGARH	Andh	Bhil, Bhilala, Barela, Patelia	Bhil Mina	Damor, Damaria	Karku	Kolam	Korku, Bopchi,  Mouasi, Nihal,  Nahul,  Bondhi,  Bondeya	Mawasi	Parja	Sahariya, Saharia, Seharia,  Sehria,  Sosia,  Sor	Saur	SonrDADRA & NAGAR HAVELI#	Kathodi	Naikda or NayakaDAMAN & DIU#	Naikda (Talavia)	Siddi (Nayaka)	VarliGOA	Dhodia	Dubla (Halpati)	Naikda (Talavia)	Siddi (Nayaka)	VarliGUJARAT	Barda	Bharwad (in the Nesses of the forests of Alech,  Barada and Gir)	Pomla	Tadvi Bhil, Bawra, Vasave	PadviHIMACHAL PRADESH	Jad, Lamba, Khampa	Beta, Beda	Domba, Gara, ZobaJAMMU & KASHMIR*	Beda	Garra	MonJHARKHAND	Banjara	KhondKARNATAKA	Adiyan	Barda	Bavacha, Bamcha	Chenchu, Chenchwar	Chodhara	Dubla, Talavia, Halpati	Gamit, Gamta, Gavit, Mavchi, Padvi, Valvi	Irular	Kammara (in South Kanaradisitrict and Kollegaltaluk of Mysore district)	Kaniyan, Kanyan (in Kollegaltaluk of Mysore district)	Kathodi, Katkari, DhorKathodi,  DhorKatkari,  Son Kathodi,  Son Katkari	Kattunayakan	Kokna, Kokni, Kukna	Kota	Koya, BhineKoya, Rajkoya	Kurumans	MahaMalasar	Malasar	Malayekandi	Maleru	Palliyan	Paniyan	Patelia	Rathawa	Sholaga	Toda	Varli	Vitolia, Kotwalia, BarodiaKERALA	Arandan, Aranadan	Kochuvelan	Koraga	Kudiya, Melakudi	MahaMalasar	Malakkuravan	Malayarayar	Palleyan, Palliyan, Palliyar, Paliyan	Ten Kurumban, JenuKurumban	Thachanadan, ThachanadanMoopan	Cholanaickan	VettaKuruman	Mala PanickarLAKSHADWEEP	Inhabitants of the Laccadive,   Minicoy and Amindivi Islands who, and both of whose parents, were born in those islands.MADHYA PRADESH	Andh	Bhattra	Bhunjia	Birhul, Birhor	Damor, Damaria	Gadaba, Gadba	Kamar	Karku	Kondh, Khond, Kandh	Kolam	Korwa, Kodaku	Majhwar	Nagesia, Nagasia	Parja	Saonta, Saunta	Sawar, SawaraMAHARASHTRA	Baiga	Barda	Bavacha, Bamcha	Bhaina	BhariaBhumia, BhuinharBhumia,  Pando	Bhattra	Birhul, Birhor	Kamar	Khairwar	Kharia	Kondh, Khond, Kandh	Koya, BhineKoya, Rajkoya	Nagesia, Nagasia	Parja	Pomla	Rathawa	Sawar, Sawara	Vitolia, Kotwalia, BarodiaMANIPUR	Angami	Koireng	Purum	Ralte	Sema	Suhte	Tarao	KharamMEGHALAYA	Chakma	Hmar	Lakher	Man (Tai speaking)	Pawi	SyntengMIZORAM	Dimasa (Kachari)	Garo	Hajong	Khasi and Jaintia (including KhasiSynteng or Pnar,  War,  Bhoi or Lyngngam) 	Man (Tai speaking)	Mikir	Any Naga tribes	SyntengNAGALAND	Mikir	Chirr	MakwareODISHA	Baiga	Birhor	Chenchu	DesuaBhumij	Gandia	Ghara	Korua	MankidiRAJASTHAN	Kokna,  Kokni,  Kukna	KoliDhor,  TokreKoli,  Kolcha,   Kolgha	PateliaTAMIL NADU	Aranadan	Kadar	Kammara (excluding Kanyakumari district and Shenkottahtaluk of Tirunelveli district)	KochuVelan	KondaKapus	Koraga	Kota (excluding Kanyakumari district and Shenkottahtaluk of Tirunelveli district)	Kudiya,  Melakudi	MahaMalasar	MalaiArayan	MalaiPandaram	Malayekandi	Mannan	Mudugar,  Muduvan	Muthuvan	PalleyanTRIPURA	Bhutia	Chaimal	Khasia	LepchaUTTAR PRADESH	Raji	Parahiya (in the district of Sonbhadra)	Patari (in the district of Sonbhadra)UTTARAKHAND	RajiWEST BENGAL	Birjia	Chakma	Hajang	Khond	Mru	ParhaiyaNote : * The information is for combined Jammu & Kashmir before bifurcation in to UTs of Jammu & Kashmir &Ladakh.# Before unificationSource: Census 2011, Registrar General of India,*****
