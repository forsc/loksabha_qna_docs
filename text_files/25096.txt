                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (FINANCE)    (SHRI PANKAJ CHAUDHARY)(a) and (b):  The Government had announced a relief package under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package (PMGKP) on 26.03.2020 which included schemes for the welfare of the poor in their struggle against COVID-19.   Further, Atmanirbhar Bharat Packages 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 were announced on 13th -17th May, 2020, 12th October, 2020 & 12th November 2020 respectively to fight COVID-19 and to make the country self-reliant.  These, including other measures announced by RBI, involved a total amount of Rs.29,87,641 crores.  Besides, a Rs. 6.28 lakh crore COVID stimulus package was also announced on 28.06.2021.  Under Atmanirbhar Bharat, the scheme of free distribution of foodgrains was extended to migrants also.  The details of these measures are at Annexure-I.   In view of the second wave of COVID-19, the schemes of free distribution of foodgrain were re-launched from May, 2021 and will be in operation till November, 2021.  While schemes announced under PMGKP were welfare schemes meant to support poor during the pandemic, the schemes/programmes announced under Atmanirbhar Bharat Packages are mostly long terms measures whose outcomes will be visible in due course. Statements indicating State-wise details of beneficiaries under PMGKP and welfare schemes under Atmanirbhar Bharat are at Annexure-II (a) and Annexure-II (b).    *****
