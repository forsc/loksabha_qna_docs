ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION, MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS (RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a) No Sir. (b) In view of the reply of part (a) above, question does not arise.   (c) The Cabinet in its meeting held on 6th April 2020, decided not to operate MPLADS for the Financial years 2020-21 and 2021-22 and place the MPLADS funds for these two years at the disposal of Ministry of Finance to meet the emergent needs of people arising due to COVID pandemic. The funds saved from the MPLAD Scheme have been utilized to enhance the allocation of funds for improving health infrastructure, provide free ration under PM Garib Kalyan Yojana, and free vaccination for the people. However, the Government released Rs. 1107.5 crore against the pending instalments of 2019-20 and previous years during March, 2021 to clear the committed liabilities and help the people during the covid-19 pandemic. The Government has also decided to release all pending instalments of 2019-20 in respect of Members of Parliament of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha during 2021-22, subject to the fulfilment of eligibility criteria and submission of eligible documents by district Authorities, as per the MPLADS guidelines.                                                     *****
