The IRAP study provides star rating of the road sections considering more than 50 parameters of the road cross-section and geometry. It was found out that 30% of the length was having less than 3-Star rating (where 5-Star means safestand 1-Star means unsafe).The National Highway passing through urban/semi-urban areas or developed villages required pedestrian and NMT facilities, which are absent as per study. Also, traffic is moving through the intersections at speed higher than 60 kmph. According to i-RAP, for the design speed of 100 kmph for the two corridors, and based on operating speed of 85th percentile speed, the roads were considered to be unsafe for motor vehicles for 30% length.The provisions of PUPs, CUPs, Footpath, Foot over Bridge & other pedestrian facilities & other grade separated structures etc. are integral part of the design of development projects keeping in view the site requirement and as per provisions given in IRC: SP-73:2018- “Manual of Specifications & Standards for Two Lanning of Highways with Paved Shoulders”, IRC: SP-84-2014- “Manual for Specifications & Standards for Four Lanning of Highways Through Public Private Partnership” IRC:SP-87-2013- “Manual of Specification & Standards for Six Lanning of Highways through Public Private Partnership”.
