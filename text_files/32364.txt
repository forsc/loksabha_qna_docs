ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b): The Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC 2011) provides data of households on various aspects of their socio-economic status viz., housing, landholding/landlessness, educational status, status of women, the differently abled, occupation, possession of assets, scheduled caste/ scheduled tribe (SC/ST) households, income, etc. The SECC data has paved the way for better targeting of the poor and targeted intervention for ameliorating conditions of the poor households. Increased granularity of SECC data has helped in tackling multidimensional poverty more efficiently than before. The beneficiaries under several schemes of Government of India as well as many state governments are selected based on the (i) “automatically excluded households”, (ii) “automatically included households” and (iii) “deprived households” data of SECC-2011. SECC data so far has been successfully used for selection of beneficiaries under various programmes/schemes like Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) of Ministry of Rural Development, Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) of Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana- Saubhagya of Ministry of Power etc. (c): 	No such decision has been taken by the Government. (d) to (f): Does not arise.*******
