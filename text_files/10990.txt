                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)	The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) is a sub-mission under the overarching National Health Mission, (NHM) along with National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) as the other sub-mission. It is implemented in all the States/UTs in the country.Statements showing physical achievements and outcomes under NHM are given at Annexure-I and II respectively.(b) & (c)	‘Public Health and Hospitals’ being a State subject, the primary responsibility of  ensuring availability of essential medicines, diagnostic tests and medical equipments in public health facilities lies with the respective State Governments. To ensure availability of essential drugs, diagnostics, Medical Equipment and reduce the Out of Pocket Expenditure (OOPE) of the patients visiting the public health facilities, Government has rolled out the Free Drugs Service Initiative (FDSI), Free Diagnostics Service Initiative and Bio-Medical Equipment Management and Maintenance Programme (BMMP) under NHM.Under NHM, technical and financial support is provided to States / UTs for provision of free essential medicines, free essential diagnostics and medical equipment in public health facilities based on the requirements posted by them in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) within their overall resource envelope. This support also includes, support for strengthening/setting up robust systems of procurement, quality assurance mechanism, warehousing, prescription audit, grievance redressal, dissemination of Standard Treatment Guidelines, and IT backed supply chain management systems like Drugs and Vaccines Distribution Management Systems (DVDMS).All States/ UTs have reported that they have notified this policy to provide free essential medicines in public health facilities. The Ministry has also provided illustrative list of essential medicines that should be provided at Sub Centres, Primary Health Centres, Community Health Centres and District Hospitals.DVDMS is a web-based Supply Chain Management System that deals in purchase, supply, distribution and inventory management of various drugs, sutures, surgical and consumable items. It has an in-built provision of monitoring and checking the availability of medicine at all facilities at district and state level. DVDMS links various Regional/ District Drug Warehouses (DWH), District Hospitals (DH), their sub stores like Community Health Centres (CHC) and Primary Health Centres (PHC). Moreover, it has the functionality for distribution of drugs to patients, thus enabling tracking of consumption till last mile.Under Free Diagnostics Service Initiative, a Guidance Note has been shared with States/ UT, which  provide an expanded list of essential diagnostics tests specific to various levels of care that includes 14 tests at Sub Centre level, 63 tests at PHC level, 97 tests at CHC level, 111 tests at SDH level and 134 tests at DH level. The tests encompass hematology, serology, bio-chemistry, clinical pathology, microbiology, radiology, and cardiology.Comprehensive guidelines of BMMP have been linked with uptime of equipment (95% in District Hospital, 90% in Community Health Centres and 80% in Primary Health Centres). The technical manual for BMMP implementation in In-house and PPP mode is released in August 2019, which provides details on planning, monitoring, SOPs for Inventory management, protocols & training components for effective planning and execution of BMMP. 30 States/ UTs have reported implementation of BMMP.In addition to this Ayushman Bharat progamme, 1.5 lakh Sub Health Centres and Primary Health Centres across the country are being transformed into Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWC) by December 2022 for provision of comprehensive primary care that includes preventive healthcare and health promotion at the community level with continuum of care approach.All these Ayushman Bharat – Health & Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs) have the provision of free essential medicines and   diagnostics to the visiting patients.(d) & (e)	The working of National Health Mission (NHM) has been regularly assessed, inter-alia, through external surveys such as, National Family Health Survey (NFHS) and Sample Registration System (SRS). Further, Common Review Missions (CRMs) also undertake a review of NHM annually. The details of various reports of CRM are available in public domain at   https://nhm.gov.in/index1.php?lang=1&level=1&sublinkid=795&lid=195Further, under National Health Mission (NHM), the performance of various health programmes is being regularly assessed, through regular review meetings, video conferences & field visits of senior officials, promoting performance by setting up benchmarks for service delivery & rewarding achievements etc.At village level, Village Health Sanitation & Nutrition Committee (VHSNC) is constituted which function under the ambit of the Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI) and acts as a sub- Committee or a Standing Committee of the Gram Panchyat, to enable communities to take collective action for the attainment of better health status in the village. A similar mechanism in urban areas is the Mahila Arogya Samiti (MAS). Untied funds are provided to the VHSNC and MAS on an annual basis to undertake their functions.Similarly, at health facility level, Rogi Kalyan Samitis (RKSs) are envisaged to act as a forum to improve the functioning and service provisioning, increase participation and enhance accountability, for provision of better facilities to the patients at the level of Primary Health Centres and above.
