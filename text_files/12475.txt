ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT (SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a)	to (f): Private Coaching centres do not come under the purview of this Ministry.  This Ministry has issued directions to all State Governments to take steps for effective regulation of such centres.  However, in the interest of students including the most disadvantaged, Government has launched Study Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds (SWAYAM), which offers interactive course content such as video lectures, reading material, self-assessment through tests and quizzes and online discussion forum for clearing doubts for students from Class 9 to post-graduation. The content can be accessed free of cost by anyone, anywhere at any time.  Another initiative of the Government called Indian Institute of Technology - Professor Assisted Learning (IIT-PAL) which provides video content in Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics prepared by IIT Professors and Kendirya Vidyalaya (KV) teachers for Class XI and Class XII students aspiring to join IITs and other Institutions.  The content is available free of cost on dedicated DTH channels of SWAYAM PRABHA.(g): Ministry of Home Affairs informed that Fire service is a State Subject and it is primary responsibility of the State Governments to allocate sufficient resources for strengthening and equipping Fire Services as per requirement and to take various steps required for safety of life and property of the citizens in the area of their jurisdiction from fire hazards. Government of Gujrat informed that for fire safety and for fire clearance, the State Government modified the Comprehensive Central Development Regulations-2017 vide notification dated 03/10/2019 by which NOC of Chief Fire Officer is made mandatory for Coaching class/ Training Centre/ Pre-School, irrespective of plot area and building height. *****
