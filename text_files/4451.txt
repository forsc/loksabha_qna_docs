                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW & JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a)-(c): Setting up of Special Courts and their functioning falls within the domain of the State and Union Territory Governments and respective High Courts who set up such courts as per their need and resources, in accordance with Section 8 of the “The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) (PoA) Amendment Act, 2015”. The Act further empowers a State Government to specify for each district, a Court of Session to be a Special Court for the purpose, in those Districts where less number of cases under this Act are filed. However as per information received from High Courts, the State/UT-wise status of special district courts set up is as per Annexure.	The 14th Finance Commission endorsed the proposal of the Union Government to strengthen the judicial system in States which included, inter-alia, establishing 1800 Fast Track Courts at a cost of Rs. 4144 crore for cases involving vulnerable and marginalized sections of the society. The State Governments were urged to use the additional fiscal space provided by the Commission in the form of enhanced tax devolution (from 32% to 42%) to meet such requirements.  ANNEXURESl.
