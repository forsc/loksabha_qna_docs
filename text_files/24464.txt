Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) was launched as a one-time special intervention to provide rural connectivity, by way of a single all-weather road, to the eligible unconnected habitations of designated population size (500+ in plain areas and 250+ in North-Eastern States, Himalayan States and Himalayan Union Territories as per 2001 census) in the core network for uplifting the socio-economic condition of the rural population.

In the critical Left Wing Extremism affected blocks (as identified by Ministry of Home Affairs), additional relaxation has been given to connect habitations with population 100 persons and above as per 2001 census. The mandate of PMGSY has been subsequently widened to include new interventions.  PMGSY-II was launched in the year 2013, with a target to upgrade 50,000 Kms  of the existing rural road network to improve its overall efficiency as a provider of transportation services for people, goods and services.

PMGSY-III was launched in the year 2019 for consolidation of 1,25,000 Km Through Routes and Major Rural Links connecting habitations,  inter-alia, to Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs), Higher Secondary Schools and Hospitals.  The main features of PMGSY are decentralized and evidence based planning, standards and specifications as per Indian Road Congress (IRC) and Rural Roads Manual, dedicated  implementation mechanism at central, state and district level, scrutiny of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) at multiple levels, strong IT backbone for monitoring and implementation of the programme, three-tier quality management system, unbroken flow of funds, inbuilt mechanism for consultation with public representatives at planning, selection of roads and monitoring stages, etc.(b) to (e) The State of Tamil Nadu has been allocated a target length of 7,375 Km under PMGSY-III.

The implementation period of PMGSY-III is upto March, 2025.The allocation of funds to the States for implementation of PMGSY depends, inter-alia, on works in hand, pace of expenditure and unspent balance available with the State.
