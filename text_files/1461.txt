                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (e):	As per Constitutional provisions, ‘Health’ is a State subject. It is within the domain of State/UT Government to ensure that hospitals given land at concessional rates provide free treatment to the poor. Since this is a State matter, Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare does not maintain details in this regard.	As per information furnished by the Land and Development Office (L&DO), Union Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, land has been allotted to the following private hospitals of Delhi on concessional rates:-i	Sir Ganga Ram Hospitalii	Veeranwali International hospital (Delhi Hospital Society)/PRIMUS-ORTHOiii	Dr. Vidya Sagar Kaushalya Devi Memorial Trust (VIMHANS)iv	Moolchand Khairati Ram Hospitalv	St. Stephens Hospitalvi	An additional strip of land measuring 773 square yards was allotted to R.B. Seth Jessa Ram Hospital for expansion of the hospital. Initially the land had been allotted by DDA.	In pursuance of directions issued by the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi in Writ Petition(C) 2866/2002 in the matter of Social Jurist Vs. GNCT Delhi and others, the Govt. of NCT Delhi had issued guidelines for provision of free treatment facilities to patients of Economically Weaker Section (EWS) category. The Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its order dated 01.09.2011 has ordered that 25% OPD and 10% IPD patents have to been given treatment free of cost. Accordingly, vide order dated 02.02.2012, Government of India took a policy decision that all the six private hospitals which have been provided land by L&DO on concessional rate must strictly follow the policy of providing treatment free of cost to 25% OPD and 10% IPD EWS patients.	As per information made available by L&DO, out of six hospitals to whom L&DO had allotted the land on concessional rate, two hospitals, namely, St. Stephen Hospital and Moolchand Khairati Ram Hospital failed to comply with the mandatory condition and filed Writ Petition before the Hon’ble High Court, who passed the order dated 28.04.2014. The Department filed SLPs in the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India against the order of Hon’ble High Court. Now, the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide order dated 09.07.2018 has made it mandatory for the above mentioned hospitals to strictly observe the condition of providing treatment free of cost to 10% IPD and 25% OPD Economically Weaker patients.	Government of NCT of Delhi has constituted a Monitoring Committee for this purpose. As and when any complaint is brought to the notice of the Land & Development Office by the Directorate of Health Services, Govt. of NCT of Delhi, action under lease terms is initiated against the erring hospital, which inter-alia includes issuance of show-cause notice, cancellation of allotment, etc.
