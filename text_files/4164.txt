In respect of North Eastern States (i.e. Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura) and Hill States ( i.e. Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Uttarakhand), the Desert Areas (as identified in the Desert Development Programme), the Tribal (Schedule V) areas and Selected Tribal and Backward Districts (as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the erstwhile Planning Commission), the objective is to connect eligible unconnected habitations with a population of 250 persons and above (Census 2001).  In the critical Left Wing Extremism affected blocks (as identified by MHA), additional relaxation has been given to connect habitations with population 100 persons and above (2001 census).(b) to (g):	Out of 1, 78, 184 habitations identified for coverage under the PMGSY, as on 30th June, 2019, 4,034  habitations are non-feasible or dropped. The States have further reported that 2,495 habitations are not feasible as of now due to reasons such as forest clearance, land issues and Court cases.  Out of the remaining eligible and feasible 1,71,655 habitations 1,66, 209 habitations have been connected through all-weather roads, including 16,086 habitations connected by various State Governments using their own resources.
