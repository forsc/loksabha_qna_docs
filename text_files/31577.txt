                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)        Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana-III (PMGSY-III) was launched in the year 2019 for consolidation of 1,25,000 Km Through Routes and Major Rural Links connecting habitations, inter-alia, to Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs), Higher Secondary Schools and Hospitals.  The State of Bihar has been allocated target of 6,162.50 km under PMGSY-III, out of which, 1,390.31 km (169 roads and 39 Bridges) has been sanctioned so far on the basis of technically acceptable proposals received from them. As per the programme guidelines of PMGSY, the tendering and execution of works sanctioned under the scheme is the responsibility of the concerned State Government. As reported by the State Government of Bihar, sanctioned projects under PMGSY-III have not yet started on ground. (b)        PMGSY has a three-tiered Quality Control Mechanism for ensuring construction of quality road works and durability of road assets under PMGSY. Under the first tier, the Programme Implementation Units (PIUs) are required to ensure process control through mandatory tests on material and workmanship at the field laboratory. The second tier is a structured independent quality monitoring at the State level through State Quality Monitors (SQMs) to ensure that every work is inspected at initial stage, intermediate stage and the final stage of construction. Under the third tier, which is at the national level, independent National Quality Monitors (NQMs) are deployed for random inspection of road works to monitor quality and to provide guidance of senior professionals to the field functionaries. An Abstract indicating the number of inspections conducted vis-a-vis quality grading during April, 2018 to November, 2021 is given at Annexure. During period April 2018 to November, 2021, a total of 415 Action Taken Reports (ATRs), on inspection reports of NQMs were required from the State. The State Government after doing necessary compliance has submitted 346 ATRs, out of which 269 have been approved, 22 are pending with the State for some clarifications, and 40 are under scrutiny. In case of 15 ATRs, decision has been taken to get them re-verified on the ground through NQMs.(c) to (e) As reported by the State Government, no such issue has come into the notice. As per programme guidelines, ensuring quality of road works is the responsibility of the State Governments, who are implementing the programme. Complaints received in the Ministry of Rural Development are sent to the State for inquiry and necessary action. In some cases, Ministry also deputes investigating team, generally comprising of National Quality Monitor(s).  In the case of complaints received from Hon’ble Member of Parliament, the National Quality Monitors/State Quality Monitors are required to intimate Hon’ble Member of Parliament about their visit.*****
