ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) to (f) :	There is no shortage of electricity in the country. As per independent  surveys, the availability of power in surveyed rural areas has gone up from an average of 12 hours in 2015  to 20.50 hours in the year 2020; and in the urban areas  the availability of power has gone up to 22.23  hours. In June, 2021, the average availability of power in rural areas was 22.17 hours  and in  urban areas  was  23.36  hours.  So far  as  State  of .......2. - 2 -Jharkhand is concerned, independent surveys indicate that average hours of rural power supply has gone up from 9 hours in the year 2015 to 16 hours in the year 2020. Based on the data ported by various utilities on communicable feeders on National Power Portal (NPP), State-wise details of average hours of power outage in rural areas are at Annexure-I and city-wise of average hours of power outage are at Annexure-II.  		Interruptions in the supply of electricity are generally on account of constraints in distribution network, or financial constraints with some Distribution Companies not having the money to pay for power. Further, electricity is a concurrent subject and supply/distribution of electricity to all consumers is done by the respective State Governments and/or State Power Utilities. Government of India has been helping the States through its various schemes including Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) and Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) to achieve the objective of providing uninterrupted power supply to all households.The DDUGJY scheme was notified by Ministry of Power, Government of India in December 2014 for strengthening and augmentation of sub-transmission & distribution infrastructure in rural areas, including metering of distribution transformers/ feeders/consumers. Under DDUGJY, Rs.4799.81 crore was sanctioned for Jharkhand, of which Rs.2397.44 crore has been released till 31.12.2021.The IPDS Scheme was notified by Ministry of Power, Government of India, on 03.12.2014, for strengthening the power sub-transmission and distribution networks in urban areas. R-APDRP (Restructured Accelerated Power Development & Reforms Programme) was subsumed under IPDS.  Under IPDS, Rs.755 crore was sanctioned for Jharkhand, of which Rs.380 crore has been released till 17.01.2022.**********
