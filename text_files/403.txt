                                                        (a)	The National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) is a competency based framework which organizes qualifications according to a series of levels of knowledge, skills and aptitude. These levels are defined in terms of learning outcomes which the learner must possess regardless of whether they were acquired through formal, non-formal or informal learning.  The National Skill Development Agency (NSDA) under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship has been mandated to operationalise the NSQF. For the current Financial Year a budget of Rs. 20 corers has been allocated for the functioning of NSDA.  NSDA does not allocate funds to States.(b) & (c)	Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana 2.0 (2016 - 2020) is the flagship outcome-based skill training scheme of the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE). The objective of the scheme is to encourage and promote skill development for the youth throughout the country. PMKVY 2.0 has two components known as Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed (CSCM) being implemented by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and Centrally Sponsored State Managed (CSSM) being implemented by State Skill Development Missions of the States/ UTs popularly known as State- Engagement Component of PMKVY (2016-20). AS per the PMKVY 2.0 CSCM state-wise target allocate and the youth trained and placed is at Annexure I. Further, as per PMKVY 2.0 CSSM the state-wise allocation of target is at Annexure II and the youth benefitted till date at Annexure III.(d) & (e)	At present 3135 qualifications for different Sectors have been aligned to National Skills Qualification Framework.
