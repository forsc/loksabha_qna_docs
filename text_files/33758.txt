ANSWER




MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a):   Coal companies dispatch coal as per Freight on Board (FoB) basis and consumers have the liberty to lift coal in various modes such as rail, road and captive modes (Merry Go Round (MGR), Belt, Rope etc.) as per their choice. Coal, when transported by Rail is charged at Class 145A/145B and freight rate per tonne for this class for different distance slabs is enclosed as Annexure A. These rates have been notified w.e.f. 01.11.2018 and uniformly applicable for all customers.  Further, No Busy Season Surcharge and Development charge is leviable on transportation of Coal and Coke by Railways.(b):  Coal is supplied to power plants through various modes of transportation like Rail, Road, MGR, belt, ropeway, etc. The landed cost of coal at power plants includes cost of coal and transportation cost of coal and hence, for power plants located far off from the mine, the landed cost of coal increases. Thus, the transportation cost of coal directly affects landed cost of coal and thereby Energy Charge Rate (ECR), which may further affect the merit order dispatch of the Power Plants.(c): The following steps have been taken by the Government to reduce the transportation cost:(i)  Rationalization of coal linkages is a policy introduced in order to reduce the distance in transportation of coal from the coal mines to the consumer. Coal linkage rationalization in the power sector has resulted in decrease in transportation cost of coal from the mines to the power plants leading to a cheaper coal based power generation. The exercise helps in reducing the load on the transportation infrastructure, easing the evacuation constraints as well as reduction in landed cost of coal. Till date, based on the request received from the consumer’s/Power plants from time to time Coal India Limited has rationalized coal quantity of about 89 Million Tonnes.(ii)  The Government in May, 2016 allowed flexibility in utilization of domestic coal by State/Central Gencos amongst their generating stations to reduce the cost of power generation by allocating more coal to their most efficient plants as well as by saving in transportation cost. The States may also transfer their linkage coal to Independent Power Producers (IPPs) selected through bidding process and take equivalent power subject to terms and conditions mentioned in the policy.****
