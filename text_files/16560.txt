ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a):	Yes, Sir. With the enhanced use of cyber space and more digital transactions, number of cyber crimes is also increasing. (b) to (d):   In case of digital transactions, sharing details about user ID,  Password & One Time  Password, etc.  of   a  person  may lead  to -2-LSUSQ No.336 for 15.09.2020compromise of Bank Account of the person by an unscrupulous person. People should refrain from sharing any sensitive personal information like details of their Bank Account/Debit/Credit Card, CVV No., OTP, etc. with unknown persons. Strengthening the security of digital payment system by banks is a continuous process.  Use of SIM card of a KYC verified customer may help in identification of criminals. However, use of multiple SIMs, e-SIM, VPN, etc. for cyber frauds poses some challenges for Law Enforcement Agencies in arresting the cyber criminals.(e) & (f):  People’s confidence in digital transactions is on the increase. Central Government has taken steps to strengthen cyber security. These steps include spreading of awareness about cyber crimes; issue of alerts / advisories; capacity building/training of law enforcement personnel / prosecutors/judicial officers; improving cyber forensic facilities; etc. The Government has also launched National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal, www.cybercrime.gov.in to enable citizens to report complaints pertaining to all types of cyber crimes with special focus on cyber crimes against women and children. *******
