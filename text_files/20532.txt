(e):	Government has assessed the achievements under PMEGP through information available on PMEGP e-portal, physical verification of actual establishments conducted between 24 to 36 months after their setting up and independent third party evaluation of the scheme conducted from time to time.  The details of the achievement are as follows:i.
