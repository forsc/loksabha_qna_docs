                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) to (d) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF STARRED QUESTION NO.248 BY SHRI SUNIL KUMAR SINGH TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 10.07.2019 REGARDING TRANSPORTATION OF COAL(a)	The latest freight rates for Coal & Coke are published in Goods Tariff No.49, Part-I (Vol.II) & Part II and the same is available at Indian Railway official website http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/directorate/traffic_comm/GOODS%20TARIFF%20NO_49%20%20PART%20I%20VOL_PART%20-%20II_Rev_120219.pdf.  Freight is charged according to distance-slabs. The tariff is uniform throughout the country. There are 3490 number of sidings and railway goods sheds currently open for handling of coal traffic in the country, including 317 sidings and railway goods sheds in Jharkhand. However, during 2018-19, loading was done from only 668 sidings and railway goods sheds, including 104 in State of Jharkhand. List of Coal sidings and railway goods sheds are available at Indian Railway official website http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/directorate/traffic_comm/downloads/Freight_Rate_2019/List_Coal_Siding_090719.pdf (b)	Fly ash is not transported in loose condition by rail and, therefore, there is no pollution during the transportation by rail. However, as far as coal is concerned, by and large, the loading & unloading points are mostly situated away from the residential areas. However Railways have taken a series of measures to control pollution. Detailed guidelines have --2/--2-been issued to  Zonal Railways, whereby ‘consent to establish’ for new sidings and railway goods sheds and ‘consent to operate’ for the existing sidings is required to be obtained from respective State Pollution Control Board (SPCB), in accordance with the provisions of Pollution Act. Measures to control pollution include water sprinkling systems, adequate green cover and dust screen walls along periphery of premises. (c)	In cases where complaints have been received regarding pollution due to coal dust, Railway Administration have either enforced pollution control measures or shifted/closed the coal handling points. Details are appended.(d)	No, Sir. *****APPENDIX REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (c) OF STARRED QUESTION NO.248 BY SHRI SUNIL KUMAR SINGH TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 10.07.2019 REGARDING TRANSPORTATION OF COALAction Taken by Zonal Railway for shifting/closure of coal handling points1.	Western Railway: Restriction for coal handling at Chaltan Goods shed was received from Gujarat Control Pollution Board. The same has been closed for handling of traffic of coal.2.	South Western Railway: Due to public protests by the residents of the town of Vasco, the Goa Pollution Control Board imposed restriction for loading of coal during the year 2018-19. On satisfactory compliance by Mormugao Port Trust authorities with the stipulations of Pollution Control Board, loading of coal had been suspended, and since resumed subject to strict precautions to avoid coal dust pollution, including covering of wagons by tarpaulins.3.	Northern Railway: A notice was served to M/s Nabha Power Ltd./Rajpura by Pollution Control Board due to pollution on account of unloading of coal at Mandi Gobindgarh. The coal handling was withdrawn from Mandi Gobindgarh to their own siding in power house. In respect of unloading of coal at Ayodhya, the residents of nearby locality filed a writ petition in Hon’ble High Court who ordered that water sprinkling may be done regularly during unloading of coal. The orders are being strictly followed.4.	South East Central Railway: Resident near Uslapur Public Siding complained regarding pollution, hence, this public siding has been closed. *****
