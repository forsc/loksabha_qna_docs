ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES & PUBLIC ENTERPRISES(SHRI ARVIND GANPAT SAWANT)(a) to (e): Yes Sir, Department of Heavy Industry have issued an Expression of Interest (EoI) on 4th June 2019 inviting proposals from State/UT Government Departments, State/City Transport Undertakings, Municipal Corporations or any other similar Public Entity interested in the deployment of electric buses for public transport in different cities on an Operational Cost Model, for availing incentives under Phase II of FAME India Scheme. Since electric buses need to be deployed only on Operational cost basis i.e. Rate per kilometer basis, the eligible incentives would be calculated through a uniform bidding mechanism for all the selected Cities/STUs etc. The criteria for calculation of eligible incentive has been explained at Para 9 under heading of “Bidding Mechanism” of the said EoI.  	As per FAME India Scheme Phase-II Notification S.O. No. 1300 (E) dated 8th March 2019 (available in Department’s website (www.dhi.nic.in), about 7000 electric buses are proposed to be incentivized by way of extending demand incentives to the tune of approximately Rs. 3545 Crore in a period of 3 years commencing from 1st April 2019.  The e-buses will be allocated across various States and Cities based on qualifying parameter i.e. favorable policies for electrification of vehicles, availability of power at affordable price, availability of space/locations for installation of charging infrastructures, dedicated depot for parking of buses and installation of chargers, concession in registration fees of such vehicles and so on. The qualifying parameter for allocation of e-buses across various States and Cities has been explained at Para 2, 4 and 9 of the EoI, issued by the Department on 4th June 2019 for deployment of e-buss under FAME India Scheme Phase-II. A copy of the detailed EoI is available in the Department’s website [www.dhi.nic.in].     ****
