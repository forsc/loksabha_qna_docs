                                                        (a)& (b) During the implementation of ‘Three year Action Plan’ Government’s debt as percentage of GDP was 48.2% in 2017-18, 47.9% in 2018-19 and 50.4% in 2019-20.  (c)The Government''s mechanism in controlling debt is derived from the mandate provided to Government under the Preamble to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 which enjoins “prudential debt management, consistent with fiscal sustainability through limits on the Central Government borrowings.” This has remained unchanged between the immediate old ‘Five Year Plan’ and the ‘Three Year Action Plan’. (d)The details of debt during the Five Year Plan immediately preceding the beginning of the Three-year Action Plan is as under: Table: Government Debt and GDP RatioYear	   Total Debt* (? crore)	Debt to GDP Ratio2012-13	     50,70,592	                   51.02013-14	     56,69,428	                   50.52014-15	     62,42,521	                   50.12015-16      69,01,971	                   50.12016-17      74,36,061	                   48.4*Government debt is at book value.*****
