                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):	Government, presently fixes minimum support Prices (MSPs) for 22 mandated agricultural crops viz. paddy, Jowar, Bajra, maize, ragi, Arhar, moong, urad, groundnut, soyabean, sunflower, sesamum, Nigerseed, cotton, wheat, barley, gram, masur (lentil), rapeseed/mustard, safflower, jute and copra and fair & remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane on the basis on the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP), after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/ Departments concerned and other relevant factors. In addition, MSPs for toria and de-husked coconut are also fixed on the basis of MSPs of rapeseed/mustard and copra respectively. These MSP Crops cover approximately 99 per cent of the total agricultural output (does not include horticulture) in the country. Government offers to procure agricultural produce conforming to the prescribed Fair Average Quality (FAQ) norms at MSP through designated agencies.	Government implements Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) for horticultural crops including onion which are perishable in nature and some agricultural crops which are not covered under the MSP on the request of State/UT Government concerned. The objective of intervention is to protect the growers of these commodities from making distress sale in the event of a bumper crop during the peak arrival period when the prices tend to fall below economic levels and cost of production. ******
