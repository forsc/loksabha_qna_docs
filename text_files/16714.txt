                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) to (f):	Public Distribution System (PDS) is operated under the joint responsibilities of the Central and State/UT Governments. The Central Government through Food Corporation of India (FCI) is responsible for procurement, storage and allocation of foodgrains to States/UTs and for transportation of foodgrains upto the designated depots of the FCI in the States/UTs, whereas, the operational responsibilities for allocation within the State/UT, transportation up to Fair Price Shops (FPSs), identification of eligible beneficiaries/ households, issuance of ration cards to them, distribution of foodgrains through FPSs, supervision & monitoring of FPS operations, etc. rest with the respective State/UT Government. Further, this............2/--2-Department has issued clear instructions to the FCI and all States/UTs to ensure that good quality foodgrains are supplied under PDS. Therefore, as and when, any complaints including distribution of sub-standard foodgrains under PDS from various sources are received in this Department, they are sent to the concerned State/UT Government for inquiry and appropriate action. A statement indicating State-wise number of complaints (various types) on TPDS received in the Department during the last three years 2017 to 2019 is at Annexure.	It is further stated that there is a set procedure/mechanism in place for the issuance of foodgrainsunder Public Distribution System (PDS). Surprise checks are also conducted at Foodgrain Storage Depots and Fair Price Shops to ensure the quality of foodgrains being supplied under PDS. The Department has issued following instructions to all States/UTs and FCI to ensure the supply of good quality foodgrains under PDS:i)	Only good quality foodgrains free from insect infestation and conforming to Food Safety Standards are to be issued under TPDS and other welfare schemes.ii)	Ample opportunities are to be provided to the State Government/UTs Administration to inspect the stocks prior to lifting from FCI godowns. State/UTs may ensure that officers not below the rank of Inspector are deputed for inspection of the foodgrains before their lifting from FCI godowns. iii)	Samples of foodgrains are to be collected and sealed from the stocks of foodgrains to be issued under the TPDS jointly by FCI and State Government/UT Administration.iv)	An officer not below the rank of Inspector is to be deputed from State Government to take the delivery of foodgrains stocks from FCI godowns.v)	Regular inspection to check the quality of foodgrains is to be carried out by the officers of State Government.vi)	It is the responsibility of the concerned State Government/UT Administration to ensure that during transportation and storage at different stages in the distribution chain, the foodgrains retain the required quality specifications.vii)	The State Government, where the decentralized procurement is in operation, should ensure that the quality of foodgrains issued under TPDS and other welfare schemes should meet the desired standards under the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).	Besides above, the institutional mechanism for the monitoring and grievance redressal under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) provides for setting up of Vigilance Committees at various levels, District Grievance Redressal Officers and independent State Food Commission for making the Public Distribution System more efficient and transparent.****ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (f) OF THE UNSTARRED QUSTION NO.406 FOR ANSWER ON 15.09.2020 IN THE LOK SABHA.STATEMENT:   COMPLAINTS ON TPDS RECEIVED  IN THE DEPARTMENT FROM INDIVIDUALS, ORGANISATIONS & THROUGH MEDIA REPORTS ETC FROM 2017 TO 2019  S.
