MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) & (b):Yes Sir. There are 14 options of subjects provided in All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) Approval Process Handbook (APH) 2021-22 for admission in Engineering and Technology. Out of 14 subjects at class XI & XII, if a student has not done a certain subject which is essential for the study of a specific discipline of engineering, then student shall be required to take pre-requisite additional course (s) either on Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) before joining the degree programme or at least in the very first year of engineering before proceeding to learn advanced courses in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology which are part of Model curriculum of AICTE for different engineering courses.(c) to (e): APH has a provision for the universities to offer suitable bridge courses such as Mathematics, Physics, Engineering drawing, etc for the students coming from diverse backgrounds to achieve desired learning outcome. Further, most of the bridge courses are available on MOOCs and therefore students can take benefit of this arrangement. The existing faculty of the institutes can hold the bridge classes.*****
