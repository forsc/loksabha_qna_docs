                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(DR. SANJEEV KUMAR BALYAN)(a)	& (b) As per 20th Livestock Census 2019, the population of total indigenous/non-descript cattle has declined by 6% from 151.17 million in 2012 to 142.11 million in 2019 whereas the decline of the population was about 9% during the census period 2007-12. The reason for declining the total indigenous/non-descript cattle population is due to the decline in the population of male indigenous/non-descript cattle population from 61.95 million in 2012 to 43.94 million in 2019. However, the total female indigenous/non-descript cattle population has increased by 10% from 89.22 million in 2012 to 98.17 million in 2019.(c) In order to complement and supplement the efforts made by the States and Union Territories to increase population of indigenous breeds, Government of India is implementing Rashtriya Gokul Mission with the aim of development and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds including high milk yielding indigenous bovines. The various steps taken by the Government under Rashtriya Gokul Mission are as follows-1.	Nationwide Artificial Insemination programme 2.	Krishi Kalyan Abhiyan3.	Establishment/strengthening of Embryo Transfer and In-Vitro Fertilization centres4.	National Bovine Genomic Centre for Indigenous Breeds (NBGC-IB)5.
