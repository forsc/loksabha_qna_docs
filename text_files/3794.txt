ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (d): Medical Education comes under the purview of the Ministry ofHealth & Family Welfare, which has informed that requests have been receivedfrom the State Governments of Puducherry and Tamil Nadu to exempt studentsfrom appearing in National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) forundergraduate and postgraduate medical admissions. However, Section 10D ofthe Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 prescribes conducting of a uniformentrance examination, namely NEET for medical admissions. Since theprovisions of the above Act apply across the country without exemption, norelaxation was given to the States. NEET is conducted once a year in pen andpaper mode whereas Joint Entrance Examination (Main) is conducted twice ayear as Computer Based Test (CBT). NEET was conducted by the Central Boardof Secondary Education (CBSE) during the last three years. State/UT-wiseinformation of students appeared/passed during the last three years is annexed.With regard to students ending their lives due to failure to clear NEET, Ministryof Health & Family Welfare has informed that they have no information in thisregard.(e) to (g): Do not arise in view of reply given in (a) to (d) above.****
