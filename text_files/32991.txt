                                                        THE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a)	to (e) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO.53* FOR 4TH FEBRUARY, 2022(a) & (b)	Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has developed India COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker, by merging mainly three national databases: CoWIN, National COVID-19 Testing database and COVID-19 India portal. The tracker depicts vaccine effectiveness against death i.e. ability of vaccines to reduce death, using person time analysis from 12th April 2021 to 2nd January 2022. The tracker is updated periodically and displays the effectiveness of partial and full vaccination against COVID-19. The latest data analysed and uploaded till January 2, 2022 depicts vaccine effectiveness of 99.3% in fully vaccinated individuals, against COVID-19. The data is analysed and presented as per the reports submitted by respective state governments.(c)		Omicron variant is the dominant variant in the country, presently.  The total number of Covid-19 cases in the country as on 31st January, 2022 is given in Annexure-A.  Whole genome sequencing for Omicron variant is done for all RTPCR positive samples from international arriving travellers arriving since 28th November, 2021.  Further, for in-country sequencing RT-PCR positive samples having CT-value of less than 25 are referred from sentinel sites in various states regularly.  The details of whole genome sequenced Omicron cases is given in Annexure-B.(d) & (e)	Government of India is supporting States in their endeavor to manage COVID-19 since the beginning of pandemic. Given the emergence of mutated variants with variable impact on transmissibility, virulence and effectiveness of vaccines, likelihood of resurgence of COVID-19 trajectory in the country is monitored by various expert committees under Indian Council of Medical Research, Directorate General of Health Services and other relevant Ministries/Departments. Union Ministry of  Health & Family Welfare continues to keep a close watch over COVID-19 situation across the country and globally.  Ministry of Health & Family Welfare vide letter dated 28th June, 2021 has circulated to all States/UTs guiding principles for imposition of restrictions or allowing relaxation in context of COVID-19 based on COVID-19 testing confirmation rates and hospital bed occupancy rates.  This has been reiterated by Ministry of Home Affairs under Disaster Management Act, 2005 vide order dated 29th June 2021.  ******
