ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	Locust is a transboundary pest but its attack in India is not a regular phenomenon. The recent locust attack of year 2019-20 was one of the biggest attacks in 26 years. However, there is no direct evidence to attribute the recent locust attack in the country due to climate change. (b)	and (c) The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has conducted climate change impact  analysis including changing monsoon pattern under National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) project. Variable impact of climate change has been projected on production of certain crops like rice, wheat, maize, groundnut, chickpea and potato. Attempts are being made under NICRA to develop heat & drought tolerant wheat, flood tolerant rice, drought tolerant pulses, water logging and high temperature tolerant tomato etc. The vulnerability assessment of Indian Agriculture to climate change is undertaken by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) to guide policy making on agricultural development in the country. ICAR along with state Agriculture Universities and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVK) has prepared District Agriculture Contingency Plans (DACP) for 650 districts, recommending location specific climate resilient crops and varieties and management practices for use by the state departments of agriculture and farmers. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) in collaboration with ICAR and Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA) issues weekly National Agromet Advisory Service (AAS) bulletin for the planners at central and State levels, farmers and other organisations for preparedness to cope up with ensuing weather conditions for better crop management throughout the season particularly during prolonged dry spell / poor rainfall situation.****
