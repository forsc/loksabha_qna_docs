The Government is actively engaged with the State Government in establishing systems that ensure provision of work as per demand. To generate awareness about the provisions of the Scheme and to provide adequate employment opportunities to rural households under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA, all States/UTs have been requested from time to time to (i) initiate appropriate Information Education and Communication (IEC) campaigns including wall paintings for wide dissemination of the provisions of the Act, (ii) expand scope and coverage of demand registration system to ensure that demand for work under MGNREGA does not go unregistered, (iii) prepare plans in a participatory mode and get them approved in the Gram Sabha, and (iv) prepare realistic labour budget.The details of central fund released, expenditure reported by States/UTs, number of completed works and total individuals worked under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS during the last five years are as under:S.No. Year      Central fund       Expenditure reported   Total number of    Total individuals                released           by States including    completed works    worked                 (Rs. in crore)     State share            (ln lakh)*         (in crore)*                                  (Rs. in crore)*	 	 1    2014-15	32,977.42	   35,709.78	             29.44	        6.222    2015-16	37,340.72	   44,002.59	             36.18	        7.223    2016-17	48,219.05	   58,062.92	             65.46	        7.664    2017-18	55,166.75	   63,649.48	             62.63	        7.595    2018-19	61,829.55	   69,618.37	             89.89	        7.77                                                                         *Source: www.nrega.nic.in (c):	No, Sir.

The Ministry releases funds to the States based on the agreed to Labour Budget, opening balance, pending liabilities of the previous year for the financial year, if any, and overall performance. Fund release to States/UTs is a continuous process and Central Government is committed to making funds available keeping in view the demand for work.(e)&(f):	As per the Schedule-I of the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA, water conservation is a permissible activity. The Mahatma Gandhi NREGA is a demand driven wage employment scheme. Hence, no work-wise allocation of funds is made. Mission Water Conservation Guidelines were drawn up in partnership with the then Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation and Department of Land Resources to focus on the dark and grey regions where the ground water was falling rapidly. It has been made mandatory for all States/UTs to spend 65% of total MGNREGS expenditure on NRM works identified in 2129 water stressed blocks.As per Management Information System (MIS), an expenditure of Rs.9053.48 crore has been incurred on water conservation and water harvesting works during the current FY 2019-20 (as on 14.11.2019) under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA.
