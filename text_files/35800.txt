ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ (SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL)(a) to (e) SVAMITVA Scheme aims to provide the ‘Record of Rights’ to village household owners possessing houses in un-surveyed inhabited areas in villages with issuance of legal ownership cards (Property cards/Title deeds). It helps in determination of clear ownership of property by mapping of land parcels using drone technology with the collaborative efforts of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, State Revenue Department, State Panchayati Raj Department and Survey of India. The Scheme facilitates monetisation of properties leading to ease of securing bank loans, reduction of property related disputes, comprehensive village level planning and providing a basis for assessment of property tax, which would accrue to the Gram Panchayats directly in States where it is devolved. The Scheme aims to cover all the villages across the country by 2025 with estimated cost of Rs. 566.23 crores. The State Governments can leverage the data/information generated through drone survey including the property cards in streamlining planning and collection of revenue in rural areas.***
