                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a)  Cleaning of rivers is a continuous process and Government of India is supplementing the efforts of the State Governments in addressing the challenges of pollution in river Ganga and its tributaries by providing financial and technical assistance under Namami Gange Programme. Under this Programme,a diverse set of interventionsfor cleaning and rejuvenation of river Ganga has been taken up including waste water treatment, solid waste management, river front management (ghat and crematoria development), maintaining continuous flow, rural sanitation, afforestation, biodiversity conservation and public participation, etc. Under the Namami Gange Programme, so far a total of 353 projects have been sanctioned at an estimated cost of Rs. 30,458 crore, out of which 178 projects have been completed and made operational. 157 sewerage infrastructure projects from among these have been taken up with a sanctioned cost of Rs. 24,249 crore for creation & rehabilitation of 4952 Million Litres per Day (MLD) of Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) capacity and laying of around 5212 KM sewerage network, out of which, 74 projects have been completed resulting in creation & rehabilitation of 1092 MLD of STP capacity and laying of 3752 KM sewerage network.As per Central Pollution Control Boards (CPCB’s) water quality median data for 2021(January to May), the observed water quality of river Ganga indicates that Dissolved Oxygen (DO) which is an indicator of river health, has been found to be within acceptable limits of notified primary bathing water quality criteria across all 84 monitoring locations. Other important river health indicators, i.e. Biochemical Oxygen Demand  (BOD)  and  Faecal  Coliform (FC), have also been found to be within acceptable limits of notified Contd…P/2//2//primary bathing water quality criteria across 68 monitoring locations (out of 84 locations) and 33 monitoring locations (out of 80 locations) respectively. As a result of multi sectoral interventions, the median values of these water quality parameters viz., Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Faecal Coliform (FC) have improved at 40 locations, 41 locations and 21 locations respectively in 2021 (January-May) as compared to 2014.(b) The allocation under the Namami Gange Programme from Financial Year (FY) 2014-15 onwards till 31st October 2021 is Rs.15,074.88 crore.The Government of India releases funds to National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) for the implementation of the river Ganga rejuvenation program. Thereafter, funds are released by NMCG for implementation of the said programme. From the financial year 2014-15 onwards till 31.10.2021, Government of India has released Rs.11,017.02 crore under the Namami Ganga Programme, which includes Rs.217.00 crore under Ghat works. NMCG has disbursed Rs.171.32 crore under Ghat works to States/ Executing agencies. (c) The Implementing and /or Executive Agencies render Utilization Certificates/ Interim Un-Audited Financial Reports, Monthly Expenditure Reports and other Reports from time to time. On the basis of these documents, the amount of funds utilized is being monitored by National Mission for Clean Ganga. Further, through Public Financial Management System (PFMS), the funds available with the Implementing and Executive Agencies can also be monitored. To ensure timely utilization of the funds by the States, NMCG has taken following steps:- (i)	National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) has constituted Budget Review Committee and Audit Review Committee. Fourteen joint meetings of these Committees have been held so far.(ii)	NMCG is ensuring that the fund demand is based on realistic assessment of expenditure linked to physical progress on the ground with a view to avoid unspent balances at the end of the financial years with the Executive and Implementing Agencies.(iii)	NMCG has also introduced a Monthly Expenditure Report (MER) from all State Programme Management Groups (SPMGs), wherein the expenditure incurred against the funds available including balance at the end of the month are provided on a regular monthly basis.(iv)	NMCG has put in place a robust mechanism for ensuring that the Utilization Certificates are rendered by SPMGs and other Executive Agencies on a quarterly basis for bringing a greater discipline in Financial and Budgetary management matters.(d)  61 projects (including one river front development project in Patna) have been sanctioned for construction of 210 ghats and 57 crematoria, out of which, 173 ghats and 45 crematoria have been completed.*****
