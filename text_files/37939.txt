Under the Act, CSR is a Board driven process and the Board of the company is empowered to plan, decide, execute and monitor CSR activities based on the recommendations of its CSR Committee. The CSR framework is disclosure based and CSR mandated companies are required to file details of CSR activities annually in the MCA21 registry. However, completion status of CSR projects or activities are not maintained separately by the Government. All data related to CSR filed by companies in MCA21 registry is available in public domain and can be accessed at www.csr.gov.in. The Government monitors the compliance of CSR provisions through the disclosures made by the companies in the MCA 21 registry. Whenever any violation of CSR provisions is reported, action against such non-compliant Companies is initiated as per provisions of the Act after due examination of records and following due process of law.On the basis of the filings made by the companies in the MCA21 registry, development sector-wise details of CSR spent by all the companies in the State of Bihar during last five Financial Years (FY) 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 are at Annexure. *******AnnexureANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 5208 FOR 04.04.2022  Development Sector-wise CSR Expenditure in Bihar (in Rs.
