Afterwards also there was a delay in the progress of monsoon further due to weakening of monsoon current, in view of formation of a cyclonic Storm ‘VAYU’ in the Arabian Sea.

During 2018-19 and 2019-20 (so far) Rs.500 crore and Rs.160 crore respectively have been released as CA under the Special Package. Central Government also supports construction of water harvesting and conservation works primarily through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) aided by PMKSY– Watershed Development Component and PMKSY– Per Drop More Crop.
