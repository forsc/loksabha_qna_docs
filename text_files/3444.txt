                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b)   The water quality in River Ganga has improved at various locations/stretch.Water quality of River Ganga is monitored at 94 locations in the 5 Ganga States i.e. Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal through the respective State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs).The observed water quality indicates that Dissolved Oxygen which is an indicator of river health has been found to be within acceptable limits of notified primary bathing water quality criteria and satisfactory to support the ecosystem of river across all seasons and also for almost entire stretch of river Ganga. Due to various pollution abatement initiatives taken by the Government under the Namami Gange Programme, the water quality assessment of river Ganga in 2018 has shown improved water quality trend as compared to 2017.Comparison of 2017 & 2018 River water quality data over the entire stretch of River with respect to parameters such as Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Faecal coliforms (FC) indicates the following:Contd…P/2//2//•	River water quality is assessed for outdoor primary water quality criteria for bathing in terms of pH (6.5-8.5), DO (>5mg/L), BOD (<3mg/L) and FC (<2500 MPN/100ml). •	The analysis of data for the year 2018 indicates that the DO (median) is meeting the primary water quality criteria for bathing (>5mg/L) at all the locations of River Ganga.Dissolved Oxygen level has improved at 35 locations  (3 in UK, 11 in UP, 17 in Bihar & 4 in WB).•	Median BOD is meeting the primary water quality criteria for bathing (<3mg/L) at all the locations of Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Bihar. BOD has improved at 41 locations (11 in UP, 23 in Bihar, 1 in Jharkhand & 6 in WB).•	Particularly in UP, the stretch from Kannauj Up stream (U/s) to Allahabad Down stream (D/s) and Mirzapur D/s to Ghazipur D/s is not meeting primary water quality criteria for bathing in terms of median BOD. In West Bengal, stretch from Serampore to Uluberia is not meeting the bathing norms.•	The median FC (<2500 MPN/100ml) is meeting the primary water quality criteria for bathing at all locations in Uttarakhand.•	In UP, FC (median) is meeting the primary water quality criteria for bathing from Garhmukteshwar to Kannauj U/s, Bithoor (Kanpur), U/s Mirzapur, D/s Mirzapur, and Varanasi U/s.•	The entire stretch of Bihar and West Bengal is not meeting the primary water quality criteria for bathing in terms of FC.•	FC has improved at total 29 locations (1 in UK, 10 in UP, 13 in Bihar, & 5 in WB).(c)   No action in this regard is required to be taken. River cleaning is a continuous process and under the Namami Gange Programme, several initiatives have been taken by Government of India. These are continuously monitored at highest levels to ensure that progress in project implementation does not suffer.*****
