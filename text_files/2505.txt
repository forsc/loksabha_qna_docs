Details of academic performanceduring the last three years and the current year are annexed.(c) and (d) : Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one JNV in each districtof the country.Opening of new JNVs is a continuous process which depends on thewillingness of the concerned State Government to make available requisite suitable land freeof cost for construction of the permanent building and making available required temporarybuilding, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However,actual sanction and opening of new JNV depends on availability of funds and approval by theCompetent Authority.One JNV each has been sanctioned in all the districts of the country (ason 31st May, 2014). The state of Tamil Nadu has not yet accepted the Navodaya VidyalayaScheme.(e) : NVS is providing continuous training to JNV teachers to upgrade their skills.
