ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a):  	No such information is available with the government.(b) & (c): 	Does not arise. However, the crop-wise details of procurement made farmers at MSP during 2017-18,  2018-19 and 2019-20 are at Annexure-I, Annexure-II, Annexure-III  and Annexure-IV.  For these procurement, farmers have been granted MSP for their produce.(d) :  	In order to ensure MSP to farmers an umbrella scheme of “Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan” (PM-AASHA), comprising Price Support Scheme (PSS), Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS), pilot of Private Procurement and Stockist Scheme (PPSS) and existing schemes of Department of Food & Public Distribution  and Ministry of Textiles is being implemented by the Government.  Contd…2/--2-Further, In order to optimize the use of scarce resources and mitigate the uncertainty in price and marketing, the Government has formulated and circulated a progressive and facilitative Model Act “The ----State/ UT Agricultural Produce & Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2018” in May, 2018 covering  the entire value and supply chain from pre-production to post harvest marketing including services contract for the agricultural produce and livestock. In order to provide better marketing facilities to the farmers, the Government has circulated a new model “The Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2017” in April 2017 for its adoption by States/ UTs. The model act provides for alternative marketing channels such as setting up of private markets, direct marketing, farmer-consumer markets, special commodity markets, to facilitate farmers in marketing their produce at competitive & remunerative prices. In order to provide better marketing facilities for farmers, the Government is implementing National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) scheme for transparent price discovery for remunerative prices for the farmers for their produce through competitive online bidding system. Government is also promoting scientific storage facilities in rural areas of the country through the scheme of “Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI)”, which is a sub-scheme under the Integrated Scheme for Agricultural Marketing (ISAM).  Assistance under the sub-scheme is available to Individual, Group of farmers/growers, Registered Farmer Produce Organizations (FPOs) etc. Government in association with concerned State Government is promoting Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) to enable them to reach economy of scale and better access to markets for better realization of prices.  The purpose of the FPO is to collectivize farmers, especially small producers, at various levels across several states, so as to foster technology penetration, improve productivity, enable improved access to inputs and services and increase farmer incomes, thereby strengthening their sustainable agriculture based livelihoods. In order to provide better marketing facilities to the farmers to sell their produce directly to consumer & bulk purchaser, the Government has approved Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund (AMIF) with a corpus of Rs. 2000 crore for developing and upgrading agricultural marketing infrastructure in  Gramin Haats and 585 Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Markets.
