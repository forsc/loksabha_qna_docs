ANSWER




                                                        (a)&(b)	The Government of India does not maintain data on Indian citizens going abroad for migration. Many countries do not share data, including with Indian Missions abroad, on the number of migrants of Indian origin in their respective countries, citing data privacy and other laws.	The Bureau of Immigration, Government of India, records the number of Indians who had gone abroad for employment.  The data for the last three years is as follows:<pre>YearNo of Indians Departed on Employment Visa201734,72,494201828,10,789201925,43,577</pre>(c) 	Government of India rules do not permit dual citizenship. Section 9 of the Citizenship Act 1955 states that "Any citizen of India who by naturalization, registration or otherwise, voluntarily acquires or acquired the citizenship of another country, shall upon such acquisition cease to be a citizen of India." ***
