                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.  STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. 69 BY SHRI RAMDAS C. TADAS TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 26.06.2019 REGARDING CONSTRUCTION OF RAILWAY FLYOVERS(a) to (c):  Road over Bridges (ROBs) in lieu of Level Crossings (LCs) are being constructed on cost sharing basis.Normally, Railway undertakes construction of Road Over Bridges (ROBs) /Road Under Bridges (RUBs) in Railway portion whereas approaches are being constructed by State Govt. Generally, there is no problem of construction of ROBs/RUBs in Railway portion. However, construction of ROBs/RUBs on approaches depends upon many factors such as availability of land, removal of encroachments, fixing the alignment of approaches, allocation of requisite funds etc. for which active involvement of the State Government is necessary.Since progress of ROBs in lieu of LCs mainly depends on active involvement of the State Government for the approaches, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed on 28.12.2017 between Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and Government of Maharashtra for construction of ROBs in the State of Maharashtra. All these ROBs will be constructed by Government of Maharashtra on Single entity basis.As per MoU, two ROBs i.e. Phulgaon ROB, Sindi (not Seedhi) ROB are being done by Government of Maharashtra on single entity basis (including Railway portion). Wardha ROB is being widened by Government of Maharashtra at their cost and work is being executed by them including Railway portion.Since these works are being executed by the Government of Maharashtra, therefore their completion depends upon Government of Maharashtra. However Ministry of Railways shall pursue all such cases with all State Governments.*****
