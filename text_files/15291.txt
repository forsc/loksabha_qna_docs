In this mission, critical technologies such as autonomous navigation, guidance & control and reusable thermal protection system have been successfully demonstrated.(b)	Yes, Sir. RLV is designed for orbital re-entry and autonomous runway landing. This will be demonstrated in the orbital re-entry experimental flight, wherein an Orbital Re-entry Demonstration Vehicle will be boosted to orbit using existing propulsion systems followed by re-entry & landing.(c)	&(d)The Development of Reusable Launch Vehicle is a technical challenge and it involves development of many cutting edge technologies. A series of technology demonstration missions would be required before it is made operational.
