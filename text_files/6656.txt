An additional 50 days of wage employment is provided over and above 100 days in the notified drought affected areas or natural calamity areas in the country on recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare. The Ministry also mandates the provision of additional 50 days of wage employment to every Scheduled Tribe Household in a forest area, provided that these households have no other private property except for the land rights provided under the Forest Rights Act, 2006.  (b)&(c):	As per the information shared by State Government of Kerala, Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is implemented in all 14 districts of Kerala. Till date, 35.97 lakh households are registered under the Scheme, out of which 19.41 lakh households are active workers. During the current FY 2019-20 (as on 13.11.2019), 14.28 lakh individuals from 12.66 lakh households have received employment under the Scheme and 421.66 lakh persondays have been generated under the Scheme during the period. District-wise details of beneficiaries under the Scheme are given at Annexure.(d):	National Level Monitors and officers of the Ministry visit States at regular interval to review implementation of the programme. After the field visits, the findings/shortcomings and recommendations are shared with the States for appropriate action at their end. Performance Review Committee meetings of the Ministry, Common Review Missions and regular video conferencing on specific issues are also important tools of Monitoring. The State has also initiated the process of appointment of Ombudspersons and State Quality Monitors for the purpose.(e):	The State Government of Kerala is utilizing the potential of community-based organisations and women self-help groups in the implementation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS. Kudumbashree, the community-based, organisation formed by the State Government of Kerala has played a key role in mobilizing people of rural areas for participating in the Scheme. Presently, Kudumbashree Area Development Society Executive Committee Members also act as Mates under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS.
