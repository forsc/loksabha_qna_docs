ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                         (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) to (c):	Urban transport, which is an integral part of urban development, is a State subject. Hence, respective state governments/ULBs are responsible for planning and development of urban mass transport infrastructure including metro rail.   The Central Government considers financial assistance for metro rail proposals in cities or urban agglomerates, on the basis of the feasibility of the proposal and availability of resources, as and when posed by the concerned state governments. Metro rail, an electricity based mass transit system is efficient, fast, safe and comfortable mode of public transport.  In August, 2017, Government of India has issued Metro Rail Policy- 2017 which focuses on systematic planning and implementation of metro rail systems and enhancing the feasibility of metro rail projects from economic, social and environmental perspective. The policy is a guide to state governments for preparing comprehensive proposals for metro rail project. The policy also enables innovative financing of metro rail projects through Transit Oriented Development (TOD), Value Capture Finance (VCF) and Public Private Partnership. As per Metro Rail Policy, every proposal for metro rail should necessarily include proposals for feeder systems that help to enlarge the catchment area of each metro station at least to 5 kms. Provision of last mile connectivity through pedestrian pathways, Non-Motorized Transport (NMT) infrastructure, and induction of facilities for para transit modes will also be essential requirements for availing any central financial assistance. These measures would help in providing hassle-free travel and last mile connectivity to commuters.Government of India has provided central assistance for implementation of metro rail projects across the country. At present, about 657 kms of metro rail network is operational in various cities viz. Delhi & NCR, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Kolkata Chennai, Jaipur, Kochi, Lucknow, Mumbai, Gurugram, Noida, Greater Noida, Ahmedabad and Nagpur. About 873 kms of metro rail and Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) is under implementation in various cities.The capital cost of Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) depends upon the type of the system viz. Bus Rapid Transport System (BRTS), Light Rail Transit (LRT), Articulated Bus, Trams, Metro Rail etc. High capacity metro rail system is cost intensive and suitable for cities with high projection of ridership. Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs on 15.07.2019 has issued standard specifications of Light Urban Rail Transits System named “Metrolite”, suitable for cities with lower projection of ridership. The capital and operation and maintenance cost of Metrolite is expected to be much less than those of high capacity metro rail system. Cities aspiring to have rail based mass transit system may adopt “Metrolite” as prime mode of mass transit system. (d):	No Sir.(e):  	Does not arise.                    *****
