ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI  R.K. SINGH)(a) to (d): Yes Sir,  Saubhagya has succeeded in universal electrification in the country including Assam, Bihar and Maharashtra. As reported by the States, 2.817 crore households (including Assam, Bihar and Maharashtra) have been electrified since the launch of Saubhagya, up to 31.03.2021. Though, Kerala had achieved 100% electrification before the launch of Saubhagya, it was affected by a cyclone during August, 2018 and hence the re-electrification of households was also approved by the Ministry. The State-wise  details  of  household   electrification  under Saubhagya are at Annexure I. State/UT-wise details of sanctioned cost and funds released including those in Assam, Bihar, Maharashtra and Kerala are at Annexure-II.(e):	Rural electrification not only involves electrification of un-electrified villages and households, but also, strengthening & augmentation of sub-transmission and distribution infrastructure, to improve the quality and reliability of power supply. Though, the Saubhagya scheme was completed on 31.03.2019, ensuring 24x7 access, quality and reliability of supply are important aspects to meet the expectations of people at large. Deendayal Upadhaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) is an integrated scheme covering all aspects of electrification, as stated above and hence was continued to meet the goals of the power sector.
