                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (SMT. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) Cancer patients are getting treatment at various health facilities in the health care delivery system including Medical Colleges, Central Institutes like AIIMS and private sector hospitals. Relevant data related to patients, including cancer patients, registered and under treatment, is maintained by the Institutions and Hospitals concerned at their own level.(b), (c) and (d) Presently, there is no evidence to suggest that the impact of missed or late diagnosis of cancer is higher in rural India than urban IndiaThe three most commonly occurring cancers in India are those of the breast, uterine cervix and oral. In all these 3 types of cancer, early screening and detection can significantly reduce the mortality.Keeping this fact in view, a population based screening initiative has been rolled out in the country under National Health Mission (NHM), as a part of Comprehensive Primary Health Care under Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres. Under the initiative, persons more than 30 years of age are targeted for their screening for these three types of cancers. Early detection of cases of these three types of cancer will be facilitated through the population based screening.(e) Cancer patients are getting treatment at various health facilities in the health care delivery system including Medical Colleges, Central Institutes like AIIMS and private sector hospitals. Relevant data related to patients, including cancer patients, registered and under treatment, is maintained by the Institutions and Hospitals concerned at their own level.
