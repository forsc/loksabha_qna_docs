(b) and (c): 	Government of India has not stopped paddy procurement at Minimum Support Price from any State. Paddy procurement during Kharif Marketing Season 2021-22 (kharif crop) has commenced from October 2021 and till 08.12.2021, 326.00 LMT paddy has been procured in central pool.  ..........2/--2-(d) and (e): 	The estimates for procurement of Paddy (in terms rice) and wheat  are finalized by Government of India in consultation with State Governments and Food Corporation of India, before the commencement of each marketing season based upon estimated production, marketable surplus and agricultural crop pattern. 	Procurement in a State depends not only upon production but also upon other multiple factors like marketable surplus, MSP, prevailing market rate, demand & supply situation and participation of private traders etc.State Government agencies and Food Corporation of India (FCI) purchase wheat & paddy with prescribed FAQ specifications at MSP   for Central Pool to ensure that farmers get remunerative prices for their produce and do not have to resort to distress sale. . However, if producer/farmer gets better price in comparison to MSP, they are free to sell their produce in open market. Due to various steps taken by the Government, procurement of paddy at MSP in central pool has increased significantly in last few years.  **** ANNEXURE-1ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN PART (a) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.2967 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 15.12.2021 IN THE LOK SABHA.STATEMENT SHOWING STATE WISE PADDY PROCUREMENT 										Fig. in LMTSTATES	KMS 2011-12	KMS 2012-13	KMS 2013-14	KMS 2014-15	KMS 2015-16	KMS 2016-17	KMS 2017-18	KMS 2018-19	KMS 2019-20	KMS 2020-21ANDHRA PRADESH 	21.23	14.31	0.72	42.19	64.72	55.59	59.70	71.73	82.58	84.57TELANGANA			24.54	24.32	23.57	53.67	54.00	77.46	111.26	141.09ASSAM	0.34	0.28	0.00	0.23	0.63	0.69	0.53	1.53	3.15	2.12BIHAR	22.87	19.45	14.07	24.09	18.26	18.42	11.84	14.16	20.02	35.59CHANDIGARH	0.19	0.18	0.17	0.15	0.24	0.19	0.21	0.19	0.22	0.28CHHATISGARH	59.71	71.36	63.96	51.08	51.37	60.03	47.87	58.40	74.86	69.74GUJARAT	0.05	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.01	0.01	0.01	0.14	0.21	1.10HARYANA	29.66	38.54	35.87	30.07	42.70	53.48	59.58	58.83	64.28	56.55HIMACHAL PRADESH 	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00JHARKHAND	4.11	3.21	0.00	0.09	3.03	2.07	2.14	2.28	3.80	6.29JAMMU & KASHMIR	0.02	0.04	0.00	0.00	0.10	0.12	0.19	0.14	0.15	0.38KARNATAKA	2.29	0.00	0.00	1.31	0.81	0.00	0.00	0.88	0.61	2.06KERALA	5.61	3.59	5.36	5.50	5.62	4.53	4.84	6.94	7.10	7.65MADHYA PRADESH	9.40	13.40	15.59	12.04	12.67	19.61	16.35	20.82	25.97	37.27MAHARASHTRA	2.60	2.86	2.40	2.97	3.43	4.61	2.67	8.66	17.42	18.85ODISHA	42.10	53.50	41.75	50.09	50.29	54.18	49.06	65.41	70.57	77.33PUNJAB	115.39	127.73	120.98	116.21	139.56	164.96	176.70	169.16	162.33	202.82RAJASTHAN	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00NEF (Tripura)	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.10	0.21	0.24TAMIL NADU	23.82	7.18	10.20	15.69	17.79	2.11	14.62	19.03	32.41	44.90UTTAR PRADESH	23.24	17.80	9.07	18.18	43.43	35.14	42.90	48.25	56.57	66.84UTTRAKHAND	0.19	0.32	0.47	6.12	8.93	10.54	0.57	6.89	10.18	10.72WEST BENGAL	14.43	14.32	10.62	22.86	23.06	28.28	24.60	29.11	27.03	27.79TOTAL	377.24	388.05	355.78	423.19	510.22	568.23	568.38	660.11	770.93	894.18*****
