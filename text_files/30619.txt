The recruitment of Anganwadi Workers is undertaken by the concerned State Government/ UT Administration.

Anganwadi Workers at main AWCs are paid an honorarium of ? 4,500/- per month; AWWs at mini- AWCs ?3,500/- per month and AWHs are paid ?2,250/- per month.  Also, performance linked incentive of ? 250/- per month paid to AWHs and @ ? 500/- per month to AWWs.
