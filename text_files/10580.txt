ANSWER




                                                        (a)	 to (d) ‘Land’ and ‘Colonization’ are State subjects.  The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs does not maintain any records of residential societies.  Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has enacted  the  Real  Estate  (Regulation and Development) Act,  2016 (RERA) to protect the interests of homebuyers. As per Section 20 of the Act, the ‘Appropriate Government’ i.e. States/ Union Territories (UTs) are required to establish the Real Estate Regulatory Authority to regulate and develop the real estate sector in the concerned State/UT.  Section 34 of RERA also enables the Real Estate Regulatory Authority to maintain a database, on its website, for public viewing, and enter the names and photographs of the defaulting promoters, or the promoters who have been penalised under the Act, with reasons thereof, and the details of the projects for which registration has been revoked.                                  ******
