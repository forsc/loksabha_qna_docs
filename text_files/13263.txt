ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS(DR. SUBRAHMANYAM JAISHANKAR)(a) to (c)	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.***STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (A) TO (C) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.*199 REGARDING PASSPORT OFFICE IN AGRA TO BE ANSWERED ON 04.03.2020(a) & (b)	The current Post Office Passport Seva Kendra (POPSK) functioning in Agra is under the administrative jurisdiction of Passport Office, Ghaziabad. There are already 36 Passport Offices (including three in Uttar Pradesh at Bareilly, Ghaziabad and Lucknow) functioning in the country that cover some of the places mentioned in the question. There is therefore no administrative necessity to create an additional PO in Agra.  The opening of Passport Kendras in the country is an on-going activity and depends on various factors, including distance from the existing Passport Kendras and volume of applications from a particular region. At present, there are POPSKs functioning at Aligarh, Bharatpur, Gwalior, Hathras, and Mathura (Vrindavan) and Achnera in the region to render passport services. As on 28 February, 2020, there are 517 Passport Kendras operational in the country (including 54 in Uttar Pradesh) as extended arms of these 36 Passport Offices. The list is at Annexure-I. (c)	Does not arise.***
