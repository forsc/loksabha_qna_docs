ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (FINANCE)(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a)   to (d): The Government of India had announced AatmaNirbhar Bharat Packages (ANB) 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 on 13th  May, 2020 to 17th  May, 2020,  12th  October, 2020  and 12th November 2020 respectively with the objective of fighting COVID-19 and to make the country self-reliant. Total financial impact of ANB including measures taken by RBI was estimated to about Rs. 27.1 lakh crore, which amounts to more than 13% of GDP.  Besides, a Rs.1.70 Lakh Crore relief package under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) was also announced on 26.03.2020 to help the poor in the battle against Corona Virus.  It inter-alia comprised of schemes like (a) release of Rs. 1000/- each to 3 crore aged widows and people in Divyang category (b) Additional allocation of food grain @ 5 kg per person per month & 1 Kg pulse free of cost to every family covered under the targeted public distribution system (c) free of cost gas cylinders to Ujjwala beneficiaries (d) Ex-gratia   payment of Rs.500 per month for three months to 20.40 crore (approx) PMJDY women account-holders (e) Comprehensive Insurance Scheme for health workers (g) Release of 24% of the monthly wages into PF accounts of wage-earners, earning below Rs. 15,000 per month, in businesses having less than 100 workers, for three months.  A statement indicating financial stimulus given by the US, China, Russia, Germany, France, Britain, Brazil and South Africa and their monetary component is at Annexure-I. (e) & (f):   The stimulus provided by the Government has led to a V-shaped recovery of the economy, resulting in a smaller contraction of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 7.3% in the second quarter and positive GDP growth of 0.4% in the third quarter of FY 2020-21 as in Annexure-II. Additional stimulus in advanced economies (AEs) will have favourable spill- overs to trading partners and capital flow spill-overs to emerging market economies (EMEs) including India as business sentiment improves and risk appetite intensifies.*****
