                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE                                           (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)  (a) to (e):  A statement is laid on the Table of the House STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 108* FOR 28TH JUNE, 2019(a)	The present status of Community Health Centres (CHCs) and Primary Health Centres (PHCs), State/UT-wise including Chandigarh and Punjab, as per data uploaded by States/UTs on Health Management Information System (HMIS) portal, as on May 2019, is placed at Annexure-I.(b)	Public health and hospitals being a State subject, the primary responsibility of improving the infrastructure and other facilities including opening of new CHCs and PHCs and support for engagement of health human resource to ensure availability of qualified doctors and other health workers,  lies with respective State/UT Governments. However, under National Health Mission, technical and financial support is provided to States/UTs including Punjab for strengthening their healthcare system in the form of Record of Proceeding(RoPs) based on the proposals submitted by the States in their Program Implementation Plans (PIPs).  The details of RoPs of the States/UTs including Punjab are available in the public domain and accessible at  https://nhm.gov.in/index4.php?lang=1&level=0&linkid=449&lid=53.The details of funds approved during the last three years from 2016-17 to 2018-19 for Hospital Strengthening that includes new construction/renovation of PHCs and CHCs is given at Annexures-II & III.  The funds for all approved activities are released as lumpsum.(c)   Public health and hospitals is a State subject. Shortage of Doctors/nurses in public health sector varies from State to State depending upon their policies and context. However, as per Rural Health Statistics (RHS) 2018, there is a shortage of doctors and nursing staff in public health facilities and State/UT-wise availability/shortage of doctors and nursing staff is shown at Annexure-IV to IX. Further, as stated above, Public health and hospitals being a State subject, the primary responsibility to ensure the availability of qualified doctors and other health workers lies with the State/UT Governments. However, under the National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their healthcare systems including support for engagement of health human resources, based on the requirements proposed by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs). The Government has taken various steps to ensure the availability of medical staff including specialists, doctors and other paramedical staff especially in the rural/remote areas. These efforts include:(i)	Providing support to the States for hard area allowance and providing residential quarters for serving in rural and remote areas. (ii)	The States are encouraged to adopt flexible norms for engaging specialists at public health facilities. These include various mechanisms for ‘contracting in’ and ‘contracting out’ of specialist services, providing desired remunerations to the specialist under “You Quote, We Pay” initiatives, empanelling private medical facilities to provide requisite Specialists etc.(iii)	The States are advised to put in place transparent policies of posting & transfer and ensure rational deployment of doctors. Further, the states are also impressed upon from time to time to fill up the vacant posts.In addition to the above initiatives under NHM, government has also taken other remedial steps to   increase the number of Doctors and Specialists. Details are as given below: •	The ratio of teachers to students has been revised from 1:1 to 1:2 for all MD/MS disciplines and 1:1 to 1:3 in subjects of Anesthesiology, Forensic Medicine, Radiotherapy, Medical Oncology, Surgical Oncology and Psychiatry in all medical colleges across the country. Further, teacher: student ratio in public funded Government Medical Colleges for Professor in MD/MS courses has been increased from 1:2 to 1:3 in all clinical subjects and for Associate Prof. from 1:1 to 1:2 if the Associate Prof. is a unit head. This would result in increase in number of specialists in the country.•	DNB qualification has been recognized for appointment as faculty to take care of shortage of faculty.•	Enhancement of maximum intake capacity at MBBS level from 150 to 250.•	Enhancement of age limit for appointment/ extension/ re-employment against posts of teachers/dean/principal/ director in medical colleges upto 70 years.•	Relaxation in the norms of setting up of Medical College in terms of requirement for land, faculty, staff, bed/bed strength and other infrastructure.•	Strengthening /upgradation of State Government Medical Colleges for starting new PG courses/Increase of PG seats.•	Strengthening/ upgradation of existing State Government/Central Government Medical Colleges to increase MBBS seats.•	Requirement of land for establishment of medical college in metropolitan cities as notified under Article 243P(c) of the Constitution of India has been dispensed with.•	Establishment of New Medical Colleges by upgrading district/referral hospitals preferably in underserved districts of the country. Under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme “Establishment of New Medical Colleges by upgrading district/referral hospitals” with fund sharing between the central government and State in the ratio of 90:10 for NE/Special Category States and 60:40 for other States, a total of 82 districts in 21 States and UTs have been identified and approved to establish new Medical Colleges. Out these, 39 have become functional. •	Cabinet has approved setting up of 15 more new AIIMS in addition to 06 AIIMS sanctioned earlier under Phase I of PMSSY.(d) & (e) There is no such proposal to upgrade and get all the CHCs/PHCs as ISO certified wellness centres.

Under Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWC), Comprehensive Primary Healthcare is to be provided which includes promotive, preventive, curative, palliative and rehabilitative services.
