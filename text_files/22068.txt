ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c)	Under the Skill India Mission, in respect of the schemes including the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme being implemented by the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, there is no provision for loans for self employment. However, under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), there is a mandatory provision for training under 155 hours of an English, Employability & Entrepreneurship (EEE) module, besides the core curriculum of the course, to inculcate entrepreneurship skills in the candidates for establishing business. Further, Training Providers under the Scheme provide support to the candidates for entrepreneurship development by facilitating bank linkages along with providing guidance and mentoring support. As on 19.01.2021, around 2.77 lakh candidates have been self-employed across the country under the scheme. Besides, PMKVY has been linked up with the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) for availing loan by trained candidates for setting up of small/ micro enterprises for which Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras act as Hand Holding Agencies for PMMY loans on the Udyamimitra Portal.
