                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW & JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS  &  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a)	to (f):  A statement is laid on the Table of the House.*** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN  REPLY TO PARTS (a)  TO (f) OF  LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 258  FOR 11TH MARCH, 2020.(a)to(d): The Government proposes to engage two number of Professional Consultants for monitoring the scheme for setting up of  1023  Fast Track  Special Courts (FTSC) across the country. These Consultants should be Law Graduates, having good analytical and communications skills with 5-8 years experience in the legal field for the position of Sr. Consultant, and 3-5 years experience for the position of Consultant.  The proposed remuneration per month is in the range of Rs.1, 00,000 - 1, 25,000 for Sr. Consultant and Rs. 80,000-1, 00,000 for the position of Consultant.  The term of Consultants will be co-terminus with the scheme of FTSC.  The advertisement for these positions was published through DAVP in newspapers on 13.02.2020 followed by uploading on  the website of Department of Justice. Applications were to be received online upto 5th March 2020.  After following all laid down codal formalities, these two consultants would be  engaged.For  proper planning, coordination and monitoring of the above scheme, these two Consultants would undertake regular activities  for obtaining data in prescribed formats from concerned High Courts, compile, analyze and evaluate them besides making various reports and appraisals  recommending  areas needing interventions; conduct inspections; organizing training and outreach campaign etc.(e): The proposal of Union of India for setting up of 1800 Fast Track Courts (FTCs) during 2015-2020 for dealing specific natured cases of heinous nature, women, children, senior citizens, other vulnerable sections of society and civil cases pending for 5 years had been endorsed by the 14th Finance Commission. The Commission had urged State Governments to utilize enhanced fiscal space available through tax devolution (32% to 42%) for the above. Union Government has also asked states to set up requisite number of FTCs. There are 828 numbers of such FTCs functioning in the country as on 31st Dec, 2019 as per information received from High Courts.In furtherance of The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018, taking special efforts, the Union Government has finalized a new scheme of FTSC for speedy trial and disposal of cases related to rape and POCSO act and communicated state Governments and Union Territory administrations to open up FTSCs including exclusive POCSO courts in Sep 2019.  After receipt of consent from the State Governments/ UTs, first installment of central share of funds have so far been released to 27 States/UTs for setting up of 649 FTSCs including 363 exclusive POCSO courts. As per information received from High Courts, 195 such courts have been established, the details of which are given at Annexure-1.(f):	Disposal of cases in courts is within the domain of the judiciary. The Union Government is committed to speedy disposal of cases and reduction in pendency of cases. The National Mission for Justice Delivery and Legal Reforms has adopted many strategic initiatives, including improving infrastructure [court halls and residential units] for Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Courts, leveraging Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for better justice delivery, filling up of vacant positions of Judges in High Courts and Supreme Court, reduction in pendency through follow up by Arrears Committees at District, High Court and Supreme Court level, emphasis on Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) and initiatives to fast track special type of cases.  However, timely disposal of cases in courts also depends on several other factors which, inter-alia, include availability of adequate number of judges, supporting court staff and physical infrastructure, nature of evidence, co-operation of stake holders viz. bar, investigation agencies, witnesses and litigants and proper application of rules and procedures to monitor, track and bunch cases for hearing.       The central government has enacted The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018 making the punishment for offences like rape more stringent by including death penalty for rape of a girl below the age of 12 years. The Act also, inter-alia, mandates completion of investigation and trials within 2 months each. Further, in order to ensure that the amendments in law effectively translate at ground level, and to enhance women safety in the country, the Government has undertaken a number of measures for implementation. These include an online analytic tool for police launched on 19th February 2019 called “Investigation Tracking System for Sexual Offences” to monitor and track time-bound investigation in sexual assault cases in accordance with Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2018; launch of National Database on Sexual Offenders (NDSO) on 20th September 2018 to facilitate investigation and tracking of sexual offenders across the country by law enforcement agencies; sanction of Safe City Projects in phase-I in 8 cities (Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow and Mumbai) under Nirbhaya Fund for using technology to aid smart policing and safety management; and steps taken to improve investigation by strengthening DNA analysis units in Central and State Forensic Science Laboratories, which includes setting up of a State-of-the-Art DNA Analysis Unit in Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Chandigarh. Guidelines have been notified for collection of forensic evidence in sexual assault cases and the standard composition in a sexual assault evidence collection kit. For building adequate capacity in manpower, training and skill building programs for Investigation Officers, Prosecution Officers and Medical Officers have commenced.***Annexure-1State wise details of No. of Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) established for Women and Girl children under the Scheme of FTSCs (January 2020)States 	No. of FTSCsMadhya  Pradesh	56Chhattisgarh 	15Delhi	16Tripura	03Jharkhand	22Rajasthan	26Telangana	09Gujarat	34Tamil Nadu	14Total	195
