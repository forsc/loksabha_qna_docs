                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) & (b) :  No ‘Women Grievance Redressal Cells’ have been set up by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India in the country, specially in the rural areas to check harassment of women in the country.  However, Government of India attaches top priority to the Public Grievances and their redressal. An effective grievance redressal mechanism has been established in the Ministry and the disposal of grievances received in the Ministry is monitored regularly.  Further, the Government of India has approved One Stop Centres scheme for setting up One Stop Centres for violence affected women in the districts across the country.  To address the complaints of aggrieved women, the Scheme of One Stop Centre is to provide for a range of services for violence affected women including police facilitation, legal counselling, psycho-social counselling, medical aid and temporary shelter in an integrated manner under one roof.  Under the scheme, OSCs are required to have a centre administrator, case workers, medical personnel, police facilitation officer, psycho-social counsellor, legal counsellor, security guard, IT staff and multi-purpose workers.  As on date, 728 OSCs have been approved to be set up in 724 districts and so far 595 OSCs are operational.  In addition, Women Helplines are operational in 32 States/UTs for 24 hours emergency and non-emergency response to women affected by violence through referral (linking with appropriate authority such as police, One Stop Centre, hospital).  So far, 2.27 lakh (approx) and 38.62 lakh (approx) women have been assisted by One Stop Centres and Women Helplines respectively. *****
