ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d):	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF PARTS (a) to (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 324 TO BE ANSWERED ON 16/07/2019 REGARDING “FERTILITY OF SOIL”(a)	As such there is no harmful effect of fertilizers on soil fertility if applied in a balanced and judicious manner. The average rate of consumption of chemical fertilizers in the country is only around 134 kg/ha. The fertility of soil is being lost in certain situations mainly due to the imbalanced use of chemical fertilizers coupled with low use of organic manures.(b) & (c):	Yes, Sir.  The study conducted by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) under All India Coordinated Research Project on ‘Long-Term Fertilizer Experiments’ in the Centres located in different States on various soil types (fixed locations) under dominant cropping systems revealed that the balanced use of chemical fertilizers do not lead to the loss of soil fertility. In fact, the balanced and judicious use of chemical fertilizers help in full expression of applied nutrients. Application of only Nitrogen or more Nitrogen as compared to Phosphorus and Potassium also lead to loss of soil fertility and crop productivity.(d)	The Government has launched a National Mission on Soil Health Card to provide soil test based fertilizer recommendations to all the farmers in the country. Besides, the Government under Integrated Nutrient Management component of National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) is promoting soil test based judicious use of chemical fertilizers through conjunctive use of both inorganic and organic sources (manure, biofertilizers etc.) of plant nutrients. In addition, split application and placement of fertilizers, use of slow releasing N-fertilizers and nitrification inhibitors including neem coated urea, growing leguminous crops and use of Resource Conservation Technologies (RCTs) are also recommended. The ICAR also imparts training, organizes front-line demonstrations etc. to educate farmers on all these aspects.* * * * * * * *
