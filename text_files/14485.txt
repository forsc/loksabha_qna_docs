In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes/programmes such as Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) under PMKSY (Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana). Central Water Commission maintains  National Register of Large Dam (NRLD) , a compilation of the large dams in the country prepared as per information received from the State Government / Authority concerned at http://cwc.gov.in/sites/default/files/nrld06042019.pdf.

Funding mechanism through NABARD has been approved by the Government for both Central and State Share. Details of State and Project wise funds allocated are given at http://pmksy-mowr.nic.in/aibp-mis/ReleaseOrder-Reports.aspx. No Project of Tamil Nadu is  part of the above.
