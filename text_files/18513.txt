                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a):	Ministry of AYUSH has implemented a Central Sector Scheme of Pharmacovigilance of Ayurvedic, Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathic (ASU&H) drugs since December, 2017.  Through this scheme, a network of National Pharmacovigilance Centre, five Intermediary system-wise PharmacovigilanceCentres and sixty three Peripheral PharmacovigilanceCentres has been established and made functional since August 2018 to inculcate the culture of reporting Adverse Drug Events and misleading advertisements of ASU&H drugs for regulatory action. Eleven more Peripheral Centres have recently been added to the network. All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA), New Delhi is designated as the National Pharmacovigilance Coordination Centre (NPvCC) with five National AYUSH institutes as Intermediary Pharmacovigilance Centres (IPvCs) and seventy four Peripheral Pharmacovigilance Centres (PPvCs) distributed across the country. Project Appraisal Committee and Project Sanctioning Committee are set up under the scheme to consider the proposals related to pharmacovigilance activities and surveillance of misleading advertisements. Signal Detection Committee and Causality Assessment Committee are constituted under the pharmacovigilance scheme to analyze the adverse effects data of ASU&H medicines reported from different centres and make recommendations, if any regulatory action is required. The pharmacovigilance centres have reported ASU&H drugs related 8203 cases of misleading advertisements and 463 cases of suspected Adverse Drug Events (186 from Ayurveda drugs, 70 from Siddha drugs, 151 from  Unani drugs and 56 from Homoeopathic drugs)   up to August, 2020. (b) & (c): Yes, the Ministry of AYUSH has implemented a central Sector Scheme for promotion of Information, Education and Communication (IEC) in AYUSH. Through this scheme, Ayush health fairs are organizedat State and National level;and multimedia campaigns, preparation and distribution of publicity material including audio visual materials aresupported. Financial assistance for organizing seminars, conferences etc is also provided to eligible organizations. Incentive is provided to Ayush industry for participating in Arogya fairs and health exhibitions. Presently, optimal utilization of electronic and digital platforms is also being done for promoting and propagating AYUSH systems. Ministry of AYUSH has its own social media presence with a lot of followers.Research Councils and National Institutes under the Ministry of AYUSH are also very active on social media platforms. MyGov.in - a online platform of Government of India is also widely used to propagate and promote various initiatives of the Ministry. Promotional efforts of Ministry of AYUSH are multifaceted to extend the outreach of Ayush system by organizing quiz contests, blogging, podcasting, webinars, video-conferences, weekly publication of digital newsletters and repurposing of the activities of Research Councils and National Institutes in campaign mode. As a result of aforesaid IEC activities visibility, acceptability and accessibility of Ayush health services has enhanced, health seeking behavior of the people changed towards Ayush and viewership & readership increased. (d):	Government of India has adopted a strategy of co-locating AYUSH facilities at Primary Health Centres (PHCs), Community Health Centres (CHCs) and District Hospitals (DHs), thus enabling choice to the patients  for availing treatment of different systems of medicine under same roof.    Engagement of AYUSH Doctors/ paramedics in these health centres and their training is supported by the Department of Health & Family Welfare through National Health Mission, whereas the support for infrastructure, equipment / furniture and medicines is provided to the States/UTs by the Ministry of AYUSH through Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National AYUSH Mission (NAM).
