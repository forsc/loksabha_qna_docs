ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS [SHRI KIREN RIJIJU]  (a) & (b) The Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports has not declared any sport discipline as National Sport. However, while the responsibility for promotion of sports, including hockey, rests with State/Union Territory Governments and concerned National Sports Federations, the Central Government is supplementing their efforts by providing expert training and coaching facilities and assisting Hockey India, which is the recognized National Sports Federation (NSF) for Hockey. The Central Government recognizes the importance of the sport of hockey in India, its popularity among the masses and medal prospects of India in various international events etc. Keeping these facts in view, the Ministry has placed the sport of hockey in the ‘High Priority’ category so that it gets maximum admissible amount of assistance under the Scheme of Assistance to the NSFs. Further, Hockey has featured in all three editions of Khelo India Youth Games and First Khelo India University Games, 2020. ****
