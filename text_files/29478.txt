ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS   (SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a)   In October, 2021, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has approved the proposal for development of ''PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (NMP)'' for providing multimodal connectivity infrastructure to various Economic Zones. The PM GatiShakti NMP will depict the economic zones and the infrastructure linkages required to support them with an objective to holistically integrate all the multimodal connectivity projects and remove missing gaps for seamless movement of people, goods & services.        There is no financial implication for multimodal connectivity infrastructure to the economic zones under the PM GatiShakti NMP as the concerned line Ministries/Departments will seek funding of their respective infrastructure projects serving the economic zones as per procedures laid under their respective schemes/programmes.  PM GatiShakti NMP will bring in holistic planning and development across the country. It will provide complete visibility of multimodal infrastructure connectivity to the economic zones and will thus help in supplementing the various initiatives being taken to increase the share of manufacturing in the country, attract investment in manufacturing and service industry sectors, which will have a catalytic effect on up-gradation and development of skills of the workforce and generation of employment opportunities. (b)    The PM GatiShakti NMP has been prepared in the Geographic Information System (GIS) based platform developed by BISAG-N to provide bird’s eye view of the infrastructure development across the country encompassing the layers of Administrative boundaries, economic zones, infrastructure & utilities, etc. This portal is a GIS based ERP system to support the stakeholders in planning, reviewing and monitoring of the Plan. (c) The Geographic Information System (GIS) based platform of the PM GatiShakti NMP will ensure smarter decision making through the power of spatial analysis made available to the Network Planners. The portal will provide analytical tools for Planning, Permissions and Project Management Information Systems which will be available for individual organisations at Centre and State level. This will not only provide visual depiction of the Master Plan but will also integrate, through APIs, the physical progress on real-time with existing database of these Ministries. (d)  In recent years several infrastructure projects including Bharatmala, Sagarmala, Jal Marg Vikas and Ude Desh Ka Aam Naagrik (UDAN); regulatory, IT and process reforms (such as introduction of GST, electronic toll collection system (FASTAG) for reducing time loss at toll plaza; introduction of paperless EXIM trade process through E-Sanchit etc. have been introduced to improve logistics and efficiency of logistics management in the country. (e)  To integrate and to build upon the initiatives already taken/planned, ''PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (NMP)'' has been launched for providing multimodal connectivity infrastructure up to the last mile to various Economic Zones which will be the fulcrum of economic development. *****
