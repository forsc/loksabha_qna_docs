ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATION AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) & (b) Yes, Sir. Halt agents are deputed at small way side stations where they undertake unreserved ticketing activities. The halt agents are authorized to issue tickets till terminating station on the section. Further, considering the safety related responsibilities of Assistant Station Masters (ASMs) and other functional constraints, Station Ticket Booking Agents (STBA) are being engaged at certain identified NSG-5 (Non-suburban grade-5) and NSG-6 category stations for issuing unreserved tickets. Recently, instructions have also been issued for engaging STBA at NSG-4 and SG-3 (suburban grade) stations on pilot basis.(c): In view of the meagre earnings and low volume of passenger traffic at halt stations, posting of railway staff for sale of tickets and creating full-fledged railway infrastructure like station buildings/ staff quarters etc. at such stations would be unremunerative. Therefore, to minimise cost of operating such halt stations, Railways appoint contractual agents who are paid commission based on the ticket sales turnover at the station.     Further, STBA are generally engaged at relatively smaller category stations for issuing unreserved tickets as a financially and operationally prudent option. (d) to (f): The initial period of contract of halt contractors is 5 years. However, an extension of another 5 years in two spells of two and half years may also be given subject to the halt contractor’s working being satisfactory and Railways dues being paid in time. Further, if the halt contractors also maintain the infrastructure of the station at their own cost including provision of water, electricity etc., another final extension of 5 years may also be given.STBA are engaged for a period of three (03) years.At present, there is no proposal under consideration to increase the tenure for which these agents are engaged.                                         *****
