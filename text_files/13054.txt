                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER FOR FISHERIES ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(SHRI GIRIRAJ SINGH)(a) & (b) Statement is laid on the table of the house  STATEMENT REFERRED IN REPLY OF LOKSABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.87 PART (a) to (b) ON STRAY CATTLE(a)	No Sir(b)   As per the Article 246(3) of the Constitution of India, preservation, protection and improvement of stock and prevention of animal diseases; veterinary training and practice is under State list on which the State has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II of the Seventh Schedule.       As per Article 243(W) of Constitution of India, the local municipality is responsible for cattle pounds and prevention of cruelty to animals. As per the Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, the Panchyat is responsible for animal husbandry, dairying and poultry. Therefore, the State may endow panchayats to establish and run Cattle Pounds (Kanji Houses)/ Gaushala Shelters (community assets) to keep the stray cattle. Many States have established Gaushalas and Shelter houses for keeping of stray cattle and also provides funds for feeding of those animals.   In view of the above mentioned constitutional provisions, the State is empowered to take appropriate action on the stray animals. Further, the Animal Welfare Board has issued advisory on stray animals to all the State Governments/ Union Territories vide its letter dated 12th July, 2018. The Animal Welfare Board encourages such organizations by providing grants-in-aid for taking care of the animals with the budget provided by Government of India.      Further, in order to utilize the unproductive animals, dry dairy is promoted. Further, the unproductive female animals are used as surrogate mother for production of calves through Embryo Transfer Technology. Rastriya Kamdhenu Aayog has been established by the Government to advice the Government on conservation of cattle.    It has been observed that the farmers are leaving the male animals as these animals cannot be used by the farmers. In order to tackle the problem the Central Government is implementing sex sorting semen technology under the Rashtriya Gokul Mission for artificial insemination of cattle. This technology will help produce female calves only. The number of male cattle will reduce gradually over a period of time.
