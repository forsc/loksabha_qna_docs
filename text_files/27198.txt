ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) & (b) Water resources projects, including construction of canals for irrigation of agricultural land, are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priorities. Role of Government of India is limited to being catalytic, providing technical support and, in some cases partial financial assistance in terms of the ongoing schemes of Government of India. Presently one cluster consisting of 147 surface minor irrigation schemes from Chhatisgarh is being implemented by Government of Chhatisgarh, with financial assistance under Surface Minor Irrigation scheme, Har Khet Ko Pani component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana being implemented by this Ministry. Against target potential of 51 thousand hectare, the potential achieved till March, 2021 is 32 thousand hectare, with completion of 106 schemes. Further, three medium irrigation projects from Chhattisgarh, namely Maniyari Tank, Kharung & Kelo, are included under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana – Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (PMKSY-AIBP) being implemented by this Ministry. Out of these, Kharung and Maniyari Tank projects have been completed, while Kelo is ongoing. Till March, 2021, 16.76 thousand hectare irrigation potential has been achieved by the three projects, against combined balance irrigation potential of 22.46 thousand hectares.(c) & (d) As informed by Government of Chhatisgarh, Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), New Delhi, has three references from Chhatisgarh. Koma project has been recently returned by MoEF&CC to Government of Chhatisgarh, as the forest area to be affected by submergence is more than the permissible norms. Further, proposal for construction of canals under Mongra project, and Rampur project, are presently under consideration at MoEF&CC, New Delhi. It has also been informed by Government of Chhatisgarh that five irrigation projects, namely Jhiria, Mundatola, Utarda, Balpahari and Pelamnala, are presently under consideration at MoEF&CC regional office, Nagpur. *****
