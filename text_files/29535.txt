ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS (SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) and (b) Electric vehicle Charging Stations are to be provided by the developer as part of the Wayside Amenities (WSAs) being awarded by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). NHAI has already awarded 39 such facilities and the proposals for 103 such sites are at bidding stage. Further, additional WSA sites, as and when identified by the Authority, would also be put up for bidding. The works which have been already awarded are expected to be completed by the end of FY 2022-23.(c) Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI) had invited proposals from Government Organizations/Public Sector Undertakings (PSU) (State/Central)/ Government DISCOMs/ Oil Public Sector Undertakings and similar other Public/Private entities to build and operate Public Electric Vehicle charging infrastructure on Expressways and National Highways under FAME India Scheme Phase-II, wherein Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) consortium with Convergence Energy Services Ltd (subsidiary of EESL) has been awarded the work for setting up of EV charging stations along 16 NH/Expressways.In order to facilitate EESL in the above prospect, NHAI has signed an MOU with EESL. As per this MoU, NHAI shall provide space/land near the toll plazas and its buildings for installation of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations based on revenue sharing model. The space/land for the same shall be provided to EESL at no cost basis for duration as decided by NHAI. This would not only assist in promoting clean/green energy and conserving the environment but could also be a source of revenue for NHAI.2. Further, the Ministry of Power, vide memorandum dated 14th December, 2018, has published guidelines and standards for the charging infrastructure of electric vehicles, which are available on [www.powermin.nic.in]. These guidelines have been revised on 01.10.2019. These guidelines stipulate the requirements regarding density/distance between two charging points and specify the priorities for rolling out of electric vehicle public charging infrastructure.*****
