ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) to (f) :	The condition of most of the State Government owned Distribution companies is a matter of grave concern. Their AT&C losses at the end of 2019-20 range from an average of 21% to a maximum of 60.16%. The gap between Average Cost of Supply (ACS) and Average Revenue Realized (ARR) excluding Regulatory Assets and Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) grants averages 60 paise per Unit in 2019-20 and the Accumulated losses of all DISCOMs in the country by 2019-20 have risen to Rs.5,07,416 crore. DISCOMs have not been able to pay the Generation Companies for the power procured, and the Outstanding payments to Generation Companies are estimated to be in excess of Rs.1,56,000 crore. The Outstanding dues to Renewable Generators are around 11 months of revenues. Therefore, reforms have been deliberated upon in consultation with the States and all Stakeholders. No final decisions have been arrived at so far.***********
