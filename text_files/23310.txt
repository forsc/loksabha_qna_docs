                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (e) The quinquennial labour force surveys on employment and unemployment were conducted by National Statistical Office (NSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The last such survey was conducted during 2011-12. Now, NSO has switched to the annual Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), which was conducted during 2017-18 and 2018-19.  As per the results of surveys, the estimated workers population ratio(WPR) which includes both organised and unorganised sector, on usual status (principal status+subsidiary status) basis for all ages in rural and urban areas to the extent available is given below:   (in %)Year		Rural	Urban		Male	Female	Male	Female2004-05	Odisha	58.6	32.2	50.4	14.8	All India	54.6	32.7	54.9	16.62009-10	Odisha	57.8	24.3	56.8	11.9	All India	54.7	26.1	54.3	13.82011-12	Odisha	59.2	24.6	57.9	15.5	All India	54.3	24.8	54.6	14.72017-18(PLFS)	Odisha	53.8	14.4	53.4	11.7	All India	51.7	17.5	53.0	14.22018-19(PLFS)	Odisha	53.6	18.4	53.5	12.6	All India	52.1	19.0	52.7	14.5(Note: For comparability, the results of the PLFS with earlier surveys need to be understood in the context with which the survey methodology and sample selection has been designed)(f) & (g) Government has taken several initiatives to improve women’s participation in the labour force. In order to encourage employment of women, a number of protective provisions have been incorporated in the labour codes for creating congenial work environment for women workers. These include enhancement in paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks, provision for mandatory crèche facility in the establishments having 50 or more employees, permitting women workers in the night shifts with adequate safety measures, etc. Government has taken a decision to allow the employment of women in the aboveground mines including opencast workings between 7 pm and 6 am and in below ground working between 6 am and 7 pm in technical, supervisory and managerial work where continuous presence may not be required. 	The Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 now subsumed in the Code on Wages, 2019 provides that there shall be no discrimination in an establishment or any unit thereof among employees on the ground of gender in matters relating to wages by the same employer, in respect of the same work or work of similar nature done by any employee. Further, no employer shall make any discrimination on the ground of gender while recruiting any employee for the same work or work of similar nature in the conditions of employment, except where the employment of women in such work is prohibited or restricted by or under any law for the time being in force. 	Further, in order to enhance the employability of female workers, the Government is providing training to them through a network of Women Industrial Training institutes, National Vocational Training Institutes and Regional Vocational Training Institutes.*****
