ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL)(a) to (d) SVAMITVA Scheme aims to provide the ‘Record of Rights’ to village household owners possessing houses in inhabited areas in villages with issuance of legal ownership rights (Property cards/Title deeds). It helps in determining clear ownership of property by mapping of land parcels using drone technology with the collaborative efforts of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, State Revenue Department, State Panchayati Raj Department and Survey of India. The pilot phase of the scheme was implemented during Financial Year 2020-21 in the States of Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. From April 2021, the Scheme is being implemented across the country in phased manner and eventually would cover all the villages of the country by March, 2025. 	Subsequent to the drone survey, distribution of property cards to the household owners are made after ensuring all the mandatory activities like ground truthing, inquiry process and dispute resolution.  In the State of Andhra Pradesh as on 14th July, 2021, drone flying has been completed in 747 villages and the property cards issued are ‘Nil’.*******
