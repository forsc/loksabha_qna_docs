The State/UT Governments have been requested to send their proposals under this Scheme along with Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) as per Scheme guidelines for consideration by the Ministry. As on date, three proposals namely Chikkamagaluru, Haveri and Yadgiri have been approved for Karnataka by this Ministry under this Phase.  For commencement/ starting of medical college, it is required of the State Government concerned to submit application for establishment of new Medical College to start MBBS course to the Board of Governors (BoG) in Supersession of Medical Council of India (MCI) under Section 10-A of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 and Regulations framed thereunder.
