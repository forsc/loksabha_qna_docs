ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT (SUSHRI PRATIMA BHOUMIK)(a) to (c): No, Sir. Grant to Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) working for the rehabilitation of children with disabilities and running special schools has not been withheld under Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS). The Government is implementing DDRS Scheme under which financial assistance is provided to NGOs for promoting the welfare of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) in the country, including the State of Maharashtra. All complete proposals which fulfill the norms of the scheme, received during a financial year, are normally processed in the year itself, subject to availability of funds. However, in case of deficiency in documents etc., the proposal is processed and grant is released only after rectification of the deficiency. Such proposals are then considered in the subsequent years in consonance with the provisions of General Financial Rules.*****
