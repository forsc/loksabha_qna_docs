                                                        (a)	to (c) The period of Basic Services to Urban Poor (BSUP) and Integrated Housing and Slum Development Programme (IHSDP) components of Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JnNURM) which was launched in December 2005,  was upto 31 March 2012. However, to complete the on-going projects sanctioned upto 31 March 2012, the mission period was extended upto 31 March 2017. Thus, no new proposals under BSUP and IHSDP were sanctioned during the last two years.                                       *****
