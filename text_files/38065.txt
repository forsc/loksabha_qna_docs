Development of State Roads in the country including Misrikh parliamentary constituency in  State of Uttar Pradesh has to be done by State Government by their own funds and funds granted by GOI including under Central Road and Infrastructure Fund (CRIF) Act 2000. The list of proposals to be sanctioned under CRIF Act 2000 is forwarded by State Government taking into consideration representations received from public representatives as per norms under CRIF.(b) Funds under CRIF are released State wise and not constituency wise. The State/ UT - wise details of accrual/ allocation of funds and the funds released/ expenditure incurred for development and maintenance of State roads under CRIF including State of Uttar Pradesh during each of the last three years and current year, are placed at Annexure.(c) & (d) The Ministry finalized the criteria for allocation of funds for development and maintenance of State Roads [for CRIF and EI & ISC Schemes] under the CRIF Act, 2000 in consultation with the Ministry of Finance and circulated the same to all State Governments and UTs in January, 2020. This criteria inter-alia provides for: - (i) Maintaining a revolving balance of one third of accrual/ allocation for the States/ UT for the year with State/ UT while releasing funds. (ii) Release of funds to States/ UTs in Quarterly installments linked to submission of Utilization Certificates (UCs). (iii) Further release of funds by State Governments/ UTs to concerned executive agencies (e.g. Public Works Department (PWDs), Road Construction Department/ Corporation, etc.) within 7 days of release of funds by the Ministry. (iv) Design of projects to be as per relevant Central Government codes and guidelines. (v) Project monitoring and quality control of works to be done at regular intervals. (vi) Quality monitoring system at State / UT level to consist of experts and supporting staff appointed by State Govt. / UT including State Quality Monitor. (vii) Quality monitoring system at State / UT level to devise a Quality Assurance System delineating requirements of quality, responsibility of officers and contractors, conduct independent tests, examine Quality Assurance documentation, responsibility of training PWD staff and recommending laboratory and field testing facilities. (viii) Inspection of works by civil engineer(s) having degree in civil engineering and 10 years’ experience / Inspection of works by an independent impartial agency/ firm. As per the CRIF Act, 2000 amended through Finance Act, 2019, the Central Government is no longer responsible for monitoring of State road projects under these schemes and expenditure incurred thereon.
