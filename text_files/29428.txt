                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (f) As on 30th November 2021, total deaths due to COVID-19 as reported by States/UTs is 4,68,980.India achieved the 100-crore Covid-19 vaccination dose milestone on 21st October 2021. During the initial phase of COVID-19 vaccination, there were challenges of vaccine eagerness as well as vaccine hesitancy which were soon overcome by implementation of a focused Communication Strategy to sustain vaccine confidence across all States/UTs.The National COVID-19 Vaccination Programme ensures equitable access of vaccination services to all eligible beneficiaries. Since 1st April 2021 to 30th November 2021, a total of 75,20,35,586 (68%) vaccine doses have been administered at CVCs located in rural areas, while 35,29,98,471 (32%) vaccine doses have been administered at CVCs located in urban areas.The Government of India continues to supply COVID-19 vaccines free of cost to States/UTs since the commencement of the National COVID-19 Vaccination Programme to ensure vaccine coverage of all eligible beneficiaries with both doses. Government of India has launched ‘Har Ghar Dastak Abhiyaan’ from 3rd November 2021 wherein missed beneficiaries for 1st dose and due beneficiaries for 2nd dose are identified and vaccinated through house-to-house activity. ****
