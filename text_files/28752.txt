Hence, Ministry of Heavy Industries has no scheme to encourage establishment of heavy industries in various parts of the country including backward regions. The Ministry, however seeks to provide technology development as well as environment friendly technologies in the industry through innovative schemes. Many states have offered incentives and schemes for the development and growth of industries including heavy industries. Central Government, through Ministry of Finance, also provides incentives in the direct and indirect tax structure for the growth of industries across the country.*********
