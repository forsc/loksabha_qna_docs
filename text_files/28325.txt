ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION, MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS  [RAO INDERJIT SINGH](a)	& (b):  The erstwhile Planning Commission was the nodal agency in the Government for estimation of the poverty in the country and it used a poverty line based on per capita consumption expenditure as the criterion to determine the persons living below the poverty line (BPL) in rural and urban areas. For determination of the methodology to estimate poverty line erstwhile Planning Commission constituted a Task Force from time to time. The last Expert Group whose recommendations were accepted by the Government in 2011 was chaired by Prof. Suresh D. Tendulkar.  Based on the data of Large Sample Survey on Household Consumer Expenditure collected by NSSO in its 68th round conducted in 2011-12 the poverty lines and poverty ratio were estimated following the extant Tendulkar Committee methodology in 2011-12 and released through a Press Note issued on 22nd July 2013. The number of persons living below poverty in 2011-12, State/UT-wise, as per the Press Note, are given in the Statement at Annexure-I. (c) & (d): This Ministry carried out all-India surveys on Periodic Labour Force, Annual Survey of Industries, and Household Social Consumption of Health and Education in India during the period July, 2017 to June, 2018, and survey on Disability, Drinking Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Housing Conditions in India during the period July, 2018- December, 2018. The results of all these surveys have been released by this Ministry as per details given in Annexure-II, and also available in the Ministry''s website. However, this Ministry also carried  out  an  all-India  survey  on  Household  Consumer Expenditure  during  the NSS  75th round  (July 2017- June 2018).  The results  of  this survey  were  examined  and  it  was  observed  that  there  was a significant  variation  in  the  levels  in  the  consumption  pattern  as well as in the direction of the change while comparing with other administrative data sources. In view of the data quality issues, the Ministry decided not to release the results of Consumer Expenditure Survey, 2017-2018.                                                 *****
