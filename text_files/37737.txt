ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) & (b) : 	The domestic coal production by Coal India Limited (CIL) and Singareni Colliery Company Ltd (SCCL) during April, 2021 to February, 2022 was about 601 MT as against 559 MT during the same period last year, thus an increase of about 7.5%. Further, the receipt of coal from captive coal mines has also increased to about 64.1 MT during April, 21 to February, 22 as against 44.9 MT during same period last year. Therefore, the lower import during current year (24.2 MT during Apr’21 to Feb’22 as against 42.4 MT during the same period last year) has been compensated by domestic sources and the thermal power plants could meet their requirement of coal.		The Government has taken the following measures to increase the coal supply to power plants:(i)	To help the power plants in enhancing their coal stock, CIL has offered about 5.2 MT coal in October, 2021 and 6 MT coal in December, 2021 from its various subsidiaries to State/Central Gencos for lifting through (Road-Cum-Rail) RCR/Road mode.(ii)	Government have issued revised coal stocking norms, which mandate the power plants to maintain sufficient stock at all times; if necessary, by import for blending to meet any contingent situation.  (c) & (d) :   In order to meet the normative requirement of coal (0.75 lakh tons/day) by the thermal power plants of Andhra Pradesh, the following steps have been taken: i.	To address the issues of coal supplies to power sector, an Inter-Ministerial Sub Group comprising of representatives from Ministries of Power, Coal, Railways, CEA, CIL and SCCL meet regularly to take various operational decisions to enhance supply of coal to thermal power plants as well as for meeting any contingent situations relating to Power Sector including to alleviate critical coal stock position in power plants.The subgroup in its meeting held on 22.03.2022 advised Mahanadi Coal Limited (MCL) and SCCL to supply 10 rakes per day and 7 rakes per day respectively to Andhra Pradesh plants. Subgroup has also advised them to lift 4 rakes under RCR mode from MCL.ii.	In addition, CIL has offered 4.97 LT during the Round-1 (October, 2021) and 4.50 LT coal during Round-2 (December, 2021) for lifting through RCR/ Road mode to help Andhra Pradesh power plants to enhance coal stock. **************
