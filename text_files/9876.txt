MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (c) Yes Sir. The Central Sector Scheme ‘National Means-cum-Merit Scholarship Scheme’(NMMSS) is being implemented since 2008 with the objective to award scholarships tomeritorious students of economically weaker sections to arrest their drop out at class VIII andencourage them to continue the study at secondary stage. The rate of scholarship has beenenhanced from Rs. 6000/- to Rs. 12000/- per annum with effect from 1st April, 2017. Under theScheme one lakh fresh scholarships @ of Rs.12000/- per annum per student are awarded toselected students of class IX every year and their continuation/renewal in classes X to XII forstudy in a State Government, Government-aided and Local body schools under the scheme.There is a separate quota of scholarships for each States/UTs. The selection of students for awardof scholarships under the scheme is made through an examination conducted by the States/UTsGovernments. The year wise and state wise total number of the beneficiaries of the schemeduring the last five years is at Annexure-I.(d) & (e) The details regarding number of students who discontinued education after availingthe scholarship is not maintained centrally, however an evaluation study of the NMMS schemeconducted by National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration (NIEPA) in 2017states that the scheme has a positive impact. The data reveals that about 70.1 % beneficiarystudents are unable to continue their studies without this scholarship and students are veryconscientious about their studies as well as the need to perform well after qualifying in NMMSScheme. They register better performance in Class IX, X, XI and XII in order to continue gettingthe scholarship for four consecutive years. Heads of all the institutions disclosed that the NMMSScheme has reduced the drop-out rate at the secondary and senior secondary classes, particularlyfrom Classes VIII to XII.*****
