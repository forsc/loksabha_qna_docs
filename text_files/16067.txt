ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (f)The Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) has been constituted as a Statutory body under Section 68 of the Juvenile Justice (Care & Protection of Children) Act (JJ Act), 2015 to promote in-country adoptions and to carry the functions of the Central Authority under the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of Inter-country Adoption.The Child Adoption Resource Information & Guidance System (CARINGS) is a web based application that provides transparent and fully automated system for management of the database of the orphaned, abandoned & surrendered children and the Prospective Adoptive Parents registering for adoption of Indian children. It facilitates expeditious and smooth adoption as well as monitoring of the adoption programme, thereby ensuring accountability of implementing agencies. The Government of India regularly reviews the functioning of CARA in the meeting of the Steering Committee of CARA chaired by the Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development. Further, to improve the adoption process,CARA regularly organises various Training Programmes in the States & UTs and carries outreach and advocacy related activities, including public awareness campaigns. *****
