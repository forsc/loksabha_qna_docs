KGBVs are residential schools from class VI to XII for girls belonging to disadvantaged groups such as SC, ST, OBC, Minority and Below Poverty Line (BPL).

The scheme-wise details of benfits provided under these scheme is as under:(i) Scheme for Adolescent Girls (SAG) is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme which aims at providing nutritional support to out of school girls in the age group of 11-14 years for improving their health and nutritional status and motivates them to go back to formal schooling, provides life skill training, accessing public services etc. Under the Scheme, life skill education is imparted to out of school adolescent girls which include confidence building, self awareness and self esteem, decision making, critical thinking, communication skills, rights and entitlement, effective home management, budgeting, saving, gender sensitivity etc. The details of funds released and utilized to States/UTs under SAG during the last five years is at Annexure-I. Year-wise number of beneficiaries during the last five years is at Annexure-II.(ii) Under the scheme of Samagra Shiksha, in KGBVs, specific skill training is provided to girls, for which States/UTs appoint vocational instructors in KGBVs to provide need based vocational education to adolescent girls. The States/UTs generally pick up courses based on the choice and need of the girls in the KGBVs. Further Samagra Shiksha aims at integrating Vocational Education with general academic education in all Secondary/Senior Secondary schools including KGBVs; enhancing the Employability and Entrepreneurial abilities of the students, providing exposure to work environment; and generating awareness amongst students about various career options so as to enable them to make a choice in accordance with their aptitude, competence and aspirations. Currently 8,16,321 girls in 11,710 Secondary and Senior Secondary schools across the country are undergoing Vocational Education under Samagra Shiksha. Samagra Shiksha also has a provision for providing exposure to vocational education to students of classes VI to VIII with an aim to provide opportunities to the students to orient themselves with the skills required for the various occupations in a sector and to equip them to make informed choices while selecting their subjects in higher classes. The State/UT-wise details of fund allocated for KGBVs, under Samagra Siksha, is at Annexure-III. The State/UT-wise details of girls enrolled in KGBVs from 2018-19 to 2020-21 is at Annexure-IV.

Under PMKVY, STT is linked to placement, while RPL does not mandate placements as it recognizes the existing skills of candidate.

Further under the scheme the targeted beneficiaries are in the age group of 15-45 years which includes adolescent girls as well. There is no separate bifurcation indicating the beneficiaries i.e. specifically adolescent girls under the Scheme.(e) No such proposal hasbeen received by the Government. However, recently the Scheme for Adolescent Girls has been subsumed under Saksham Anganwadi & Mission Poshan 2.0. As adolescent girls in the age group 11-14 years are covered under RTE Act, 2009, the targeted beneficiaries under the revised scheme are adolescent girls in the age group of 14+ to 18 years in Aspirational Districts and NE States. ***** Annexure-IAnnexure referred in reply to Part (b) to (d) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No.57 for answer on 04.02.2022 regarding “Schemes for Adolescent Girls” asked by Shri M.
