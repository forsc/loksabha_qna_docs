ANSWER




(a)  	At present, Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras are not facing any severe shortage of medicines. The Bureau of Pharma PSUs of India (BPPI), the implementing agency of Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) makes regular efforts to make all the drugs of its product basket available to the consumers. Sometimes, some drugs are not available for non-receipt of valid bids for a particular drug in a tender floated by the BPPI/non-supply by a vendor.  The Product basket of BPPI comprises of 802 drugs and 155 surgicals. Presently, 667 drugs and 56 surgicals are available for sale at PMBJP Kendras. (b) From 01.04.2019 to 27.11.2019, BPPI have received only 46 complaints related to shortage of medicines through CPGRAMS portal. (c) BPPI has appointed State-level Marketing Officers to monitor the functioning of the Kendras in each State. The State-level Marketing Officers are monitoring the supplies of the required medicines to the PMBJP Kendras of their respective States. The complete logistics and supply chain system are being monitored by the logistics & supply team placed at the BPPI head office. Further, Information Technology (IT) enabled End-to-End supply chain system with Point-of-Sale (POS) application for value-added services have been implemented in PMBJP. At present, BPPI has four modern warehouses at Gurugram, Bengaluru, Guwahati and Chennai for storage and distribution of drugs. Drugs are made available to all Kendras across the country from these warehouses. *****
