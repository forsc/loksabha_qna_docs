                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (d):This Ministry is implementing Anganwadi Services under the Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) which is a centrally sponsored Scheme implemented by the States/UTs.  The Scheme aims at holistic development of children below 6 years of age and pregnant women & lactating mothers.  The scheme provides for a package of six services comprising of (i) Supplementary nutrition (ii) Pre-school non-formal education (iii) Nutrition and Health Education (iv) Immunization (v) Health check-up and (vi) Referral services.Three of the six services, viz., Immunization, Health check-up and Referral Services are related to health and are provided through NRHM & Public Health Infrastructure.Besides this, the Government has set up POSHAN Abhiyaan (earlier known as National Nutrition Mission) on 18.12.2017 which aims to address the problem of malnutrition in the country. To ensure a holistic approach, all districts of 37 States/UTs have been covered in the Abhiyaan. The goals of POSHAN Abhiyaan are to achieve improvement in nutritional status of Children from 0-6 years, Adolescent Girls, Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers in a time bound manner during the three years with fixed targets as under:S.No	Objective	Target1.	Prevent and reduce Stunting in children (0- 6 years)	By 6% @ 2% p.a.2.	Prevent and reduce under-nutrition (underweight prevalence) in children (0-6 years)	By 6% @ 2% p.a.3.	Reduce the prevalence of anemia among young Children(6-59 months)	By 9% @ 3% p.a.4.	Reduce the prevalence of anemia among Women and Adolescent Girls in the age group of 15-49 years.	By 9% @ 3% p.a.5.	Reduce Low Birth Weight (LBW).	By 6% @ 2% p.a.The Abhiyaan aims to reduce malnutrition in the Country in a phased manner, through a life cycle approach, by adopting a synergised and result oriented approach. The Abhiyaan ensures mechanisms for timely service delivery and a robust monitoring as well as intervention infrastructure. The Abhiyaan targets to bring down stunting of the children in the age group of 0-6 years from 38.4% to 25% by the year 2022. The Anganwadi Services and POSHAN Abhiyan, both are implemented in all States/UT’s, which includes economically backward areas of Bundelkhand. Further, while sanctioning new AWCs, States/UTs are advised to open these centres in the areas pre-dominantly inhabited by SC/ST/Weaker Section population. They have also been advised to re-assess their requirement of Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) and relocate AWCs considering the need. While relocating, villages pre-dominantly inhabited by population belonging to SC/ST and minority community are to be given priority.*****
