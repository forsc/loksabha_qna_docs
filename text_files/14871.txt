ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (d):  As per Census 2011, the  number of main workers in the age group of 5-14 years in the country is 43,53,247  and in the State of West Bengal is 2,34,275.The presence of child labour is a complex problem emanating from socio-economic factors. So as to eliminate child labour, the Government of India has taken several steps.    	The Government has amended the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986 and enacted the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 which came into force with effect from 1.9.2016. The Amendment Act, inter-alia,  provides for complete prohibition of work or employment of children below 14 years of age in any occupation and process and prohibition of adolescents in the age group of 14 to 18 years in hazardous occupations and processes. The Amendment Act also provides for stricter punishment for employers for violation of the Act and has made the offence as cognizable.Contd..2/-:: 2 :: 		As per provisions contained in the Act, whoever employs any child or permits any child to work in contravention of the provisions   shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months but which may extend to  two years, or with fine which shall not be less than twenty thousand rupees but which may extend to fifty thousand rupees, or with both. Provided that the parents or guardians of such children shall not be punished unless they permit such child for commercial purposes in contravention of the provisions of the Act.           	After strengthening the legislative framework through amendment in Child Labour Act, the Government has also framed the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2017 which, inter-alia, specifies the duties and responsibilities of State Governments and District Authorities to ensure effective enforcement of the provisions of the Act.*****
