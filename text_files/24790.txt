All COVID-19 Vaccination Centres (CVCs) are advised to publish the vaccine slots (mentioning details such as vaccine type, cost, number of slots, number of walk-in/online slots etc), in advance, for convenient booking of slots by the beneficiaries.  Further, a communication strategy is in place which is being implemented across all States/UTs with a focus to sustain vaccine confidence. Accessibility of vaccination is also being improved through involving Private COVID-19 Vaccination Centres (CVCs), Workplace CVCs & ‘Near to Home’ CVCs. Continued efforts are also being made to ramp up domestic production of vaccines.
