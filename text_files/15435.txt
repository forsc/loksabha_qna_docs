                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.  ***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.4121 BY SHRI KOMATI REDDY VENKAT REDDY TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 18.03.2020 REGARDING SECOND RAILWAY LINE FROM KOTHAGUDEM TO DORNAKAL(a) and (b) Railway has prioritized doubling on its high density network (HDN) and highly utilized network(HUN) lines. Section from Bhadrachallam Road(Kothagudem) to Dornakal and Motumari to Vishnupuram does not fall on these HDN and HUN routes.  However, details of projects falling fully/partly in State of Telangana are as under: 13 Projects (9 New Line and 4 Doubling) costing ?20,226 crore for 1,604 km length, falling fully/partly in Telangana are under different stages of planning/approval/execution, out of which, commissioning of 85 km length has been achieved and an expenditure of ?3037 crore has been incurred upto March 2019. This includes:?	9 New Line Projects are covering a length of 1,067 km at a cost of ? 14,816 crore, out of which, 85 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of ?2,212 crore has been incurred upto March 2019. ?	4 Doubling Projects are covering a length of 537 km at a cost of ? 5,410 crore. An expenditure of ?824 crore has been incurred upto March 2019. Budget Allocation (for Projects falling fully/partly in the State of Telangana):?	Average Annual Budget allocation for infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/partly in the State of Telangana, during 2014-19 was ?1,110 crore per year.  ?	Total allocation of Budget for infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/ partly in the State of Telangana, in 2019-20 is ?2,056 crore, which is 85% more than average annual allotment during 2014-19. ?	Allocation of Budget for infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/ partly in the State of Telangana, during financial year 2020-21 is ?2,602 crore, which is 134% more than average annual allotment during 2014-19.Commissioning (for Projects falling fully/partly in the State of Telangana):?	During 2009-14, 87 km (66 km New line and 21 km Doubling projects), falling fully/partly in the State of Telangana have been commissioned, at an average rate 17 km per year.?	During 2014-19, 188 km (135 km of New line and 53 km of Doubling projects), falling fully/partly in the State of Telangana have been commissioned in the State at an average rate 38 km per year, which is 116% more than commissioning during 2009-14.  Many of these projects are getting delayed due to land acquisition, forestry clearance, wildlife clearance, shifting of utilities and non deposition of State Govt.’s share in cost sharing projects. An amount of ?499 cr is outstanding against government of Telangana towards their share in cost sharing projects. (c) Indian Railway is carrying multifarious commodities over its network. The utilization of section is not commodity based, rather the average Line Capacity of any section is measured according to interpolation of data based on the actual number of trains running on the particular section. When the single line sections are saturated with the traffic and even after giving all possible infrastructural inputs, the network is not in a position to accommodate any further traffic demand, these single line sections are considered for doubling on priority basis.(d) There are two routes between Motumari to Bibinagar one is via Kazipet and another is via Vishnupuram. Motumari to Bibinagar (via Kazipet) is already double line. On the other route Motumari to Bibinagar via Vishnupuram, the doubling of Bibinagar-Vishnupuram has been included in Budget 2019-20 subject to requisite government approvals as part of project of doubling from Guntur to Bibinagar (248 km). Preparation of Detailed Project Report (DPR) has been taken up. *****
