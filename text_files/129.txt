Under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, the Central Government is empowered to prohibit transmission of a channel or a programme if it is considered necessary due to national security or in public interest or if it is found to be in violation of Programme & Advertising Code. Similar mandate is available under the Uplinking and Downlinking Guidelines, 2011, in respect of private satellite TV channels.     However, before taking a decision to prohibit any programme or a channel, the broadcaster is given due opportunity to present his case as a matter of natural justice.******
