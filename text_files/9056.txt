                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a)	to (e) At present, 2 pairs of trains namely 55811/55812 Dhubri-Kamakhya Passenger and 15417/15418 Alipurduar-Silghat Rajyarani Express connect Dhubri with Guwahati via Goalpara Town. Further, Goalpara Town is being served by 22 pairs of trains connecting it to various destinations including Guwahati.  Requests, including that from the Hon’ble Member of Parliament, have been received for introduction of train from Dhubri to Guwahati. The same have been examined but found operationally not feasible, at present, inter alia due to infrastructural constraints at Dhubri. However, introduction of trains is an on-going process on Indian Railways subject to operational feasibility, resource availability, etc. *****
