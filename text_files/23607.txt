ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (f): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (f) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.4629 BY SHRI UTTAM KUMAR REDDY NALAMADA TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 24.03.2021 REGARDING RAILWAY LINE BETWEEN HYDERABAD AND VIJAYAWADA(a) No, Sir.(b) Presently, there are 2 routes from Hyderabad to Vijayawada – one route via Kazipet and another via Guntur. Further, 3rd line work is in progress in Kazipet-Vijayawada section. Therefore, there will not be any requirement for new line between Hyderabad-Vijayawada. (c) and (d) The minimum distance between Secunderabad (station primarily serving Hyderabad) and Vijayawada is 313 Kms via Guntur with a travel time of 05.00 hrs. while the distance via Kazipet is 349 Kms with a travel time of  05.20 hrs. Travel time will get further boost after completion of third line between Kazipet-Vijayawada. (e) and (f) There is no high speed train between these two cities. However, prior to cancellation of regular train services to contain the spread of Covid-19, Vijayawada and Secunderabad was well connected by train services like 22203/04 Visakhapatnam-Secunderabad Duronto Express and 12739/40 Visakhapatnam-Secunderabad Garibrath Express.  Presently, only special trains, keeping in view the health protocols, suggestions and concerns of State Governments, are being operated over Indian Railways. There is no immediate proposal for introduction of regular train service between Hyderabad and Vijayawada, owing to operational and resource constraints, including terminal constraints and line capacity constraints on sections en route.  However, introduction of train services over Indian Railways is an ongoing process subject to operational feasibility, commercial viability etc.  ****
