ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER FOR MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND MINISTRY OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a)	Yes Sir. The arrival (onset) of monsoon over the country is always being monitored. There is no such pattern obtained on the late arrival of monsoon. However, this year monsoon onset over Kerala had been delayed, but it was predicted by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The dates of onset of monsoon over Kerala for the last 10 years are given in table below : Year	Date of onset over Kerala2009	23 May2010	31 May2011	29 May2012	5 June2013	1 June2014	6 June2015	5 June2016	8 June2017	30 May2018	29 May(b)	No Sir. As per IMD’s forecast, onset of monsoon over Kerala for this year was likely to be delayed and was expected on 6th June with a model error of ± 4 days. The onset of monsoon over Kerala has occurred on 8th June 2019 within the forecast limit, against the normal date of 1st June. Afterwards also there had been delay in the further progress of monsoon in the country due to weakening of monsoon current, in view of formation of a cyclonic Storm ‘VAYU’ in the Arabian Sea. The progress of southwest monsoon till 15th July 2019 is shown in Fig-1 and the Press Release, issued on 15th May 2019, regarding the forecasting of date of onset of Southwest Monsoon 2019 over Kerala is given in Annexure.(c)	& (d) 	India Meteorological Department has the state of the art prediction models and other tools for monitoring and predicting various characteristics of monsoon. Under National Monsoon Mission, Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) has implemented two state of the art dynamical prediction systems for short, medium & extended range forecasts and seasonal forecasts. All these initiatives have helped to improve the accuracy of forecast. An improved suite of prediction models have already been implemented operationally at IMD for enhanced short range forecast through assimilation of all available Indian and global satellite data in real time. Even though there is a method for predicting monsoon onset over Kerala, the progress of monsoon across the country is made by considering spatial continuity of rainfall pattern and satellite imageries and advance of monsoon over the country is predicted based on above mentioned models.
