                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) & (b):	The Government of India is fully committed for complete eradication of bonded labour. The Bonded Labour System was abolished throughout the country by an Ordinance with effect from 24.10.1975 which was later replaced by Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976.  The Act provides for the abolition of Bonded Labour System with a view to prevent the economic and physical exploitation of the weaker sections of the people.  Under the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 identification, release and rehabilitation of freed bonded labour is the direct responsibility of the concerned State/Union Territory Governments. Contd..2/-::  2  ::In order to assist the State/UT Governments in the task of rehabilitation of identified and released bonded labourers, Central Plan Scheme was started in 1978 and the Scheme has been revised from time to time.  The Scheme was last modified in May, 2016.  As per the Scheme, the Central Government bears 100% expenditure and the State Governments are not required to pay any contribution for the purpose of cash rehabilitation assistance, evaluation studies, surveys and awareness campaigns for bonded labour. The directions have been issued by the Central Government to all the State/UTs Governments from time to time to ensure that Survey, Awareness Generation and Evaluatory Studies are undertaken in their States/UTs on priority basis.           	Under the Scheme, bonded labour rehabilitation fund is created at the district level by each State/UT with a permanent corpus of at least Rs.10 lakh at the disposal of the District Magistrate.  This fund is utilized for extending immediate financial assistance to the released bonded labour. Immediate financial assistance upto Rs.20,000/- per rescued bonded labourer is provided by the concerned District Magistrate from the corpus fund.  This amount is fully reimbursed by the Central Government to the State/UT Governments.  Further, under the Scheme rehabilitation assistance to the tune of Rs.1.00 lakh,     Rs.2.00 lakh and Rs.3.00 lakh are provided to released bonded labourers based on their category and level of exploitation as against an amount of   Rs.20,000/- only in the earlier scheme.            	In addition to the financial assistance, the beneficiaries are also entitled for the following non-cash assistance from the respective State Government:(i)	Allotment of House-site & agricultural land;(ii)	Land development;(iii)	Provision of low cost dwelling units;(iv)	Animal husbandry, dairy, poultry, piggery etc.;(v)	Wage employment, enforcement of minimum wages etc.; (vi)	Collection and processing of minor forest products;(vii)	Supply of essential commodities under targeted public distribution system;(viii)	Education for children; and (ix)	Any other Welfare Scheme of State/Central Government.Contd..3/-:: 3 ::(c):		The details of budget allocated and utilised toward the fulfillment this commitment from 2017 till date are as under:-Year	BE	RE	Expenditure2017-18	1000	812	787.752018-19	1000	750	317.452019-20	800	100	34.752020-21	1000	100	99.85(d):		Regular sensitization programmes with the field level functionaries such as District Magistrate/Superintendent of Police/Labour Department officials at the district and state level are held under the aegis of National Human Rights Commission, State Human Rights Commissions along-with participation of Non-Government Organizations and other stakeholders.******
