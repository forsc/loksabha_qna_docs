                                                        MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a) Comprehensive inventorisation of e-waste generation in the country has not been done. However, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in 2005 estimated 1.47 lakh ton of e-waste in the country and simultaneously had projected 8.0 lakh ton of e-waste generation in the year 2010. As per the Global E-waste Monitor 2017 Report of United Nations University the annual generation of e-waste in India was 2 million metric tons in 2016.(b) and (c) As per the information available with Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), 304 dismantlers and recyclers have been granted authorization by 18 State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/Pollution Control Committees (PCCs). These authorized dismantlers and recyclers are having equipment and facilities for environmentally sound processing of e-waste, the cumulative annual processing capacity of these units are 7,80,865 MT.

The Haryana SPCB has issued show cause notice to two non-compliant units. (e) The Ministry has notified E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016 on 23rd March, 2016 and has further made amendments in March, 2018 for its effective implementation. The provisions of these Rules include extended producer responsibility, setting up of producer responsibility organizations and e-waste exchange to facilitate collection and recycling, assigning specific responsibility to bulk consumers of electronic products for safe disposal and other measures which include responsibility of producers of electronic and electrical products for collection and channelizing of electronic waste.
