ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):At United Nations Conference on Climate Change (COP 26), India represented by NITI Aayog participated in the fourth ministerial dialogue of ‘non-binding’ Zero Emission Vehicles Transition Council (ZEVTC)’, a global forum on enhancing cooperation on transition to zero-emission vehicles. India, as ‘governments in emerging markets and developing economies’, supported a ‘non-binding’ Zero Emission Vehicles Transition Council (ZEVTC) declaration, which calls for working intensely towards accelerated proliferation and adoption of zero emission vehicles. No specific targets have been mentioned. While supporting the declaration on the above mentioned lines, India mentioned, “two-wheelers and three-wheelers constitute more than 70% of global sales and more than 80% in India. All governments should also support the transition of these light vehicles to zero emission vehicles”.All developed countries have been called to strengthen international collaboration and support so that a global, equitable and just transition is realised. India has already made great strides on introducing policies towards the faster adoption of electric mobility. India’s Transformative Mobility paradigm is shifting towards; shared, connected and electric, to meet our global commitments, and have positive implications for environment and reduce high import dependency on oil. To give an impetus to manufacturing and adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in India, Government of India is supporting the ecosystem through following national flagship schemes. i.	Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India II(FAME India II) scheme with an outlay of Rs.10,000 crore to incentivize demand for EVs in different segments by providing upfront subsidies and creating EV charging infrastructure.ii.	National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) with an outlay of Rs.18,100 crore to incentivize setting up of giga scale manufacturing facilities in the country for 50 Giga Watt Hour of ACC. iii.	Productivity Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for Automobile and Auto Components with an outlay of Rs.25,938 crore to incentivise manufacturing of high technology automobiles and automotive components with a focus on electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.***
