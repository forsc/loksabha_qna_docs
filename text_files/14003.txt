Cost incurred per tonne on import of coal during 2018-19 was Rs.7764. (e)&(f): All India coal production achieved a growth of 8.1% in 2018-19. During April 19 –Feb. 20, coal production declined by 0.64% as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. The decline in coal production is largely due to heavy rainfall witnessed in the coal mining areas in the current year which was around 25% more than the previous year. Further, rains also continued during the month of October. However, production has started showing an upward trend since November, 2019 and the country achieved highest ever production of 74.8 MT in the last five years in January, 2020 and 77.96 MT in February, 2020.  The focus of the Government is on accelerating domestic production of coal through allocation of more coal blocks, pursuing with State Government for assistance in land acquisition and coordinated efforts with Railways for movement of coal.In order to enhance domestic production, 25% of coal production has been allowed for sale of coal for newly allocated coal blocks.Further, for sale of coal, allowing 100% FDI for coal mining activities including associated processing infrastructure is expected to attract international players and create efficient and competitive coal market. In order to enhance coal production, Coal India Limited (CIL) has taken the following steps: •	CIL and its subsidiaries have planned and implemented higher capacity mega mines (Capacity>10MTY) with high mechanization. CIL has identified mines/projects for further capacity expansion plan till 2030.  •	Portal based monitoring of on-going projects to ensure timely completion of projects.•	Introduction of Surface Miners in opencast mines to improve operational efficiency and cater to environmental needs. During 2018-19, around 50% of the opencast coal production in CIL was through Surface miners.•	Introduction of Mass Production Technology in underground coal mines: 2 mines are worked with Powered Support Longwall technology and 11 mines are worked with Continuous Miner technology.****
