                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	India with its continuous efforts has significantly improved its preparedness to deal with natural calamities. Our Disaster Management Act 2005 articulates the need for mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) into development planning. The National Policy and National Plan on Disaster Management seek to build a safe and disaster resilient India. There are institutional mechanisms at the National, State & district level in the country to develop appropriate preparedness and prompt response mechanism for effective management of natural disasters. Central Government has established a robust early warning system and has significantly enhanced accuracy of weather forecasts. Forecasting agencies are continuing their efforts for the improvement of warning and dissemination systems vigorously. Mock exercises and community awareness programmes are being regularly conducted to educate people/farmers at the time of natural calamities.Contd…..2/-- 2 -	The National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (NCRMP) is under implementation in 8 coastal states with a total outlay of Rs. 4903 crore to mitigate the sufferings of the coastal community who are generally poor and vulnerable to various types of disasters. Cyclone shelters and early warning system created under this project proved to be of great help during cyclones ‘Phailin’ in 2013, ‘Hud-Hud’ in 2014, ‘Titli’ in 2018 and recent cyclone ‘Fani’.	The measures taken by the Central and State Governments have significantly improved disaster management practices, preparedness, prevention and response mechanism resulting in significant reduction in casualties during natural calamities, including cyclones, in the country. Further, strengthening of the disaster management 	is a continuing and evolving process of the governance. 	Financial assistance is provided to the farmers in the event of natural calamities, including cyclones, from National Disaster Response Fund. *******
