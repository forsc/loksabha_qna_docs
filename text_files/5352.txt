The Committee has submitted its Report to the Government in September, 2018. An Empowered Body has also been set up to monitor and review the progress against the recommendations. The Committee on Doubling Farmers’ Income (DFI) recognises agriculture as a value led enterprise and has identified seven major sources of growth, viz., improvement in crop productivity; improvement in livestock productivity; resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; increase in the cropping intensity; diversification towards high value crops; improvement in real prices received by farmers; and shift from farm to non-farm occupations. Several initiatives have already been rolled out on the recommendations of DFI Committee. All programmes of Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare are aligned to achieving these recommendations.Contd…2/--2-(b):	 Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management including conservation and artificial recharge to ground water in the Country is primarily States’ responsibility.Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) – Per Drop More Crop is implemented in all States including Haryana to focus on water use efficiency at farm level through precision/Micro Irrigation technologies, viz; drip and sprinkler irrigation systemes.

Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare is participating for increasing awareness about micro irrigation, changing cropping pattern, promotion of alternate crops, mechanization, among others for more production with less water.(c):	 With a view to ensure better transparency, accountability,  timely payment of claims to the farmers and to make the scheme more farmer friendly, Government has comprehensively revised the Operational Guidelines of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) which have become effective from Rabi 2018-19.
