ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	and (b)	The Government has notified Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. The Rules mandate the producers and the brand owners to work out modalities for waste collection system based on the principle of Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR)involving the State Urban Development Departments. Producers, importers and brand owners who introduce such products in the marketneed to establish a system for collection of used multi-layered plastic sachets, pouches or packaging, and register with the State Pollution Control Boards/Central Pollution Control Board.Till now, a total of 89 Brand-ownersand 4 Producers have been registered by CPCB having an EPR capacity of approximately 4 lakh tons per annum.  The above plastic waste is being used in various schemes such as co-processing in cement kilns, waste to energy plants, recycling and road construction.(c) and (d)	Ministry has taken several measures for the management of plastic waste. Considering the high environmental cost associated with the use of single-use plastic, particularly the adverse effect on soil, water bodies and on marine environment, Hon’ble Prime Minister has announced India’s pledge to phase out Single-use plastic by 2022. Many States/UTs through their own notifications have also imposed partial or complete prohibition on the use of plastic carry bags/single use plastic. 23 States and 9 UTs have issued notifications/orders introducing regulations pertaining to complete ban on plastic carry bags and/or other single-use plastic items.The Ministry had issued “Standard Guidelines for Single-Use Plastic” on 21st January 2019 to all States/UTs and Ministries. The Standard guidelines entail waste management system improvements, legal options for States/UTs to prohibit SUP items through regulatory measures, eco-friendly alternatives, social awareness and public education. The guidelines also included measures to be taken by government offices. Government has identified Compostable plastic as one of the alternatives. To promote the use of compostable plastic, the provision of minimum thickness of fifty microns has been made inapplicable to carry bags made up of compostable plastic, conforming to IS/ISO 17088. Some of the State Governments which have banned the use of plastic bags in their respective states are allowing only compostable plastic bags for plant nurseries, horticulture, agriculture and other use. Apart from the traditional material like jute bags, leaf plates, bamboo cutleries, the new material like bagasse based products, banana stem based products etc are now widely available in market. *****
