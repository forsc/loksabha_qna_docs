ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (e) Central Water Commission (CWC) monitors live storage status of 91 reservoirs of the country and issues weekly bulletin on every Thursday. As per latest bulletin dated 20.06.2019, live storage available in these reservoirs is 27.265 billion cubic meter (BCM), which is 17% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The live storage available in these reservoirs is 92% of the live storage of corresponding period of last year and 93% of live storage of average of last ten years.From the storage elevation curve for each reservoir, storage corresponding to actual water level is calculated. The requisite water levels in the reservoirs are maintained by the dam authorities, which are generally State Governments, Central and State power generating PSUs, Municipalities and private companies etc., through a determination of rainfall, flood levels and water demands.The main reasons for the decline in storage are low rainfall in catchment area and various uses during the period. To overcome the situation, CWC issued advisories to the concerned State Governments/UT''s for judicious use of available water to avoid any distress to people.Contd…P/2//2//Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management & conservation including rain water harvesting is primarily States’ responsibility. Central Government supports construction of water harvesting and conservation works primarily through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) aided by Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana –Watershed Development Component (PMKSY-WDC) and Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana – Per Drop More Crop. Under these Schemes, during the last three years, 17,56,027 water harvesting and conservations works have been completed for which Rs.23,435.67 crore was released as Central share.Other measures taken by the Central Government to control water depletion and promote rain water harvesting / conservation are at the following URL: http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf*****
