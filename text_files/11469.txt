ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a)	& (b): Government of India enacted National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013 on 05.07.2013 to provide subsidized foodgrains to the States/UTs. Schedule-l of the Act envisages distribution of Millets (nutri-cereals / coarse grain) at highly subsidized rate of Rs. 01 per kg in addition to wheat and rice..........2/--2-	Millets are already a part of Public Distribution System. The procurement, storage and distribution of Millets by States/UTs is done under Decentralized Procurement (DCP) system. Under this, the States/UTs which intend to distribute millets under Public Distribution System have to make an assessment of the quantity for procurement and distribution of Millets under PDS and get their procurement plan approved in advance from Government of lndia, so as to ensure that the procured quantity is distributed under PDS in that State only. Subsequently, the allocation of approved quantity of millet for distribution under PDS is made by this Department, while ensuring that the overall quantity of rice, wheat and millets has to be within the upper ceiling fixed in respect of each State/UT under NFSA. Responsibility for distribution of foodgrains within the State/UT rests with the concerned State/UT Govt.As per clause 9 of 9 TPDS (Control) Order, 2015, the State Government shall allow sale of commodities other than the foodgrains distributed under the Targeted Public Distribution System at the fair price shop to improve the viability of the fair price shop operations. This Department has no role to play in distribution other than rice, wheat and nutri-cereals (coarse grains).A Committee was also constituted in 2017 by the Prime Minister’s Office under the chairmanship of Prof Ramesh Chand, Member, NITI Aayog, to promote millets under PDS for greater nutritional support. The Committee after broad deliberation submitted its report dated 23.4.2018 covering all the areas titled “Improving nutrition through promotion of millets under PDS”. 		The details of nutri-cereals allocated by this Department during the last three years and the current year are at Annexure-I.(c):  	As PDS is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and the State/ UT Governments, as and when complaints are received by the Government, they are sent to State/UT Governments concerned for inquiry and appropriate action.(d):  	There is no such proposal under consideration. However, procurement of maize and its distribution under PDS is being done in the State of Uttar Pradesh since 2018-19.****Annexure-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) & (b) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.418 FOR ANSWER ON 04.02.2020 IN THE LOK SABHA.ALLOCATION OF NUTRI-CEREALS UNDER TPDS/NFSAS.
