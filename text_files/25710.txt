ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS (RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a)	According to NITI Aayog’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) India Index Report 2020-21, Bihar’s composite score (52 out of 100) on the SDGs is the lowest among all States. The Index has been constructed using 115 indicators across 16 SDGs. (b)	Some of the reasons for the lowest score of Bihar in the SDG India Index are as follows. A high proportion (33.74 per cent) of the population lives below the poverty line, and as high as 52.5 per cent suffers from multidimensional poverty. Only 12.3 per cent of households have any usual member covered by a health insurance. As high as 42 per cent of children under five years of age are stunted, which is the highest in the country.  It has the lowest literacy (64.7 per cent) in the age group of 15 years and above. The State has the highest Pupil Teacher Ratio (PTR) at secondary level (class 9-10) at 58, while the India average is at 21. It has the lowest Gross Value Added (constant prices) in agriculture per worker (in Lakhs/worker) at 0.29. The State also has the lowest mobile tele-density (50.65 per 100 people) and lowest number of internet subscribers (30.99 per 100 people).(c)	& (d) The Fourteenth Finance Commission, in its recommendations, has not made any distinction between General Category States and Special Category States in the horizontal distribution of shareable taxes among the States. After acceptance of the Fourteenth Finance Commission recommendations, the State’s share in divisible pool of central taxes has increased from 32 per cent as it used to be earlier to 42 per cent for the period 2015-20. This provides for more fiscal space to the States for implementation of projects.***
