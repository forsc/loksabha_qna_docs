ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b): 	Opening of Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) is a continuous process. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by the Ministries or Departments of the Government of India/State Governments/UT Administrations in the prescribed proforma, thereby committing resources for setting up the KV, as well as on availability of sanction of the Government. Proposals fulfilling the pre-requisites as per the norms of KVS are processed further for approval of the Competent Authority.(c) :	8 districts of Chhattisgarh, namely Balod, Baloda Bazar, Balrampur, Bemetara, Gariyaband, Mungeli, Surajpur and Gaurela Pendra do not have Kendriya Vidyalayas.(d) & (e) :	A proposal has been received from the State Government of Chhattisgarh in the prescribed format for opening of a new KV at Mungeli.  The State Government has earmarked 12 Acre of land at Village Lachhanpur and identified a temporary building comprising of 10 rooms at Government High School, Matgaon.   No proposal in the prescribed format has been received from the State Government for opening of new KVs at Bilaspur and Gaurela Pendra Marwahi. (f) 	As the proposals which have been found to be fulfilling the pre-requisites as per norms of KVS have to compete among other proposals under the “Challenge Method", before seeking the approval of the Competent Authority, no definite time frame can be given in this regard. *****
