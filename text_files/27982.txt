State can provide additional mandays of work over and above of 100 days from its own resources. An additional 50 days of wage employment is provided over and above 100 days in the notified drought affected areas or natural calamity areas in the country on recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. At present, there is no plan to increase days of work under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA. As per section 6(1) of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA), the Central Government may, by notification, specify the wage rate for its beneficiaries. Accordingly, the Ministry of Rural Development notifies Mahatma Gandhi NREGA wage rate every year for States/UTs.  To compensate the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA workers against inflation, the Ministry of Rural Development revises the wage rate every year based on change in Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labour (CPI-AL).  The wage rate is made applicable from 1st April of each Financial Year.  *********Annexure referred in reply to part (a) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.3504 dated 10.08.2021 (i)	Adult members of a rural household, willing to do unskilled manual work, may apply for registration in writing or orally to the local Gram Panchayat.(ii)	The Gram Panchayat after due verification will issue a Job Card free of cost within 15 days.(iii)	The worker has a right to demand and receive work within 15 days of the receipt of the application or the date of the demand in case of advance application, whichever is later, as mandated by the Act.(iv)	In case employment is not provided within fifteen days from the date of registration of the demand for work or the date from which work has been demanded in case of advance applications, whichever is later, the worker is legally entitled to a daily unemployment allowance.(v)	Preparation of Labour Budget (LB) which is an essential annual work plan document that entails planning, approval, funding and project execution modalities.(vi)	The shelf of projects for a village will be recommended by the gram sabha and approved by the zilla panchayat.
