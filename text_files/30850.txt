                                                        (a)      No Centrally Sponsored Scheme is being implemented by Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (MDoNER). However, during the last three years funds amounting to Rs.1467.51 crore have been released under various Central Sector Schemes of MDoNER to the Government of Assam. (b)	MDoNER does not release funds to Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) directly. However, the Ministry provided funds to the State Government of Assam under Special Package for Bodoland Territorial Council for various developmental projects. Under this package of Rs.750.00 crore, 65 projects for Rs.749.63 crore have been sanctioned, against which Rs.714.24 crore have been released including Rs.3.85 crore during the last three years. So far 54 projects worth Rs.589.11 crore have been completed and remaining projects are at various stages of implementation. (c) 	As stated above, the Ministry does not release funds to the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) directly. Funds to the Government of Assam for the sanctioned projects are released as and when all the requisite documents including utilisation certificates, physical and financial progress etc. are received from the State Government, as per the Scheme guidelines.(d) and (e)	A new Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) has been signed amongst Government of India, Government of Assam and Bodo Groups (ABSU and NDFB factions) on 27.01.2020. This MoS, inter alia, states that Government of Assam may earmark a sum of Rs.250.00 crore per annum for a period of three years for special development of area under BTC. Further, Government of India may contribute an additional amount of Rs.250.00 crore per annum for the same period.
