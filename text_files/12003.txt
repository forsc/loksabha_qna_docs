ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a) to (d):  A statement is laid on the Table of the HouseSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 90 FOR 7TH FEBRUARY, 2020(a) & (b) Medical Council of India (MCI) informed that there are a total 12,01,354 allopathic doctors registered with the State Medical Councils/Medical Council of India as on 30th September, 2019. Assuming 80% availability, it is estimated that around 9.61 lakh doctors may be actually available for active service. It gives a doctor-population ratio of 1:1404 as per current population estimate of 1.35 billion against the WHO prescribed ratio of 1:1000. The details of number of doctors registered with the concerned State Medical Council State/UT-wise including Chhattisgarh are at Annexure.(c) & (d) The Central Government has taken several steps to increase the number of medical seats in the country. 29185 MBBS seats increased during the last five years. The measures adopted include:i. Establishment of New Medical Colleges attached with district/referral hospitals in underserved districts of the country.ii. Strengthening/ upgradation of existing State Government/Central Government Medical Colleges to increase MBBS and PG seats.iii. Relaxation in the norms for setting up of Medical College in terms of requirement for faculty, staff, bed strength and other infrastructure.iv. Minimum requirement of land for establishment of medical college in metropolitan cities as notified under Article 243P(c) of the Constitution of India has been dispensed with.v. Enhancement of maximum intake capacity at MBBS level from 150 to 250.vi. DNB qualification has been recognized for appointment as faculty to take care of shortage of faculty.vii. Enhancement of age limit for appointment/ extension/ re-employment against posts of teachers/dean/principal/ director in medical colleges upto 70 years.viii. The ratio of teachers to students for Professor has been revised from 1:1 to 1:2 for all MD/MS disciplines and 1:1 to 1:3 in all clinical subjects in Government funded medical colleges and in Private medical colleges with 15 years standing. Further, for Associate Professor, the said ratio has been revised from 1:1 to 1:2 and 1:3 if he/she is a unit head in all clinical subjects in Government medical colleges and in Private medical colleges with 15 years standing. This would result in increase in number of PG seats in the country.ix. By amending the regulations, it has been made mandatory for all medical colleges to start PG courses within 3 years from the date of their MBBS recognition /continuation of recognition.x. Colleges are allowed to apply for PG courses in clinical subjects at the time of 4th renewal. It will serve to advance the process for starting PG courses by more than 1 year.xi. Provision has been made in the regulations to offer less number of seats to the applicant medical college, in case, it falls short of minimum prescribed requirements of applied intake to avoid wastage of human resources.xii. A Consortium (a group of 2 or upto 4 private organizations) has been allowed to establish a medical college.Shortage of doctors varies in different States. The shortage is more due to uneven rural-urban distribution. Public health and hospitals, being a State subject, the primary responsibility to ensure availability of doctors in public health facilities lies with the State/UT Governments and no data with regard to shortage of doctors in the States is maintained centrally. However, under the National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their healthcare systems including support for engagement of doctors on contractual basis, based on the requirements posed by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs). States are encouraged to adopt flexible norms for engaging specialist doctors for public health facilities. Financial support is also provided to States for providing performance-based incentives, hard area allowance, providing accommodation and transport facilities in rural and remote areas, sponsoring training programmes, etc for engaged human resources to address the issue of shortage in the public health facilities.
