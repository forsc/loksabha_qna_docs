ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI AND TRIBAL AFFAIRS(SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) Central Ground Water Board monitors the ground water level in the entire country including the State of Bihar on a regional scale at periodical intervals.  The District-wise status of ground water table in Bihar during the last three years 2018-2020 are given as Anneuxre.  The perusal of the water level data during November indicates depths to water levels in monitored wells are within 15 mbgl.(b) Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management including conservation and  water harvesting is primarily States’ responsibility.  However, the important measures taken by the Central Government for conservation, management of ground water and effective implementation of rain water harvesting in the country are available at the following URL:http://jalshakti-dowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_ Feb2021.pdf.In addition, a number of States have done notable work in the field of water conservation/harvesting.  Of these, mention can be made of ‘Mukhyamantri Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan’ in Rajasthan, ‘Jalyukt Shibar’ in Maharashtra, ‘Sujalam Sufalam Abhiyan’ in Gujarat, ‘Mission Kakatiya’ in Telangana, Neeru Chettu’ in Andhra Pradesh, Jal Jeevan Hariyali in Bihar, ‘Jal Hi Jeevan’ in Haryana among others.Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) is implementing National Aquifer Mapping and Management program (NAQUIM), which envisages mapping of aquifers (water bearing formations), their characterization and development of Aquifer Management Plans to facilitate sustainable management of Ground Water Resources.  The State-wise information is shared with States/Uts for implementation.    Contd…P/2//2//Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has prepared a Manual on Artificial Recharge to Groundwater which presents various techniques on artificial recharge and rainwater harvesting for rural as well as urban areas.  Further, CGWB has also prepared a “Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Ground Water, 2020”, which envisages construction of different types of artificial recharge structures in the Country in both rural and urban areas.As far as financial assistance is concerned Central Government supports construction of water harvesting and conservation works primarily through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana – Watershed Development Component (PMKSY-WDC).(c) As per the Dynamic Ground Water Resources carried out jointly by Central Ground Water Board and State Ground Water Department for the year 2020, there are only 07 Over exploited Blocks, 05 Critical Blocks in Bihar which constitutes about 02% of the total number of blocks assessed in the State and thus, serious groundwater conditions may not be contemplated in near future.Further, Bihar is implementing Jal Jeevan Haryali Scheme for sustainable management of water resources under which restoration of Ahar-pyne structures, renovation of old water bodies and plantation etc. are being taken up.***** ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) of Unstarred Question No.†619 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 22.07.2021 regarding “Ground water Table in Bihar”.District-wise Depth to water Level and Distribution of Percentage of Wells for the Period of November, 2018, BiharS.
