ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)       The State of Maharashtra has been sanctioned 30,947 km of road length under various interventions of Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) since inception. Out of which, the State has constructed 26,555 km of roads as on 15th December, 2021. The details of roads constructed in Maharashtra and other States under Pradhan Mantrai Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY),  State-wise as on 15th December, 2021, are given at Annexure-I. (b)     Central funds under PMGSY are released to State Government. Further funds are released at district and sub-district level by the State Government. The allocation of funds to the State for implementation of PMGSY depends, inter-alia, on works in hand, execution capacity of the State and unspent balance of previous year(s) available with the State. As per the programme Management Information Systems (MIS), the State of Maharashtra had an unspent balance (including state share and excluding security deposits) of Rs. 593.8 crore as on 1st April, 2021 and Rs. 421 crore as on 13th, December, 2021 for implementation of PMGSY including RCPLWEA. Thus, there is no dearth of funds in the state for implementation of PMGSY. The amount released to and expenditure including state share by the State of Maharashtra is given below:- Financial Year	      Amount Released         Expenditure Including state share                       (Rs. in crore)	        (Rs. in core)2018-19	                 6.75	                   204.192019-20	               150	                   234.502020-21	                 0	                   213.142021-22  (Upto 15.12.2021)	 0	                   173.90 District wise expenditure (including state share) for the last three years and the current year is given in Annexure-II. (c)     Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna (PMGSY-I) was launched as a one-time special intervention to provide rural connectivity, by way of a single all-weather road, to the eligible unconnected habitations of designated population size (500+ in plain areas and 250+ in North-Eastern States, Himalayan States and Himalayan Union Territories as per 2001 census) in the core network for uplifting the socio-economic condition of the rural population. Relaxation has been provided to the Desert Areas (as identified in the Desert Development Programme), the Tribal (Schedule V) areas and Selected Tribal and Backward Districts (as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs and Planning Commission) and unconnected habitations in these areas with a population of 250 persons and above in the Core Network as per Census 2001 are eligible for connectivity under the scheme. In the critical Left Wing Extremism affected blocks (as identified by Ministry of Home Affairs), additional relaxation has been given to connect habitations with population 100 persons and above as per 2001 census.  As the programme unfolded, a need was felt for consolidation of the existing Rural Road Network to improve its efficiency not only as a provider of transportation services, but also as a vehicle of social and economic development. Accordingly, in the year 2013, PMGSY-II was launched for upgradation of selected Through Routes and Major Rural Links (MRLs) with a target to upgrade 50,000 Km in various States and Union Territories.  Subsequently, in 2016, Road Connectivity Project for Left Wing Extremism (LWE) Affected Areas (RCPLWEA) for construction/upgradation of strategically important roads was launched in the 9 LWE affected states, as a separate vertical under PMGSY.  In the year 2019, Government launched PMGSY-III for consolidation of 1,25,000 Km Through Routes and Major Rural Links connecting habitations,  inter-alia, to Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs), Higher Secondary Schools and Hospitals. District-wise/Block-wise allocation of targets within the overall targets allocated to the States/UTs is done by the respective State Governments/Union Territories. The state of Maharashtra is allocated 6,550 km road length under PMGSY-III. The state has already been sanctioned 430 road works of 2,925.92 km road length under PMGSY-III.  The details of the sanctioned, completed and balance works under PMGSY including RCPLWEA in various districts of Maharashtra state are given in Annexure-III. The progress of state of Maharashtra under various verticals/interventions of the PMGSY including RCPLWEA is as under:- *Balance road length is less than the difference of sanctioned and completed length due to reduction in road length, change in alignment, construction of part length by other agencies, etc.(d)       Central funds under PMGSY are released to State Government as a whole. Further funds are released at district and sub-district level by the State Government. The details of the works sanctioned, completed and expenditure incurred in Yavatmal and Washim districts under various interventions of the PMGSY are as under:-Yavatmal:*Balance road length is less than the difference of sanctioned and completed length due to reduction in road length, change in alignment, construction of part length by other agencies, etc.  (e)        As per the programme guidelines, the timeline for completion of road work is 12 working months from the date of issue of the work order. However, where a package comprises more than one roadwork, the total time given for completion of the package is 18 calendar months. Similarly, a time period of 21-24 months has been allowed for completion of bridge works exceeding 25-meter in length, depending on site conditions.  PMGSY-I & II are targeted for completion by Sept. 2022, RCPLWEA by March 2023 and PMGSY-III is targeted for completion by March 2025.*****
