ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) to (e) :  Power Finance Corporation (PFC) Ltd. conducts a study of the financial condition of Power Utilities every year and publishes a “Report on Performance of State Power Utilities”, which also includes the evaluation of the AT&C losses. As per their latest ''Report on Performance of State Power Utilities'' for the year 2019-20, the annual Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses for the country was 20.93%. The State-wise and year-wise details of AT&C losses including Bihar are given at Annexure.The AT&C losses for Bihar stand at 40.38% while the national average for AT&C losses is 20.93%. The reasons for high AT&C losses are mainly managerial deficiencies. The losses are primarily because the tariffs are non-reflective of costs; poor billing and collection efficiencies; non-payment of electricity dues by State Government department; non-payment/short payment by the State Government against the subsidies announced by them. All these aspects are related to deficiencies in governance. Government of India have decided that assistance under the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme will be conditional on the States and their DISCOMs taking steps to reduce their AT&C losses. (f) & (g) : 	No, Sir.  No such proposal has been received.*********
