RCS - UDAN is market driven scheme. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN. Airports Authority of India (AAI), the implementing agency for RCS - UDAN has conducted third round of bidding and awarded 335 valid RCS routes to 11 Selected Airline Operators (SAOs) under this round. RCS flight operations have already commenced from Kolhapur. RCS flights could not be commenced from Sholapur, due to obstacles i.e. Chimneys in the Flying Path. List of RCS - UDAN routes operationalized in the state of Maharashtra under RCS - UDAN is enclosed at Annexure.
