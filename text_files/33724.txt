The details of these Schemes/projects are given below: (i) 	The Department of Rural Development (DoRD), Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS), Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), Deendayal Antayodaya Yojana- National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM), DeenDayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETI) and Shyama Prasad  Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM). (ii) 	The Department of Land Resources (DoLR), Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Watershed Development Component (WDC) of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) in 28 States (except Goa) which is principally development of rainfed portions of net cultivated area and culturable wastelands.   The State-wise status of progress of these schemes/projects during the last two years and the current year are given at Annexure-I.(b): 	Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) accords emphasis for targeted implementation of its schemes/projects. In order to ensure that the schemes reach closure, the Ministry has evolved a comprehensive multi-level and multi-format system of monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of rural development schemes, including Performance Review Committee Meetings, District Development Co-ordination and Monitoring Committee (“DISHA”) meetings, National Level Monitors (NLMs), Area Officers Schemes, Common Review Mission, Concurrent Evaluation and Impact Assessment Studies. The schemes of the Rural Development have been brought upon end-to-end transaction based MIS, which enables all the stakeholders to monitor status of schemes in a real time basis. The works are photographed with geo-tags & time stamps. All the data of RD schemes are available on public domain. In addition to above, the Ministry arranged for sufficient fund for completion of works and further, bottlenecks like forest clearance that require facilitation with Ministry of Environment & Forests or Banks are also arranged.  Social Audits are also conducted by some Schemes like Mahatma Gandhi NREGS and PMAY-G. Appointment of Ombudsman are also made for attending to any grievances regarding MGNREGA works. In addition, grievance redressal is being given due attention in all schemes of the Rural Development. State specific reviews of States/UTs are also undertaken from time to time.(c):   	The State/UT-wise details of funds allocated/released during the last two years along with the amount of funds spent by each State under the Schemes of the Ministry of Rural Development are given at Annexure-II.******
