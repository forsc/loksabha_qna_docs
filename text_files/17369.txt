ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a):  Yes Sir. ;;(b) & (c):  Air India has done route economics analysis for the period April, 2019 to March, 2020. The details are annexed.;(d):  Air India is a network carrier and operates to 56 domestic and 44  international destinations. Air India continuously monitors the market developments, performance of its flights and carries out studies with an objective to withdraw, to introduce new routes or increase / decrease frequency on existing routes. Air India has withdrawn flights which were not meeting their fuel/variable cost.  However, Air India analyses the reasons for the losses and based on the strategic importance of such services to its network arrives at a decision whether to continue or withdraw such services. Also some domestic routes show losses but actually these routes feed connections to major routes so those cannot be withdrawn or replaced with smaller aircraft. Non-profitability of any single route is not taken in isolation only on its financial performance. However, the main reasons for incurring  losses include inter-alia:i.     Low demand on sectorsii.     Competitive fares by the rival carriersiii.     Cost of operations being higher as Air India is a full service carrier as compared to other airlines some of which are low cost carrier.
