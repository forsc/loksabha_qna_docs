Financial support is also provided to States for providing performance-based incentives, hard area allowance, providing accommodation and transport facilities in rural and remote areas, sponsoring training programmes, etc for engaged human resources to address the issue of shortage in the public health facilities.Also, States are advised to put in place transparent policies of posting and transfer, and ensure rational deployment of healthcare professionals. As the posts required for health facilities are filled up by respective State/UT Governments, they are impressed upon from time to time to fill up the vacant posts.As per RHS-2018, State/UT wise availability of healthcare professionals and vacancy thereof is given at Annexure-II. Also, as per NHM-MIS, State/UT wise status of healthcare professionals including doctors, specialists etc. recruited on contractual basis under NHM is given at Annexure-III.
