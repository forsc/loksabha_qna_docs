ANSWER




                                                        (a)	& (b): Government of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) had been requested to submit the revised proposals for Metro Rail Projects for Vijayawada and Vishakhapatnam in line with Metro Rail Policy, 2017. GoAP did not submit any revised proposal in this regard. However, GoAP submitted a proposal for external financial assistance from Korean EXIM Bank for a Light Metro Rail Project in  Visakhapatnam  on  Public  Private  Partnership  (PPP)   mode.  The Korean side, after examining the proposal conveyed their inability to finance the Project. The GoAP was, therefore, advised that the project proposal may be posed by them to other bilateral/ multilateral agencies for loan assistance through web portal of the Department of Economic Affairs as per the extant guidelines. (c)&(d) Urban Transport, which is an integral part of urban development, is a state subject.Therefore, formulation of proposals in regard to Metro rail projects with appropriate funding pattern, along with preparation of Comprehensive Mobility Plan, Alternative analysis report, Detailed Project Report etc., are done by the respective State Governments.                                  *****
