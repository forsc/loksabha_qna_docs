                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):	On 15th August 2020, Hon’ble Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi announced the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) following which NDHM pilot was launched in the Union Territories of Chandigarh, Ladakh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Puducherry, Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep.The budget allocated for NDHM for the year 2020-21 is Rs 30 crore.(b):	Creation of Health ID under National Digital Health Mission is not mandatory for citizens.(c):	Stakeholder consultations for NDHM and NDHM building blocks were conducted with participation from various state medical councils, medical associations, hospitals, insurance companies, licensing authorities, officials from central and state governments, development organizations and NGOs and software developers/technical partners in July, 2020.Shri J. Satyanarayana, (retd. IAS 1977, Andhra Pradesh cadre) Senior Advisor-IT, NHA was also consulted in this regard.The services of M/s Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy were obtained for Health Data Management Policy.(d):	The status of issuance of Health IDs in the 6 UTs where NDHM pilot has been rolled out, as on 8th February 2021 is as under:UT	No. of Health IDs createdAndaman & Nicobar Islands	2,04,353Lakshadweep	19,569Ladakh	57,460Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu 	75,886Puducherry	3,10,015Chandigarh	1,38,391Total	8,05,674The budget allocated for Health IDs for the year 2020-21 is Rs 1.06 cr. The expenditure on Health IDs till 31.12.2020 is Rs 52.02 lakhs.There is no provision for state/UT wise budget and expenditure.(e) & (f):	An individual may choose to create a Health-ID under the NDHM. Upon opting to create a Health-ID, only basic demographic and geographic information of the beneficiary like name, year of birth, gender, mobile number and address are collected. This system can be used to create Personal Health Records for each individual wherein records generated by various Health Information Providers like doctors, healthcare facilities and laboratories can be collated and viewed by that individual and by healthcare providers with the consent of the individual only. The data pertaining to medical records will be stored in a federated architecture as described in the National Digital Health Blueprint released by the Government of India in 2019. This data is being captured even now as a part of doctor-patient or healthcare provider-individual interaction. Under the NDHM, it shall be possible for other healthcare providers to access this data with the consent of the individual concerned. The health data pertaining to an individual will remain at the facility level only and no central repository of medical records is envisaged to be created in NDHM.The Government gives highest priority to data security and privacy. It is inbuilt in the design of NDHM. All applicable laws, rules and judgments of Hon’ble Supreme Court are being followed. Health Data Management Policy has also been approved. Apart from various legal provisions, all technical solutions possible to ensure data privacy and security are being put in place.              As mentioned in the National Digital Health Blueprint (NDHB), the guiding document for NDHM implementation, use of secure health networks and government community cloud infrastructure, as defined by MeitY, is being used for hosting of data. All events on this cloud infrastructure would be under 24x7 surveillance to ensure highly secure environment.            One of the key aspects of information security framework under NDHM highlights Privacy by Design as one of the key guiding principles. It aims to ensure that health data and its transfer are always compliant and adhere to all privacy requirements. All the building blocks that require handling personal health records are being designed to comply with such policy ab-initio.            Further, medical records are made available to anyone only with the consent of the individual or his/her nominee.
