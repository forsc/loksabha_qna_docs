ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)( a):	As per information available, no request for increasing the interest subvention rate on crop loans for farmers to 6 per cent has been received. However, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare implements the Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS) which provides concessional short-term Agri-loans to the farmers practising Crop husbandry, Animal husbandry, Dairying and fisheries. ISS is available to farmers availing short-term crop loans upto Rs.3.00 lakh at an interest rate of 7% per annum for one year. Additional 3% subvention is also given to the farmers for prompt and timely repayment of loans (Prompt Repayment Incentive- PRI); thus reducing the effective rate of interest to 4% per annum. In addition to this, many of the State Governments provide further interest subvention to the eligible farmers making the crop loans available even zero percent in certain cases. (b):	In view of reply to ( a), the question does not arise.(c):	No, Sir.(d):	There is no such proposal under consideration of this Department.******
