                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):	The Ministry of Rural Development, inter alia, is implementing Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) and Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G) etc. in rural areas of the country. PMGSY: PMGSY is a one-time special intervention of Government to provide connectivity by way of a single all-weather road with necessary culverts and cross drainage structures, to the eligible unconnected habitations in the core network. The programme envisages connecting all eligible unconnected habitations with a population of 500 persons and above (as per 2001 Census) in plain areas and 250 persons and above (as per 2001 Census) in Special Category States, Tribal (Schedule-V) areas, the Desert Areas and in Selected Tribal and Backward Districts. For most intensive Integrated Action Plan (IAP) blocks, the unconnected habitations with population 100 and above (as per 2001 Census) are eligible to be covered under PMGSY. PMGSY also permits upgradation (to prescribed standards) of existing rural roads in districts where all the eligible habitations of the designated population size have been provided all weather road connectivity. The funds under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) are released to the State Governments for the projects sanctioned, based upon their absorption capacity, balance works in hand, unspent balance available, and fulfilling of certain conditions laid down as per the programme guidelines PMAY-G: To meet the objective of ‘Housing for All by 2022’, PMAY-G aims at construction of 2.95 crores houses from 2016-17 to 2021-22. PMAY-G beneficiaries are provided financial assistance of Rs 1.20 lakh in plain areas and Rs. 1.30 lakh in hilly States, difficult areas and Integrated Action Plan (IAP) districts. An additional assistance of Rs. 12000/- is extended for toilets through convergence with Swachh Bharat Mission- Gramin (SBM-G), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) or any other dedicated source of funding . In addition to the above, there is a provision of 90/95 persondays of unskilled labour wage under MGNREGS to the beneficiaries for construction of houses. Financial releases under PMAY-G are commensurate to the target allocated to the States.  *****
