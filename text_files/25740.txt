ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS (SHRI DEVUSINH CHAUHAN)(a) 	BharatNet project is being implemented in a phased manner to provide broadband connectivity to all Gram Panchayats (GPs) in the country. The scope of BharatNet has been extended recently upto all inhabited villages beyond GPs. As on 02.07.2021, a total number of 1,57,383 Gram Panchayats have been made Service Ready under the Project.(b)	In Chhattisgarh, the implementation of BharatNet Phase-I has already been completed and BharatNet Phase-II is being implemented by the State Government under State-led model. The District-wise details of Chhattisgarh, including Durg parliamentary constituency (namely Durg and Bemetara Districts) are given in Annexure-I. (c)	The implementation of BharatNet Phase-II in Chhattisgarh under the State-led model is delayed. Long time taken in obtaining Right of Way (RoW) permissions, difficult terrain and issues in carrying out work in the State’s Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas have also impacted the project progress. Since March 2020, pursuant to lockdown and movement restrictions due to COVID-19, the progress of the project has been further adversely affected.For expediting the implementation of the project, close monitoring by Department of Telecommunications (DoT), Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) and Bharat Broadband Network Limited (BBNL) is being done, and regular review meetings are held with the State Government/Implementing Agency. Further, State Level Implementation Committee chaired by Chief Secretary of the State has also been constituted to monitor the progress of the project and to resolve the issues in a timely manner.
