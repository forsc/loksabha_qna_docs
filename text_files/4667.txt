ANSWER




                                                        (a)		 Development of Shipping including shipbuilding, ship repair and shipping services is primarily a private sector activity.  To promote ship building in the country a scheme to provide financial assistance to shipyards is being implemented.  Cochin Shipyard Ltd. (CSL), a PSU of Ministry of Shipping is presently implementing two major projects viz. Large Dry Dock at CSL premises and an International Ship Repair Facility on land leased from Cochin Port Trust.  The implementation of both these projects is progressing smoothly.  (b)		 Expansion, modernization and upgradation of Major Ports meant to promote shipping and trade in the country is an ongoing process.   This is done through various infrastructure projects conceived by the ports and implemented either from the ports own resources or through Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. Most of these projects, after award are executed as per the relevant contractual timelines. However, a few projects could not progress as per the contractual timelines for various reasons like delays in environment clearance, non-fulfillment of the conditions precedent, lack of funds with the concessionaire etc. (c)	& (d) Yes, Sir. The various government projects in the ports and shipping sector are monitored regularly at various levels in the concerned organizations as well as in the Ministry of Shipping to ensure their timely completion.(e)	Various measures have been taken in recent years to make the shipping industry more attractive and competitive.  These are reduction in GST from 18% to 5% on bunker fuel used in Indian flag vessels; providing cargo support to  Indian shipping industry through Right of First Refusal (RoFR); allowing shipping enterprises based in India to acquire ships abroad and flag them in the country of their convenience; bringing in parity in the tax regime of Indian seafarers employed on Indian flag ships vis-à-vis those on foreign flag ships;  removal of licensing requirement for chartering of foreign registered ships by citizens of India; encouraging coastal movement of agriculture and other commodities, fertilizer,   EXIM Transshipment Containers and Empty containers etc.                                             *****
