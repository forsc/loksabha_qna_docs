Also, no staff was made available by the Department of Posts to man the Wellness Centre. CGHS explored the options for accommodation to house the Wellness Centre. The Department of Posts offered two Type-IV Staff Quarters. These quarters have been taken over by CGHS and renovated to make them suitable for running a Wellness Centre. Furniture and other infrastructure have been provided. To run the Wellness Centre, one regular Medical Officer and one Pharmacist are posted and action has been taken to engage two Medical Officers, Nursing Officer and support staff on contract basis till regular incumbents are posted.
