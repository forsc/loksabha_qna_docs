Thereafter, the matter was reviewed from time to time and keeping in view the interests of the vulnerable sections of the population, the prices have been kept unchanged since the implementation of the Act. Further, to safeguard the interests of the NFSA beneficiaries in the wake of ongoing Covid pandemic, no proposal for revision in the Central Issue Prices is pending at the moment with the Government. *****
