ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E RMINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a): 	Under the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), inter-alia the inclusion and exclusion of beneficiaries is the responsibility of the respective State/UT Governments. Further, inclusion and exclusion of beneficiaries under NFSA is an ongoing process as per the eligibility criteria evolved by the States/UTs. Accordingly, leveraging the implementation of information technology for Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) reforms under NFSA, digitization of ration cards/beneficiaries’ data, de-duplication process, permanent migration, deaths, identification of ineligible/duplicate/fake ration cards, etc. the States/UTs so far have reported cancellation of about 4.28 Crore ration cards during the period 2014 to 2021. However, linking or non-linking of Aadhaar with ration cards is not a criterion for deletion/cancellation of ration cards under NFSA. A statement showing State/UT wise, and year wise number of ration cards deleted by States/UTs during 2014 to 2021 is at Annexure.(b) & (c): 	To ensure all NFSA beneficiaries are in receipt of their monthly foodgrains in full quantities as per the entitlements of their Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and Priority Household (PHH) ration cards, all States/UT have been advised vide time to time letters, meetings and video conferences to ensure the distribution of foodgrains at FPSs through transparent electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) device transactions, along with biometric authentication of beneficiaries and provide ePoS printed transaction receipts to all beneficiaries in local/bilingual languages.(d): 	Under the Notification dated 08/02/2017 (as amended from time to time), issued by the Department pursuant to Section-7 of the Aadhaar Act 2016, the timeline given to all States/UTs for linking of Aadhaar numbers of beneficiaries with their ration cards has been extended up to 31/03/2022. Until then, as per the extant instructions of the Department vide letters dated 24/10/2017 and 08/11/2018, States/UTs have been advised that no genuine NFSA beneficiary/household shall be denied from receiving their entitled quota of subsidized foodgrains only for want of Aadhaar; or due to failure of biometric/Aadhaar authentication due to network/ connectivity/ linking related issues, poor biometrics of the beneficiary or any other technical reasons.(e): 	States/UTs were also advised to integrate electronic weighing machines/scales with ePoS devices at all FPSs to ensure correct and transparent weighment of foodgrains by FPS dealers at the time of distribution. Presently, around 90% of monthly foodgrains allocated by the Department are distributed by the States/UTs through ePoS transactions.***** ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.3371 FOR ANSWER ON 23.03.2022 IN THE LOK SABHA.Statement showing State/UT wise, and year wise number of ration cards deleted by States/UTs during 2014 to 2021:Sl.
