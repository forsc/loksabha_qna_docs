However, some stocks are temporarily kept in “Cover and Plinth” (CAP) storage which is a scientific method of foodgrain storage. The details of steps taken by FCI/Department of Food and Public Distribution  for management of stocks are:i.	Foodgrains in ‘Cover and Plinth’ (CAP) storage are stored on elevated plinths and wooden crates are used as dunnage material. Stacks are properly covered with specifically fabricated low-density black polythene water -proof covers and tied with nylon ropes/nets.ii.	The quality of foodgrains is monitored at regular intervals by a system of checks at different levels to ensure proper preservation of foodgrains in storage.	iii.	Inspection of stocks is done on following basis:-	By Technical Assistants (TAs) 100% on fortnightly basis/ 33% on monthly basis by Manager(QC)/fortnightly inspection by Divisional Manager and AGM(QC). Besides, various squads conduct inspection from time to time.........2/--2-iv.	Prophylactic (spraying of insecticides) and curative treatments (fumigation) are carried out regularly and timely in godowns for the control of stored grain insect pests as given below:-	Malathion- once in 15 days.-	Aluminium Phosphide – fumigation, as and when required             (9 gms/MT plus 20% additional)v.	Aeration of stocks is done to avoid condensation and maintain the quality of the stocks.(b): The Government implements the following schemes through FCI  for Stocks augmenting and modernizing the existing storage capacity: i.	Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) Scheme: Under this Scheme formulated in 2008, storage capacity is created by private parties, Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and State Government Agencies for guaranteed hiring by FCI. As on 31.12.2019, a total capacity of 143.63 LMT has been created.  Under this scheme, no funds are allocated by Government for construction of godowns and full investment is done by the private parties/CWC/State Agencies.ii.	Central Sector Scheme (erstwhile Plan Scheme): This scheme is implemented in the North Eastern States along with a few other States. Funds from annual budgetary allocation are released by the Government of India to FCI and also to the State Governments for construction of godowns. A total capacity of 1,84,175 MT has been completed by FCI and State Governments during the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-17). This scheme has been extended from 01.04.2017 to 31.03.2022. A capacity of 51,925 MT has been created by FCI & State Governments from 01.04.2017 to 31.12.2019. iii.	Construction of Steel Silos: In addition to conventional godowns, Government of India has also approved an action plan for construction of steel silos in the country for a capacity of 100 LMT in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode for modernizing storage infrastructure and improving shelf life of stored foodgrains. As on 31.12.2019, steel silos of 7.25 LMT capacity have been created.Further, Government of India has granted in-principle approval for construction of 90 LMT of storage facilities under Covered and Plinth (CAP) hiring Scheme (2019) of Food Corporation of India (FCI) for accommodating the wheat stocks for the ensuing Rabi Marketing Season (RMS) 2020-21.In addition, godowns are hired under Private Warehousing Scheme (PWS) to address immediate/urgent requirement of storage space. Godowns under PWS can be hired after hiring all the capacity available with CWC/State Warehousing Corporations (SWCs)/State Agencies/PEG capacity available.                                    ****
