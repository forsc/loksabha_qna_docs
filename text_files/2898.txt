ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT 	(SHRI KRISHANPAL GURJAR)(a) & (b) Yes, Sir. To encourage Private Sector to employ Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), a scheme of incentive to employers in the Private Sector for providing employment to PwDs was launched in 2008-09. The scheme is being implemented through Employees Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) and Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC).  In order to make it more attractive for the Private Sector and also to address the issues relating to employability and availability of skilled man power related to (PwDs), the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD) has revised the scheme w.e.f. 1st April, 2016.   The details of the revised scheme are as under: •	Payment of employers’ contribution towards the EPF and ESI shall be borne by the Government for a period ten years instead of three years at present.•	The employers need not deposit the EPF/ESI contribution in respect of their PwD employees. The employers’ contribution shall be deposited to the respective accounts of PwD employees by EPFO and ESIC. DEPwD shall make payment to EPFO/ESIC in advance.•	All eligible persons with disabilities employed in the private sector are covered under the scheme, irrespective of any salary or wage ceiling.•	The applicable administrative charges on EPF/ESI contribution presently required to be deposited by the employers shall be borne by the Government.•	Payment of One-third of the gratuity amount due and admissible to a PwD employee shall be paid by the Government.•	In case a Private Employer engages a PwD as apprentice and employs him/her on completion of the apprenticeship period, the stipend payable to the PwD during the apprenticeship period shall be borne by the Government. (c) Does not arise in view of above.*****
