                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(DR. SUBHAS SARKAR)(a) to (d) The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country for providing good quality modern education to the talented children predominantly from rural areas. All the districts (as on 31st May, 2014) of the States / UTs, which have accepted the scheme, have been covered. Opening of new JNVs is a continuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government / UT administration to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of the permanent building and making available required temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV depends on the availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority. Out of total 20 Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) sanctioned in the State of West Bengal, 19 are functional and remaining 01 JNV in Malda district is non-functional for want of suitable temporary accommodation and transfer of land in favour of Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti by the State Government.Opening of new KVs is a continuous process. KVs are opened primarily to cater to the educational needs of the wards of transferable Central Government Employees including Defence & Para-Military personnel, Central Autonomous Bodies, Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and Central Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) by providing a common programme of education. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations and committing resources for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities found fulfilling the mandatory pre-requisites for opening of new KVs have to compete with other such proposals under the “Challenge Method” and subject to approval of the competent authority.  At present, 62 Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs), including 03 in Malda district, are functional in West Bengal.  Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan has not received any proposal in prescribed proforma for opening of a new KV in Malda, Uttar Parliament Constituency from the State Government of West Bengal.(e) to (g)  The details of funds allocated/granted/released/yet to be released/due under various schemes under the Department of School Education & Literacy, Ministry of Education, Government of India to the State of West Bengal during the last three years are as follows:-Under Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) and Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) schemes, funds are not allocated State/UT-wise.Samagra Shiksha Scheme<pre>                                                                                     (Rs. in lakh)Year	Amount approved as Centre Share	Amount released2018-19	109365.00	108934.522019-20	163526.00	157905.492020-21	133877.32	132743.02</pre>(a) the amount released for the better education of poor students in Nashik District of Maharashtra; and(b) the details of performance of the Government in the education for poor students?PM Poshan Scheme (earlier known as Mid-Day Meal)<pre>                                                                           (Rs. in lakh)Year	Central Assistance Allocated / Released 2018-19	91710.012019-20	107102.662020-21	134330.72</pre>A supplementary requirement of Central Assistance due to increase in additional numbers of children over and above the PAB-MDM approval for the year 2020-21 amounting to Rs 2290.96 lakh is being released to the State Govt. of West Bengal during this year.
