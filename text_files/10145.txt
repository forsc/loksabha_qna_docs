As per available information, there are 58 posts of functional Directors in various CPSEs which are currently not filled on regular basis. Of these 58 posts, 41 are pertaining only to the calendar year 2019. The recommendations of Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) are already available in respect of 29 posts of Functional Directors and selection process in respect of 12 posts has been initiated by PESB. Further, 274 positions of Independent Directors are vacant in various CPSEs. In order to fill up the posts of Independent Directors in a timely manner, recommendations for filling up 521 positions on the Boards of various CPSEs have been made during the last three years, i.e. 2017, 2018 and 2019 (till date),*****
