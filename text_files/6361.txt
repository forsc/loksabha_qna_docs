ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)a)	The Budget target for disinvestment during 2019-20 has been set at Rs. 1,05,000 crore. For achieving disinvestment targets, the Government uses various modes of disinvestment including Initial Public Offer (IPO), Offer For Sale (OFS), Buyback of Shares, Strategic Disinvestment and Exchange Traded Funds (ETF). The execution and outcome of disinvestment transactions is dependent on the prevailing market conditions and investor interest. b)	The list of CPSEs ''In-principle'' approved for strategic disinvestment by CCEA is at Annexure-I. The decision regarding strategic disinvestment of BPCL has not yet been taken by CCEA.c)	The details of proceeds received due to disinvestment of PSUs during 2014-15 to 2018-19 are at Annexure-II.d)	Government has been following policy of strategic disinvestment which is guided by the economic principle that Government should not continue in business in sectors, where competitive markets have come of age and economic potential of such entities may be better discovered in the hands of strategic investor due to factors such as infusion of capital, technological upgradation and efficient management practices. Profitability of CPSEs is not the criteria for selection of CPSE, for this purpose. Besides, in certain other CPSEs, which also include profit-making CPSEs, policy of minority stake sale without transfer of management control through various SEBI approved methods, is also being followed.e)	Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) function under the administrative control of their respective Ministries/ Departments. The administrative Ministries/ Departments take measures for revival/ restructuring in respect of CPSEs under their administrative control on a case to case basis. In this regard, Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) has issued guidelines on 29.10.2015 on revival/ restructuring of CPSEs. These guidelines are implemented by the concerned administrative Ministries/ Departments of CPSEs.f)	BSNL and MTNL have been incurring losses since 2009-10. On the basis of their financial performance, BSNL and MTNL were classified by DoT as "Incipient sick CPSE" in 2017. As per the guidelines dated 29.10.2015 issued by Department of Public Enterprises on "Streamlining the mechanism for revival and restructuring of sick/incipient sick and weak Central Public Sector Enterprises”, DoT initiated the process for preparation of restructuring/revival plan of BSNL/MTNL. IIM Ahmedabad and M/s Deloitte were engaged to prepare a Revival/Restructuring plan for BSNL and MTNL respectively. Based on their reports, DoT, in consultation with BSNL/MTNL, prepared a comprehensive revival plan. The revival plan was submitted for the consideration of the Cabinet which was approved by it in its meeting held on 23.10.2019. The revival plan consists of several measures including reduction of staff cost through Voluntary Retirement Scheme, allotment of spectrum for 4G services, monetization of land and building, tower and fiber assets of BSNL/MTNL, debt restructuring through sovereign guarantee bonds and in-principle approval of merger of BSNL and MTNL. BSNL, MTNL and Government have initiated the process for implementation of these measures.Annexure- IDetails of CPSEs approved for Strategic Divestment 1)	Scooters India Ltd.2)	Bridge & Roof India Ltd.3)	Project & Development India Ltd.4)	Pawan Hans Ltd.5)	Bharat Pumps Compressors Ltd.6)	Central Electronics Ltd.7)	Hindustan Prefab Ltd.8)	Bharat Earth Movers Ltd.9)	Hindustan Newsprint Ltd.
