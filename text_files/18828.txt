The objectives of Fund of Funds include accelerating innovation driven entrepreneurship and business creation, mobilizing larger equity-like resources for startups. The Fund of Funds does not directly invest in startups, instead provides capital to SEBI-registered Alternate Investment Funds (AIFs), known as daughter funds, who in turn invest money in growing Indian startups through equity and equity-linked instruments. SIDBI has been given the mandate of managing this Fund through selection of suitable daughter funds and overseeing the disbursal of committed capital.ii)	Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS) - The Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS) has been approved by the Government in January,2021 with a corpus of Rs. 945 Crore for next 4 years starting from 2021-22. The scheme aims to provide financial assistance to startups for proof of concept, prototype development, product trails, market entry and commercialization. This would enable these startups to graduate to a level where they will be able to raise investments from angel investors or venture capitalists, or seek loans from commercial banks or financial institutions. The Seed Fund will be disbursed to eligible startups through eligible incubators across India.******
