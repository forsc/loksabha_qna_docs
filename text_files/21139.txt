ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ?????? (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) : In order to provide old age protection to unorganized sector workers, the Government of India has launched a flagship scheme namely, Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM) in March, 2019, which is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme.   The workers in the age group of 18-40 years whose monthly income is Rs. 15000/- or less and not a member of Employee Provident Fund Organization (EPFO)/Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC)/(National Pension Scheme (NPS) can join the scheme.  Under the scheme, 50% monthly contribution is payable by the beneficiary and equal matching contribution is paid by the Central Government.   Each subscriber under the PM-SYM, shall receive minimum assured pension of Rs 3000/- per month after attaining the age of 60 years.  As on 22.02.2021, over 8.94 lakh persons including farmers have been registered under the scheme in Haryana.(b) : Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) has been introduced from Kharif 2016 to provide a simple and affordable crop insurance product to ensure comprehensive risk cover for crops of farmers against all non-preventable natural risks from pre-sowing to post-harvest and timely settlement of claims.   Haryana Government is implementing the scheme since its inception.  As the major part of the scheme is being implemented on Area Approach basis and season-end claims are worked out on the basis of yield data submitted by the concerned State Government, therefore, reasons for crop loss/ claims are not looked into or not known. Hence, risk/peril-wise details i.e. due to flood, drought, pest attack, etc., of claims are not maintained for wide spread calamities/season-end claims under the scheme.   Season-wise/Year-wise details of coverage including claims paid in Sonipat district under the scheme are given in following table :(Rs. in lakhs)Season	Farmer Applications Enrolled	Gross Premium	Claims Paid	Farmers benefitted (to whom claims paid)Kharif 2016	43067	1224.14	1705.66	12326Rabi 2016-17	30622	662.25	174.75	851Kharif 2017	33588	1130.48	1688.47	4581Rabi 2017-18	37812	851.27	106.03	1092Kharif 2018	39311	1419.99	2771.11	9885Rabi 2018-19	34579	1059.3	3071.96	7635Kharif 2019	34120	1355.61	3873.92	10826Rabi 2019-20	36767	998.21	2040.6	13528Total	289866	8701.25	15432.5	60724*******
