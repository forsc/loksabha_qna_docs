GOI is supplementing the efforts of the State Governments in addressing the challenges of pollution of river Ganga and its tributaries by providing financial and technical assistance. Under Namami Gange Programme, 24 sewerage infrastructure projects at an estimated cost of Rs.4773 crore have been sanctioned for creation / rehabilitation of 1940 Million Litres per Day (MLD) Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) capacity in Yamuna river basin, including tributaries (Hindon and Chambal) of river Yamuna. These 24 projects are spread in Himachal Pradesh (1 project), Haryana (2 projects), Delhi (10 projects), Uttar Pradesh (10 projects) and Rajasthan (1 project). Out of these 5 projects have been completed.Stringent monitoring, regulation and enforcement towards compliance of Grossly Polluting Industries against regulatory framework mandated under Consent mechanism issued in respect of provisions of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 is undertaken through Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) and Pollution Control Committees (PCC). Contd…P/2//2//Industry specific effluent/emission standards are notified by Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change under Schedule-I: ‘Standards for Emission or Discharge of Environmental Pollutants from Various Industries’ of Environment Protection Act, 1986.  State Pollution Control Boards and Pollution Control Committees in States and Union Territories respectively are to ensure compliance of these standards. So far, 47 industry specific effluent standards and 63 industry specific emission standards have been notified.Sector-specific Charters are implemented in industrial sectors, viz., Pulp & Paper, Sugar, Distillery and Textile and their compliance is verified through regulatory monitoring through technical institutions. In Haryana, there are 14 Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) with total capacity of 161.5 MLD and in Delhi there are 13 CETPs with capacity of 212.3 MLD in the Yamuna basin. Financial assistance is also provided under Namami Gange Programme to industrial clusters to upgrade/ augment their CETPs. Upgradation of one CETP project in Mathura for textile industrial cluster has been taken up. (b) to (d)  As informed by Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), there are 26 polluted industries identified in Aligarh discharging their treated effluent in Aligarh drain, which is also passing through Hathras district, where 11 polluting industries are identified. This drain ultimately meets river Yamuna at Morewali Dargah in Agra.
