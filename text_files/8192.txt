ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) FOR NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY,  POWER and MoS for  SKILL DEVELOPMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP(SHRI R. K. SINGH)(a) to (d) The National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE), Chennai has estimated   gross wind power potential of the  country  as 302 GW  and 695 GW at 100 meter and 120 meter above ground level, respectively. The state wise wind power potential is given at Annexure-I. Till 31.10.2019, 37 GW of wind power projects have already been installed in the country against target of 60 GW by 2022. The state wise wind power installed capacity is given at Annexure-II (as on 31.10.2019). Some of the important issues faced during the  realization of potential include land acquisition for installation of wind power projects, change in policies by the State Governments,  delay in getting forest clearance,  reluctance of financial institutions to fund low tariff  RE projects, etc.     The wind power projects are installed in the country commercially, based on techno economic feasibility of the site. During last five years capacity of approx 14 GW has been added.  (e)&(f) The Government issued ‘Guidelines for Development of Onshore Wind Power Projects’ on 22 October 2016 with an objective to facilitate the development of wind power projects in an efficient, cost effective and environmentally benign manner taking into account the requirements of project developers, state and national imperatives. The Guidelines , inter alia, cover requirement of site feasibility, type and quality certified wind turbines, micro-siting criteria, compliance of grid regulations, real time monitoring, online registry and performance reporting, health and safety provisions, decommissioning plan, etc. Government  have also issued ‘Guidelines for Tariff Based Competitive Bidding Process for Procurement of Power from  Grid Connected Wind Power Projects’ on 8th  December, 2017, with an objective to provide a framework for procurement of wind power through a transparent process of bidding including standardization of the  process and defining of roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders.The Government is also promoting capacity addition of wind power projects through private sector investment by providing various fiscal and financial incentives such as Accelerated Depreciation benefit; concessional custom duty exemption on certain components of wind electric generators. Besides, Generation Based Incentive (GBI) is available for the wind projects commissioned before 31 March 2017. In addition to fiscal and other incentives as stated above, technical support including wind resource assessment and identification of potential sites is being provided through the National Institute of Wind Energy, Chennai.*****
