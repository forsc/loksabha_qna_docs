ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES (SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL) (a) & (b): The Ministry of Food Processing industries (MoFPI) has been implementing Central Sector Umbrella Scheme - Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA Yojana (PMKSY) since 2016-17 for overall growth and development of food processing sector. Under component schemes of PMKSY, MoFPI provides mostly credit linked financial assistance (capital subsidy) in the form of grants-in-aid to entrepreneurs for setting up of food processing / preservation industries, including fruit and vegetable processing units. PMKSY is not any region or state specific but demand driven and is implemented across the country including Haryana. So far, Ministry has approved 2 Mega food Parks, 20 Cold Chain projects, 2 Agro Processing Clusters & 15 Food Processing Units in Haryana State under corresponding component schemes of PMKSY.               Also, as part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Initiative, MoFPI is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme-PM Formalisation of Micro Food Processing Enterprises Scheme (PMFME) for providing financial, technical and business support for setting up/upgradation of 2 lakh micro food processing enterprises across the country during five years from 2020-21 to 2024-25 based on One District One Product (ODOP) approach, out of which 4559 units have been allocated to Haryana. (c): 	Under the PMFME scheme, Citrus Fruit has been identified as ODOP for Fatehabad district and Citrus(Kinnow) for Sirsa district. However, no application from fruit and vegetable based enterprises has yet been received in these districts under PMFME. Also, no fruit and vegetable based project has been approved under component schemes of PMKSY in these two districts, though one dairy based cold chain project has been approved in Sirsa district.*****
