ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS (SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) As per the information provided by the Department of Transport, Uttar Pradesh, petrol vehicles, more than ten years old but less than fifteen years old four-wheeler vehicles, are registered under fuel type of petrol vehicle in Ghaziabad RTO. No such petrol vehicle which is registered under fuel type of diesel vehicle has been found in their database. (b) to (e) Yes, Sir. During migration to VAHAN 4.0 database, emission standards of vehicles registered  between 2005 to 2018 have been recorded with wrong standards in Ghaziabad RTO. The State Transport Department has taken up the issue with National Informatics Centre (NIC) to rectify such anomalies on priority basis. As per records available with the RTO Ghaziabad, vehicle bearing Registration Number UP 14 AZ 5314  complies with BS-III emission norms. The said vehicle was registered on 25.01.2010 under the category of emission norms ‘Not Applicable’. It is because of this that PUCC is not being issued. The State Transport Department has taken necessary action to update the emission standards.  Implementation of provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 comes under the purview of respective State Governments and Union Territories.*****
