                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ?????? 		(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b) : Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) being implemented from Kharif 2016 in the country is voluntary for the States/UTs.  The scheme is regularly reviewed in consultation with stakeholders especially the challenges faced in its operational implementation.  The scheme is being implemented on actuarial pricing regime and premium pricing is primarily determined through transparent bidding process amongst empanelled general insurance companies.  During implementation of the scheme, hardening of premium market, reduced participation in tender process, inadequate underwriting capacity of insurance companies has been observed.  Keeping this in view the above, a working group to examine the alternate risk management mechanism to rationalize the premium pricing, enhancing underwriting capacity and challenges faced in implementation of the schemes as well as to suggest remedial measures has been constituted by the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.  (c) : Keeping in view the greater role of States/UTs in implementation of the scheme, the financial sharing pattern towards premium subsidy between Central and States/UTs has been kept at 50 : 50 under the scheme.  The sharing pattern between Central and States has been revised for North Eastern States to 90 : 10.  at the time of revamping of the scheme from Kharif 2020 season.  (d) & (e) :  Yes Sir. The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) is successfully fulfilling the objectives of the schemes including providing financial support to stabilize income of farmers especially in natural calamity hit seasons/years/areas.   Since inception of the scheme in 2016-17 till 2020-21, against premium of Rs. 21,531 crore paid by farmers, claims of Rs. 1,04,196  crore have been paid to 9.01 crore farmer applications.   Year-wise and State/UT-wise details (including Andaman & Nicobar Islands) of number of farmer applications enrolled/beneficiaries, farmers share in premium and total premium collected during last three years i.e. from 2018-19 to 2020-21 and current year i.e. 2021-22 is annexed.
