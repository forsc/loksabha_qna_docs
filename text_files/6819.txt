ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a): The Budget Outlay for New Lines over Indian Railways for the financial year 2019-20 has been `9477.77 crores.(b): Funds to the Railway Projects are allocated project-wise, not State-wise. Odisha falls in East Coast Railway, South Eastern Railway and South East Central Railway. The details of allotment of funds and expenditure project-wise are made available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in >Ministry   of   Railways  >Railway  Board  >About   Indian   Railways  >Railway Board Directorates >Finance (Budget). This list includes the works of all States, including Odisha.(c): The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions of working agencies/contractors etc. All these factors vary from project to project and site to site and affect the completion time and cost of the project. In the overall interest of the nation and to ensure that projects are completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, divisional level, zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues that are obstructing the progress of projects.To ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects.   *****
