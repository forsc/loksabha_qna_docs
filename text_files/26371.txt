ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (d): It has always been the endeavour of the Government to explore the possibilities of cooperation in the field of higher education with the aim of enhancing cooperation with foreign countries, including increasing the number of inbound international students in India to make India a preferred hub for foreign students and also to improve the research ecosystem of India. The World Class Institutions scheme has been launched in the year 2017 under which the private educational institutions granted the status of ‘Institution of Eminence Deemed to be University’ are allowed to start new off-shore campuses with the prior approval of the Ministry of Education after receiving No objection certificate from the Ministry of External affairs and Ministry of Home Affairs.To facilitate Internationalization of Higher Education in India, the Study in India programme was launched on 18.04.2018. Students from all over the world can apply under this flagship programme and the focus is on 45 target countries across South-East Asia, Middle East and Africa. Five gulf countries, viz. Oman, Iraq, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, are amongst the countries being focused upon. Out of these 5 countries, four are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council.Further, the University Grants Commission has also brought out guidelines for Internationalisation of Higher Education in India.*****
