ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PETROELUM & NATURAL GAS(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (d) Government has decided that Bharat Stage-VI (BS-VI) emission standards fuels will be supplied across the country w.e.f. 01.04.2020.Prices of petrol and diesel have been made market-determined by the Government with effect from 26.06.2010 and 19.10.2014 respectively. Since then, prices of petrol and diesel are independently being priced by the Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies on the basis of trade parity principle plus suitable costs and margin based on market condition, competitor’s price, supply-demand scenario etc. Since, pricing methodology is not based on cost plus mechanism, appropriate decisions are taken considering above factors, instead of looking at additional expenses of BS-VI fuels in isolation.*************
