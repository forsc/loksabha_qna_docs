ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): In January, 2021, the Chief Minister of Odisha requested Government of India (GoI) for establishing an International airport at Puri for which the State Government had identified land close to Puri town. Discussions were held between Ministry of Civil Aviation, Government of Odisha, Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on 12.01.2021 in order to work out the modalities in this regard. State Government of Odisha has informed that they have sanctioned approx. Rs. 14.48 lakhs to carry out the pre-feasibility study report with regard to establishment of an international airport at Puri. Declaration of an airport as an international airport depends upon the traffic potential and the demand from airlines for operation of international flights besides provision of Ground Lighting Facilities, Instrument Landing System, adequate runway length, Immigration, Health and Animal & Plant Quarantine Services. (d): Establishment of new Greenfield airports including International airports is governed under the Greenfield Airport Policy issued by the Government of India (GoI) in 2008. As per Policy, an airport developer, including the State Governments, willing to establish an airport is required to send a proposal to the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA). There is a 2-stage process for approval of the proposal i.e. ''Site-Clearance'' stage and ''In-Principle'' approval stage. In accordance with this policy, MoCA receives proposals from the State Governments or Airport developers from time to time for establishment of airports. After due examination, the approval for development of a new Greenfield airport is granted.;The responsibility of implementation of airport project including funding of the project rests with the concerned airport developer.
