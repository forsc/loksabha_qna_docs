ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF JAL SHAKTI(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & 	(b)   Yes, Sir.  The Guidelines on Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) issued by the erstwhile Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM-G) in December, 2015 are still in force.  As sanitation is a State subject, SBM-G is being implemented through State/UT Governments.  However, to ensure that the MHM guidelines are followed up by all concerned, Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation had also held inter-Ministerial meetings in 2016, 2017 and 2018 with concerned Ministries /Departments viz. Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, Ministry of Women and Child Development, Bureau of Indian Standards, etc.  (c) & (d) 	Workshops and seminars on MHM are held from time to time. Kerala organized 5 days training on MHM with the support of Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (WSSCC).  Maharashtra has organized trainings on MHM with the support of United Nations Children’s Funds (UNICEF). Jharkhand organized one-month campaign on MHM with the support of UNICEF.
