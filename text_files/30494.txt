ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a)	to (c) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 200* FOR 10TH DECEMBER, 2021(a) to (c)   Health is a State Subject.  Hospital services are part of the integrated health services which are regulated by the State Government concerned.  As per the report of National Sample Survey 71st Round conducted by National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) from January to June 2014, the average medical expenditure per hospitalization in private hospitals was more as compared to Government Hospitals. It is however, the responsibility of the State Government to take cognizance of instances of unreasonable charges by the private hospitals and take action to prevent and control such practices.  Details of such cases are not maintained centrally. To provide affordable and quality tertiary health care facilities, Government is setting up new AIIMS and upgrading Government Medical Colleges under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana.  State Governments are also supported for setting up of new medical colleges as well as for increasing UG and PG medical seats.  Further, under the National Health Mission (NHM), technical and financial support is provided to States/UTs for strengthening their healthcare systems upto District Hospital level, based on the proposals submitted by them in their Program Implementation Plans (PIPs), subject to availability of resources. NHM adopts a health system approach and targets to build a network for public health facilities with Health & Wellness Centres at the grassroot level and District Hospitals, with robust referral linkage, to offer Comprehensive primary and secondary care services to citizens.*****
