ANSWER




                                                        (a) & b) As  per information provided by Government of Kerala, the State Government of Kerala has entered into a Concession Agreement  with Adani Vizhinjam Port Private Limited ( AVPPL) in August, 2015 for the development and operation of Vizhinjam International Deepwater Multipurpose  Seaport Project on Design, Build, Finance ,Operate, Transfer  ( DBFOT) basis for an initial concession period of 40  years.  For implementation of the Vizhinjam Port Project, Government of Kerala has formed a 100% Government owned Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) named Vizhinjam International Seaport Ltd (VISL).	 An Independent Engineer has been appointed to monitor the project in line with the Concession Agreement. Government of Kerala has also constituted a Project Implementation Committee and an Empowered Committee headed by Chief Secretary of the State for monitoring the Project and for timely intervention and to render assistance to remove bottlenecks, if any, faced by Concessionaire.  Apart from the above, the Chief Minister as Chairman of the body corporate (VISL) has been reviewing the project from time to time and providing necessary directions.In December 2014, Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India accorded in principle approval for this project under the Scheme For Financial Support to PPPs in Infrastructure (Viability Gap Funding). Government of Kerala has submitted the documents for final approval in July 2019.c)   	As per the Concession Agreement entered into between Government of Kerala and M/s AVPPL, the Scheduled Completion Date (SCD) of the project is 3rd December 2019.  With the construction of the critical component of the project viz, breakwater being delayed due to the failure of the Concessionaire in sourcing sufficient quantity of rocks, a slippage in the Scheduled Completion Date of the project is anticipated. Government of Kerala along with   M/s AVPPL is taking earnest efforts in resolving these issues and to minimize the delay in commissioning the project.                                          *****
