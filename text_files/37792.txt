                                                        (SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a)       The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) envisages providing cash incentive of ? 5,000/- in three installments directly to the Bank/ Post Office Accounts of Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers (PW&LM) in DBT Mode during pregnancy and lactation in response to individuals fulfilling specific conditions as detailed below:Cash Transfer	Conditions	Amount (in ?)First Installment	•	Early Registration of Pregnancy	1,000/-Second Installment	•	Received at least one antenatal check-up (Payment after 6 months of pregnancy)	2,000/-Third Installment	•	Child birth is registered•	Child has received first cycle of BCG, OPV, DPT and Hepatitis-B or its equivalent/ substitute	2,000/-  Under the scheme early registration of pregnancy, one ante-natal check-up (ANC) and first cycle of vaccination of child are monitored and tcked. (b) & (c)   Yes, Sir. The objectives of the scheme are: (i) providing partial compensation for the wage loss in terms of cash incentives so that the woman can take adequate rest before and after delivery of the first living child; and (ii) the cash incentives provided would lead to improved health seeking behaviour amongst the Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers (PW&LM).             The Ministry is implementing PMMVY in accordance with the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) which provides that subject to such schemes as may be framed by the Central Government, every Pregnant Women & Lactating Mother (PW&LM), except those who are in regular employment with the Central Government or State Government or Public Sector Undertaking or those who are in receipt of similar benefits under any law for the time being in force, shall be entitled to maternity benefit of not less than rupees six thousand, in such instalments as may be prescribed by the Central Government.   Accordingly, under PMMVY, payment of maternity benefits of ? 5,000/- in beneficiary’s bank/post office account is provided in three instalments. The eligible beneficiary receives the remaining cash incentive as per approved norms towards Maternity Benefit under Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) after institutional delivery so that on an average, a woman gets ? 6000/-.    (d) & (e)         Employment status of the beneficiaries is not captured under the Scheme and thus this information is not available with the Ministry.****
