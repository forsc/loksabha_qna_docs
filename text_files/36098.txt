ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) The details of airlines and airbuses  (airbus aircraft-fleet) flying in the country since 2017  are enclosed in Annexure.;(b) Staff, crew and pilots are engaged directly by airlines and their service providers. While, the Government does not conduct any specific assessment of the demand for such professionals, based on stakeholders feedback, it is estimated that India may require around 1000 fresh commercial pilots per annum over the next five to six years.(c) The initiatives taken by the Government to increase the employment scope and completion for type rating to licensed pilots in the country are as follows:(i)	The Airports Authority of India (AAI), on 25 September 2020, approved a liberalised Flying Training Organisations (FTO) policy wherein the concept of airport royalty (revenue share payment by FTOs to AAI) was abolished and land rental charges were significantly rationalised.  (ii) Under the old policy, around 13% royalty was charged on FTO revenue and land rentals were linked to local land rates.   (iii) AAI received bids for all nine FTO slots in March 2021 despite the airline sector going through a serious financial crisis due to Covid.  (iv) AAI issued award letters on 31 May 2021 and 29 October 2021 for nine FTOs to be established at five airports at Belagavi (Karnataka), Jalgaon (Maharashtra), Kalaburagi (Karnataka), Khajuraho (Madhya Pradesh) and Lilabari (Assam). Soft launch of two FTOs at Kalabuargi was done on 15 August 2021. (v) In the second round of FTO creation, tender process is in progress for establishing 15 FTOs at 10 Airports namely Cooch Behar, Tezu, Jharsuguda, Deoghar, Meerut, Kishangarh, Hubli, Kadapa, Bhavnagar and Salem Airports.;(vi) DGCA has introduced new Online On Demand Examination (OLODE) for the AME and flight crew (FC) candidates with effect from November 2021. These license examinations provide an opportunity to the candidates to choose date and time to appear in the examination as per his/her choice on the available slots of the examinations.(vii) DGCA has modified its regulations to empower Flying Instructors with the right to authorise flight operations at FTOs. This will help increase the flying hours and aircraft utilisation at each FTO and lead to faster completion of the CPL requirements.******
