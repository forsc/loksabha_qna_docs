ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a):		The details of the total number of cases of Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) settled by the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) are as follows: Year	Total no. of cases settled2016-17	70,10,9282017-18	85,72,1332018-19	1,15,21,9302019-20 (till 29.02.2020)	1,50,88,002Contd..2/-:: 2 ::(b) & (c):	 As per paragraph 72 (7) of the Employees’ Provident Funds Scheme, 1952 the claims complete in all respects submitted along with the requisite documents shall be settled and benefit amount paid to the beneficiaries within 20 days from the date of its receipt by the Commissioner. Therefore, at any point of time, it would not be possible to have no pendency at all for settlement of claims since receipt of the claims is an ongoing process. At present, the organization has been able to settle nearly two-third of EPF claims within 10 days of its receipt. (d) & (e):	Improvement in service delivery is an on-going process. EPFO has taken many steps for speedy disposal of the claims. Some of the important steps taken in this regard are providing option for submission of claim forms through online mode, simplification of process of settlement by doing away with the certain manual processes, bringing down the number of levels for approval of claims from three to two and the making payments to subscribers through National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT).*******
