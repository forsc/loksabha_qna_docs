ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a):  Yes Sir. As per the announcements in Union Budget 2021-22, the scope of the long-term strategy of setting up of the Value Chain Development Project of Operation Greens Scheme, which is administered by the Ministry of Food Processing Industries, has been expanded from TOP (Tomato, Onion and Potato) to 22 perishable products which mainly include fruits and vegetables.;       As a part of the Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, under the Operation Greens Scheme 50% subsidy for transportation and storage from surplus production areas to consumption centres has been provided as a short term measure, for which the Scheme Guidelines were notified on 11 June 2020. These Scheme Guidelines were amended in November 2020 extending the transportation subsidy to all fruits and vegetables when airlifted from the North East Region (NER) and Himalayan Region States and Union Territories (UTs). This simplified and functional domestic air transport and storage subsidy is in keeping with the objective of the Krishi Udaan Scheme of Ministry of Civil Aviation thereby achieving convergence between schemes.;(b) and (c): Yes Sir. Acknowledging the importance of robust health systems as a significant pillar of sustained progress in the health sector, a new centrally sponsored scheme, Prime Minister Aatma Nirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana (PMASBY), has been announced in the Union Budget 2021-22 for the development of capacities of health care systems and institutions across the continuum of care at all levels, viz. primary, secondary, and tertiary and for effective responsiveness to the current and future pandemics or disasters. It also aims to facilitate the smooth movement of pharmaceuticals through air transportation. One of the main interventions is operationalisation of 17 new Public Health Units and strengthening of 33 existing ones at Points of Entry, which include 32 airports, 11 seaports, and 7 land crossings. The Scheme has been announced with an outlay of about Rs. 64,180 crore over six years (till FY 2025-26) including for NER States.
