                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), 2005 provides at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. An additional 50 days of wage employment are provided over and above 100 days in the notified drought affected areas or natural calamity areas in the country on recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. The Ministry of Rural Development does not compile data on distress migration, However, some research studies have indicated that MGNREGA has helped in reducing distress migration.(b):	State/UT-wise details of expenditure  under MGNREGA from FY 2014-15 to FY 2019-20 (as on 19.07.2019) is given at Annexure-I.(c):	The release of funds is a continuous process. The Ministry releases funds periodically in two tranches with each tranche consisting of one or more instalments based on agreed to Labour Budget (LB), opening balance, pace of utilization of funds, pending liabilities of the previous year, if any, and overall performance. Details of pending FTOs on unskilled wage under MGNREGA during the FY 2019-20 (as on 19.07.2019) are given at Annexure-II.(d):	The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (MGNREGA) is a demand driven wage employment scheme. Hence, no work-wise allocation of funds is made. As per Management Information System (MIS), State/UT-wise details of expenditure for construction of Anganwadi centres under MGNREGS since 2017-18 is given at Annexure-III.*****
