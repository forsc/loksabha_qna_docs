Under the scheme, financial support is provided on cost sharing basis between Central Government and respective State Governments for various activities such as interception, diversion and treatment of wastewater, shoreline protection, lake front development, in-situ cleaning i.e. de-silting & de-weeding, storm water management, bioremediation, catchment area treatment, lake beautification, survey & demarcation, bio-fencing, fisheries development, weed control, biodiversity conservation, education and awareness creation, community participation, etc. This Ministry has sanctioned 155 projects for conservation of wetlands since 1987- 88 for achieving the desired water quality enhancement, besides improvement in biodiversity.The Ministry recently took up work for restoration and rejuvenation of 130 wetlands. A four pronged strategy was prepared and the nodal officers of these wetlands were trained in preparing focused management plans and also in working out the health of the wetland. For the first time in the country, wetlands were graded between A to E as per their health.   *****
