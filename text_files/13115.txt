ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a):	 The Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) provides credit-linked financial assistance in the form of grants-in-aid for setting up food processing industries/projects/units for processing and preservation of various agricultural and allied produce including meat and poultry under the central sector schemes of Integrated Cold Chain and Value Addition Infrastructure (Cold Chain), Creation of Backward and Forward Linkages (BFL) and Creation/ Expansion of Food Processing & Preservation Capacities (Unit Scheme) which are component schemes of Umbrella Scheme- PRADHAN MANTRI KISAN SAMPADA YOJANA (PMKSY). Whereas the Cold Chain scheme is under implementation for more than five years, the Unit Scheme and BFL scheme is under implementation since 2017-18. These schemes are implemented in all States and UTs of India. Besides the above three schemes, under the centrally sponsored scheme of ‘Setting up/ Modernization of Abattoirs”, Ministry has been providing financial assistance, particularly to local bodies to set up and/or modernize abattoir projects. This scheme has since been discontinued and only funds are released to the already sanctioned projects.(b) to (d): Yes, Sir. The share of assistance to meat and poultry industry has been around 5%. The Ministry does not earmark fund for different sub-sector like fruits and vegetables, meat & poultry. The assistance is based on demand. However, the Ministry gives preference to processing of perishable produce like fruits & vegetables, dairy, meat & poultry.(e): 	12 Mega Food Parks (MFPs) are proposed to be made operational during 2019-20. However, these MFPs are not especially dedicated to meat & pouty processing industry. Meat & poultry processing units can be set up in these parks to push production of meat & poultry products and export thereof.*****
