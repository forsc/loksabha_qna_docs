                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)a)	The details of number of houses constructed under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) in Jharkhand with corresponding percentage of completion of construction, district-wise is given in Annexure.b)	The PMAY-G scheme requires the States/UTs to provide the beneficiaries a bouquet of house design options according to local conditions, using appropriate technology suitable to the region of their residence. The Ministry of Rural Development, in collaboration with the Unite Nation Development Programme (UNDP) and Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi conducted studies in various states and developed locally appropriate, cost effective and disaster resilient housing design typologies for identified housing zones. The appropriate house design typologies developed in respect of 15 States, including Jharkhand, has been compiled into a book “PAHAL” which has been distributed among states and is also available on the website of the Ministry. Since PMAY-G is a beneficiary driven scheme, advisories have been issued by the ministry urging State Governments to encourage beneficiaries to adopt environment friendly technology like fly-ash bricks, roof-top rainwater harvesting, bamboo-based construction materials etc. in construction of PMAY-G houses.c)	In Phase – I (2016-17 to 2018-19) of PMAY-G, the targets allocated for Aspirational districts was construction of 26.30 lakh houses out of which, 25.86 lakh (98.3%) houses have been sanctioned and 22.28 lakh (84.7%) houses have been completed as on 05.12.2019.The targets for 2019-20 of Phase II (2019-20 to 2021-22) of PMAY-G for Aspirational districts is 13.87 lakh of which 12.52 lakh (90%) houses have been sanctioned as on 05.12.2019.  As per framework for Implementation, the time period given for construction of a house is 12 months from the date of sanction.  Further, to achieve the targets of States/ UTs including aspirational districts under PMAY-G,the Government has taken several initiatives and innovative steps which include: i.	Implementation and monitoring of the scheme through end to end e-Governance model using MIS-AwaasSoft. ii.	Evidence based monitoring of construction of house through uploading of geo-tagged photographs at each pre-determined stage of house construction. iii.	Single bank account (State Nodal Account) of PMAY-G at the State/UT level from where the assistance is transferred directly to beneficiary account through DBT. iv.	Increasing availability of trained rural mason by encouraging Rural Mason Training.v.	Assigning each house sanctioned under PMAY-G to a local functionary to improve monitoring and facilitate timely construction of houses. vi.	Awards to the best performing States/UTs, Districts based on performance index dashboard, thereby creating healthy competition and motivation. vii.	Increasing choices available to beneficiaries by providing a menu of design typologies based on climate, topography, cultural and traditional housing practices and vulnerability to disaster.******
