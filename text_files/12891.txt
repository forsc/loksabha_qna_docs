                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT (SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (d): A statement is laid on the Table of the House.** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *146 DUE FOR REPLY ON 02-03-2020 BY SHRI KAUSHALENDRA KUMAR REGARDING “UNEMPLOYMENT”. (a) to (d): As per the results of annual Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) conducted by National Statistical Office (NSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation during 2017-18, the estimated unemployment rate on usual status (principal status + subsidiary status) basis for persons of age 15 years and above in the country was 6.0%.	Employment generation coupled with improving employability is the priority of the Government. Government has taken various steps for generating employment in the country like encouraging private sector of economy, fast-tracking various projects involving substantial investment and increasing public expenditure on schemes such as Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) and Deendyal Antodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM). Promoting entrepreneurship is essential for enabling the youth to productively contribute to the economic development of the country. Accordingly, the Government of India has accorded priority to the entrepreneurship through various measures such as Startup India, Mudra Scheme, etc. so as to train and finance entrepreneurs.Under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is implementing a flagship scheme known as the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal VikasYojana (PMKVY) 2016-20 with an objective to provide skilling to one crore people under Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) across the country for four years i.e. 2016-2020. 	Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) has been initiated by Government inter alia for facilitating self-employment. Under PMMY collateral free loans upto Rs. 10 lakh, are extended to micro/small business enterprises and to individuals to enable them to setup or expand their business activities. 	Government has implemented the National Career Service (NCS) Project which comprises a digital portal that provides a nation-wide online platform for the job seekers and employers for job-matching in a dynamic, efficient and responsive manner and has a repository of career content to job seekers. 	The National Manufacturing Policy identifies employment intensive industries like textiles and garments, leather and footwear, gems and jewellery and food processing, etc. as special focus attention sectors. The policy provides special attention for Small Scale Industries as they offer employment opportunities both for self-employment and jobs across diverse geographies. Besides these initiatives, flagship programmes of the Government such as Make in India, Digital India, Swachh Bharat Mission, Smart City Mission, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, Housing for All, Infrastructure development and industrial corridors have the potential to generate productive employment opportunities. Ministries/Departments/States run skill development schemes across various sectors to improve the employability of youth and also facilitate placements. Schemes such as the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) wherein Government reimburses 25 percent of the stipend payable to apprentices also enhances employability of the youth to access employment.	Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY) was launched by the Ministry of Labour and Employment for incentivising employers for promoting employment generation. Under this scheme, Government is paying entire employer’s contribution (12% or as admissible) towards EPF and EPS for all eligible new employees for all sectors for 3 years. The last date for registration of beneficiaries under PMRPY through employer was 31st March 2019.*****
