ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) to (c) Representations are received at various levels of Railways administration viz. Station, Divisional level, Zonal level and Railway Board’s level, a compendium of which is not maintained. However, these demands are examined and action as found feasible and justified, is taken, subject to operational feasibility and commercial viability. At present, three Mail/Express services originate from/terminate at Machilipatnam namely, 12749/12750 Machilipatnam-Bidar Express, 17211/17212 Machilipatnam-Yesvantpur Express and 17245/17246 Machilipatnam-Dharmavaram Express.  Diversion of these trains to run via Cuddapah is operationally not feasible, at present.  Further, no train specific allotment of budget allocation is made; budget allocation is made for all the activities related to running of trains including other operating expenses. *****
