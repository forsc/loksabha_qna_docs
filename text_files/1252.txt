                                                        THE MINISTER   OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)	and (b)Under the GraminKrishiMausamSewa (GKMS) scheme, District Agromet Units (DAMUs) are being established at KrishiVigyanKendras (KVKs) in collaboration with Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) to implement block level Agromet Advisory Services (AAS). The network of DAMUs will be extended to cover all the districts in a phasewise manner.  At present, the process of setting up of DAMUs at 200 KVKs (Annexure I) has been undertaken and remaining 330 DAMUs will be covered subsequently.(c)	After successful implementation of district level AAS, India Meteorological Department (IMD) is in the process of implementation of block level weather forecast and Agromet Advisories to enhance outreach and usefulness of AgrometAdvisories. Block level weather forecast and Agromet Advisories will aid the farmers in taking decision on day-to-day agricultural operations. AAS rendered by India Meteorological Department (IMD) is a step towards weather-based crop and livestock management strategies and operations dedicated to enhancing crop production besides reducing crop damage and loss due to extreme weather events. IMD is taking continuous efforts to reach each and every farmer in different parts of the country with block level weather forecasts and Agromet Advisories.
