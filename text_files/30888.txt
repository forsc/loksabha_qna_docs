                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c)According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) the Working Group I contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report, global mean sea level has increased by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. Further, as per the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), on an average, the sea level along the Indian coast is considered to be rising at about 1.7 mm/year.  Shoreline change including erosion and sea level rise are slow phenomena and manifesting globally. The Government is committed to combating coastal erosion and protecting the coastal areas and coastal communities through various extant legal and promotional measures. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has notified Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 2019 with a view to conserve and protect the unique environment of coastal stretches and marine areas, besides livelihood security to the fisher communities and other local communities in the coastal areas and to promote sustainable development based on scientific principles taking into account the dangers of natural hazards and sea level rise due to global warming. As per the aforesaid Notification, certain coastal areas are declared as coastal regulation zone, wherein developmental activities such as residential, industrial, infrastructure, etc, are regulated as per the extant provisions.The Government is combating climate change through its several programs and schemes. This includes implementation of the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which comprises missions in specific areas of solar energy, energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan ecosystem, sustainable habitat, green India, and strategic knowledge on climate change. The NAPCC provides an overarching framework for all climate actions. Thirty-three States/Union Territories have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) in line with NAPCC taking into account the State specific issues relating to climate change. These SAPCCs outline sector-specific and cross-sectoral priority actions, including adaptation. The Government is also implementing the scheme, ‘National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change’ to support adaptation measures of States/UTs in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. *****
