                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): Yes, Sir.

The growing traffic demand has its own pressure on the existing airport infrastructure.  In order to meet the growing demand, the airport operators including the Airports Authority of India (AAI) undertake upgradation/ modernisation of airports from time to time depending on the availability of land, commercial viability, socio-economic considerations, traffic demand / willingness of airlines to operate to/from such airports etc. AAI has embarked upon a Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) plan of Rs. 25,000 crores over a period of 5 years for development/modernization/upgradation of its airport infrastructures in the country including Jaipur, Jodhpur and Udaipur in Rajasthan and Kolhapur and Pune in Maharashtra.
