                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a): As on 3rd February 2021, total number of deaths reported due to COVID-19 in the country stands at 1,54,596. Although high in absolute terms, India has managed to restrict the mortality to 112 deaths per million population, which is far lower than other similarly affected countries. (b): As on 3rd February 2021, total number of cases reported due to COVID-19 in the country stands at 1,07,77,284. Although high in absolute terms, India has managed to restrict the morbidity to 7801 cases per million population, which is far lower than other similarly affected countries.(c): The COVID-19 recovery rate has improved consistently in the country. The recovery rate at end of May 2020 stood at 48.8%, which rose to 83.3% by end of September, 2020 and currently stands at 96.98%. Similarly, the COVID-19 case fatality rates have also dropped consistently. While it was 2.95% at end of May 2020, and 1.57% at the end of September 2020, the  COVID-19 case fatality rate currently stands at 1.44%, which is one of the lowest among similarly affected countries.(d): Government of India adopted a whole of Government, whole of society approach to effectively manage COVID-19 in the country. Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India, under extant provisions of DM Act constituted 11 Empowered Groups on different aspects of COVID-19 management in the country to fast track informed decisions on issues including (i) medical emergency planning, (ii) availability of hospitals, isolation and quarantine facility, disease surveillance and testing, (iii) ensuring availability of essential medical equipment, (iv) augmenting human resource and capacity building, (v) supply chain and logistics management, (vi) coordination with private sector, (vii) economic and welfare measures, (viii) information, communications and public awareness, (ix) technology and data management, (x) public grievance and (xi) strategic issues related to lockdown. These groups were restructured on 11th September, 2020 into 6 Groups based on the need and evolving scenario. On 8th January 2021, another Empowered Group on Vaccine Administration has been constituted to take all necessary measures for effective implementation of CO-WIN platform created for inventory management and delivery of COVID-19 vaccine.For appropriate management of suspect/confirmed COVID-19 cases, a three tier arrangement of health facilities has been implemented in consultation with the State Governments:•	COVID Care Center (CCC) that shall offer care for mild cases.•	Dedicated COVID Health Centre (DCHC) that shall offer care for all cases that have been clinically assigned as moderate.•	Dedicated COVID Hospital (DCH) that shall offer comprehensive care primarily for those who have been clinically assigned as severe.Tertiary care hospitals under ESIC, Defence, Railways, paramilitary forces, Steel Ministry etc. are also being leveraged for case management.In addition, States have opted for public private partnership with many private hospitals to work as stand-alone COVID hospitals. DRDO has set up large field hospitals with capacities ranging from 1000 to 10,000 isolation beds.Starting with just one laboratory for testing of samples for COVID-19, the network of existing laboratories has been expanded vastly to test samples for COVID-19. As on 2nd February 2021, a total of 2364 laboratories have been approved for COVID-19 Testing. At present India is testing about a 7-8 lakh samples a day.Due to reliance on imports for some of the crucial logistics, indigenous manufacturing of personal protective equipment, testing kits, ventilators was facilitated to improve their local manufacturing and availability.States have also supported in terms of supply of logistics. So far 1.69 crore of PPE Kits, 4.08 crores N-95 masks, 11.16 crore tablets of Hydroxychloroquine, 36,948 ventilators and 1,02,400 oxygen cylinders have been supplied to States/UTs/ Central Government hospitals so far (as reported on 2nd February 2021).  In addition, oxygen concentrators are also being supplied to States.(e) & (f): Life insurance benefits have been extended to all healthcare workers, under the ‘Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package Insurance Scheme for Health Workers Fighting COVID-19’ announced on 30 March 2020. Ministry of Health and Family welfare has collaborated with the New India Assurance (NIA) Company Limited for providing the insurance amount based on the guidelines prepared for the scheme. This insurance scheme provides a life insurance cover of Rs. 50 lakh to healthcare providers, including community health workers, who may have to be in direct contact and care of COVID-19 patients and therefore are at risk of being infected.
