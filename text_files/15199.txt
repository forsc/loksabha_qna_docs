                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (b): The Ministry has been implementing schemes such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM) for providing wage and self-employment opportunities to the people in rural areas of the country. MGNREGS aims at enhancing livelihood security of households in rural areas of the country by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every household, whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work resulting in creation of productive assets of prescribed quality and durability. DAY-NRLM aims at strengthening livelihoods security, promoting self-employment and skilled wage employment in rural areas. Deen Dayal Upadhyay Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), a sub scheme under DAY-NRLM, is being implemented for skilling rural poor youth to improve their employability. Under DAY-NRLM, Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs) are also set up in each district of the country for providing need-based training to prospective entrepreneurs and enabling them to take bank credit to start their own micro enterprises. In the Union Budget 2020-21, the   Government has announced allocation of Rs. 61,500 crore to MGNREGS and    Rs. 9,210.04 crore to DAY-NRLM.   ****
