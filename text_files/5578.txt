ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) & (b) 	Multiple complaints are generally received against same number regarding Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC). To deal with this problem of UCC, the TRAI has already issued a regulation “Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018 (TCCCPR, 2018)”.This regulation takes into account multiple complaints of Unsolicited Commercial Communication against the same number while deciding whether to impose usage cap on the offending telephone number for violation of the regulations. Originating Access Provider (OAP) has to check whether there are similar complaints or reports against the same sender. If it is found that there are ten or more such complaints against the sender, usage cap shall be put on the offending sender pending investigations to be completed within 30 days. If after investigation, OAP finds that sender was engaged in UCC, action will be taken by OAP as per the provisions of TCCPR 2018. In brief, for first violation, due warning shall be given; for second violence, usage cap shall continue for a period of six months and for third and subsequent violations, all telecom resources shall be disconnected for a period up to two years with blacklisting.
