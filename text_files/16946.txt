                                                    (a) 	whether the Government has taken any steps to open Regional and Divisional Post Offices at Deoghar in Jharkhand; and (b) 	if so, the details thereof and the time by which these offices are likely to be made operational?






ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) & (b) 	Sir, there is no category of Regional and Divisional Post Offices in the Department. Hence, the question does not arise. A proposal, however, for opening of a Divisional administrative office at B. Deoghar was received from Jharkhand Circle in September, 2015. The proposal was not found justified on financial yardsticks. There is no proposal under consideration for creation of a Regional office at B. Deoghar in Jharkhand.************
