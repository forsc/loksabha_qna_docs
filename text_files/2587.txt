                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) & (b) : The Directorate has initiated investigation in approximately 1100 cases wherein investigations are at various stages. A number of entities including companies, firms, individual persons, LLPs, etc. are under investigation in these cases. Disclosure of names and other details of these entities, including companies, during pendency of investigations may not be in larger public interest as the same may hamper the ongoing investigations.(c) & (d) :  Whenever there is an apprehension that any accused person may leave the country during the pendency of PMLA investigation, Look Out Circular (LoC) is issued by Directorate of Enforcement. In case any of the accused person against whom LoC is issued tries to leave the country, the Immigration Authorities inform the Directorate and such person is apprehended. Further, some of the accused persons may already be residing abroad or may have left India before the issuance of Red Corner Notice (RCN) and Extradition Requests. Action under the newly enacted Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018 is also initiated in suitable cases against economic offenders who have left India so as to avoid criminal prosecution or who being abroad, refuse to return to India to face criminal prosecution.(e) : Does not arise in view of reply above.                  *****
