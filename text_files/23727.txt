As on 16.03.2021, CIL is carrying a stock of more than 85 MT, which is highest in recent past, and with the ongoing surge in production, the stock shall increase further in the remaining days of the current fiscal. Therefore, there is adequate amount of coal lying with CIL and it is ready to cater to the needs of the Power Sector.

Out of the above 135 Plants, CEA monitors 126 plants which are linked with CIL sources. In the current year (upto January’21) against the total domestic coal receipt of 481.33 MT from various sources by the thermal power plants, CIL supply was about 365.88 MT i.e. 76% of total coal received by the power plants monitored by CEA.
