ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b): The QS ranking is generally based on the surveys conducted by nongovernmentalagencies and gives substantial weightage to the ‘perception’ factorwhich is inherently subjective. Given its size and population and the socio-economicand geographical diversities, Indian universities and Institutions are doing better thanthose of many developing countries. Variations in standards of Indian Universitiesdepends on a number of factors including social, economic and geographicalconditions.(c) & (d): As per information received from the Ministry of External Affairs, country-wisedetails of number of students who went abroad for higher studies, in 2015-16, 2016-17,2017-18 and 2018-19 are enclosed at Annexure-I.(e) : Some of the major problems faced by Indian students while studying abroad areas follows:i. Misleading information about fees to be paid to the University or additional feessought for various elements, sudden increase in fees etc;ii. Sudden closure or de-recognition of foreign universities, institutes/colleges,after student joins university and pays tuition fees;iii. Fake calls asking students to make payments to avoid cancellation of studentvisa or deportation;iv. Harassment by educational consultants/agents, University administration.v.

Students Welfare officers ofIndian Embassy are constantly in contact with Indian students association andUniversity administrations. There are informal group of students in social medial todisseminate information about students related issues in many countries. Such groupsare in touch with student welfare officers. Advisory on dos and don’ts in foreigncountries including issues related to fraudulent agents are issued by Indian Missions,which are placed on the website of the Mission.To address issues pertaining to Indian Students abroad, an Expert group, havingofficials from stakeholders Ministries and government bodies (Ministry of ExternalAffairs, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Ministry of Health and FamilyWelfare, Medical Council of India) and senior diplomats based in Delhi dealing withConsular and Educational matters from select embassies (United States of America,United Kingdom, Canada, Russia, China, Australia etc.) has been established.Further, the Ministry of External Affairs constantly collaborates with various foreignMissions in India on a number of issues, including Regulating agents and consultants,both in India and abroad.(f): A few cases of assault/violence have been reported by the students that havecome to the notice of Indian Missions.
