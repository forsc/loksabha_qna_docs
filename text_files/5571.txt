Requests from Governments of Assam, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh (for one more at Dist. Tawang) have been accepted. Arrangements have been made for supply one toy train each to these three States.    (d)     The details of railway projects for the entire country and for the North Eastern Region are as under:	20 projects out of total 491 New Line, Gauge Conversion and Doubling projects (approximately 48,860 km, costing  6.5 lakh crores) of the country pertain to North Eastern Region (Approximate total length of 1,783 km, costing  68,401 crore). These are at different stages of planning / approval / execution.  Commissioning of railway projects involves land acquisition by State Governments, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearance from various authorities, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, order of Hon’ble Courts etc. Annual targets and achievement are affected by these factors.     Major achievements in N.E. Region during last 5 years are:•	The entire rail network of NE region has been converted to broad-gauge.•	 Harmuti-Naharlagun new line (21.75 km), a capital connectivity project for Arunachal Pradesh (Itanagar) was commissioned  on 20.02.2015.
