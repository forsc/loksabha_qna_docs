MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a) & (b): Education is in the Concurrent List of the Constitution and majority of theschools are under the administrative control of the concerned States and UnionTerritories Administrations. The Right of Children to Free and CompulsoryEducation (RTE) Act, 2009 makes elementary education a fundamental right of allchildren in the age group of 6-14 years. Section 10 of the RTE Act stipulates that itshall be the duty of every parent or guardian to admit or cause to be admitted his orher child or ward, as the case may be, to an elementary education in theneighbourhood school. Section 12(1)(c) of the Act mandates all private aided, SpecialCategory schools and private unaided schools to admit in class I (or below) to theextent of at least 25% of the strength of that class, children belonging to weakersections and disadvantaged groups and provide free and compulsory education tillits completion. In order to implement the provisions of the section 12(1)(c) of theRTE Act, States and UTs are required to notify the disadvantaged groups andweaker sections, per child cost and start admissions in private un-aided schools.Further, Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) vide letter no 12-5/2016-EE.11 dated 25.05.2016 has requested States/UTs to carry out a groundassessment of private unaided schools across the country to ensure compliance withthe provisions of Section 12 of RTE Act, 2009.(c): No such proposal is under consideration at this stage.*****
