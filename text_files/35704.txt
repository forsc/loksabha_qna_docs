NARAYANASWAMY)(a):  Central Assistance(CA) of Rs. 12.44 Cr. has been released in 2021-22 under the Pre-Matric Scholarship for Scheduled Castes students in Andhra Pradesh.(b):  Till 2018-19, the funding pattern under the Pre-Matric Scholarship for Scheduled Caste Scheme was based  on the concept of Committed Liability (CL) of the State Governments/UT Administrations. As, in 2018-19,  the demand under the scheme for Andhra Pradesh was within the Committed Liability (CL) of the State Government , no CA was released for the year.In 2019-20, the funding pattern under the scheme was changed from concept of CL to a sharing ratio of 60:40 between the Centre and the States or Notional Allocation (N.A) based on SC population, whichever is lower. The Notional allocation for the State of Andhra Pradesh for 2019-20 was  Rs.11.55 Cr. As the State Government had an unspent amount of Rs.15.54 Cr (from the CA released in 2014-15), which was higher than the Notional allocation for the State, no CA was released for 2019-20.(c) & (d):  It has been decided to merge the  Pre - Matric Scholarship Scheme for SC Students with the  Pre - Matric Scholarship scheme for the children of parents/guardians engaged in unclean and hazardous occupation. The merged scheme is known as ''Pre -Matric Scholarship Scheme for SC Students & Others''. The amount of scholarships under the scheme has been increased w.e.f. 2022-23.
