ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a):	No State Government/UT Administration has reported any incidence of death due to starvation in the country.(b) & (c):	The grain available with Food Corporation of India (FCI) is stored and preserved properly. Food grains are perishable commodity and FCI is storing/handling large quantities of foodgrains over long periods. Out of these Stocks, some quantities become Non-issuable/rotten due to various reasons like:i. 		Due to Natural Calamities like Cyclone/flood damages.ii. 	Transit damages viz enroute damage in wagon/truck due to contamination, wagon roof leakage etc.............2/--2-iii. 	In some cases due to negligence of officials/ officers, for which suitable disciplinary action against defaulters, where ever found guilty, are invariably taken.The details of the amount of foodgrains damaged during the last 3 years and current year in FCI, state-wise is given at Annexure-A.(d):	Against total stocks of 741.41 LMT (as on 01.06.2019), the total storage capacity available with Food Corporation of India (FCI), Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and the State Agencies (both owned and hired capacity), is 862.45 LMT (as on 31.05.2019) comprising 739.76 LMT in covered godowns and 122.69 LMT in Cover and Plinth (CAP) storage. As such, there is sufficient capacity for storage of central pool foodgrains at the national level.However, depending on requirement in specific areas and for modernization of storage facilities, Government implements the following schemes for construction of godowns and silos in the country for central pool stock of foodgrains:i.	Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) Scheme: Under this Scheme, which was formulated in 2008, storage capacity is created by private parties, Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and State Government Agencies for guaranteed hiring by Food Corporation of India (FCI). A capacity of 142.62 Lakh MT (LMT) has been created as on 31.05.2019.  Under this scheme, no funds are allocated by Government for construction of godowns and full investment is done by the private parties/CWC/State Agencies. After a godown is constructed and taken over by FCI, storage charges are paid to the investor for the guaranteed period of 9/10 years irrespective of the quantum of foodgrains stored.ii.	Central Sector Scheme (erstwhile Plan Scheme): This scheme is implemented in the North Eastern States along with a few other States. Funds are released by the Government to FCI and also directly to the State Governments for construction of godowns. A total capacity of 1,84,175 MT has been completed by FCI and State Governments during the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-17). This scheme has been extended for 3 years from 01.04.2017 to 31.03.2020. A total capacity of 49,375 MT has been created by FCI & State Governments from 01.04.2017 to 31.05.2019.iii. 	Construction of Steel Silos: In addition to conventional godowns, Government of India has also approved an action plan for construction of steel silos in the country for a capacity of 100 LMT in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode for modernizing storage infrastructure and improving shelf life of stored foodgrains. Against this, as on 31.05.2019, steel silos of 6.75 LMT capacity have been created.Steps taken by FCI to minimize damage of foodgrains are at Annexure-B.(e):	There is a decreasing trend in accrual of damage foodgrains in FCI from 2016-17 to 2019-20 which is due to adopting various practices given at point no (d) above.            *** Annexure-AANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (b) & (c) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.1733 DUE FOR ANSWERED ON 02.07.2019 IN THE LOK SABHA.Region-wise foodgrains stock accrued as Non-Issuable (damaged) in FCI from 2016-17 to 2019-20 (as on 31.05.19)(Fig. in tonnes)S.
