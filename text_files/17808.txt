ANSWER




MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b): The implementation of the Digital India Land Records Modernization Programme (DILRMP) is a complex, sensitive and voluminous work, involving cumbersome and time consuming processes. Gestation period of completion of the various activities/components of this programme is relatively longer as compared to other schemes. Progress is inter alia dependent on State-specific additional needs of the State Governments as they may deem relevant and appropriate. Substantial progress has been achieved under the Digital India Land Record Modernization Programme (DILRMP). The details of the same are as under: (i)	Computerization of Land Records has been completed (more than 90%) in 24 States/ UTs and substantial progress has been achieved in 10 States/ UTs.(ii)	Digitization of Cadastral Maps has been completed (more than 90%) in 21 States/ UTs and substantial progress has been achieved in 9 States/ UTs.(iii)	 Computerization of Registration (SRO) has been completed (more than 90%) in 26 States/ UTs and substantial progress has been achieved in 7 States/ UTs.(iv)	 Integration of SRO with Revenue Office has been completed (more than 90%) in 18 States/ UTs and substantial progress has been achieved in 9 States/ UTs.(v)	Modernization of Record Room has been completed (more than 90%) in 7 States/ UTs and substantial progress has been achieved in 12 States/ UTs.(c): State-wise present status of Digitization of Land Records and Survey / Resurvey, as reported by the States / UTs on DILRMP-MIS, is annexed.(d) & (e): DILRMP is a demand driven programme and funding under DILRMP is done as per Guidelines of Government of India and keeping in view the effectiveness and capacity of the States/UTs Governments. The funds allocated during last five financial years i.e. year 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 are Rs. 97.77 crore, Rs. 150.00 crore, Rs. 150.00 crore, Rs. 250.00 crore and Rs. 150.00 crore respectively. The allocated funds were sufficient to meet the requirements/demands of the States/UTs during the corresponding years.                                               ****                                                                                   AnnexureAnnexure referred to in reply to part (c) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 1455 for answer on 20.09.2020State-wise present status of Digitization of Land Records and Survey / Resurvey.S.
