ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) & (b)	Yes Sir. An assessment study was commissioned by the Department of Land Resources namely “Wastelands Atlas of India (Change Analysis Based on Temporal Satellite Data of 2008-09 and 2015-16)”. This study was conducted by National Remote Sensing Centre, Hyderabad. The outcome has been published as “Wastelands Atlas of India 2019” and released on 4th November, 2019 which inter alia contains district-wise estimated area under wastelands in 2008-09 and in 2015-16. The salient features of this Atlas are (i) updation wastelands maps of 2008-09 with 2015-16 Resourcesat-2 data and generation of wastelands map of 2015-16, (ii) areas with major wastelands change between 2008-09 and 2015-16 are identified and depicted, (iii) creation of wastelands geospatial database and dissemination through Bhuvan geo-portal; and (iv) preparation ofcategory-wise spatial change statistics and summation in the form of wastelands atlas.The wastelands atlas provides inputs to identify specific areas for further reducing their extent and is helpful in identifying areas for productive use / greening, new infrastructure projects and potential solar farms for renewable energy and so on. For planning the development of rainfed areas and culturable wastelands, the State Governments practically consult such credible references invariably.( c)	As per information received from Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, the State /UT-wise details of fallow and barren /waste land (in percentage) are given at Annexure I. (d)	There is no scheme/ programme exclusively to convert waste land into arable land. However, the Department of Land Resources, Ministry of Rural Development has been implementing a scheme called Watershed Development Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (WDC-PMKSY) for development of rainfed areas and culturable wastelands in the country since 2015-16. Before this, the scheme was known as Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) which was in operation from 2009-10 to 2014-15. The major activities carried out under the scheme are ridge area treatment, drainage line treatment, soil and moisture conservation, rain water harvesting, nursery raising, afforestation, horticulture, pasture development, livelihoods for assetless persons, etc. The Department has sanctioned 8214 watershed development projects in States / UTs from 2009-10 to 2014-15 covering an area of about 39.07 million hectare under IWMP. Out of 8214 sanctioned projects, 345 uninitiated projects and 1487 projects  in Preparatory Phase (Total 1832) had been transferred to States to be taken up under their respective State’s budget. As per the information received from the States under the scheme, between 2014-15 to 2019-20 (upto Sept. 2019), about 6.08 lakh water harvesting structures were created / rejuvenated, an additional area of about 13.47 lakh ha has been brought under protective irrigationand about 27.25 lakh farmers have been benefitted.In addition, as per the information received, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme "National Afforestation Programme (NAP)" for regeneration of degraded forests and adjoining areas through people''s participation. Under this scheme an amount of Rs. 234.74 crore has been released to States to treat an area of 57,292 hectares during the last three years (i.e. 2016-17 to 2018-19). (e)	The State / UT - wise details of funds released as Central share [from 2009-10 to 2019-20 (up to 28.11.2019)]and funds utilized underIWMP/WDC-PMKSY projectsfor reclamation rainfed areas and culturable wastelands including tribal areas in the countryare given at Annexure II.(f)	For implementation of the programme, agencies/ institutional structures at the State, District and project levels have been constituted. The Department has, inter alia, taken   a number of steps for effective implementation of the programme such as insistence of public participation through the formation of the village Watershed Committee which implements the programme; dedicated implementing structures; Bhuwan IWMP portal; Drishti mobile app; field visits and regular review meetings etc.*****
