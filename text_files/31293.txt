ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI  R.K. SINGH)(a) :		The details of State-wise installed capacity of Coal based power plants as on 31.10.2021 are furnished at Annexure.(b) :		During April-Nov, 2021, power plants were not able to maintain sufficient stock as coal based power generation in the country increased by about 16% as compared to the corresponding period of the preceding year due to revival of economic activities. Further, there were interruptions in domestic coal supplies due to heavy rains which continued until first week of Oct, 2021 as well as rise in imported coal prices in the international markets which resulted in less coal import by thermal power plants. Due to second wave of Covid-19 Pandemic in Apr-Jun, 2021, the production & logistic arrangements were also affected as a huge number of manpower got infected. (c) :		The Government has taken the following measures to increase the coal supply to power plants:(i)	To address the issues of coal supplies to power sector, an Inter-Ministerial Sub Group comprising of representatives from Ministries of Power, Coal, Railways, Central Electricity Authority (CEA), Coal India Limited (CIL) and Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) meet regularly to take various operational decisions to enhance supply of coal to thermal power plants (TPPs) as well as for meeting any contingent situations relating to Power Sector including to alleviate critical coal stock position in power plants.(ii)	Ministry of Power has constituted a Core Management Team (CMT) with members from MoP, Railways, CEA, CIL, NTPC, DVC and POSOCO to ensure close monitoring of coal stocks at TPPs and operational decisions are being taken in CMT to augment supply of sufficient quantity of coal to the TPPs.(iii)	To help the power plants in enhancing their coal stock, CIL in Oct’21 had offered about 5.2 Million Tonnes coal from its various subsidiaries to State/Central Gencos for lifting through Rail Cum Road (RCR)/ Road mode.(iv)	Revised coal stocking norms based on 85% Plant Load Factor (PLF) have been issued by CEA, mandating the coal stock of 17 days at pit head stations and 26 days at non-pit head stations to be maintained by power plants during February to June every year.(v)	Recently, an Inter-Ministerial Committee comprising of Secretary (Coal), Secretary (Power), Secretary (MoEF&CC) and Chairman, Railway Board has been set up to review the situation and ensure adequate supply of coal to power plants in the country. ************
