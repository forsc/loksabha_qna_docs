ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (e) It is the responsibility of the State Governments and the Urban Local Bodies concerned to setup facilities for collection, transportation and treatment of sewage  being generated  and  to ensure that untreated  sewage does not fall into rivers and water bodies. As per the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution), Act 1974, industrial units are required to install effluent treatment plants (ETPs) and treat their effluents to comply with environmental standards before discharging into rivers and water bodies. 	The Government of India is supplementing the efforts of the State Governments in addressing the challenges of pollution of rivers by providing financial and technical assistance through schemes like ‘Namami Gange’, National River Conservation Plan (NRCP), Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) etc. 	Further, to control discharge of industrial effluents, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and respective  State  Pollution  Control  Boards  (SPCBs)  /  Pollution  Control  Committees  (PCCs)  monitor Contd...P/2//2//industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.  To improve the monitoring of compliance, directions have been issued by CPCB to specific industries to install online 24x7 effluent monitoring systems. Steps have also been taken by CPCB to promote low waste concept in grossly water polluting industries and maintain zero liquid discharge wherever possible. 	Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in association with the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/Pollution Control Committees(PCCs) monitors the water quality of rivers on a regular basis across the country through a network of monitoring stations.  As per latest report of CPCB, 351 polluted river stretches have been identified on 323 rivers based on the value of Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). This is as against 302 polluted river stretches on 275 rivers identified during 2015, which can also be attributed to strengthening of monitoring network from 2500 to 3500 locations from the year 2015 to 2018. River-wise details of polluted stretches is provided at Annexure-I. 		Details of State-wise and year-wise funds released to the State Governments/Union Territories during last three years under NRCP and  under Namami Gange are given at Annexure-II and Annexure-III respectively.***** ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) to (e) of Lok Sabha Unstarred question No. †2935 to be answered on the 05.12.2019 on “Prevention of River Pollution”.Statewise-Prioritywise number of Polluted River StretchesSTATE	I	II	III	IV	V	Grand TotalANDHRA PRADESH				2	3	5ASSAM	3	1	4	3	33	44BIHAR			1		5	6CHHATTISGARH				4	1	5DAMAN, DIU AND DADRA NAGAR HAVELI	1					1DELHI	1					1GOA			1	2	8	11GUJARAT	5	1	2	6	6	20HARYANA	2					2HIMACHAL PRADESH	1	1	1		4	7JAMMU & KASHMIR		1	2	2	4	9JHARKHAND				3	4	7KARNATAKA			4	7	6	17KERALA	1			5	15	21MADHYA PRADESH	3	1	1	3	14	22MAHARASHTRA	9	6	14	10	14	53MANIPUR		1			8	9MEGHALAYA	2			3	2	7MIZORAM			1	3	5	9NAGALAND	1		1	2	2	6ODISHA	1		3	2	13	19PUDUCHERRY				1	1	2PUNJAB	2			1	1	4RAJASTHAN			1		1	2SIKKIM					4	4TAMIL NADU	4			1	1	6TELANGANA	1	2	2	2	1	8TRIPURA					6	6UTTAR PRADESH	4		1	2	5	12UTTARAKHAND	3	1	1	4		9WEST BENGAL	1	1	3	4	8	17Grand Total	45	16	43	72	175	351 ANNEXURE-IIAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) to (e) of Lok Sabha Unstarred question No. †2935 to be answered on the 05.12.2019 on “Prevention of River Pollution”.Details of State-wise and year-wise funds released to the State Governments/Union Territories during last three years and current year on rivers under NRCP         (excluding Ganga and its tributaries)                                                                                   (Rs. in crore)Sl.
