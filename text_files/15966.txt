ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (c) The Government has notified Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. For proper regulation and sound recycling of plastic waste, provisions have been made for registration of all plastic recyclers with respective State/UT Pollution Control Boards/Committees. Further, the rules mandate the producers, importers and brand owners to work out modalities for waste collection systems based on the principle of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) according to which the primary responsibility for collection of used multi-layered plastic sachets, pouches or packaging is fixed on the producers, importers and brand owners who introduce the products in the market.  The producers, importers and brand owners have now initiated setting up of material recovery facilities for collection of plastic waste and are tying up with the registered recyclers for the recycling of plastic waste on their own or through the Producers Responsibility Organizations (PRO). The EPR mechanism is thus an additional source of income for recyclers.In response to several petitions filed in the NGT, the Hon’ble Court has directed the Pollution Control Boards/Pollution Control Committees to take stringent action against plastic waste recycling units operating in residential areas andthose which are operating without any license or consent. Such units weresealed and electric connections were disconnected. The plastic recycling units which are registered with the Pollution Control Boards /Pollution Control Committees shall continue to operate in designated areas. *****
