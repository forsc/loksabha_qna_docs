                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b):  Government of India (GoI) has accorded ''in-principle'' approval for setting up of 21 Greenfield Airports across the country namely Mopa in Goa, Navi Mumbai, Sindhudurg and Shirdi in Maharashtra, Bijapur, Hassan, Kalaburagi and Shimoga in Karnataka, Datia (Gwalior) in Madhya Pradesh, Kushinagar and Jewar (Noida) in Uttar Pradesh, Dholera and Hirasar in Gujarat, Karaikal in Puducherry, Dagadarthi, Bhogapuram and Orvakal in Andhra Pradesh, Durgapur in West Bengal, Pakyong in Sikkim, Kannur in Kerala and Hollongi (Itanagar) in Arunachal Pradesh. Further, GoI has also granted ''site clearance'' to Government of Madhya Pradesh and Government of Rajasthan for setting up of Greenfield airports at Singrauli and Alwar (Bhiwadi) respectively. So far, five Greenfield airports namely,  Shirdi in Maharashtra, Durgapur in West Bengal, Pakyong in Sikkim, Kannur in Kerala and Kalaburagi in Karnataka have been operationalized. ;Besides this, Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21-10-2016 to stimulate regional air connectivity. An airport which is included in the awarded routes of RCS - UDAN and requires upgradation/development for commencement of RCS operations, is developed under "Revival of unserved and underserved airports" scheme. Under the scheme, 49 airports, 2 water aerodromes and 5 heliports have been revived/developed including Gwalior Airport in Madhya Pradesh.(c):  Sagar (Dhana) airport/airstrip in Madhya Pradesh belongs to the State Government of Madhya Pradesh and the airport/airstrip is listed under unserved category in the RCS-UDAN scheme document. No bid has been received from any airline operator for connecting Sagar airport till fourth round of RCS bidding so far. (d): Bhopal, Indore and Khajuraho airports have already been upgraded to International Standards with New Integrated Terminal Buildings and other associated work. Further, Indore airport has been declared as Customs Notified airport. Indian carriers are free to mount air services from any point in India to foreign destinations as per the respective bilateral air service agreements. However, actual operations are guided by traffic demand and commercial judgment of the airlines.;(e): The Airports Authority of India has spent Rs. 11515.31 crore on the development of airports during the last three years i.e. Financial Year 2017-18 to 2019-20 against allocation of Rs. 11662.89 crore.
