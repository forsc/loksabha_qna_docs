                                                        MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILDDEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a)	& (b): Yes Sir.  There are 14 lakh Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) sanctioned by the Government. During the last years, number of operational Anganwadi Centres has increased as tabulated below:Year	Number of Anganwadi Centres(Operational)31.03.2014	13,42,14631.03.2015	13,46,18631.03.2016	13,49,56331.03.2017	13,54,79231.03.2018	13,63,02131.03.2019	13,72,872(c)	& (d):  The beneficiaries under the Anganwadi Services Scheme are identified on the basis of Aadhaar which is used as identity document for delivery of services or benefits which brings in transparency and efficiency and enables beneficiaries to get their entitlements. The beneficiaries not possessing Aadhar card are assisted by the field functionaries to obtain the Aadhar card. Till such time they get the Adhaar card, they are provided the Anganwadi Services on the basis of alternative identification document. This is an important tool to eliminate fake beneficiaries, if any, and it is an ongoing exercise. It is applicable to all the States/UTs including Kerala.********
