ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) 	Sir, the ‘Do Not Call Registry’ was established by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) in 2007 to allow subscribers some control over Unsolicited Commercial Communications in which they have no interest. To strengthen the enforcement of this registry the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2010 (TCCPR 2010) were bought in force, in which the name ‘Do Not Call Registry’ was changed to ‘National Customer Preference Register (NCPR)’ and registration of telemarketers with TRAI was introduced.	The regulations were successful in control of unwanted communications to an extent. However, to further strengthen the system and to leverage technology in combating this menace, a Distributed Ledger has been established through Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, 2018 (TCCPR 2018). This has allowed the preferences of subscriber for receiving telemarketing calls to be hidden from view of even the telemarketers, thereby protecting subscriber information from abuse. Other measures have also been introduced in these regulations, such as traceability of actions taken by the telecom companies, telemarketers, and businesses that use commercial communication services. This is expected to improve compliance and lead to reduction in the number of complaints.(b) & (c) No information is available for incidents of telemarketing companies calling customers from the personal phones of their employees. However, as per regulation in force, commercial communication (telemarketing) is prohibited from personal phones. In case such complaints are received, the involved phone numbers are liable to be disconnected after investigation by telecom companies. Telemarketing calls can only be made from the numbers in the 140 series.
