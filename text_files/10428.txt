ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)	As part of our active engagement with partner countries under development cooperation, the Government of India has committed to execute a number of projects in partner countries during the last five years. They cover a wide range of sectors like connectivity, energy, hydropower, solar, roads, agriculture, other infrastructure, culture, capacity building, and healthcare. While some of the projects have already been completed, the remaining are under various stages of implementation.These include a number of projects in different countries under the Lines of Credit (LOC) and grants. The year-wise detail of LOC projects extended to foreign countries during the last five years is enclosed at Annexure A. These projects are under various stages of implementation. There are also a number High Impact Community Development Projects which are undertaken by Government in different countries under grant. Government is also undertaking large number of projects in other countries apart from neighbourhood worth Rs. 7345.60 crores in the last five years.  The year-wise details of budget allocated by the Indian Government for the implementation of the grant projects in the foreign countries and the expenditure incurred during the last five years is enclosed at Annexure B. (c)	 An assessment of the funds required for completion of projects is made before each financial year based on progress in execution aligned with project implementation cycle. Timelines fixed for the projects vary and are determined based on consultation with borrower governments and the ground situation. Every effort is made to complete these projects as early as possible, in close consultation with the borrower Governments.In relation to the projects in countries abroad financed under the Lines of Credit scheme, these are being monitored through Project Management Consultants, review meetings held in consultation with Exim Bank of India, bilateral review meetings, visits by Ministry of External Affairs and Exim Bank officials and continuous supervision through concerned Indian Missions and Posts abroad so that the project completion targets are achieved. Similarly projects in foreign countries under grant from Government of India are monitored for expeditious completion of targets by Missions and Posts abroad in consultation with the Ministry of External Affairs and project implementing agency.    By adopting the effective project monitoring and review mechanisms outlined above, Government has been able to reduce the cost and time overruns in respect of projects implemented.***
