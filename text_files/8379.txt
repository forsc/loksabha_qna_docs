                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):     As per information provided by Medical Council of India (MCI), there are a total 11,59,309 allopathic doctors registered with the State Medical Councils/Medical Council of India as on 31st March, 2019. Assuming 80% availability, it is estimated that around 9.27 lakh doctors may be actually available for active service. It gives a doctor-population ratio of 1:1456 as per current population estimate of 1.35 billion, which is lower than the WHO norm of 1:1000. Shortage of doctors in public and private sector varies in different States. Health being a State subject, the primary responsibility to ensure availability of doctors in public health facilities lies with the State/UT Governments and no data with regard to shortage of doctors in the States is maintained centrally.(b) to (e):     At present, there are 539 medical colleges in the country with an intake capacity of 80,312 MBBS seats annually. In the last three years, 15800 undergraduate and 7697 postgraduate medical seats have been increased. Besides, 2242 DNB seats have also been increased during the period. Further, the Central Government has taken several steps to increase the number of medical seats in the country. These include:i.	The ratio of teachers to students for Professor has been revised from 1:1 to 1:2 for all MD/MS disciplines and 1:1 to 1:3 in all clinical subjects in Government funded medical colleges and in Private medical colleges with 15 years standing. Further, for Associate Professor, the said ratio has been revised from 1:1 to 1:2 and to 1:3 if he/she is a unit head in all clinical subjects in Government medical colleges and in Private medical colleges with 15 years standing.   This would result in increase in number of PG seats in the country. ii.	DNB qualification has been recognized for appointment as faculty to take care of shortage of faculty.iii.	Enhancement of maximum intake capacity at MBBS level from 150 to 250.iv.	Relaxation in the norms of setting up of Medical College in terms of requirement for faculty, staff, bed strength and other infrastructure.v.	Minimum requirement of land for establishment of medical college in metropolitan cities as notified under Article 243P(c) of the Constitution of India has been dispensed with.vi.	Strengthening/upgradation of State Government Medical Colleges for starting new PG courses/Increase of PG seats. vii.	Establishment of New Medical Colleges by upgrading district/referral hospitals preferably in underserved districts of the country. viii.	Strengthening/ upgradation of existing State Government/Central Government Medical Colleges to increase MBBS seats.ix.	Enhancement of age limit for appointment/ extension/ re-employment against posts of teachers/dean/principal/ director in medical colleges upto 70 years.x.	Provision has been made in the regulations to offer less number of seats to the applicant medical college, in case, it falls short of minimum prescribed requirements of applied intake to avoid wastage of human resources.xi.	 Consortium (a group of 2 or upto 4 private organizations) has been allowed to establish a medical college.……………………….
