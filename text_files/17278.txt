                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):  It has been informed by AIIMS Delhi, new AIIMS under PMSSY and three central Government Hospitals viz. RML Hospital Delhi, Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi and Lady Hardinge Medical College, Delhi that there is no acute shortage of doctors as well as medical staff.(c) to (f):  It has been informed by AIIMS Raipur that  contractual workers  have been demanding regularization. Department related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare had taken up the matter on 28.08.2018 and had observed the following : “To earnestly examine what preference can be extended to contractual staff in regular recruitment and also whether they can be regularised.”Thereafter, this Ministry had sought advice from the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) vide letters dated 28.09.2018, 01.10.2018 and 30.11.2018. In the meanwhile, contractual staff at AIIMS Bhopal had also filed O.A. No. 43/2018 before Hon’ble CAT, Jabalpur for regularization of their services.  The DoPT vide its O.M. dated 24.01.2019 had cited the Uma Devi judgment dated 10.04.2006 in which Hon’ble Court had stated that there should be no further bypassing of the constitutional requirement and regularizing or making permanent, not duly appointed as per the constitutional scheme. Therefore, since the judgment in O.A. No. 43/2018 was pronounced placing reliance on Uma Devi judgement, the applicants were deemed ineligible for regularization as per the Uma Devi judgement.The clarifications received from the DoPT were circulated to six AIIMS vide letter dated 10.04.2019 for guidance.
