                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????  (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d):	 In order to promote organic products, a dedicated web portal (www.Jaivikkheti.in) has been created to encourage organic farming by directly connecting the farmers in the country including that of Tripura to the  consumers to get a better price for their products. This portal has been developed as both an information platform and a marketing platform. Total 2.12 lakh farmers have been registered under Jaivikkheti portal. Further, Government is implementing National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) scheme wherein regulated whole sale mandis are integrated/linked through virtual platform to facilitate online trading of Agriculture and horticulture commodities through transparent price discovery for produce of farmers through competitive online bidding system. It is a reform linked scheme and the States have to carry out three mandatory reforms in their State Agricultural Produce Market Committee Acts to be eligible to integrate their Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) to e-NAM platform. So far, 585 regulated wholesale mandis of 16 States and 2 Union Territories have been integrated with e-NAM platform which does not include Tripura as the State is yet to carry out mandatory reforms for e-NAM. More than 1.66 crores farmers have been registered in e-NAM platform.********
