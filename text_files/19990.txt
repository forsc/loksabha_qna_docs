Further, amended Act provides that such order shall not be applicable  to a processor or value chain participant of any agricultural produce, if the stock limit of such person does not exceed the overall ceiling of installed capacity of processing or the demand for export in case of an exporter.  State Governments as well as Central Government continue to exercise powers under the Prevention of Black Marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980 which provides for detention in such cases for the purpose of prevention of black-marketing and ensuring maintenance of supplies of essential commodities.*****
