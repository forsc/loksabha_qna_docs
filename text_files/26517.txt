ANSWER




(a)        Yes, Sir. (b)        The Government has partnered with United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), Canada and Finland through Government to Government/ Business to Business engagements. Discussion is an ongoing process. Details are shown below:S.No.	Country	Area of Collaboration1.	UAE	NSDC is working with the Ministry of Human Resource and Emiritization (MoHRE) and Abu Dhabi Quality and Conformity Council (ADQCC) for benchmarking qualifications, assessment and certification. In October, 2018, benchmarking of 16 UAE skill qualifications to 13 Indian skill qualifications in construction and automotive sectors was conducted by the technical teams of NSDC and ADQCC. In August, 2019, a pilot programme was initiated. 133 candidates were assessed on mutually recognized qualifications. 63 candidates were interviewed and selected by the UAE employer out of which 18 candidates were deployed in the UAE. 2.	KSA	In the first phase, 5 occupations were benchmarked between India and KSA. Pilot programme for 100 workers was conducted and Recognition of Prior Learning assessment has been undertaken, out of which 81 candidates have successfully cleared the assessment and were issued joint certification in February, 2020. 3.	Canada	A letter of intent is underway between Ministry of Immigration, Quebec and MSDE to launch a Recruitment Mission to mobilize skilled Indian workers from India to Quebec in the healthcare, retail and hospitality sectors.The process has slowed down due to COVID-19.4.	Finland	NSDC and Finnish National Agency for Education (EDUFI) has an MoU for knowledge exchange to adopt best practices of the Finnish TVET system.The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), the Government of India signed the Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) with the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Government of Japan. The MoC on Technical Intern Training Programme (TITP) was signed on 17th October, 2017 to significantly expand the bilateral cooperation between India and Japan in the field of skill development.  So far 220 interns have been placed in Japan through the Sending Organizations empanelled by NSDC and the interns are pursuing their training in Japan in diverse industry sectors including Manufacturing, Healthcare, Construction, Textile, Agriculture and Food Manufacturing. This is a big leap with more than 780% increase from 17 interns placed in the first year of operation in 2018. As on June, 2021, in addition to the 220 interns placed in Japan, more than 700 candidates are being training by the Indian Sending Organizations. Due to the pandemic, flights to Japan were disrupted since March, 2020 and the TITP interns are unlikely to go to Japan till the Olympics of 2021 are over.In January, 2021, the MoC was signed between the Government of India and the Government of Japan on a basic framework for partnership for proper operation of the system pertaining to “Specified Skilled Worker” (SSW). The MoC on SSW would set an institutional mechanism for partnership and cooperation between India and Japan on sending and accepting skilled Indian workers, who have qualified the required skill and Japanese language test, to work in fourteen sectors in Japan. These Indian workers would be granted a new status of residence of “Specified Skilled Worker” by the Government of Japan. The MoC would enhance people-to-people contacts, foster mobility of workers and skilled professionals from India to Japan. Skilled Indian workers from fourteen sectors viz. nursing care; building cleaning; material processing industry; industrial machinery manufacturing industry; electric and electronic information related industry; construction; shipbuilding and ship-related industry; automobile maintenance; aviation; lodging; agriculture; fisheries; food and beverages manufacturing industry and food service industry would have enhanced job opportunities to work in Japan. (c)        National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), as an implementation arm of MSDE, works in associations and collaboration with different private players as Authorized partners, Networked entities across the country in domain of training, certification, employment support etc. under the overall skill value chain system.
