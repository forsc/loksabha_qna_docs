ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a) & (b):  The Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) is implementing Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) with the primary aim of strengthening Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDG''s) with the main thrust on convergence with Mission Antyodaya. Under the scheme funds are released to States/ Union Territories. The Ministry does not allocate funds directly to Districts of the State.  The MoPR has also been incentivizing best performing Panchayats across the country through awards, including financial incentives ranging from Rs.5-50 lakhs for Panchayats under its Incentivization of Panchayats Scheme in recognition of their good work for improving delivery of services and public goods. District Supaul did not receive any award during the last three years under Incentivization of Panchayats scheme.The major rural development schemes of the Ministry of Rural Development like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) and the scheme of Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) of the Department Drinking Water and Sanitation are implemented at Panchayat level in the country including in the State of Bihar and its Districts of   Supaul.  The scheme like MGNREGS is demand driven and no separate allocation to the States including the State of Bihar is made.  The total funds utilised in the District of Supaul out of the allocated/released funds to the State of Bihar under the scheme of MGNERGS during 2017-18 to 2020-21 (as on 06.03.2021) is Rs.380.92 crore, under PMAY-G is Rs.558.54 crore and Rs.463.87 crore under PMGSY (up to March 2020 since inception of the scheme). (c)  Under the schemes of MoPR, the progress of implementation of the scheme including utilisation of funds is closely monitored with the States through meetings, videoconferences etc. For further release of funds to the States, the status of utilization of funds released earlier is also taken into account. In addition to this, an online monitoring and reporting system (MIS) for RGSA has been developed and operationlised. Transaction based PFMS has been introduced for release and tracking of funds under RGSA..     The Ministry of Rural Development accords emphasis on proper implementation of all its rural development schemes. In order to ensure the programme benefits reach the rural poor, the Ministry has evolved a comprehensive multi-level and multi-format system of monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of rural development programmes, including Performance Review Committee Meetings, District Development Co-ordination and Monitoring Committee (“DISHA”) meetings, chaired by the Hon’ble Member of Parliament, National Level Monitors (NLMs), Area Officers Schemes, Common Review Mission, Concurrent Evaluation and Impact Assessment Studies. NLMs are deputed to visit the districts periodically, generally twice a year, to monitor and report on various aspects of implementation of all rural development programmes.  Besides above, the scheme of PMAY-G is also monitored using MIS-AwaasSoft and Evidence based monitoring using AwaasApp. ‘AwaasApp’ helps monitoring different stages of construction of the house by geo-tagging the same.Under BSM (Grameen), Geo-tagging of community assets, conduct of Swach Survekshan Grameen, declaration of ODF plus villages, provisions of social audits, third party evaluation like provisions are used to monitor the progress of implementation of the scheme. Moreover, all the MPs, MLAs and MLCs of a district are the members of District Swachh Bharat Mission that is responsible for carrying out Block and Gram Panchayat level reviews of SBM (Grameen) programme on regular basis.  *****
