In balance section from Chamaraj-Daladi-Rajkot, construction works are in different stages of execution, wherever land is available. Balance land acquisition has been taken up and all necessary documents have been submitted to State Revenue Authorities.(b) & (c): Completion of the project is dependent upon many factors such as land acquisition, statutory clearances like forestry and wild life clearances, shifting of services, cutting of trees, construction of road over bridges and road under bridges by road maintaining agencies. Since action for balance land acquisition has been taken up, therefore, fixing the timeline for completion of project at this stage is not feasible. *****
