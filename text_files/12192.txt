                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO) (a) to (d): The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a comprehensive list of 17 Global Goals and 169 associated targets, which integrate economic, social and environmental dimensions of development. The SDGs came into effect on 1st January 2016 and are to be achieved by end of year 2030. NITI Aayog has been entrusted with the role to co-ordinate SDG implementation in the country. NITI Aayog has done the mapping of all the SDGs and associated targets with the Central Ministries, Centrally Sponsored and Central Sector Schemes as well as major government initiatives. Central Ministries are striving to achieve the SDG targets by 2030 through the implementation of different development schemes in collaboration with the State Governments and Union Territories. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has developed a National Indicator Framework in consultation with other Ministries to support monitoring of progress on the SDGs. NITI Aayog has published the SDG India Index to track progress of all the States and UTs with respect to SDGs and ranks the States/UTs on a scale of 0 to 100 based on their performance. MoSPI released “Sustainable Development Goals National Indicator Framework Baseline Report 2015-16”, which provides a benchmark for monitoring progress of the country on the various targets under the SDGs. MoSPI has also developed SDG Dashboard on NIF to visualize the progress of SDGs with associated targets at national as well as sub-national level.****
