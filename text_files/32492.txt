MUNISWAMY REGARDING KOLAR GOLD FIELDS.(a) & (b): Yes, Sir. Management Consultant hired for suggesting way forward in respect of Bharat Gold Mines Limited (a PSU under the M/o Mines) whose operations are closed since 01.03.2001, has submitted its report.  Based on the report of the Management Consultant, Monitoring Committee constituted by the Ministry to suggest way forward for BGML, has recommended that the underground mining activities have been abandoned since closure and is flooded with sub-surface ground water.  Hence, the existing underground mines are not accessible. Further, the mines were closed due to unviable and uneconomic mining of gold and the lease is expiring in 2023, it would be prudent not to pursue the mining activities by BGML. On expiry of the BGML mining lease, Government of Karnataka may auction or allocate the ore tailing dumps and the two gold mineralization blocks namely Mc Taggert and Oriental lodes which are located within the BGML mining lease for development of the plants for extraction of gold from dumps and exploration and exploitation of the gold mineralization blocks respectively.(c) & (d): There is no plan in Ministry of Mines to convert BGML mines to museums.(e):  As per available information, Crown Mines, one of the largest and deepest gold mines in Johannesburg in South Africa is converted to Museum.(f) & (g): There is no such plan under consideration. *****
