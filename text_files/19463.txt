ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (f) : The Corona Virus (COVID-19) pandemic followed by lockdowns has affected economies across the globe including India. COVID-19 has resulted in large number of migrant workers going back to their native places. Government has taken several initiatives to address the challenges and threats posed by Covid-19.	Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana (ABRY) Scheme has been launched to incentivize creation of new employment alongwith social security benefits and restoration of loss of employment during COVID-19 pandemic. This scheme being implemented through the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO)  reduces the financial burden of the employers of various sectors/industries including MSMEs and encourages them to hire more workers. Under ABRY, the Government of India is  crediting  both the employees’ share (12% of wages) and employers share’ (12% of wages) of contribution payable or only the employees’ share, depending on employment strength of the EPFO registered establishments.	To boost employment and livelihood opportunities for migrant workers returning to villages, in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak, Government of India has launched Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan (GKRA) on 20th June 2020. Total employment generated (in persondays) under the GKRA as on 02-02-2021 is 507868671.	Government of India under PM- SVANidhi Scheme has facilitated collateral free working capital loan upto Rs.10,000/- for one-year tenure to street vendors, to resume their businesses.  	Under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY), Government of India has  contributed both 12% employer’s share and 12% employee’s share under Employees Provident Fund (EPF), totaling 24% of the wage for the wage month from March to August, 2020 for  the establishments having upto 100 employees with 90% of such employees earning less than Rs. 15000/-. Under the PMGKY scheme Rs 2567.66 crore was credited in EPF accounts of 38.82 lakhs eligible employees.	In addition, RBI and Government of India have introduced measures to infuse liquidity in the economy to sustain the market economy and raise the level of employment.            ESIC provides relief to the insured persons(IP) in contingency of unemployment under Atal Beemit Vyakti Kalyan Yojana under which cash relief is paid for a period of maximum 90 days, provided the IP was in insurable employment for at least two years before being unemployed. The scheme which was initially implemented on a pilot basis for a period of two years, came into force on 01.07.2018.          ESI Corporation has extended this scheme for another one-year i.e. from 01.07.2020 to 30.06.2021, with enhanced quantum of relief  from 25 % to 50% of the average daily earning and relaxation of eligibility conditions for the Insured Persons who became unemployed 24.03.2020 onwards.             ESIC invests its funds as per the investment policy approved by ESI Corporation in line with the instructions issued by Ministry of Finance, Govt. of India. ESIC has invested Rs.16,976.78 crore in Special Deposit Account (SDA) maintained by  Govt. of India.	   ESI Scheme is implemented as per provisions of ESI Act,1948 and is funded by contributions received from covered employers and employees, which is deposited in the “ESI Fund”. No grants of Central Government are received by ESIC. All expenditure towards providing cash benefits and medical benefits are made from ESI Fund by ESIC. *****
