ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (d): Modernisation of police forces is an ongoing and continuous process. ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects as per the seventh Schedule of the Constitution. State Governments are primarily responsible for modernisation of their police forces. However, the Government of India supplements the efforts of the State Governments towards equipping and modernizing their police forces, by providing financial assistance under the scheme of ‘Assistance to States for Modernisation of Police(ASMP)’. -2/… -2-LS.US.Q.NO.1105 FOR 08.02.2022Under this scheme, the States are provided central assistance for acquisition of advanced weaponry such as latest rifles, all types of intelligence equipment including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs),  Night Vision Devices (NVDs), CCTV surveillance systems & body worn camera systems; modern communication equipment and state-of-the-art equipment for  security, training, forensics, cybercrime, traffic policing, etc. Further, ‘construction’ and ‘purchase of operational vehicles’ are also permitted in the insurgency affected north-eastern States and Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected districts.  Implementation of this scheme has resulted in appreciable improvement in police infrastructure of State Governments. Under this centrally sponsored scheme, for being considered for release of funds, State Governments have to furnish Utilisation Certificate (UC) in respect of funds released to them till 31st December in each financial year. State Governments furnish UCs from time to time. If a State Government fails to furnish UC, funds to the extent of unutilised amount is not released to that State. Such unreleased amounts as on 31st December of the financial year are pooled and released as ‘better performance incentives’ to the States with no pending UCs. The amount of central financial assistance disbursed and unspent balance at States’ end under this scheme since the financial year 2014-15 are as below:-3/… -3-LS.US.Q.NO.1105 FOR 08.02.2022(? in crore) Financial Year	Funds Released	Unspent balance(as on 31.01.2022)2014-15	1397.24	9.682015-16	662.11	10.822016-17	594.02	24.722017-18	451.75	61.502018-19	768.83	236.072019-20	781.12	513.442020-21	103.25*	93.882021-22	89.17*	88.79(* Funds against allocations could not be released to most of the States as they had substantial unspent balances out of earlier releases under the scheme.)(e) 	Under this centrally sponsored scheme, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and 8 North-Eastern States have to provide 10% share of the total size of the annual State Action Plan, while the other States have to provide 40% share.(f) 	Details of the funds lapsed due to non-utilisation of earlier released funds, State-wise and year-wise, are at Annexure.****
