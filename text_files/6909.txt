                                                    (a) whether the rail network in Haryana falls under 3 railway zones, i.e, North-West Railway zone and Northern Railway Zone and North-Central Railway zone; and (b) if so, the reasons therefor and the steps taken/likely to be taken to put Haryana State under only one of the three zones for better management and coordination?






ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a):  Yes, Sir. (b): Zones and Divisions on Indian Railways are not based on the State or District boundaries. The jurisdiction of a Zone/Division is decided on the basis of operational/administrative requirements, without any regional considerations, keeping in view the geographical contiguity of the divisions forming a zone and smooth movement of traffic. This is done with a view to improve train operations and efficiency of the system. The present arrangement is working satisfactorily and there is no plan to put Haryana under one Railway zone.*****
