Based on the success of the pilot, the Programme was extended to pan-India level with 43 courses conducted in 2018-19 covering diverse fields - pollution monitoring (air/water/soil), emission inventory, Sewage Treatment Plant (STP)/Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP)/Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) operation, waste management, environmental impact assessment, water budgeting & auditing, bamboo management & livelihood generation, etc.  Overall, 135 training programmes were conducted at 87 locations throughout the country and 2315 youth have been successfully trained under various courses during 2018-19.(b) & (c):  As per the industry specific effluent standards notified by the Government under the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, only treated effluent, meeting the standards, is permitted to be discharged. All industries are required to install Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) for treatment of wastewater as per the conditions in the Consent to Operate issued by the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/ Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. In addition, the Government has taken various steps for prevention and control of industrial pollution like, categorization of industries based on their pollution potential; identification of industries falling under the 17 categories of highly polluting industries and issuance of directions for  installation of Online Continuous Effluent Monitoring System (OCEMS) in these industries for continuous check on discharge of pollutants; identification of Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs); inspection of industries based on computer generated alerts ; issuance of various directions under Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Environment (Protection) Act, 1986; monitoring of water quality of various water bodies under the National Water Quality Monitoring Programme (NWMP); etc.*****
