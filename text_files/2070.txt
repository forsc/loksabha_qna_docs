                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) & (b)  	One of the strategic objectives of the National Digital Communications Policy 2018 (NDCP-2018) is “Provisioning Broadband for all”, which inter-alia, aims to provide universal broadband connectivity at 50Mbps to every citizen; provide 1 Gbps connectivity to all Gram Panchayats of India by 2020 and 10 Gbps by 2022; ensure connectivity to all uncovered areas. (c) & (d)	No specific advisory has been sent to the State Governments to identify the places in the cities experiencing heavy congestion in telecom networks. To address issue of network congestion Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has laid down Quality of Service (QoS) benchmarks for various parameters for Cellular Mobile Telephone Service through “the Standards of Quality of Service for Basic Telephone Service (Wireline) and Cellular Mobile Telephone Service Regulations, 2009 (as amended)”, and several parameters for assessing network congestion have been provided under these regulations. TRAI assesses the performance of service providers against the benchmarks for laid down parameters for the service area as a whole. In case of non-compliance with the benchmarks the service providers are liable to pay the financial disincentives, which TRAI may impose. (e) 	In order to enhance and extend telecommunication services in Delhi Licensed Service Area (Delhi-LSA), which includes parts of NCR, the Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) have added 75,387 Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) in last five years. TRAI has reported that for the quarter ending March 2019 all the service providers have met the benchmarks for the QoS parameters in Delhi-LSA, which includes parts of NCR areas.
