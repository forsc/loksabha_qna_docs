ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a): Yes, in order to realize the Government’s objective of “Housing for All” by 2022, Rural Housing Interest Subsidy Scheme (RHISS) was approved by the Union Cabinet on 24th January 2017. The guidelines were released for RHISS on 19th June 2017.  RHISS provides for interest subsidy at the rate of 3.0 percent on the principal amount of the loan. The interest subsidy by Government of India is admissible for a maximum loan amount of Rs.2.00 lakh for 20 years or full period of loan whichever is less. The maximum amount of subsidy for a beneficiary is Rs.38,359/- for the entire duration of the loan.                 National Housing Bank (NHB) was identified as the Central Nodal Agency (CNA) to channelize the subsidy to the lending institutions and to monitor the scheme implementation. Primary lending institutions for RHISS include Scheduled Commercial Banks, Housing Finance Companies, Regional Rural banks, State Cooperative banks, Urban Cooperative banks, Small finance banks, Non Banking Financial Companies (NBFC), Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs) or any other institution identified by the Ministry. RHISS progress till 14th January, 2021  is as below: (b): 	In order to realize the Government’s objective of “Housing for All” by 2022, Rural Housing Interest Subsidy Scheme (RHISS) was approved by the Union Cabinet on 24th January 2017.  The initial funding of Rs. 48.54 crore was released by the Ministry of Rural Development to NHB on 31st July, 2019 and subsequently, subsidy has been disbursed during current year also.  Year wise details of rural poor who have benefited from the above Scheme in the States of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Tripura from the amount so far released, are given below:  (c): No subsidy has been disbursed in the State of Tripura so far.  The progress and performance of the subsidy disbursed under the scheme especially in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh are as under:- (d): 	Total subsidy disbursed under the scheme till 14th January, 2021 is Rs 12.20 crore. The reasons  for poor utilization of funds and weak response from the rural poor are as below:i.	Major public sector banks like State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank, UCO Bank and Indian Bank have not entered into an MoU with NHB.ii.	As the subsidy needs to be extended to beneficiaries who are not part of the Permanent Wait List of PMAY G, identification of such borrowers is difficult. iii.	Unavailability of credit guarantee is affecting the off-take of the scheme through Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) as they are reluctant to sanction loans without credit guarantee. (e): 	NHB is the Central Nodal Agency for RHISS.  Inclusion of new PLIs is a continuous process undertaken by NHB.  *********
