ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): Government has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) to facilitate/stimulate regional air connectivity by making it affordable. RCS-UDAN is a market driven scheme. Airlines undertake assessment of demand and nature of supply required on particular routes and lead the process under RCS. Under RCS - UDAN, there is a provision for revival of existing unserved airports. Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has approved the proposal for revival of existing un-served / under-served airports/airstrips of the State Governments, Airports Authority of India, Public Sector Undertakings and Civil Enclaves at an estimated cost of Rs. 4500 Crore. Revival of these unserved/underserved airports is ''demand driven'', depending upon firm commitment from airline operators as well as from the State Governments for providing various concessions.  No airline has submitted proposal for operation of flight from Chandrapur under RCS-UDAN. Chandrapur airstrip of Maharashtra figures under tentative lists of unserved Airports/Airstrips in the RCS - UDAN version 4.0 document. If any valid bid is received under RCS-UDAN, same shall be considered as per scheme document.
