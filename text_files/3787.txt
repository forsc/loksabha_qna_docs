MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (d) Education is in the concurrent list of the Constitution and majority of schools areunder the jurisdiction of the State Governments. It is for the respective State Governments toensure that the moral education is taught effectively in their schools.National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has developedNational Curriculum Framework (NCF, 2005) which emphasises on inculcating moral values,attitudes and skills required for living in harmony with oneself and with others. Issues related toMoral values, wherever possible have been incorporated in the textbooks developed for schoolstage as well as in the entire school life – the curriculum, classroom climate, school management,teaching-learning, teacher-pupil relationships etc.As per information received from University Grants Commission (UGC), moraleducation is embedded in the syllabi of all courses in the stream of Humanities and SocialSciences at university level. Further, some universities in the country are also running courses onspiritual and religious studies.******
