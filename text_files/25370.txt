ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b): Yes, National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) under the Department of Pharmaceuticals fixes / revises the ceiling prices of the scheduled formulations as per the provisions of the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO, 2013). Further, NPPA also monitors the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of scheduled formulations so as to ensure that the MRP of such formulations are within the range of ceiling price and that of non-scheduled formulations to ensure that MRP does not increase by more than 10% of MRP during the preceding twelve months. The details of ceiling / retail prices fixed/revised by NPPA are available on NPPA’s website,  www.nppaindia.nic.in.(c) & (d): NPPA has issued detailed guidelines on 13th April, 2016 for compliance of revised prices by the manufacturers / marketing companies due to change in the Tax/ GST rates.  Recently, the GST Council in its 44th meeting held on 12th June, 2021 has reduced GST on goods being used in COVID-19 management. A copy of the press release issued by the Ministry of Finance indicating the details of medicines and medical devices used for COVID management, on which GST rates were revised, is enclosed. In order to pass the benefit of reduction in GST rates to the consumers, NPPA has issued instructions on 15th June, 2021 to all the manufacturers and marketing companies of drugs/formulations and medical devices to revise the MRP of drugs/formulations on which Tax/GST rates have been reduced. A copy of OM dated 15th June, 2021 of NPPA is enclosed.
