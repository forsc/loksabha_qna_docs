ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) to (d): Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) conducts an anti-dumping investigation on import of a product on the basis of a duly substantiated application filed by the domestic industry with a prima-facie evidence of dumping into the country causing injury to the domestic industry. 	The anti-dumping investigation is conducted in accordance with Customs Tariff (Identification, Assessment and collection of Anti-dumping Duty on Dumped Articles and for Determination of Injury) Rules, 1995, as amended from time to time, framed under the Customs Tariff Act, 1975. DGTR critically analyses the submissions and evidence on record and issues a final finding containing its recommendation regarding imposition of appropriate anti-dumping measure. The basic intent of anti-dumping measure is to eliminate injury caused to the domestic industry and to create a level playing field for the domestic industry. Acting upon the recommendation of the DGTR, the Department of Revenue may levy provisional or definitive anti-dumping duty. Since such anti-dumping duty is in addition to other duties levied on the product, its imposition discourages import of the concerned product by making it costlier. 	To assist the domestic industry, particularly MSMEs, to file application for trade remedy measures, DGTR has established a Help Desk & Facilitation Centre with effect from 23.09.2019. The Help Desk also guides the MSME units, with the support of concerned Administrative Ministry/ Department, in removing ''data gaps'' encountered in the process of filing a trade remedial application, thus enhancing their access to trade remedies.DGTR is also conducting outreach programmes to sensitize the domestic manufacturers about the trade remedy measures available to the industry to counter the unfair trade practices being adopted by the exporters in the exporting countries. *****
