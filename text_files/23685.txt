Thereafter, several meetings have been held with the Federations to explain the rationale behind this PPP initiative and the fact that the existing passenger train services shall not be affected by the operation of passenger train services through PPP mode. These services to be operated through PPP mode shall be additional trains and are aimed at increasing the availability of train services to the public. As such, the interest of employees working for the operation of existing train services over Indian Railways will not be affected. Further, it has been decided that the Crew (Drivers and Guards) required for operation of trains through PPP mode shall be provided by Indian Railways, which shall make Railway employees a vital part of PPP in passenger train operations project.*****
