                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c): 	No Such instance has come to the notice of Government of India. However, in the wake of demonetization policy, the Government decide to grant interest waiver for two months (November and December 2016) for all short term crop loans availed from Cooperative Banks between 01.04.2016 to 30.09.2016 by all farmers and upfront deposit of the same in the account of the concerned farmers. For this purpose, additional funds of Rs. 660.50 crore were granted under the Interest Subvention Scheme.(d): 	Government of India supplements the efforts of the State Governments through various Schemes/ Programmes. The various schemes/ programmes of the Government of India are meant for the welfare of the farmers by increasing production and remunerative returns to the farmers.            Giving a major boost to the pro-farmer initiatives, the Government has approved a new Umbrella Scheme ‘Pradhan Mantri Annadata  Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA)’.  The Scheme is aimed at ensuring remunerative prices to the farmers for their produce as announced in the Union Budget for 2018. This is an unprecedented step taken by Govt. of India to protect the farmers’ income which is expected to go a long way towards the welfare of farmers. Giving a major boost for the farmers income, the Government has approved the increase in the Minimum Support Price (MSPs) for all Kharif & Rabi crops for 2018-19 season at a level of at least 150 percent of the cost of production.
