ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING(SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a) to (b):  Presently, the Set Top Box (STB) provided by a service provider is tightly coupled with Conditional Access System (CAS) deployed by the Service Provider. The interoperability of STBs is a complex issue involving the issue of probable piracy of content. It primarily needs to take care of disparate requirements such as technical neutrality, innovation, flexibility and low cost of STB etc. STBs in the market used different compression technique, Coding technique, Encryption system, Middleware and operating system. These technical options make it unique and complicate the interoperability. (c) to (d): TRAI has taken up the issue relating to development of interoperable STBs in digital Television Broadcasting Sector that should be compatible across operators using same platforms.  The matter involves a complex R&D (Research and Development) process to devise a widely acceptable solution among the stakeholders. *****
