ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (d): Government has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21.10.2016 to facilitate/stimulate regional air connectivity by making it affordable. RCS - UDAN is market driven mechanism. Development of regional air connectivity routes is left to market forces and airlines undertake assessment of demand and nature of supply required on particular routes and lead the process under RCS - UDAN. After first round of bidding under RCS - UDAN, RCS routes connecting Bilaspur, Ambikapur and Jagdalpur airports of Chhattisgarh were awarded to Selected Airline Operator (SAO). These routes were subsequently terminated / cancelled due to non-compliance by SAO. ;No valid bid for operation of RCS flights connecting Bilaspur and Ambikapur was received in further rounds of bidding. In third round of bidding of UDAN, RCS routes connecting Jagdalpur to Hyderabad, Raipur, Vishakhapatnam and Bhubaneshwar have been awarded. ;;At present, 4th round of bidding under UDAN is in progress. In case, any valid bid is received for routes connecting Bilaspur and Ambikapur in Chhattisgarh, same shall be considered as per RCS provisions. ;;State Government of Chhattisgarh has developed airports at Bilaspur and Jagdalpur with the technical assistance of Airports Authority of India (AAI). Bilaspur and Jagdalpur airports are licensed for Code 2C type of aircraft. Licensing of Ambikapur airport for Code 2B type of aircraft depends upon the completion of the required infrastructure/procedures. Chhattisgarh Government has requested for Navigation facilities and upgradation of airports for operating flights from the above mentioned airports. The Selected Airline Operators (SAOs) under UDAN are obligated to commence RCS flight operations on a RCS-route within a period of six months from the issuance of Letter of Award or within two months from the readiness of airport, whichever is later, unless any extension is granted by the Implementing Agency.
