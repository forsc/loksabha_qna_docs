                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2510 BY SHRIMATI SUMALATHA AMBAREESH AND SHRI D.K. SURESH TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 16.03.2022 REGARDING NEW RAILWAY LINES IN KARNATAKA(a) to (d):  Railway projects are sanctioned and taken up Zonal Railway-wise and not State-wise as the Indian Railways’ projects may span across State boundaries. During the last 20 years i.e. 2001-02 onwards, 17 nos. of new line projects totalling 1,934 Km length falling fully/partly in the State of Karnataka have been included in Budget out of which 11 new line projects of length 1,412 Km have been sanctioned.  	As on 01.04.2021, 21 new line Projects costing `34,154 crore for 2,583 Km length falling fully/partly in State of Karnataka are under different stage of planning/approval/execution, Out of which 284 Km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `4,803 crore has been incurred upto March, 21.Since 2014, there is substantial increase in budget outlay for infrastructure projects and safety works and commensurate commissioning of projects. Average annual Budget allocation for Infrastructure and safety works, falling fully/partly in State of  Karnataka,  during  2014-19 has been enhanced to `2,702 crore  per  year  from  `835 crore  per  year  during  2009-14,  which  is 224% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14.  For financial year 2019-20 budget allocation of `3,386 crore (306% more than average annual allocation of 2009-14) and for financial year 2020-21 `4,220 crore (405% more than average annual budget allocation of 2009-14)  has been  provided  for  these  works. For financial  year 2021-22, highest ever budget outlay of `4,297 crore has been provided for these works, which is 415% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14. During 2014-21, 1,162 Km sections (281 Km of New line and 881 Km of Doubling) falling fully/partly in the State of Karnataka have been commissioned at an average rate 166 km per year, which is 47% more than commissioning during 2009-14 (113 Km/Yr).	The completion of any Railway project(s) depends on various factors like deposition of cost share by cost sharing authority in cost sharing project(s), quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project(s) site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions etc.  All these factors affect the completion time of the project(s). As such, confirmed completion time of project(s) cannot be ascertained at this stage. Nevertheless, every effort is being made to execute the project(s) expeditiously. *****
