ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????      (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a):    Government fixes Minimum Support Prices (MSP) on the basis of recommendations of Commission for Agriculture Cost & Prices (CACP) as well as consultation with other stakeholders. CACP considers various factors including actual cost of cultivation as well as Composite Input Price Index (CIPI) while recommending MSP, which is expressed in terms of Rs. per quintal. (b):   The details of cost of production in the last five years for mandated MSP crops are given in Annex. (c):    Cost of production is one of the important factors in the determination of MSP. While recommending its price policy, the CACP considers all costs in a comprehensive manner. The costs include all paid out costs such as those incurred on account of hired human labour, bullock labour/machine labour, rent paid for leased in land, expenses incurred in cash and kind on the use of material inputs like seeds, fertilizers, manures, irrigation charges, depreciation on implements and farm buildings, interest on working capital, diesel/electricity for operation of pump sets etc., miscellaneous expenses and imputed value of family labour. 	            In addition to cost of production CACP also considers various other factors while recommending MSP which include overall demand-supply situations of various crops in domestic and world markets, domestic and international prices, inter-crop price parity, terms of trade between agriculture and non-agriculture sector, likely effect of price policy on rest of economy and a minimum of 50 percent as the margin over cost of production.
