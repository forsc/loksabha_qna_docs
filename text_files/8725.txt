                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a):	  	As per census 2011, the number of workers in the age group of 5-14 years is 43,53,247. (b) & (c):	 As per Census 2011, Out of total 43,53,247 workers in the age group of 5-14 years, the number of  girls  is  16,89,200 while the number of male child worker is 26,64,047.               	 Child Labour is an outcome of various socio-economic problems such as poverty, economic backwardness and illiteracy.     For elimination of child labour, the Government of India stands committed to the elimination of child labour in the country.                   The Government has amended the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986 and enacted the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 which came into force with effect from  1.9.2016. The Amendment Act inter-alia provides for complete prohibition of work or employment of children below 14 years of age in any occupation and process and prohibition of adolescents in the age group of 14 to 18 years in hazardous occupations and processes. The Amendment Act also provides for stricter punishment for employers for violation of the Act and has made the offence as cognizable.*******
