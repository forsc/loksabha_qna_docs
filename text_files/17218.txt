ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a): There is sufficient coal at the Coal based Thermal Power Plants of the country.  As per Central Electricity Authority (CEA), the coal stock at thermal power plants end increased from 20.41 MT on 10.09.2019 to 35.96 MT on 10.09.2020 which is sufficient for 20 days consumption. Further, Coal stock at Non-Pithead Plants increased from 16.95 MT on 10.09.2019 to 30.11 MT on 10.09.2020 which is sufficient from 22 days coal consumption by the Non-Pithead power plants. (b): There have been sporadic instances of resistance from local population for movement of coal through road mode due to various issues including environmental concerns. It is mandatory for the coal company to obtain consent under Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 from the concerned State Pollution Board. (c): Coal companies have planned to minimize movement of coal through road mode in a phased manner and substitute the same by conveyor belts, ropeways etc. In the first stage of First Mile Connectivity (FMC), 39 big mines, which produce more than 4 Million Tonnes coal per annum,  have been identified for creating infrastructure for  mechanized movement of coal up to the loading point. Ministry of Power in a meeting on 25.01.2018 has directed for use of captive mode of transport for coal movement like elevated closed belt conveyors for Power plants within 20 kilometers from pithead, Merry-Go-Round (MGR) for plants located within 40 Kms from pithead and the option of MGR based on financial viability for power plants upto 100 Kms.   ***
