                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ??????? ??????   (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	Government announces Minimum Support Price (MSP) for 22 mandated crops viz., paddy, jowar, bajra, maize, ragi, arhar, moong, urad, groundnut-in-shell, soyabean, sunflower, sesamum, nigerseed, cotton, wheat, barley, gram, masur(lentil), rapeseed/mustard, safflower, jute and copra. In addition, MSP of Toria and de-husked coconut are also fixed on the basis of the MSPs of rapeseed/mustard and copra respectively. West Bengal farmers are free to sell their crop at MSP.(b) to (d): 	The total quantity of paddy, wheat and maize produced in West Bengal in 2020 and total number of farmers benefitted from the various crops procured at MSP in the state of West Bengal in 2020 is at Annexure-I. The State Govt. has not done this procurement. Paddy is procured by Food Corporation of India (FCI) and Jute is procured by Jute Corporation of India.	(e):	Crops generally non-perishable in nature, having mass consumption, essential for food security, do not have widely varying cost of production and widely grown having large area under cultivation are included under MSP. However, Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) is implemented for procurement of those horticultural/agricultural commodities which are perishable in nature and are not covered under MSP support. The objective of intervention is to protect the growers of these commodities from making distress sale in the event of a bumper crop during the peak arrival period when the prices tend to fall below economic levels i.e., cost of production. This scheme is implemented at the request of a State / UT Govt.
