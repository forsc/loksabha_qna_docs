Development of regional air connectivity routes is left to market forces and airlines undertake assessment of demand and nature of supply required on particular routes and lead the process under RCS - UDAN. States of North Eastern Region have been included as Priority Area(s) in the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik). Helicopter services have also been included in the scheme for better connectivity of Priority Area(s). ;Besides RCS-UDAN, Government has also laid down Route Dispersal Guidelines(RDGs) with a view to achieve better air transport services to different regions of the country.
