STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF THE STARRED QUESTION NO.50 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 01.12.2021 IN THE LOK SABHA.(a) to (c): 		Ethanol Blended with Petrol (EBP) Programme was launched with multifarious objective of increasing income of farmers, reduction in import of crude oil, reduction in pollution etc. The Government has notified the National Bio-fuel Policy, 2018 which inter-alia allows production of ethanol from sugarcane juice, sugar containing materials like sugar beet, sweet sorghum, starch containing material like corn, cassava, damaged food-grains like wheat, broken rice etc.           Besides, the policy also allows use of surplus food-grains for production of ethanol under Ethanol Blended with Petrol (EBP) Programme with the approval of National Bio-fuel Coordination Committee (NBCC) comprising of representatives from Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Department of Food & Public Distribution, NITI Aayog etc. The NBCC in year 2020, after holding discussions with various stakeholders and after taking into consideration the sufficient availability of rice and maize in the country, has recommended the production of ethanol from rice available with Food Corporation of India (FCI) and from maize for blending with petrol under EBP Programme, which were accepted by the Government.  There is sufficient availability of food-grains in the country and in no way food-security or per capita availability of food-grains has been compressed.(d): 		The stocking norm as on 01st October, 2021 for rice is 102.50 LMT and for wheat is 205.2 LMT. Against this, the total availability of rice with FCI (including state agencies) is 253.26 LMT and wheat is 468.52 LMT. Annual procurement of rice and wheat is also more than the requirement of food-grains under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), Other Welfare Schemes (OWS) and strategic reserve being maintained for food security. (e):		Does not arise.   ***
