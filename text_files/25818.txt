ANSWER




                                                        (a) and (b): Yes, Sir. Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) takes action on the Registrar or Enrolment Agency or service provider based on the Policy for enforcing of Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update) Regulations 2016, processes, standards, guidelines, data quality and containing corrupt /fraudulent practices, as updated from time to time. The latest policy dated 24.03.2021 is attached as Annexure-1.The action against such Registrar or Enrolment Agency or service provider includes deactivation of Aadhaar operator for retraining, suspension of Aadhaar operator and imposition of financial penalty on the Registrar or Enrolment Agency or service provider. Such details (monthly basis) are available under the link https://uidai.gov.in/ecosystem/enrolment-documents/sanction-orders.html (c):  In such cases the Aadhaar enrolment/update request gets rejected and the resident has to re-enroll/ re-update. However, the overall rejection in Quality Check (including operator mistakes) of the enrolment during the last 6 months is approximately 4.78 percent only.In order to minimize difficulties faced by the residents UIDAI has made provision for two screens in all the Enrolment Kits. The resident enrolling for Aadhaar can check the demographic details being recorded in their Aadhaar on the screen in front of them and ask the operator to enter correct information then and there, if entered wrongly. In addition to this, the resident gets an acknowledgement slip after enrollment/ update having all the details printed on it. Resident has to give his/ her consent and sign on the acknowledgement slip after Enrolment/ update, which becomes the part of the enrolment packet. UIDAI takes earnest efforts to minimize such errors by sensitizing its operators by imparting various trainings from time to time.With Quality check in place, UIDAI ensures that the resident does not get an Aadhaar with incorrect demographic information. In addition, no new Aadhaar /updation could be carried out based on invalid / fake documents.********Annexure-IPolicy for enforcing of Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update) Regulations 2016 , processes, standards, guidelines, Data Quality and containing corrupt / fraudulent practices.(Version -3.0 dated 24/03/2021)Honourable Supreme Court of India while disposing of Writ Petition (Civil ) No. 247 of 2017 and others dated 9.6.2017 in PAN- Aadhaar linking case, has inter alia  stated that :“….It is important that the aforesaid apprehensions are assuaged by taking proper measures so that confidence is instilled among the public at large that there is no chance of unauthorised leakage of data whether it is done by tightening the operations of the contractors who are given the job of enrolment, they being private persons or by prescribing severe penalties to those who are found guilty of leaking the details, is the outlook of the Government. However, we emphasise that measures in this behalf are absolutely essential and it would be in the fitness of things that proper scheme in this behalf is devised at the earliest.….”The above security concerns raised by Honourable Supreme Court about biometric as well as other personal data of residents have necessitated tightening  of the enrolment process and operation  and creating  by imposing financial disincentive on Registrars and deactivating/suspending their operators.The Regulation 26 – “Liability of Registrars, enrolling agencies and other service providers and action in case of default” is reproduced below:“Without prejudice to any other action which may be taken under the Act, for violation of any regulation, process, standard, guideline or order, by a Registrar or Enrolment Agency or any service provider or any other person, the Authority may immediately suspend the activities of such a Registrar or Enrolment Agency or service provider or concerned person, and after holding due enquiry, it may take steps for imposition of financial disincentives on such a Registrar or Enrolment Agency or service provider or any other person and for cancellation of the credentials, codes and permissions issued to them pursuant to the Act or these regulations, or any other steps as may be specifically provided for in the terms of engagement with the Authority."1.	UIDAI performs various validations & quality checks once the enrollment packet is uploaded to CIDR by Registrar/Enrolment agency. During these processes erroneous packets gets rejected. UIDAI also receives resident feedback/grievances through various channels regarding overcharging of residents for enrolment/update. UIDAI has started taking feedback from enrolled resident by calling/contacting them about their experience during their Aadhaar enrolment / update. Following are the broad objectives and actions proposed for Enforcing of Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update) Regulations 2016, processes, standards, guidelines, Data Quality and containing corrupt / fraudulent practices. To ensure that the interests of the UIDAI and the resident are protected, poor data quality and deviations from process norms (herein after called deficiencies) are dis-incentivized. Equally, the disincentives imposed must seek to serve as a deterrent and provide an opportunity for improvement, but must not become an unsustainable liability for the enrolment partners.2.	Specific deficiencies shall attract financial disincentives and administrative actions whereas Performance based periodic review attract administrative action if overall performance is poor for the period under review.3.	All the transactions during the previous month, irrespective of enrolment for new Aadhaar or update shall be considered for assessing the deficiencies4.	The overall financial dis-incentives on account of deficiencies other than corruption charges, in a given month, shall be capped at 10 % of the total amount payable in that month to the registrar – EA combination. The outstanding amount due to capping shall not be carried forward to the next month.  5.	The financial disincentive to be imposed against the corrupt practices reported by Regional Office for action as per MOM of the Standard Reconciliation Committee (SRC) meeting will be imposed in full.  Considering the UIDAI policy of 0% tolerance against corruption, this shall be applied over and above the deficiency charges mentioned as per para 3 above. The financial disincentive on corruption to be impossed only as per SRC report submitted by RO, including on OBD survey cases. The outstanding amount due over and above the amount payable during the month shall not be carried forward to the next month.6.	UIDAI, while making payment of assistance to Registrars will deduct the amount on account of financial disincentives.7.	In case of any dispute on the financial disincentive imposed against deficiencies or corruption cases, the Registrar may raise the same in the next SRC meeting and action shall be taken based on the decision of the SRC Committee.8.	Various deficiencies & Financial disincentives /administrative actions are as below.Sl.

The 10% capping shall not be applicable for SLA on Corruption and the entire amount shall be deducted from payment.
