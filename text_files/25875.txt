                                                                 THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                          (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a):	Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) was launched on 25 June 2015 in selected 500 cities and towns across the country. State-wise list of 500 cities and towns covered under the scheme is given at ANNEXURE-I. Out of 500 cities, 13 cities have been merged with another AMRUT cities by the respective States. (b) & (c):	 The Mission focuses on development of basic infrastructure, in the selected cities and towns, in the sectors of water supply; sewerage and septage management; storm water drainage; green spaces and parks; and non-motorized urban transport. A set of Reforms and Capacity Building have been included in the Mission.The Service Level Improvement Plans (SLIPs) were prepared by the cities whereby they assessed the gaps. Theses SLIPs were consolidated by the State to State Annual Action Plans (SAAPs) to address assessed gaps. So far, against the target to provide 139 lakh water tap connections to achieve universal coverage in AMRUT cities, 107 lakh new water tap connections have been provided under AMRUT and in convergence of other Schemes.  Similarly, against the target to provide sewer connections/ septage facilities to 145 lakh households in AMRUT cities, 79 lakh households have been provided new sewer connections/ septage facilities under AMRUT and in convergence with other Schemes.Reforms and Capacity Development programmes of AMRUT have already been completed. However, implementation of projects have delayed due to various reasons such as long gestation period of large infrastructure projects, country-wide lockdown imposed due to Covid-19 pandemic and interruption of work due to natural calamities etc.  (d):	The total central outlay under AMRUT is Rs.50,000 crore, of which Rs.35,990 crore has been allocated for Central Assistance to States/ Union Territories (UTs) for AMRUT projects.  So far, funds amounting to Rs.32,534 crore have been released as Central Assistance (CA) to the States/UTs of which Rs.26,298 has been released for AMRUT projects.                                              *****
