ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (c) Requests for provision of stoppage of trains at stations are received at various levels of Railway Administration, a compendium of which is not maintained. Provision of stoppage of 12307/12308 Howrah-Jodhpur Express at Jhinjhak and Rura has been examined but found operationally not feasible as the train has stoppage at Kanpur Central. However, subject to operational feasibility and commercial justification, stoppage of trains is an ongoing process on Indian Railways. In view of the prevailing Covid-19 situation, only special trains with limited stoppages are being operated keeping in view the suggestions and concerns of State Governments and health advisories. *****
