ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) to (e):  The Code on Social Security, 2020 (the Code), for the first time has provided a definition of gig worker, which means a person who performs work or participates in work arrangement and earns from such activities, outside of the traditional employer-employee relationship.  Since all the provisions of the Code have not come into force, no data regarding number of gig workers has been collected.  The Code envisages various benefits to gig and platform workers through formulation of schemes including (i) life and disability cover; (ii) accident insurance; (iii) health and maternity benefits (iv) old-age protection; (v) crèche and other benefits as may be determined by the Central Government.  In case a gig worker is employed on regular terms and conditions on full time basis, then employer shall have to comply and provide to all benefits available to a full time employee. ******
