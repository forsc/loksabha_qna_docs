                                                        THE MINISTER OF LAW & JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a) to (c):		A Statement is laid on the Table of the House STATEMENT REFFERED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) TO (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *282 FOR ANSWER ON 17TH DECEMBER, 2021.(a) & (b): Prior to year 2016, the notary applications for appointment of central public notaries from all over the States/UTs were invited through OFFLINE mode. Since 2016 the notary applications are being invited through online mode on ‘Service Plus’ Portal monitored by NIC as well as by offline mode. Since 2019, only applications sent through online mode are accepted.		In the year 2019, with the assistance of a software (module for auto generation of Certificate of Practice in bilingual form) developed by NIC, Notary Cell had issued about 9000 auto generated certificate of practice. Vide the Notaries (Amendment) Rules, 2019, the renewal process have been made online, however due to Covid-19 Pandemic and some technical issues, the same could not be operationalized.		Now the Notary Cell in consultation with NIC is working on new web portal exclusive for Notary Cell wherein the issuance /renewal process of certificate of practice will be digitized. User friendly facilities including feature of online tracking of applications is also being explored. (c)	At present there is no proposal to introduce digital signature facilities for notary attestations.
