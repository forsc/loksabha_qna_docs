ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) and (b):  The airlines, inter alia, have to pay the following taxes on services across the country:(i)    Goods and Services Tax (GST) on both output services such as passenger tickets, air cargo, catering and other ancillary services, and input services such as navigation, landing, parking, and maintenance, repair and overhaul services.;(ii)   GST is leviable on goods procured domestically, except for Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) which is outside the ambit of GST. Airlines pay a number of taxes on ATF, which include Central Excise duty and VAT/Sales Tax, besides GST on certain fuel supply related services. Import of ATF, like other goods imports, attracts Customs duties also.(iii)   Direct taxes are payable by airlines on their profits.;;(c) and (d):  In order to mitigate the impact of multiple taxes on ATF, Ministry of Finance was requested (i) to bring ATF within the ambit of GST, and (ii) reduce the incidence of Central Excise. At the same time, State Governments were requested to reduce the VAT/Sales Tax applicable on ATF. A number of States have reduced the VAT/Sales Tax applicable at airports State-wide, while some States have reduced the rate for some designated airports.
