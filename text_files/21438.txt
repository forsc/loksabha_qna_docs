                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES & PENSIONS AND PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR.JITENDRA SINGH):    (a)	Yes, Sir. (b)	The Units 5&6 of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project (KKNPP-5&6) would be 1000 MW each. They are expected to be completed in 66 and 75 months from first pour of concrete respectively. The contractors for execution of various works in the project are chosen carefully adopting stringent pre-qualification criteria including their experience in similar complex works.(c)	The safety of each of the reactors and the site as a whole is evaluated both by Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) and the regulatory authority, Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB). The reactors are set up and operated in line with the various clearances of AERB. The operation of the six reactors at the site thus would not pose a hazard to the environment and people.(d)	Yes, Sir.  The stage-wise regulatory clearances from the safety angle are obtained from the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board. The environmental clearance for the project has been obtained from the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change following the due process including environmental impact assessment and public hearing.                                            *****
