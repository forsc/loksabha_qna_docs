The latest anticipated cost of this project is `4543 crore. An expenditure of `16.32 crore has been done and work of land acquisition has been taken up.Reconnaissance Engg-cum-Traffic Survey (RETS) for Tori-Chatra (66 km) New Line has been completed 2016-17. As per survey report the cost of project was `948.02 crore (2016-17 price level). The Project could not be taken forward as it was financially not viable in view of other infrastructure development works in the adjoining area. (d): Indian Railways does not run trains on State-wise basis, as railway network cuts across State boundaries. Further, at present major stations like Raipur, Bilaspur, Durg etc., located in state of Chhattisgarh, are well connected to Delhi area. However, at present, there is no proposal to introduce train services from stations located in Chhattisgarh to Delhi, owing to operational constraints.	*****
