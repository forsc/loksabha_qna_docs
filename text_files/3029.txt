ANSWER




MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) & (b) Presently, 4 pairs of trains connect Rayagada with Bhubaneswar. Further, 3 pairs of train services for Mumbai (including one pair via Rayagada), and 2 pairs of train services forJeypore are available from Visakhapatnam. One pair of Express train connects Jeypore with Raipur. Introduction of additional trains on these routes is not feasible, at present, due to operational and resource constraints including terminal constraints at Bhubaneswar, Visakhapatnam, Mumbai & Raipur and line capacity constraints on sections en-route. (c) & (d) At present, Bissam Cuttack and Ambodala stations are being served by 4 pairs & 11 pairs of train services respectively. Stoppage of additional Mail/Express services at these stations is presently, not operationally expedient. However, passengers of these stations may avail changeover at Titlagarh/Rayagada.  Besides, provision of stoppage of train services is an ongoing process on Indian Railways, subject to operational feasibility and commercial justification.*****
