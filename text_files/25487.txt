                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI) (a) to (d): The primary responsibility of disaster management rests with the State Governments. As per the established procedure, the State Governments concerned, in the wake of a natural disaster, provide necessary relief to affected people, including farmers, from State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) already placed at their disposal.  However, to supplement the efforts, additional financial assistance is provided from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), in case of disaster of ‘severe nature’.-2-L.S.US.Q. NO.1311 FOR 27.07.2021During the year 2020, Inter-Ministrial Central Team (IMCT) was deputed for assessment of damages in the aftermath of floods of 2020 during kharif season in the State.  Based on the report of IMCT, the High Level Committee (HLC), in its meeting held on 28.01.2021 approved an assistance of Rs. 245.96 crore including Rs. 188.23 crore for agriculture input subsidy for 2.39 lakh hectare of crop loss of 33% and above.  The amount is released to the States as per the established procedure. Further, in order to support the affected people of the State Government of Telangana, the Central Government released both the installments of Central Share of SDRF/ State Disaster Risk Management Fund (SDRMF) amounting to Rs. 449 crore to Government of Telangana for relief measures.  In addition, an amount of Rs. 977.76 crore was already available as opening balance in SDRF account of State. Financial assistance from SDRF and NDRF is towards relief and not for compensation of loss as suffered/ claimed. In addition, farmers are entitled for compensation under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (PMFBY), which is being implemented by the State Governments concerned.                                     *****
