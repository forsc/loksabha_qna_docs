                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a)	The Ministry of Women and Child Development is administering the following schemes for women empowerment:I.	Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY)II.	Mahila Shakti Kendra (MSK) SchemeIII.	One Stop CentreIV.	Women HelplineV.	Mahila Police VolunteersVI.	Swadhar GrehVII.	Working Women Hostel Scheme.The Ministry holds regular review meetings with Women and Child Development Departments of State Governments/UT Administration for effective implementation of the schemes and programmes for welfare of women and children. Regional consultations are also held to discuss issues concerning implementation of schemes. The schemes also have inbuilt monitoring mechanism to check fund utilization. The schemes are periodically reviewed for their proper and better implementation. (b) 	National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) compiles and publishes statistics on crimes in its publication “Crime in India”. The published reports are available till the year 2017. The district-wise data of the cases of trafficking of women and children are not maintained separately. However,  State/UT wise (including North-Eastern States) and gender wise number of minor victims (below 18 years)  and number of Adult victims (above 18 years) trafficked under Human Trafficking during 2015-17 are placed at Annexure I and Annexure II, respectively. (c) & (d)     ‘Police’ is a State subject under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and as such prevention of human trafficking and crime against children is the responsibility of State Governments. However, the Ministry of Home Affairs has been supplementing the efforts of the State Governments by taking various initiatives and measures. MHA has provided financial assistance to all States for setting up Anti Human Trafficking Units, and 332 Anti Human Trafficking Units  have been set up in various Districts of the States. MHA also provides financial assistance to the States and Judicial Academies in States, to hold ‘Judicial Colloquiums’ and ‘State level conference’ to sensitize police officials, judicial officers and prosecutors about various provisions of law relevant to trafficking and their role in curbing trafficking. MHA has also issued various advisories to the States and UTs from time to time on preventing and combating human trafficking. These advisories are available at MHA’s website www.mha.gov.in. Through the National Investigation Agency (Amendment) Act, 2019, the Schedule of NIA Act, 2008 has been amended and National Investigation Agency has been empowered to investigate the cases committed under Sections 370 and 370A of Indian Penal Code relating to Human Trafficking.  To address the cross border trafficking, Memoranda of Understanding on prevention of human trafficking have been signed with Bangladesh, UAE and Cambodia. Ministry of Women & Child Development is implementing Ujjawala scheme  which is a Comprehensive Scheme for Prevention of Trafficking and Rescue, Rehabilitation and Re-integration of Victims of Trafficking for Commercial Sexual Exploitation in the country.  The Target groups and beneficiaries of the scheme are women and children who are either vulnerable to or victims of trafficking. The Scheme envisages providing shelter, food, clothing and health as well as economic and social security for the beneficiaries including imparting vocational training to help beneficiaries get alternate livelihood opportunities. The Ministry of Women and Child Development is also implementing the Swadhar Greh Scheme which targets the women victims of difficult circumstances who are in need of institutional support for rehabilitation so that they could lead their life with dignity.As per Section 2(14) (ix) of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act), a child who is found vulnerable and is likely to be included into drug abuse or trafficking is included as a “child in need care and protection”. The JJ Act, 2015 mandates a security net of service delivery structures to provide Institutional and non-Institutional care to these children. The primary responsibility of execution of the Act lies with the States/UTs. The Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing a centrally sponsored Child Protection Services (erstwhile Integrated Child Protection Scheme) for supporting the children in difficult circumstances. The primary responsibility of implementation of the scheme lies with the State Governments/UT Administrations. The scheme inter-alia provides for setting up of Child Care Institutions (CCIs) by the States/UTs either by themselves or in association with voluntary organisations. The scheme, also provides for non-institutional care wherein support is extended for adoption, foster care and sponsorship. The scheme supports 24x7 outreach helpline service for children in distress. This service is available through a dedicated toll free number, 1098 which can be accessed by children in crisis or by adults on their behalf from any place in the geographical location of India. (e) & (f)    Data relating to women and children being trafficked abroad from various States of the country are not maintained by Ministry of External Affairs. Occasionally, reports indicate that some Indian women seek Overseas Employment, particularly in Gulf countries, without obtaining Emigration Clearance (EC) as per provisions of Emigration Act, 1983. Such women not only travel illegally for Overseas Employment, but become vulnerable to various employment related problems. As and when Indian Missions/Posts receive such complaints from women workers in distress, the Missions take immediate action to redress their grievances, with the foreign Employers, Labour Department/Local Government Authorities. 	In the Ministry of External Affairs, data relating to nurses going to Emigration Check Required or ECR countries is maintained as they need to take permission for such employment. In other cases data of those women workers are maintained who are holders of ECR passports and intend to work in the ECR countries. They need to obtain clearance for this from the Ministry of External Affairs. For both, E-migrate system has been set up. The State-wise data as figuring in the E-migrate system for Housemaid  and Nurse  Designations are placed at Annexure-III. District-wise Female Emigration Check data for Housemaid Designation and District – wise Female Emigration Check data for Nurse Designation are placed at Annexure –IV and Annexure-V.***** Annexure - IState/UT-wise Number of Victims Trafficked Minor (below 18 Yrs) during 2015 to 2017SNo.	State/UT	2015	2016	2017		Male	Female	Total	Male	Female	Total	Male	Female	Total 	STATES :1	Andhra Pradesh	22	52	74	0	44	44	2	24	262	Arunachal Pradesh	2	9	11	0	2	2	0	0	03	Assam	32	97	129	34	96	130	23	164	1874	Bihar	192	38	230	183	13	196	362	33	3955	Chhattisgarh	51	50	101	60	78	138	14	31	456	Goa	0	2	2	0	2	2	0	1	17	Gujarat	91	244	335	137	348	485	0	2	28	Haryana	46	17	63	5	8	13	0	9	99	Himachal Pradesh	7	0	7	2	2	4	1	2	310	Jammu & Kashmir	4	0	4	0	0	0	0	1	111	Jharkhand	71	127	198	18	72	90	17	314	33112	Karnataka	103	75	178	113	219	332	48	101	14913	Kerala	56	10	66	18	65	83	24	38	6214	Madhya Pradesh	10	45	55	62	35	97	46	75	12115	Maharashtra	94	201	295	78	94	172	44	103	14716	Manipur	3	0	3	2	7	9	5	8	1317	Meghalaya	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	3	318	Mizoram	0	0	0	0	2	2	60	0	6019	Nagaland	0	2	2	0	0	0	0	0	020	Odisha	56	87	143	98	*108	206	60	57	11721	Punjab	103	0	103	47	1	48	7	1	822	Rajasthan	1804	583	2387	1823	696	2519	849	37	88623	Sikkim	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	5	524	Tamil Nadu	68	75	143	122	195	317	21	16	3725	Telangana	139	161	300	0	7	7	12	112	12426	Tripura	4	1	5	2	4	6	6	6	1227	Uttar Pradesh	11	3	14	748	74	822	27	11	3828	Uttarakhand	1	13	14	1	2	3	6	9	1529	West Bengal	239	1553	1792	426	2687	3113	20	299	319 	TOTAL  STATE(S)	3209	3446	6655	3979	4863	8842	1654	1462	3116 	UNION TERRITORIES :30	A & N Islands	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	031	Chandigarh	22	5	27	0	1	1	0	0	032	D&N Haveli	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	033	Daman & Diu	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	034	Delhi UT	369	96	465	144	46	190	383	52	43535	Lakshadweep	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	036	Puducherry	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	2 	TOTAL UT(S)	391	102	493	144	48	192	383	54	437 	TOTAL (ALL INDIA)	3600	3548	7148	4123	4911	9034	2037	1516	3553Note : Data for the year 2015 is provisional								* 15 Transgender Victims Trafficked from Odisha is included					Source : Monthly Anti Human Trafficking Data received from AHT Units of State/UT police for the year 2015 to 2016 and Annual Anti Human Trafficking Data received from AHT Units of State/UT published in Crime in India-2017 Annexure -
