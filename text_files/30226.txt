ANSWER




                                                        (a)&(b) In line with Hon’ble Prime Minister’s announcement at COP26, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy is committed to achieving 500 GW of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030.  (c) The Government has taken several steps to  achieve renewable energy targets in the country. These include:- •	Permitting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) up to 100 percent under the automatic route, •	Waiver of Inter State Transmission System (ISTS) charges for inter-state sale of solar and wind power for projects to be commissioned by 30th June 2025, •	Laying of new transmission lines and creating new sub-station capacity for evacuation of renewable power,•	Declaration of trajectory for Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) up to the year 2022, •	Setting up of RE parks to provide land  and transmission to RE developers on a plug and play basis, •	Schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM), Solar Rooftop Phase II, 12000 MW CPSU Scheme Phase II, etc,•	Notification of standards for deployment of solar photovoltaic system/devices, •	Setting up of Project Development Cell for attracting and facilitating investments,•	Standard Bidding Guidelines for tariff based competitive bidding for procurement of Power from Grid Connected Solar PV and Wind Projects. •	Government has issued orders that power shall be dispatched against Letter of Credit (LC) or advance payment to ensure timely payment by distribution licensees to RE generators.•	Green Term Ahead Market (GTAM) launched to facilitate procurement of RE power through power exchange in the country.(d) Most of the grid connected renewable energy projects in the country are being implemented by private sector developers selected through a transparent competitive bidding.  State Governments have a vital role in implementation of such projects including in   facilitation of land availability, statutory clearances, strengthening of power evacuation infrastructure,  etc.  Further, most of the renewable energy generated is ultimately purchased by State DISCOMs.*****
