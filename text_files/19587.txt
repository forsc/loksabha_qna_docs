ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) & (b) As per information provided by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) the details of the crimes against children recorded in Bhubaneswar from 2015 to 2019 and the list of crimes is at Annexure-I. (c) & (d) As per information provided by NCRB, the details of the registered cases of sexual harassment in Shelter Homes for women and children from 2017 to 2019 is at Annexure-II.  The Government of India has enacted the Commission for Protection of Child Rights Act (CPCR), 2005, under which National and State Commissions for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) are established. These Commissions are  mandated to function for protection and promotion of child rights.Further the Government of India has implemented the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 which is a comprehensive law that provides protection to children from the offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography inter-alia. The Act categorises penetrative sexual assault or sexual assault as ''aggravated'', if committed by anyone being on the management or staff of protection home, inter alia, and prescribes severe punishment for the same. (e) & (f) As per information provided by NCRB, the latest data available with NCRB pertains to 2019. However ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and the responsibility to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens including crimes against children, rest with the respective State Government and UT Administration. *****  ANNEXURE-IStatement Referred To In Part (a)& (b) of Reply To Lok Sabha Un-Starred Question No.769 For Answer On 05.02.2021 raised by SHRIMATI APARAJITA SARANGI regarding “CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN” indicating Crime Head-wise Cases Registered in Bhubaneshwar (Odisha) under Crime against Children during 2015-19Sl	Crime Head	2015	2016	2017	2018	20191	Murder (Sec.302 IPC)	0	0	0	0	02	Infanticide (Sec.315 IPC)	0	0	0	0	03	Foeticide (Sec. 315 & 316 IPC)	0	0	0	0	04	Exposure and Abandonment (Sec.317 IPC)	0	0	0	0	05	Simple Hurt (Sec.323 r/w IPC,324,332,353,327,328,330 IPC)	-	-	0	0	06	Grievous Hurt (Sec.325, 32,326A, 326B,329,331, 333, 335 IPC)	0	0	0	0	07	Kidnapping and Abduction of Children	0	0	0	279	2968	Human Trafficking (Secs. 370 & 370A IPC) (Children only)	0	0	0	0	09	Selling of Minors for Prostitution (Sec. 372 IPC)	0	0	0	0	010	Buying of Minors for Prostitution  (Sec. 373 IPC)	0	0	0	0	011	Rape (Sec. 376 IPC)	59	-	82	0	012	Attempt to Commit Rape (Sec. 376 r/w 511 IPC)	-	-	0	0	013	Assault on Women with Intent to Outrage her Modesty (Sec. 354 IPC)	0	0	0	0	014	Insult to the Modesty of Women (Sec. 509 IPC)	0	0	0	0	015	Other IPC Crimes	0	0	0	0	016	Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) r/w Sec.376,354, 509 IPC)	0	54	0	93	10316.1	Section 4 & 6 of POCSO Act or POCSO Act  (Section 4 & 6) r/w Section 376 IPC	0	49	0	81	7916.2	Section 8 & 10 of POCSO Act or POCSO Act (Section 8 & 10)  r/w Section 354 IPC	0	0	0	0	016.3	Section 12 of POCSO Act or POCSO Act (Section 12) r/w Section 509 IPC	0	0	0	0	016.4	Section 14 & 15 of POCSO Act	0	0	0	12	2416.5	POCSO Act  r/w Section 377 IPC	0	0	0	0	016.6	Sections 17 to 22 of POCSO Act	0	5	0	0	017	Juveniles Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act	0	7	8	3	318	Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956	0	0	0	0	019	Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act	0	0	0	0	020	Prohibition of Child Marriage Act	0	0	0	0	221	Transplantation of Human Organs Act	0	0	0	0	022	Cyber Crimes/Information Technology Act	-	-	0	0	023	Other SLL crimes	0	0	0	0	024	Total Crimes against Children (IPC+SLL)	59	61	90	375	404Source: Crime in India	Note: ''-'' Refers to data not collected during the year.
