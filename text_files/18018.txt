                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) and (b):		A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) AND (b) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1750 BY SHRI VINAYAK RAUT TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 21.09.2020 REGARDING SPEEDING UP PROJECTS IN MAHARASHTRA(a):	Railway Projects are sanctioned Zonal Railway-wise; not State-wise / Region-wise as Railway Network spans across various State boundaries.  However, presently, 39 projects, costing `86,696 crore for 6,722 km length, falling fully/partly in the State of Maharashtra, are in different stages of Planning/sanction/execution, out of which, commissioning of 1,026 km length has been achieved and an expenditure of `17,841 crore has been incurred upto March, 2020.During 2009-14, 292 km length of projects falling fully / partly in the State of Maharashtra, have been commissioned which increased to 596 km during 2014-19, which is 104% more than commissioning during 2009-14.Details of all ongoing projects including cost, expenditure and outlay are made available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in >Ministry of Railways >Railway Board >About Indian Railways >Railway Board Directorates >Finance (Budget) > Pink Book (Year)> Railway wise Works, Machinery and Rolling Stock Programme (RSP).Average annual Budget allocation on infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/partly in the State of Maharashtra, during 2014-19 has increased to `4,801 crore per year from `1,171 crore per year (during 2009-14), which is 310% more as compared to average annual allocation of 2009-14.  The Budget outlay during 2019-20 has further increased to `7,281 crore, which is 522% more with respect to 2009-14.Around `613 crore is the outstanding amount towards State Government of Maharashtra for cost sharing projects.  Non-deposition of amount by State Government is adversely affecting the progress of projects.(b):	To ensure that project is completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, Divisional level, Zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues obstructing the progress of projects. Besides, to ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts, which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects. For important capacity enhancement projects, institutional financing has been arranged which has increased Railways’ capacity for committed fund provision for capacity enhancement projects.*****
