                        be pleased to state:-















                                                    (a) whether the Government proposes to start a DMU (daily) train from Falna to Palanpur as the labourers of this area are  affected with silicosis disease and there is scarcity of basic infrastructure facilities like education, transport, communication to these tribes due to their remote inhabilitation; and(b) if so, the details thereof?






ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) & (b) No, Sir.  Owing to operational constraints including terminal constraints at Falna, introduction of DMU train between Falna and Palanpur is not feasible, at present. However, Falna and Palanpur are presently very well connected to each other by 39 pairs of Mail/Express and 02 pairs of Passenger trains.*****
