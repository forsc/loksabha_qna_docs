                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		 	  (SHRI NARENDRA  SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (c):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 339   DUE FOR REPLY ON 17TH  MARCH, 2020.(a) & (b):    Yes Sir.   Crop residue is traditionally utilized as animal feed as such or by supplementing with some addictives in most parts of the country. It has been estimated that one ton of paddy stubble burning leads to a loss of 5.5 kilogram nitrogen, 2.3 Kg phosphorus, 25 Kg potassium and more than 1 Kg of Sulphur, 50-70% of micro-nutrients absorbed by rice and 400 Kg of Carbon. The heat from burning paddy straw kills the bacterial and fungal population critical for a fertile soil and also causes damage to the soil organic quality. To reduce the crop burning and potential benefits to farmers, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare has introduced the scheme of In-situ management of Crop residue in the state of Punjab, Haryana, UP and NCT of Delhi. The funds to the tune of Rs. 584.33 Crores and Rs. 594.14 Crores have been released during 2018-19 & 2019-20 respectively under this scheme to State Government of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi & Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), to provide subsidy of @ 50% to individual farmers and 80% for Custom Hiring Centres. Total 100610 Crop Residue Machines were provided to the Individual farmers and 168226 under Custom Hiring Centers. Total 378 balers with 40% subsidy were also provided to the farmers and farmer groups under Submission on Agriculture Mechanization for collection of straw in form of bales. The Governments are promoting the ex-situ management of crop residue by way of utilizing it in biomass based power plants, production of bioethanol and Bio-CNG etc. The on- field burning of Crop Residue results in loss of critical bacterial and fungal population essential for maintaining for soil fertility. As a result of In-situ Management of Crop Residue Management Scheme, in the year 2019 the number of crop burning events in the States concerned have been reduced by 18.8% and 31.0% as compared to the years 2018 & 2017 respectively. Contd…2/--2-(c):	The Department under the National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) is providing 100% assistance to the State Governments/Government Agencies for setting up of state of the art liquid/carrier based bio-fertilizer units and mechanized Fruit/Vegetable market waste/agro waste compost production unit. Similarly, for individuals/private agencies assistance as capital investment is provided through National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD).*****
