                                                        MINISTER OF CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS(D.V. SADANANDA GOWDA) (a): 	Sir, the following steps are being taken by the Government to ensure adequate supply of fertilizers across the country: Before the commencement of each cropping season, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), in consultation with all the State Governments, assesses the requirement of fertilizers. After assessment of requirement, DAC&FW projects month-wise requirement of fertilizers. On the basis of month-wise & state-wise projection given by DAC&FW, Department of Fertilizers allocates sufficient/ adequate quantities of fertilizers to States by issuing monthly supply plan and continuously monitors the availability through following system: i.	The movement of all major subsidized fertilizers is being monitored throughout the country by an on-line web based monitoring system called integrated Fertilizer Monitoring System (iFMS);ii.	The State Governments are regularly advised to coordinate with manufacturers and importers of fertilizers for streamlining the supplies through timely placement of indents for railway rakes through their state institutional agencies like Markfed etc.iii.	Regular Weekly Video Conference is conducted jointly by Department of Agriculture & Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), Department of Fertilizers (DoF), and Ministry of Railways with State Agriculture Officials and corrective actions are taken to dispatch fertilizer as indicated by the State Governments. iv.	The gap between demand (requirement) and production is met through imports. The import for the season is also finalised well in advance to ensure timely availability. Thus, Department of Fertilizers ensures adequate availability of fertilizers to the farmers. However, distribution within the State is the responsibility of the concerned State Government. (b) & (c):   The availability of fertilizers is monitored at the State level through data captured in the integrated Fertilizer Monitoring System (iFMS). As per the system, there is no shortage of any fertilizer in the country. The fertilizer requirement, availability and sales position for Kharif 2019 as on 21.06.2019 as per iFMS data is as follows:                                                                               <Figures in LMT>	                           Projected Requirement	Availability	SalesUrea	                                 59.47	                   61.82	49.28P&K (DAP, MOP & complex)	         46.91	                   71.80	30.06	It can be seen from the table above that the availability of fertilizers has been more than the sales. ********
