ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR) (a) to (d) The World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing (EUL) assists interested UN procurement agencies and Member States/Countries in determining the acceptability of using specific vaccines, based on an essential set of available quality, safety, efficacy and performance data. The aim is to expedite the availability of these products to people affected by a public health emergency and allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 vaccines. Persons immunized with such vaccines which are listed under the WHO- EUL are deemed to be protected by authorities of many countries and allowed to travel internationally. However, not all countries require COVID-19 vaccination for travel. India also does not at present require Covid-19 vaccination for travel. Among the countries which do have such requirements, as on 6th December 2021, a total of 108 countries recognize Indian vaccination certificate for travel purpose.*****
