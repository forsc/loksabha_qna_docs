ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) : 		The power generation capacity of NTPC’s Thermal Power Station Solapur, Maharashtra is 1320 Mega Watt (MW).(b) & (c):  	NTPC Solapur is providing fly ash / pond ash to all Ash users who participated and were successful in auction done through a transparent bidding process by M/s Metal Scrap Trade Corporation Limited (MSTCL).The details of Fly ash being issued to cement industry from NTPC, Solapur are:1.	From 08.11.2017 to 13.11.2018 at Rs. 320 per Metric Tonne (MT) through auction done by M/s MSTC Ltd.2.  From 14.11.2018 to till date at Rs. 440 per MT through auction done by M/s MSTC Ltd.(d) to (f) :	Ministry of Power has not received any proposal from wheat traders for providing pond ash share free of cost by the thermal power station.Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC) regulates Utilisation of fly ash by Thermal Power Plants (TPPs). As per the latest MoEF&CC Notification dated 31.12.2021, there is no provision for any specific dispensation for wheat trader/producers.  Setting up of a power plant is a de-licensed activity and TPPs take their own techno commercial decisions for operating their Plants in a viable manner and making their cost of electricity competitive. The demand for fly ash has been increasing. In order to bring in transparency and to restrict malpractices in the allocation of fly ash, Ministry of Power (MoP) vide letter dated 22.09.2021 has advised TPPs to consider the sale of fly ash through a transparent bidding process, so as to reduce the tariff of electricity for consumers.(g) & (h) :		NTPC Solapur conducted an auction, as per MoP advisory dated 22.09.2021, of pond Ash on 27.10.2021 through M/s MSTC Limited for all Ash users.  Therefore, there is no need to stop this tender.************
