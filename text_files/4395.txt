ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND PENSIONS AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a) & (b):   As on 10.07.2019, total number of pending second appeals/complaints in the Central Information Commission for more than one year is 9075. No such data is maintained centrally in respect of other Governments/Departments.(c):  (i)  For speedy disposal of pending cases the Government has taken several steps like capacity building through training of Central Public Information Officers (CPIOs)/ Public Information Officers (PIOs) and issue of guidelines for PIOs and First Appellate Authorities (FAAs), so as to enable them to supply information/dispose of first appeal effectively, resulting into less number of ‘First Appeals’ and ‘Appeals’ to the Information Commission. Online applications can be made to offices under Central Government. Currently, systems of 2242 Public Authorities have been aligned to receive, process and reply to Online RTIs from the applicants.(ii)	DoPT provides funds to various State Governments for establishing helpline in order to facilitate obtaining of the information by the RTI applicants.(iii)	Funds are provided each year to various state Administrative Training Institutes (ATIs) by the Government to help generate awareness about RTI among the citizens of the country through measures like Distance learning programmes and Online certificate course in regional languages, publishing of handbooks on RTI and distribution of the same among the public. State Information Commissions (SICs) are also provided funds for celebration of RTI week.*****
