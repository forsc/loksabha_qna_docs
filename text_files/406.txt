ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is implementing a flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) 2016-20. PMKVY 2016-20 does not mandate the establishment of skill development centres, however, it enables large number of prospective youth for taking up Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) through accredited and affiliated training centers (TCs) throughout the country including NCT of Delhi. Under the scheme, for imparting the skill training, the accreditation and affiliation of TCs are being done under single window IT application known as SMART (Skill Management and Accreditation of Training Centres). As on 12.06.2019, 1,99,831 candidates have been trained under 344 empanelled TCs in NCT of Delhi covering all the districts.  Additionally, Ministry also promotes establishment of model and aspirational skill centres known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) in every district for imparting skill training through PMKVY 2016-20. As on date, 11 PMKKs have been allocated in NCT of Delhi. Out of allocated PMKKs, 6 PMKKs have been already established.(b) and (c)	Ministry has undertaken various measures to encourage greater participation of industry in skilling ecosystem. Government have developed and designed dynamic and demand driven curriculum & standards through industry led – Sector Skill Councils. These curriculum are aligned with latest National Occupational Standards (NOSs)/ Qualification Packs (QPs).On the other hand, industries are encouraged to participate as training partners to run the high employment potential courses through appropriate accreditation and affiliation framework.Further, under the PMKVY 2016-20 scheme, there is provision for imparting industry linked skill development training for ensuring the placement of the candidates. The last 20% payment to training partners/training centre would be made only after wage employment or self employment to at least 70% of the trained candidates. TCs are required to have dedicated mentorship-cum-placement cells for industry linkage and placement of candidates. TPs are mandated to organize Placement/Rozgar Melas every six months with support from the SSCs and to ensure the participation of local industry. Under PMKVY 2016-20, as on 12.06.2019, 51,622 candidates have been placed in various sectors in NCT of Delhi.*
