                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (d):	Since ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects as per the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, it is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments/UT Administration to modernize their police forces, enhance gender sensitization and fitness of police personnel. However, the Central Government supplements the efforts of the  State  Governments  towards  equipping  and  modernizing their police forces, including establishment of associated technological infrastructure and training equipment to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of police forces, by providing financial assistance under the scheme of ‘Assistance to States for Modernisation of Police (ASMP)’. The Central Government also issues advisories from time to time to the State Governments for increasing number of women in the police forces up to 33%, to strengthen welfare measures for women police personnel and to ensure their safety and a conducive work environment such as provision of housing, medical and rest room facilities for women police personnel in Police Stations to attract women to join the Police Forces. *******
