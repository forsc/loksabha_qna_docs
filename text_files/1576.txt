ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (c): The Government, including at Prime Minister level, has been strongly taking up the issue of high crude oil price, bilaterally with crude oil producing countries as well as with the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas expressed concerns over crude oil price volatility to the OPEC Secretary General and conveyed that India will continue working with OPEC member countries on responsible oil pricing, which is beneficial to both consumers and producers.The crude oil price fluctuation is a frequent market phenomenon, and crude oil production and price depends on several factors, including demand and supply, geo-political situation and policies of crude oil producing countries. Indian refineries import crude oil from diverse sources depending on their technical and commercial considerations and keeping in view the domestic requirement. Government has also taken steps to enhance domestic oil and gas production and to reduce reliance on imports.*****
