ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI PANKAJ CHAUDHARY)(a)		Yes Sir.Financial Year	Total Number of ITRs Filed(Including Revised Returns)2018-19	6,74,22,6612019-20	6,78,97,4502020-21	7,38,94,135(b) 	(c) 	The Government has taken the following steps to simplify the procedure for filing 		Income Tax Returns :i.	Pre-filling of various schedules of the Income Tax Returns (ITRs) which will reduce the time and effort required to fill the ITRs on the part of the taxpayers.ii.	Actively promoting e-Verification of ITRs and establishing complete (100%) paperless environment.iii.	Providing online access to taxpayers of their Tax Deducted at Source(TDS), tax payments, specified financial transactions and other information by bringing about amendments in Form 26AS thereby helping them file their ITRs easily. iv.	Reducing processing time of returns on year-on-year basis.v.	Educating and empowering the tax payers by pro-actively engaging with tax payers through digital media and enhancing transparency.(d) (i)	The Government has increased the total income limit for availing rebate 		under section 87A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 from Rs.3,50,000/- to 		Rs.5,00,000/- with effect from Assessment Year 2020-21. Taxpayers can avail the 		rebate under 87A of the Act without paying taxes on income of upto Rs.5,00,000/- 		provided they file their ITRs. (ii)  	Further, on consideration of difficulties being faced by the taxpayers in filing of ITRs 		within the prescribed statutory time-limits under the Act, the time limits have been 		extended from time to time during the last three years. This has enabled taxpayers to 		file their original returns without payment of late fee and file belated returns or revised 		returns which was otherwise not permissible after expiry of statutory time limits.*******
