ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a)&(b):  Sir, the National Register of Citizens (NRC) is being updated at present in the State of Assam as per the provisions of the Citizenship Act, 1955 and the provisions contained in the Schedule framed under Rule 4A (4) of Citizenship Rules, 2003. NRC, Assam was prepared in 1951 as a non-statutory process by recording particulars of all persons enumerated                            during Census 1951. The exercise to update NRC 1951 is being conducted under the special provisions in respect of State of Assam.-2/...-2-LS.US.Q.NO.539 FOR 25.06.2019(c)&(d):  Detection and deportation of illegal immigrants is a continuous process. Central Government is vested with powers under Section 3(2)(c) of the Foreigners Act, 1946 to deport foreign nationals staying illegally in the country. These powers to identify/detect, detain and deport illegally staying foreign nationals have been entrusted under Article 239(1) and 258(1) of the Constitution of India to the UTs/State Governments respectively. These powers also stand delegated to the officials of Bureau of Immigration.	Since illegal migrants enter India in a clandestine and surreptitious manner and without valid travel documents, accurate data regarding such migrants is not available.	 (e): 	Instructions have been issued to the State Governments from time to time for taking appropriate and prompt steps for identification of illegal migrants, their restriction to specified locations as per provisions of law, capturing their biographic and biometric particulars, cancellation of fake Indian documents obtained by them and initiation of legal proceeding including deportation proceedings as per provisions of law. Border Security Force is taking all necessary measures to prevent illegal infiltration at the international borders including deployment of additional manpower, use of special surveillance equipment, erection of border fencing & floodlights, construction of border roads & border outposts, intelligence sharing, conducting special operations along the border etc.*****
