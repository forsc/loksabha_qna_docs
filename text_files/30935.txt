All the schemes are targeted for benefiting farmers and increasing their livelihood opportunities by promoting agro based employment. Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare is implementing a scheme “Establishment of Agri-Clinics and Agri-Business Centers (AC & ABC)” under ‘Sub Mission on Agriculture Extension’ to provide gainful self-employment opportunities to unemployed youth who possess qualification in agriculture and allied science.Further, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare is implementing a project namely, Attracting and Retaining Youth in Agriculture (ARYA) through Krishi Vigyan Kendras in 100 districts of the country since 2015-16. The objective of this project is to empower the youth in rural areas to set-up enterprises in agriculture and allied areas for gainful employment and sustainable income generation.Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) is a demand driven wage employment programme which provides for the enhancement of livelihood security of the households in rural areas of the country by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. Recently, Government has launched All-India Quarterly Establishment Based Employment Survey (AQEES) in April, 2021. As per the result of the first round of Quarterly Employment Survey for the period April to June 2021, employment increased to 3.08 crore in the nine selected sectors of the economy against a total of 2.37 crores in these sectors taken collectively, as reported in the sixth Economic Census (2013-14) reflecting a growth rate of 29%. The most impressive growth of 152 percent has been recorded in the IT/BPO sector, while growth rates in Health is 77 percent, in Education it is 39 percent, in Manufacturing it is 22 percent, in Transport it is 68 percent and in Construction it is 42 percent.To enhance the income of labourers for their empowerment, Government has taken various steps like encouraging private sector of economy, fast-tracking various projects involving substantial investment and increasing public expenditure on schemes like Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalyal Yojana  (DDU-GKY) and Deendyal Antodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM), Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), etc.Further, Government has launched Prime Minister Street Vendor’s Atma Nirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) Scheme in June, 2020 to provide working capital loans to Street Vendors, vending in urban areas, to resume their businesses, which were impacted adversely due to COVID-19.*****
