ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b) : The Hon''ble High Court of Madras vide its order dated 24.10.2019 inWA No. 2931 of 2019 directed CB - CID and the Forensic Department ofGovernment of Tamil Nadu to verify the thumb impressions of the studentsadmitted to various medical colleges in Tamil Nadu.(c) : Vide Order dated 04.11.2019 in the W.A. No. 2931 of 2019, the Hon’bleMadras High Court has directed the Central Government and the MedicalCouncil of India “to verify whether they have received any complaint or whetherany malpractice has been done for getting medical seats in other States”.Further, vide same order, the CBI has been directed by the Hon’ble Madras HighCourt “to verify as to whether CBI has got any complaint with regard toimpersonation or other malpractices in the NEET Examination to get admissionin the Medical Colleges in other States”.(d) : National Testing Agency (NTA) is the designated authority for conductingNEET (UG). NTA informed that for conducting the exam, invigilators, centresuperintendent and the deputy superintendent, observer and NTArepresentatives are deployed at each centre. For monitoring of the exam, citycoordinators and State Coordinators are also deployed and detailed instructionsare issued to these examination personnel for conducting NEET (UG)examination in foolproof manner.(e) to (g): As per Graduate Medical Education Regulations, 1999 of MedicalCouncil of India, in order to appear in the NEET, a candidate has to obtainminimum 50% of marks in the qualifying examination (40% for SC/ST/OBCcandidates 45% in respect of candidates with benchmark disabilities). To beeligible for admission to MBBS course, a candidate has to obtain minimummarks at 50th percentile in the NEET. However, in respect of candidatesbelonging to SC/ST/OBC, the minimum qualifying marks are at 40th percentileand in respect of candidates with benchmark disabilities, the minimum marksare 45th percentile for General Category and 40th percentile for SC/ST/OBC. Thesyllabus of the NEET has been framed after reviewing of various State syllabi aswell as those prepared by CBSE, NCERT and COBSE to establish uniformityacross the country keeping in view the relevance of different areas in medicaleducation. The NEET evaluates minimum knowledge of a candidate in therelevant subjects expected at higher secondary stage.In the interest of students, including the most disadvantaged, Ministry ofHuman Resource Development has launched Study Webs of Active Learning forYoung Aspiring Minds (SWAYAM), which offers interactive course content suchas video lectures, reading material, self-assessment through tests and quizzesand online discussion forum for clearing doubts for students from Class 9 topost-graduation. The content can be accessed free of cost by anyone, anywhereat any time. Another initiative of the Government called Indian Institute ofTechnology - Professor Assisted Learning (IIT-PAL) provides video content inBiology, Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics prepared by IIT Professors andKendirya Vidyalaya (KV) teachers for Class XI and Class XII students aspiring tojoin Higher Educational Institutions. The content is available free of cost ondedicated DTH channels of SWAYAM PRABHA.*****
