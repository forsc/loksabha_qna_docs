ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) Yes, Sir. After the closure of Jet Airways, monitoring of airfare was started by DGCA on certain routes, selected on random basis. As per the prevailing regulations, air fares are neither established nor regulated by the Government. All scheduled domestic airlines are required to display route-wise and category-wise fares on their respective websites in compliance to the regulations.;(b) Due to suspension of operation of Jet Airways there was a reduction in capacity in the domestic sectors. Meetings were held to sensitize the airlines in this regard. Monitoring of airfare was started by DGCA on certain routes, selected on random basis to ensure that the airlines do not charge airfares outside the range declared by them. During monitoring, it was observed that airfares remained within the fare bracket established. However, a marginal hike in airfare was noticed. Subsequently, due to induction of more aircraft by the domestic airlines and resultant capacity increase in the domestic sectors, fares have been observed as normalized.
