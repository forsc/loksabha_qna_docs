ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) to (c)    Under the National Perspective Plan (NPP), the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component & 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) of eight links have been completed. Details and current status of the proposals for inter-State linking of rivers under the Inter Linking of Rivers (ILR) Programme is furnished at Annexure.There is a structured mechanism of Government of India for preparing work plan, fixing the targets, consultation with all stakeholders, review of the progress etc. for ILR programme. Government of India has accorded priority to the ILR programme. Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) of link projects, after completion, are sent to the concerned States and efforts made for building consensus amongst them for water sharing etc. A “Special Committee on Interlinking of Rivers” has been constituted in September, 2014 for the implementation of ILR programme. Nineteen meetings of the Special Committee have been held so far. Further, a Task Force for Interlinking of Rivers has been constituted by MoWR, RD & GR (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in April, 2015 for expediting the works under ILR programme and fifteen meetings of the Task Force have been held so far.  Ken-Betwa Link project is the first ILR project under NPP, that is under implementation after a tripartite agreement was signed among the States of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Madhya Pradesh (MP) and the Central Government for implementation of Ken-Betwa Link Project (KBLP) on 22.03.2021. Subsequently, Government of India approved implementation of KBLP at an estimated cost of Rs. 44,605 crore (at year 2020-21 price level), including a central support of Rs. 39,317 crore [90 (Centre):10(State)].  The project inter alia envisages providing annual irrigation to an area of 10.62 lakh ha (8.11 lakh ha in MP and 2.51 lakh ha in UP).  It will provide 194 Million Cubic Metre (MCM) of water for enroute drinking water supply to a population of 62 lakh (41 lakh in MP and 21 lakh in UP) and will have installed power generation capacity of 103 megawatt (MW). Estimated cost for all ILR projects, i.e., 30 identified links, is Rs. 8.44 lakh crore. However, the issue related to actual expenditure arises at the time of implementation of the link projects.  **** ANNEXURE ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) TO (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3567 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 24.03.2022 REGARDING “INTER-LINKING OF RIVERS”.
