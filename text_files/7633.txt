ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (c): The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one Jawahar NavodayaVidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country. Opening of new JNVs is a continuous processwhich depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government/UT administration to makeavailable requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of the permanent building andmaking available required temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till thepermanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV dependson the availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority. All the districts of UttarPradesh as on 31.05.2014, including Hardoi District under which Sandila Tehsil falls, havealready been covered under Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme.*****
