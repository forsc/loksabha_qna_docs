                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) & (b): At present there is no such Committee. However, Government has approved three surveys viz. (i) All-India Quarterly Establishment Based Employment Survey (AQEES); (ii) All India Survey on Migrant Workers;  and (iii) All India Survey on Domestic Workers.The information gathered through these surveys would enable the government to understand significant issues and help to frame evidence –based National Employment Policy.(c) & (d): Government of India has launched All-India Quarterly Establishment Based Employment Survey (AQEES) in April, 2021 which has two components viz. Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) and Area Frame Establishment Survey (AFES). As per the result of the first round of Quarterly Employment Survey  for the period April to June 2021, employment increased to 3.8 crore in the nine selected sectors of the economy against a total of 2.37 crores in these sectors taken collectively, as reported in the sixth Economic Census (2013-14).(e): Government has taken various steps for generating employment in the country (including Maharashtra and Andaman & Nicobar Islands) like encouraging various projects involving substantial investment and increasing public expenditure on schemes like Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen KaushalyaYojana (DDU-GKY) and Deendayal AntodayaYojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM). Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rojgar Yojana (ABRY) was launched with effect from 1st October, 2020 as part of Atmanirbhar Bharat package 3.0 to incentivize  employers for creation of new employment along with social security benefits and restoration of loss of employment during Covid-19 pandemic. This scheme being implemented through Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), seeks to reduce the financial burden of the employers and encourages them to hire more workers. The terminal date for registration of beneficiaries has been extended from  30.06.2021 till 31.03.2022.Besides these initiatives, the flagship programmes of Government such as Make in India, Digital India, Smart City Mission, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, Housing for All, Infrastructure development and Industrial corridors and  Production-Linked Incentive(PLI) Scheme are also oriented to generate productive employment opportunities.*****
