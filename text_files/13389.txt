ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a)	to (c) Presently, Amravati-Pune sector, on end-to-end basis, is being served by two pairs of services viz. 11405/11406 Amravati-Pune Express (Bi-weekly) running with both air-conditioned and non air-conditioned accommodation and  22117/22118 Pune-Amravati AC Express (Weekly)  is running as a fully air-conditioned service. Attachment of non air - conditioned class coaches in 22117/22118 Pune-Amravati AC Express is not feasible, at present, as the train is already running with maximum permissible load and is running on integrated link with 22125/22126 Nagpur-Amritsar AC Express and 22123/22124 Pune-Ajni AC Express.  However, augmentation/de-augmentation of coaches is an ongoing process on Indian Railways, subject to operational feasibility and commercial justification. *****
