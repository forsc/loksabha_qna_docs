                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE                           (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)AND CORPORATE AFFAIRS   					????? ??? ????????? ????? ???????? ??? ????? ??????                               (???? ?????? ???? ?????)(a) to (g):- The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) under the Department of Economic Affairs (Ministry of Finance) had constituted on June 12, 2018 an Expert Committee to study the issue of listing of equity shares of companies incorporated in India on foreign stock exchanges and of companies incorporated outside India on Indian stock exchanges. The committee has, inter-alia, recommended that listing of equity shares of companies incorporated in India on foreign stock exchanges may be allowed on specified stock exchanges in Permissible Jurisdictions subject to certain terms and conditions.  The Ministry of Finance, (Department of Economic Affairs), Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Securities and Exchange Board of India and Reserve Bank of India etc. are involved to examine and implement framework to carry out necessary amendments for enabling such listing.  The listing of Indian companies in foreign stock exchanges is likely to increase the competitiveness of Indian companies in terms of access to capital, broader investor base and better valuations thus benefiting the health of the Indian economy. As per the Expert Committee report the following additional advantages to the Indian economy are expected to be:-(i) Boost to the “Brand India” globally;(ii) Increased attractiveness for the growing Indian technology sector;(iii) Competitive pressures to stimulate efficiency and growth;(iv) Development of finance services as a high-value added export;(v) Improved economic relations with other countries etc.Further, the Department of Economic Affairs vide its letter dated 25.02.2020 has informed that they have received communication from only one entity i.e. Softbank group on the proposal of direct listing.  Similarly this Ministry has received communication from the Indian Venture Capital Association.************
