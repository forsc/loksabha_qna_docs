The Central Government is supporting sportspersons through National Sports Federations (NSFs) for their training, foreign exposures and competitions to enable them to participate in international sports events, and enhance their chances of winning medals. Further, customized training of elite athletes is supported under Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS). Further, the Khelo India Programme has been launched with the twin objectives of mass participation and promotion of excellence in sports. Talent identification and grooming of the identified talent is being supported SAI promotional schemes, viz. 23 National Centres of Excellence (NCOE), 67 SAI Training Centre (STC), 29 Extension Centre of STC and 69 Schools, Indigenous Games & Martial Arts Centres and Akharas adopted under National Sports Talent Contest (NSTC).(b) & (c)	Yes, Sir.

(d)	Augmentation of sports infrastructure is an ongoing exercise. Under Khelo India Scheme, projects for creation, development and upgradation of sports infrastructure in the States and Union Territories are being supported. So far, 267 projects have been sanctioned under Khelo India Schemes in different States / UTs of the country including 8 in Delhi. (e) & (f)	Sports, being State subject, primary responsibility for promotion and development of sports, including increased participation of youth in sports and provide requisite sports facilities. However, the Central Government supplements the efforts of State Governments. To support the efforts of State Governments, this Ministry through SAI is implementing various Sports Promotion Schemes across the country to identify talented sportspersons in various age groups and nurture them to excel at national and international levels.
