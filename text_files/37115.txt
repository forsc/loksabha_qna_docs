(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)    (a) to (d): 	No report has been received from any part of the country regarding indiscriminate use of antibiotics in food crops leading to the development and spread of Anti Microbial Resistance (AMR) among crops. However, the matter of use of antibiotics was considered by Registration Committee suo moto and a Sub-Committee was constituted under the Chairmanship of Dr. S.C. Dubey, Assistant Director General (Plant Protection & Biological Science), ICAR to examine the matter on production, sale and use of Streptomycin + Tetracycline. The Sub-Committee has submitted its report before the Registration Committee. The Registration Committee considered the report in its 430th meeting held on 23.07.2021 and approved the recommendation of Sub-Committee to phase out the use of Streptomycin + tetracycline as per the availability of alternatives. Large-scale validations at field level have also been suggested for available alternatives. In view of this, DARE/ICAR has sent a communication to the crop specific ICAR-Institutes to conduct appropriate research to find out safer and better alternatives.The Government of India has published the Gazette notification; S.O. 5295 (E) dated 17.12.2021 (Annexure-I) for prohibition of Streptomycin + Tetracycline in agriculture. Comments/suggestions on the draft notification have been received and the same have been considered by the Registration Committee in its 437th meeting held on 16.03.2022 wherein it decided to seek further suggestion/ comments from ICMR.
