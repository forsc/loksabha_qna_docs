(a)	whether India gave a befitting reply to the provoking speech of the Prime Minister of Pakistan in the United Nations in September 2019;(b) 	if so, the details thereof; (c)	whether Pakistan has become isolated in the world for spreading fake propaganda and fabricated falsehood against the country at international level and India has gained honour and respect in the world; and(d) 	if so, the details thereof?






ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (d)	India has categorically and unequivocally rejected Pakistan’s blatant misrepresentation of facts and fabricated narratives at international fora, including at the United Nations. The Indian delegation, in its Right of Reply delivered at the UN General Assembly on 27 September 2019, called out the hate speech made by the Prime Minister of Pakistan which justified terrorism and held out nuclear threats. Government has briefed members of the international community on Pakistan’s false propaganda, and its continued aid and abetment to cross-border terrorism against India, including in the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir.As a result of Government’s efforts, Pakistan’s attempts to interfere in internal affairs of India; to present an alarmist situation of the region; and its abuse of international fora including United Nations have been successfully and effectively thwarted. Countries have shown understanding that matters related to Jammu and Kashmir, which is an integral part of India, are internal to India. Countries have also called on Pakistan to not allow its territory to be used for terrorism in any manner. They have also acknowledged that issues, if any, between India and Pakistan should be addressed bilaterally and peacefully.***
