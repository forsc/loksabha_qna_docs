ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????   (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c) : The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) is being implemented from Kharif 2016 in the country and claims are worked out and settled by insurance companies as per provisions of the scheme.    State-wise details of premium paid by farmers, total premium, claims reported, claims paid and claims pending since inception of the scheme in 2016-17 till 2020-21 for the crops notified by the States under PMFBY are given in Annexure.	Claims are worked out insurance unit area wise for the notified crops.  Parliamentary Constituency-wise details are not maintained. (d) & (e) : The admissible claims under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) are generally paid by the concerned insurance companies within two months of completion of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs)/harvesting period and one month of notification for invoking the risks/perils of prevented sowing, mid-season adversity and post harvest losses subject to receipt of total share of premium subsidy from concerned Government within time.  However, settlement of few claims in some States got delayed due to reasons like delayed transmission of yield data; late release of their share in premium subsidy, yield related disputes between insurance companies and States, non-receipt of account details of some farmers for transfer of claims to the bank account of eligible farmers and National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) related issues, erroneous/incomplete entry of individual farmers data on National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP), delay in remittance of farmers share of premium/non-remittance of farmers share of premium to concerned insurance company etc.   	Further, insurance companies have to pay penal interest @12% per annum to the farmers for the period beyond the stipulated period in the PMFBY Guidelines from the date of receipt of final yield data from the State Government and completion of crop damage survey.   Stratified Grievance Redressal System starting from block level to district level and State level has been included in the Operational Guidelines of PMFBY.  Accordingly, most of the PMFBY implementing States have notified the constitution of Block level/District level and State level Grievance Redressal Committees under the Scheme to dispose off the grievance as per given time frame.	This Department is also regularly reviewing the schemes in consultation with State Governments and other stakeholders to streamline the process for early settlement of claims and to provide timely and adequate benefits to the eligible farmers under the scheme.
