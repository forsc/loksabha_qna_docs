ANSWER




                                                        (a)to(b): Yes, Sir. Scheme for Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHCs), a sub-scheme under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana–Urban (MAY-U),for providing accommodation at affordable rent to urban migrants/ poor has been launched on 31.07.2020 by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). This scheme has been designed in line with the vision of “Aatma Nirbhar Bharat”.The objective of this scheme is to provide dignified living with necessary civic amenities to urban migrants/poor near their workplace at affordable rent. It also aims to create a conducive environment by incentivizing Public/ Private Entities to leverage investment for creating affordable rental housing stock, if they have available vacant land.This Scheme will be implemented through following two Models:Model-1: Utilising existing Government funded vacant houses in cities by converting them into ARHCs under Public Private Partnership mode or by public agencies. Model-2: Incentivising Private/Public Entities to Construct, Operate and Maintain ARHCs on their own vacant land. 	The beneficiaries for ARHCs will be urban migrants/poor from Economically Weaker Section (EWS)/ Low Income Group (LIG) category. A total of 2.95 lakh beneficiaries have been envisaged to be benefitted by this Scheme, initially.(c)to (e):	Yes, Sir. Private players will be encouraged to participate under both models of the Scheme. Under Model–1, State/ UT Governments will select a Concessionaire through Request for Proposal (RFP) to develop existing Government funded vacant housing complexes to be used as ARHCs for a period of 25 years under Repair/Retrofit, Develop, Operate and Transfer (RDOT) mode. Large chunks of vacant landsare lying unutilized with Industries, Trade Associations, Manufacturing Companies, Educational/ Health Institutions, Development Authorities, Housing Boards, Central/ State Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and other such Entities. Under Model-2, ARHCs will be constructed, operated and maintained by these Public/Private entities on their own available vacant land for 25 years by themselves. The States/UTs including Tamil Nadu are under process of identifying such projects which are dispute free and readily available for converting into ARHCs after making them liveable. Workers, service providers, students, etc. who move from rural areas to urban centres are part of target beneficiaries of ARHCs. They may avail these accommodation facilities on affordable rent through aggregators.                                         *****
