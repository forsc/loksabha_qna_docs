                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRYAND DAIRYING (DR. SANJEEV KUMAR BALYAN)a)	Yes Sir,     In  nation-wide National Milk Safety and Quality Survey conducted through a third party by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) in 2018,  out of 6,432 samples of milk taken from 1,103 towns/cities with population above 50,000, only  12 samples  were found adulterated  with hydrogen peroxide, detergents, urea and neutralisers rendering the milk unsafe for  human consumption. Further, 5.7% of the samples were found withcontamination ofAflatoxin M1 residues beyond permissible limits. Instances of sub-standard and adulterated milk sold in the market are also reported in the course of regular surveillance and enforcement drives undertaken by State/UT Governments which are primarily responsible for enforcement of Food Safety and Standards Act.b)	 As regards the Scheme for production of organic milk, no such proposal has been received from the State Governments for consideration. However, under the on-going scheme of “National Programme for Dairy Development” approval has been granted during 2019-20 for strengthening of 231 Cooperative dairy plants to equip them to detect adulterants in milk (Urea, Maltodextrin, Ammonium Sulphate, Detergent, Sugar, Neutralisers etc.). In addition one State level Central laboratory for 18 States has been approved under the programme. This will ensure capability for testing of chemical and microbiological quality of milk before reaching the consumers. The total cost of the project was Rs.271.64 crore. c)	In the recent National Milk Safety and Quality Survey, 2018 conducted by FSSAI, a major finding was presence of Aflatoxin M1 residues beyond permissible limits in milk, the source of which is animal feed and fodder. d)	To address the issue, a  direction has been issued by FSSAI  on 27.01.2020, making it mandatory for feeds intended for cattle to comply with the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) specifications for Compounded feeds for Cattle (IS 2052:2009) and carry a BIS certification mark on the label of the products. This will come into effect after 6 months from the date of issue.
