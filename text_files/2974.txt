                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY                                         (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****    STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.2750 BY SHRI BALUBHAU ALIAS SURESH NARAYAN DHANORKAR TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 10.07.2019 REGARDING VACANCY AFTER INTRODUCTION OF FLEXI FARE SYSTEM(a) & (b): Passenger traffic over Indian Railways is not uniform. It varies during lean and peak periods and this lean and peak period is also not uniform for all parts of the country. Moreover, trains running on popular and convenient timings with lesser stoppages and running time are generally well patronized and also experience waiting list almost throughout the year.  However, other trains not having these features are chosen by passengers for travel only as a second alternative and are, therefore, not fully patronized.  The occupancy of Rajdhani/Shatabdi/Duronto Express trains also varies accordingly. However, overall occupancy of Rajdhani, Shatabdi & Duronto Express trains during the financial year 2018-19 has been approximately 98%, 76% & 94% respectively.  The corresponding occupancy figures during the current financial year 2019-20 (up to May) have been approximately 110%, 83% & 105% respectively for Rajdhani, Shatabdi & Duronto Express trains.Further, to improve the occupancy of all trains including Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duronto trains, the following discount/rebate in fare schemes have been offered:-(i)	10% rebate in basic fare is given on vacant berths/seats booked after preparation of first reservation charts in all trains including Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duronto Express trains.(ii)	Discounted fare has been offered for the passengers of Bengaluru City-Mysuru and Mysuru-Bengaluru City sections in 12007/12008 Chennai Central-Mysuru Shatabdi Express and for the passengers of New Jalpaiguri-Malda Town in 12042 New Jalpaiguri-Howrah Shatabdi Express. (c): Based on the feedback from different quarters, a committee was constituted to review the Flexi Fare scheme. Further, based on the committee’s recommendations and other representations, the matter has been examined and Flexi Fare scheme has been rationalized w.e.f 15.03.2019 on an experimental basis as under:-(i)	Discontinuation of Flexi Fare scheme (Rajdhani, Shatabdi and Duronto Express trains) from 15 trains fully and from 32 trains during pre defined lean period of 3 months (February, March & August). Out of these, during pre-defined lean period, Flexi Fare has been withdrawn from 5 Rajdhani Express trains. (ii)	Maximum cap of Flexi Fare scheme has been reduced to 1.4 times from 1.5 times earlier in all Flexi Fare applicable classes.(iii)	Graded discount has been introduced in Flexi Fare trains including Rajdhani Express trains, where class-wise occupancy is less than 60%, 4 days prior to scheduled departure of the train as under:-Occupancy	DiscountUp to 70%	20% on last fare70 to 80%	10% on last fareAbove 80%	Nil 				                 *****
