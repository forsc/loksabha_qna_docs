The state-wise details of 77 projects sanctioned under the above themes are annexed.The projects under the scheme are identified for development in consultation with the State Governments/ UT Administrations and are sanctioned subject to availability of funds, submission of suitable detailed project reports, adherence to scheme guidelines and utilization of funds released earlier. Submission of project proposals by the State Governments/Union Territory Administrations and its sanctioning by the Ministry is a continuous process. The Ministry had sanctioned the project ‘Development of Coastal Circuit in Dakshin Kannada Dist, Uttar Kannada Dist & Udupi Dist in Karnataka’ under Swadesh Darshan Scheme in 2016-17 for Rs.95.67 Crores. The decision to drop the above project was taken by the Central Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee of the scheme in its meeting held on 5th September 2018 due to NIL progress on ground.  The State Government has informed that funds amounting to Rs.11.08 Crores have been released to the executing agencies and work of Rs.24.12 Crores approved under the scheme has been taken up for implementation. In pursuance, Ministry has asked State Government to submit the details of the work allotted for implementation and payments made.******
