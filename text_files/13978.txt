                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) & (b): As per information provided by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), total number of missing children in the country, State/UT-wise during 2016-2018              (below 18 years) is Annexed. Some of the reasons behind the cases of missing children could be kidnapping, abduction, trafficking, illegal adoption, run away children and due to natural calamities as reported by NCRB.(c): 	 As informed by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), pursuant to the directions of Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of WP (C) 75/2012, MHA has issued detailed advisory on 25.06.2013 to the States and UTs in which it was inter-alia stated that in case of complaint with regard to any missing children made in a police station, the same should be reduced into a First Information Report and appropriate steps should be taken to see that follow up investigation is taken up immediately thereafter, etc. The Hon’ble Court had also directed that the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) may be asked to monitor the implementation of Standard Operating Procedure by the State Governments for rescuing and restoring missing children.(d): As informed by MHA, causes for missing children would vary on case to case basis including trafficking.(e): 	As informed by MHA, ‘Police’ is a State subject under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibilities to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens including children rests with the respective State Governments.  The State Governments are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provisions of laws. However, the Government of India accords highest priority to the safety of children in the country. In addition to the Advisory mentioned in reply to part (c) of the question, MHA has issued other advisories from time to time including advisories on 25.09.2013 and 30.10.2018 on ''measures to be taken in cases of missing adolescent girls'' requesting States/UTs to give greater focus on the cases relating to missing adolescent girls and make timely interventions to protect these girls from falling prey to any social abuse and organised crimes; and measures to be taken in cases of kidnapping of minors respectively.***  AnnexureState/UT-wise Report on Missing and Traced Children (Below 18 years) during 2016-2018.SL	State/UT	2016	2017	2018		Missing	Traced	Missing	Traced	Missing	Traced1	Andhra Pradesh	3324	1912	3616	2902	3150	26102	Arunachal Pradesh	61	33	74	48	34	323	Assam	2413	1069	1651	1170	2120	14614	Bihar	5896	3026	8493	3271	12072	69675	Chhattisgarh	3127	2051	3341	2267	4237	29206	Goa	57	25	45	14	47	167	Gujarat	2007	1247	2172	1653	2417	18738	Haryana	3575	1695	3814	2217	3739	25769	Himachal Pradesh	280	174	368	271	481	34010	Jammu & Kashmir	1070	354	725	219	800	41611	Jharkhand	1008	329	1099	465	993	37712	Karnataka	4224	2733	3195	1954	2864	231413	Kerala	1735	1520	1755	1595	2153	200214	Madhya Pradesh	12068	8197	14116	8834	15320	928415	Maharashtra	9982	4357	8581	3364	6928	321416	Manipur	186	172	97	75	107	8217	Meghalaya	184	155	148	103	163	11918	Mizoram	0	0	1	1	3	319	Nagaland	77	63	103	101	97	8120	Odisha	5791	589	7446	6281	3491	113921	Punjab	1290	510	2724	872	2587	63822	Rajasthan	4203	3216	3403	2453	3521	247923	Sikkim	150	110	88	85	57	5224	Tamil Nadu	5801	4660	5844	4782	5333	403825	Telangana	4700	3597	4304	2984	4410	315226	Tripura	197	171	166	150	198	18827	Uttar Pradesh	5169	1861	5161	2763	5704	279928	Uttarakhand	859	589	877	572	938	37429	West Bengal	16881	5388	19671	11849	16027	10205	TOTAL  STATE(S)	96315	49803	103078	63315	99991	6175130	A&N Islands	53	48	43	35	56	4431	Chandigarh	435	152	513	207	540	21432	D&N Haveli	8	2	8	4	4	033	Daman & Diu	39	27	34	29	30	1734	Delhi	14661	5863	15252	6807	14986	910235	Lakshadweep	0	0	0	0	0	036	Puducherry	58	49	43	43	49	48	TOTAL UT(S)	15254	6141	15893	7125	15665	9425	TOTAL (ALL INDIA)	111569	55944	118971	70440	115656	71176Source: Crime in India						Note: Clarifications are pending from West Bengal, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya & Sikkim for the year 2018
