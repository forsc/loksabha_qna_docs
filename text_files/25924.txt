ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) to (c) Flood management including erosion control falls within the purview of the States. Accordingly, flood management schemes are formulated and implemented by concerned State Governments as per their priority. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and also promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas.                 The encroachment of river beds, in general, aggravates the problem of flooding in rivers. Ministry of Jal Shakti has continuously impressed upon the states the need to adopt flood plain zoning approach. A model draft bill for flood plain zoning legislation was also circulated by the Union Government to all the States. This bill envisages zoning of flood plain of a river according to flood frequencies and defines the type of use of flood plain. The states of Manipur, Rajasthan Uttarakhand, and erstwhile State of Jammu & Kashmir had enacted legislation however, delineation and demarcation of flood plains is yet to be undertaken. The response from the State Governments towards enactment of flood-plain zoning legislation has not been encouraging. Ganga Flood Control Commission under Ministry of Jal Shakti has also continuously impressed upon the basin States on the need to take follow-up action to implement the flood plain zoning approach in various Commission meetings with States representative. The National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) has time to time advised all States in Ganga Basin, including Bihar for demarcation, delineation and notification of river flood plains and removal of encroachments from river bed/flood plain of the river Ganga and its tributaries. Major flood prone States viz Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Odisha etc. have not taken initiative to enact flood plain zoning legislation. The States expressed their inability to enact the Act mainly on account of reasons like high population density, practical difficulties in relocation and rehabilitation, scarcity of land resources in urban areas, etc.*****
