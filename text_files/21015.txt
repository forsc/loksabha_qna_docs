                                                        (a) & (b) Several efforts are being made to develop the tribal areas with focus on the infrastructure including roads, housing, schools etc. Under the Scheduled Tribe Component (earlier known as Tribal Sub Plan) 41 Ministries/ department allocate funds exclusively for the development of Scheduled Tribes. During the year 2020-21, 41 Ministries have allocated Rs. 52024.23 crores under 316 schemes out of which Rs. 32986.45 crores have been utilised so far (as on 04.03.2021). Under the scheme of Pradhan Mantri AwasYojna (PMAY)- Rural, funds to the tune of Rs. 13410.61 crores have been allocated under the Scheduled Tribe Component by the Department of Rural Development for construction of houses. The list of Ministries/Department along with the funds allocated and released under Scheduled Tribe Component during last two years is at Annexure.    	Cumulatively, on an average Rs. 2.00 lakh crore is being utilized per year under the Scheduled Tribe Component of Central Ministries/Department, State Government and Ministry of Tribal Affairs for the development of tribal areas including infrastructure development in different sectors.  The programmes and schemes of Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) are intended to support and supplement the efforts primarily of other Central Ministries and the State Governments to fill critical gaps in institutions and programmes. Government has adopted a multi-pronged strategy for overall development of tribal people across the country in various sectors including infrastructure i.e., roads, housing, schools, etc. The various sectors are namely (i) Education (ii) Health (iii) Agriculture and allied fields (iv) Other income generating schemes to augment Tribal household economy and (v) Administrative structure (incl. manpower) / Institutional framework & Research studies. MoTA provides support for infrastructure development mainly through its three schemes namely (i) Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution of India, (ii) Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS) and (iii) Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub Scheme (SCA to TSS).   For providing quality education to the tribals, 740 Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS) are being established by MoTA in blocks with 50% or more ST population and 20,000 or more tribal persons. The Ministry also supports around 30 lakh tribal students annually through different kind of scholarships and fellowships. (c)	MoTA Extends support to State Governments / UTs for development of bilingual Primers under the Scheme ‘Support to Tribal Research Institutes’ for enhancement of learning achievement level amongst the Scheduled Tribe Students. So far 82 language primers have been developed by various State Governments.(d)	Under the schemes of Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution and SCA to TSS, funds are provided to the State Governments on demand for the purpose of upgradation/infrastructure development and purchase of equipment in health centres, govt. hospitals, and also for provision of mobile dispensaries, hygiene/sanitation/nutrition of tribal people etc. In addition, this Ministry also administers the scheme of “Grant-in-Aid to Voluntary Organisations working for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes” under which grants are provided to NGOs to meet the expenditure incurred by them in providing food and health check-up to ST students in educational projects being run by them. Grants are also provided under this scheme to organizations for running projects of 10 or more bedded hospitals and mobile dispensaries and ambulances in areas where such services are deemed deficient.  ******  ANNEXURE Annexure referred to in Reply part (a) & (b) to Unstarred Question No. 2177 for answer on 08.03.2021 regarding “Infrastructure in Tribal Areas”Allocation and Release by Central Ministries/Department during last 2 years towards Scheduled Tribe Component(Rs.in crores)Sl No	Ministry / Department 	2018-19	2019-20		Allocation	Release	Allocation	Release1	Department of Agricultural Research and Education	106.71	106.70	105.91	38.272	Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers'' Welfare	3354.76	3282.75	8717.57	8392.053	Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries	251.49	260.52	221.80	194.414	Department of Commerce	25.01	25.00	29.01	25.345	Department of Consumer Affairs	2.58	2.58	1.72	1.006	Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities	69.29	202.98	78.92	210.157	Department of Fisheries	--	--	49.44	42.658	Department of Food and Public Distribution	6.00	--	0.50	0.009	Department of Health and Family Welfare	3490.82	3148.74	4042.09	3762.1610	Department of Higher Education	1264.48	1264.82	1605.00	1418.5911	Department of Land Resources	189.98	189.99	178.30	161.5412	Department of Rural Development	5377.64	5386.41	5882.27	5926.8413	Department of School Education and Literacy	4900.56	4924.66	5831.61	5657.6914	Department of Science and Technology	99.03	97.79	111.84	100.5515	Department of Telecommunications	504.47	265.42	140.75	62.3916	Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation	108.91	158.91	237.81	228.4817	Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation	1852.04	1852.04	1833.89	1802.7018	Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH)	4.00	25.75	26.00	26.0019	Ministry of Coal	30.53	30.53	95.16	98.7520	Ministry of Culture	24.45	24.44	22.51	22.0521	Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region	567.13	567.13	750.87	754.4122	Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology	225.76	225.76	215.24	175.5123	Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change	78.41	69.31	95.35	90.9424	Ministry of Food Processing Industries	5.75	5.75	38.25	0.3525	Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs	288.36	289.36	324.71	325.6626	Ministry of Labour and Employment	748.62	423.11	929.06	533.9827	Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises	826.92	832.51	618.96	773.5328	Ministry of Mines	10.59	11.88	25.55	25.5729	Ministry of New and Renewable Energy	188.18	188.18	322.00	279.9230	Ministry of Panchayati Raj	62.82	62.82	61.15	61.1531	Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas	0.00	0.00	1619.80	323.6132	Ministry of Power	496.02	877.61	803.78	706.1233	Ministry of Road Transport and Highways	2355.56	849.66	2610.00	226.1334	Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship	219.11	23.80	172.71	21.2535	Ministry of Textiles	74.26	73.76	184.99	158.1536	Ministry of Tourism	0.00	87.57	55.00	55.0037	Ministry of Tribal Affairs	5954.78	5956.54	7293.66	7291.5038	Ministry of Women and Child Development	1466.55	1466.54	2232.83	1787.2939	Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports	121.20	120.61	182.82	181.75 	Total	35352.77	33381.93	47748.83	41943.41
