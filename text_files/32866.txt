                                                                     THE MINISTER OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                      (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a): Government of India launched Smart Cities Mission (SCM) on 25 June 2015. 100 cities have been selected for development as Smart cities through 4 rounds of competition from January 2016 to June 2018.  (b): As per SCM Statement & Guidelines, Central Government will provide financial support under the Mission to the extent of ? 48,000 crore over five years i.e., on an average ? 100 crore per city per year. An equal amount on a matching basis will be contributed by the State Government/Urban Local Body (ULB).(c): The implementation of SCM at the city level is done by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) created for the purpose. At State level, Mission implementation is coordinated by the State level High Powered Steering Committee (HPSC) chaired by the Chief Secretary of the State.  At the National level, implementation of SCM is monitored by an Apex Committee headed by Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA).  Nominee Directors of MoHUA on the Boards of SPVs monitor progress in respective cities on a regular basis. MoHUA regularly interacts with the States/Smart Cities through video conferences, review meetings, field visits, regional workshops etc. at various levels to assess the performance of cities and handhold them for improving the same. Smart Cities are assessed on various parameters including, but not limited to, project implementation and utilization of funds through the Online Geospatial Management Information System (GMIS).(d) & (e): Projects under SCM are aimed at improving liveability, economic ability, and sustainability of cities. The focus is on sustainable and inclusive development and the idea is to look at developing compact areas, creating replicable models which will act as lighthouses to other aspiring cities through work on four pillars of comprehensive development — institutional, physical, social, and economic infrastructure. Projects under the Mission, inter alia, include development of Integrated Command & Control Centres, Smart Roads, Smart Solar, Smart water & wastewater infrastructure, vibrant urban spaces.  As on 21 January 2022, Smart Cities have tendered out 6,721 projects worth ? 1,88,507 crore; out of which work orders have been issued in 6,124 projects worth ? 1,62,908 crore; out of these, 3,421 projects worth ? 58,735 crore have been completed.  The details of other significant initiatives launched by Mission aimed at integrated development across various aspects of urban development are given in Annexure-I.                              *****
