                                                                   THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                             (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a)	to (d): Yes, Sir. In the wake of reverse migration of urban migrants/ poor in the country due to COVID-19 pandemic, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) on 31/07/2020 has launched Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHCs), a sub-scheme under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban). These ARHCs provide low-cost rental accommodation for the urban migrants/ poor near their workplace through following two models: i.	Utilizing existing Government funded vacant houses in cities by converting them into ARHCs under Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode or by Public agencies ii.	Construction, Operation and Maintenance of Affordable Rental Housing Complexes by Public/ Private Entities on their own available vacant land. The details of the ARHCs Scheme are available at http://arhc.mohua.gov.in/filesUpload/Operational-Guidelines-of-ARHCs.pdf.  The State/ UT-wise details of the existing vacant houses converted into ARHCs for the beneficiaries and ARHCs sanctioned for Public/ Private Entities to be constructed on their available land are at Annexure.                                   *****
