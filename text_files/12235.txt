                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) &(b) Forest Survey of India, Dehradun, an organization under the Ministry carries out the assessment of forest cover of the country biennially and the findings are published in India State of Forest Report (ISFR). As per the latest ISFR 2019, there is an increase of 3976km2in forest cover in the country over that of the ISFR 2017. The State/UTs wise change in forest cover is given in Annexure I.There is an overall increase in the forest cover in the country as well as in tribal districts. However, some decline in forest cover in North East States and a few tribal districts has been observed in the ISFR-2019 as compared to ISFR-2017, due to various reasons such as shifting cultivation, developmental activities such as mining, construction of dams, road and railway network, etc. Details of forest cover in North Eastern States and tribal districts are given in Annexure II and Annexure III, respectively.(c) To increase the forest cover in the country, the Ministry is taking several initiatives. These include ongoing Centrally Sponsored Schemes of the Ministry such as National Afforestation Programme, National Mission for a Green India and Development of Wildlife Habitats. The recently promulgated Compensatory Afforestation Fund Rules, 2018also contain provisions for taking up assisted natural regeneration, artificial regeneration and silvicultural operations in forests which contribute to increase in forest cover. The Ministry also supports school nursery and urban forestry programmes through people’s participation.  Afforestation activities are also taken up under various programmes/funding sources such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana and under the schemes/plans of State/UT Governments.
