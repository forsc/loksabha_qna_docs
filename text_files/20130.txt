ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c) No Sir, There is no proposal to establish any new mechanism at the level of Chief Minister or Ministers in States for time-bound implementation of schemes. However, the Ministry of Rural Development accords emphasis on proper implementation of all its rural development schemes. In order to ensure the programme benefits reach the rural poor, the Ministry has evolved a comprehensive multi-level and multi-format system of monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of rural development programmes, including Performance Review Committee Meetings, District Development Co-ordination and Monitoring Committee (“DISHA”) meetings, National Level Monitors, Area Officers Schemes, Common Review Mission, Concurrent Evaluation and Impact Assessment Studies, internal audit and Public Financial Management System (PFMS) implementation.  Further, a State Level Development Coordination Committee under the chairmanship of Chief Minister has been provided to look for monitoring and coordination of all the centrally sponsored schemes.  They also look at the issues for time bound implementation of Central/Centrally Sponsored Schemes.As per the reports/returns received from the state governments/UT Administrations, the implementation of these programmes have been found to be satisfactory. Third-Party evaluation of the Schemes is also carried out regularly and actions, as appropriate, are taken on the findings.*******
