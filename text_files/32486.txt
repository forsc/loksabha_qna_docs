The objective of the policy is to create a robust Indian Software Product development ecosystem leading to ten-fold increase in India share of the Global Software product market and so as to generate direct and in-direct employment for 3.5 million people by 2025.ii.	Next Generation Incubation Scheme (NGIS) has been approved to support software product ecosystem and to address a significant portion of National Policy on Software Product (NPSP 2019). It is envisaged to create a vibrant software product ecosystem to complement the robust IT Industry for continued growth, new employment and enhance competitiveness.iii.	Some other initiatives to promote IT sector exports include Future Skills PRIME, Market Development Initiative in Nordics and Africa Region, Market Outreach Initiatives etc. under Champion Sector Services Scheme.iv.	Further, in order to promote trade in services including IT services, Department of Commerce follows a multi-pronged strategy which comprises seeking meaningful market access through multilateral, regional and bilateral trade agreements. Focused efforts are also being made to address mobility issues being faced by the service suppliers and resolve barriers if any, faced by the exporters and other stakeholders as a part of these agreements. (b)	A target of US$ 400 billion for Merchandise exports for FY 2021-22 has been set. These targets have been communicated to State Governments, Missions Abroad and all Export Promotion Council (EPCs) for action. Following are some of the steps taken to increase exports:i.	‘Districts as Export Hubs’(DEH) Initiative under which products and services with export potential have been identified in all districts of the country. An institutional mechanism has been set up in each District in the form of District Export Promotion Committees (DEPCs). The primary function of the DEPC is to prepare and act on District Specific Export Action Plans in collaboration with all the relevant stakeholders from the Centre, State and District levels.ii.	A Central Sector Scheme ‘Transport and Marketing Assistance (TMA) for Specified Agriculture Products’ for providing assistance for the international component of freight, to mitigate the freight disadvantage for the export of agriculture products, and marketing of agricultural products, is under implementation.iii.

The scheme is formulated on focus product-focus country approach to evolve specific market and specific product through market studies/survey. Assistance would be provided to Export Promotion Organizations/Trade Promotion Organizations/National Level Institutions/ Research Institutions/Universities/Laboratories, Exporters etc., for enhancement of exports through accessing new markets or through increasing the share in the existing markets.iv.

This scheme seeks remission of Central, State and Local duties/taxes/levies at different stages at the Central, State and local level, which are incurred in the process of manufacture and distribution of exported products, but are currently not being refunded under any other duty remission scheme.vii.	Common Digital Platform for Certificate of Origin to facilitate trade and increase FTA utilization by exporters.viii.	EPCs, Commodity Boards and India’s mission abroad are actively promoting India’s trade, tourism, technology and investment goals.(c)	Software Technology Parks of India (STPI), an autonomous society under Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has established 62 STPI centres across the country, of which 54 centres are located in Tier II and Tier III cities.To create employment opportunities and dispersal of IT/ITES industry in small cities and towns (excluding metro locations), Government had launched two BPO promotion schemes, namely India BPO Promotion Scheme (IBPS) and North East BPO Promotion Scheme (NEBPS). These schemes aim to incentivize setting up of 53,300 seats BPO/ITES operations by providing financial support up to 1 lakh per seat in the form of viability gap funding. Since the inception of these schemes, around 250 units have set up BPO/ITES operations across 27 States/UTs of the country, providing direct employment to over 47,000 persons. Under these schemes, the disbursements of financial support are on reimbursement basis directly linked with the objective i.e. employment generation by the units. (d)	The STPI centres are being set-up by STPI from its own internal accruals as per the extant policy of setting-up of new STPI centres, no funds are being sanctioned or released by the Union Government for this purpose. Till now, financial support of Rs. 80 crores have been disbursed to BPO/ITES units under IPBS and NEBPS schemes. (e)	The State-wise list of existing STPI Centres is at Annexure-I.(f)	In order to create favourable ecosystem for start-ups, various domain-centric Center of Excellences (CoEs) have been set-up by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) in collaboration with suitable partners and stakeholders (State Government, Industry/ Industry Associations, Academia) in various parts of country. These CoEs are acting as single-window facilitators to extend requisite lab support, funding, mentoring services, etc.Further, to help IT industry to grow rapidly and contribute to country’s exports of services; Software Technology Park (STP) Scheme - a 100% export-oriented scheme is being implemented by STPI for the development and export of computer software using communication links or physical media and including export of professional services.Other major initiatives of Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY) to promote technology led startup-innovation ecosystem are:•	Technology Incubation and Development of Entrepreneurs (TIDE 2.0) Scheme•	MeitY Start-up Hub (MSH)•	Scheme for Accelerating Startups around Post COVID Technology Opportunities (SASACT)•	Start-up Accelerator Programmes•	Electronic system and design manufacturing Entrepreneur Parks  •	Support for International Patent Protection in E&IT (SIP-EIT) Scheme for SMEs******* Annexure-I: List of existing STPI Centres:S.
