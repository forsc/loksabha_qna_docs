Etakkot railway station is a NSG-6 category railway stations having medium level platform. Considering the safety aspects, it has been decided to provide railway stations with High Level Platforms irrespective of its category of station on Broad Gauge which was not the case earlier, as only erstwhile ‘A1’, ‘A’ & ‘C’ category stations were provided with High Level platforms. However, priority are accorded to higher category of station over lower category of station while sanctioning and executing the work of raising the height of platforms.  The work for Etakkot railway station is not sanctioned at present.*****
