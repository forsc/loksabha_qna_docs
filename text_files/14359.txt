ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                          (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)	& (b) Urban transport, which is an integral part of urban development, is a State subject. Hence, respective state governments are responsible for planning, development and sustainable operation of urban transport system including metro rail system. Considering the operational length and recency of operation, none of the metro rail companies, which are 50:50 joint ventures of central government and respective state government, have reported low ridership. Government of India has issued Metro Rail Policy-2017, which envisages provisioning for feeder systems to enlarge the catchment area of each metro station at least to 5 kms, last mile connectivity through pedestrian pathways, Non-Motorized Transport (NMT) infrastructure, induction of facilities for para transit modes etc. Government of India has also issued Transit Oriented Development Policy in May 2017, which envisages high density mixed land use development in the influence zone of transit stations.  These steps incentivize commuters for using the metro rail, thus enhancing ridership. (c) & (d) No, Sir.(e) 	As per Metro Rail Policy 2017, metro rail implementing agencies shall put an appropriate monitoring mechanism for time bound implementation of metro rail project. A high powered committee under the chairmanship of Chief secretary of concerned  state is set up to resolve various issues related with expeditious completion of project, which includes land acquisition, shifting of utilities and other structure in project alignment, rehabilitation of project affected persons etc.                                             *****
