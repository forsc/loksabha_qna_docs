THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI  PIYUSH GOYAL)(a)to(d):	Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is a major driver of economic growth and a source of non-debt finance for the economic development of India. FDI inflows serve to augment domestic capital and help to promote industrial development and employment generation across sectors. It has been the endeavour  of the Government to put in place an enabling and investor friendly FDI policy. Government reviews FDI 	policy on an ongoing basis and changes are made in the FDI policy regime, from time to time, to ensure that India remains increasingly attractive and investor-friendly investment destination.The technology brought into the country through FDI is largely a matter of private business decisions of foreign investors. However, no information is maintained centrally about the nature of technology brought into the country. ******
