The JV Company awarded the Contract for development and operation of Deposit-13 Mine to M/s. Adani Enterprises Limited (AEL), appointing them as Mine Developer-cum-Operator based on lowest offer basis.	NMDC has informed that they are not aware of any place of worship of tribal goddess Pithor Rani in Deposit No.13 as per the records available in NCL Project. The name of tribal Goddess Pithor Rani was heard only during the agitation by local Villagers between 07.06.2019 to 12.06.2019.(c) to (f): On 04.06.2019, Samyukt Panchayat Jan Jagaran Samithi, Dakshin Bastar Dantewada submitted a representation to the Collector, Dakshin Bastar Dantewada that they are going to protest against the work given to M/s AEL for development of Deposit No.13 mine. On 07.06.2019, the local people of Bailadilla Sector under the banner of Jan Sangharsh Samithi, Bailadilla Kirandul staged dharna at Bailadilla Iron Ore Mine, Kirandul check post till 13.06.2019 on the following issues: (i)	Awarding the Contract to M/s. AEL and(ii)	The Gram Sabha which was held in the year 2014 for obtaining No Objection Certificate (NOC) under Forest Rights Act (FRA) for obtaining Forest Clearance claiming it is false and has to be re- conducted.(iii)	All Mining activities to be stopped since it is a place of worship of Tribal God/ Goddess.   	NMDC has reported that two Trade Unions informed them to extend their support to “Sanyukta Panchayat Sangarsh Samiti” w.e.f. 08.06.2019. The scope of work given to AEL is to excavate the iron ire from the Mine, transportation and loading into railway wagons/trucks. The Mining Lease of Deposit-13 will remain with NCL and it will not be transferred to any other agency.	The District Administration persuaded the Villagers to stop Dharna giving assurance that the State Government will enquire into this within 15 days. Besides, they took certain administrative action. District Collector/concerned Authorities of State Govt. of Chhattisgarh have issued notices for stopping all the activities of Deposit No. 13, village Hiroli, District, Dantewada.*****
