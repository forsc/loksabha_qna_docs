ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI) a)	  Increase in domestic production of oil and natural gas has a major role in reducing the import dependence. To spur growth of domestic production and attract new entrants, a large number of   policy initiatives in the areas of   generation of   quality geo-scientific data and providing easy access, finding future oil & gas by awarding new exploration acreage, expediting production from new development acreages and from existing production acreages and focus on production maximisation have been taken in the recent years. The Government has also taken various steps towards achieving 20% blending of ethanol in petrol by 2025 which includes allowing use of sugarcane, damaged food grains and maize for conversion to ethanol.  The National Policy on Biofuels – 2018 prescribes an indicative target of 5% blending of biodiesel in diesel by 2030. Thrust is being given to Advanced Biofuels such as Second Generation (2G) Ethanol, Bio CNG/ Compressed Bio Gas (CBG), UCO based biodiesel etc. which can be sourced from wastes such as crop residues, Biomass, industrial waste, sewage water etc. and are abundantly available in the Country. ''SATAT’ (Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation) scheme for CBG was launched in 2018 which envisages targeting production of 15 MMT of CBG from 5000 plants by 2023.(b) and (c) The Government has not proposed any policy for flex engines. However, a production linked incentive scheme that incentivises Auto OEMs to accelerate the introduction of flex fuel vehicles has been notified.(d) and (e) Due to the lower calorific value of flex fuels in comparison to petrol, there will be a drop in fuel efficiency. However, with modifications in engines (hardware and tuning), the loss in efficiency due to blended fuel can be reduced.(f) and (g) No regulation for the conversion of regular engines to Flex engines has been issued.**********
