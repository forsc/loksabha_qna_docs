                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a)	& (b): Tobacco Board ensures the fair and remunerative prices to FCV Tobacco farmers by fixing Minimum Guarantee Indicative Price (MGIP) in consultation with FCV Tobacco farmers and Traders. The FCV Tobacco production is mainly concentrated in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. In the year 2019-20, the price realization of the FCV farmers was above the MGIP, despite the unseasonal rain in the States of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka and COVID pandemic. (c): Tobacco Board conducts e-auctions for sale of FCV tobacco on the designated auction platforms for encouraging competition among the traders to have better price discovery. Further, in order to ensure better returns to the farmers, Tobacco Board conducts various yield and quality upgradation activities like, facilitating supply of essential inputs for production of quality tobacco viz., seed, fertilizers etc., energy conservation measures for reducing the wood fuel usage in tobacco curing, field visits with scientists from Central Tobacco Research Institute for technical advisory services, etc.*****
