                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE AND CORPORATE AFFAIRS	                            (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)                                           ????? ??? ???????? ????? ???????? ??? ????? ?????? 	                    (???? ?????? ???? ?????)(a) to (e): The Government in the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) administers the provisions of Companies Act, 2013, Limited Liability Partnerships (‘LLPs’) Act, 2008 and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016. However, the Ministry of Labour and Employment has informed that the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSHW&C) Code, 2020, has provisions for safety, health and working conditions of workers which include daily and weekly working hours, leave etc. The OSHW&C Code, 2020 has been published on 29th September, 2020 and will come into force on the date as notified by the Central Government. The OSHW&C Code, 2020 and draft Rules framed thereunder provide that no worker shall be required or allowed to work, in any establishment or class of establishments for more than eight hours in a day or forty eight hours in a week.  Further, the Government has notified four Labour Codes; namely, the Code on Wages, 2019, the Industrial Relations Code, 2020, the Code on Social Security, 2020 and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the relevant provisions of 29 Central Labour Laws.Codification of the Labour laws will inter-alia reduce multiplicity of definitions & authorities, facilitate implementation & use of technology in enforcement of labour laws and bring transparency & accountability in enforcement which would promote setting up of more enterprises. Further, provisions of one registration for an establishment instead of multiple registration, one licence and one return in place of multiple licenses and returns would reduce rigidity of labour market and facilitate hassle free compliance. Simultaneously, the codes will harmonize needs of workers and industry and will prove an important milestone for welfare of the workers.                                            *****
