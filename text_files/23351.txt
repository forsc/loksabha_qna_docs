                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????	     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (f):	National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) is a virtual platform integrating physical wholesale mandis/ markets of different States/ Union Territories (UTs) to facilitate online trading of agricultural commodities through transparent price discovery method to enable farmers to realize better remunerative prices for their produce. 	The Central Government is providing free e-NAM software and financial grant assistance for related hardware including quality assaying equipments and for creation of infrastructure like cleaning, grading, sorting, packaging and compost unit etc. Under the scheme, various training & awareness programmes are conducted free for farmers and other stakeholders for successful implementation of e-NAM. 	As per scheme guidelines the concerned State/UT has to submit the proposal in the form of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) to integrate their mandis with e-NAM portal following the e-NAM scheme guideline. As per targets set earlier, 1000 mandis have been integrated based on proposals received from 18 States and 03 Union Territories. However, no DPR was received from Government of Bihar for implementation of e-NAM in the State within targeted number. 	Farmers are free to register on e-NAM Portal and sell their produce through online transparent and competitive bidding method, which is encouraging them to join increasingly on e-NAM platform. So far, more than 1.70 crore farmers have registered on e-NAM platform. No market in Bihar is linked to the National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) portal for which farmers in that state have not been registered on e-NAM portal. So far, more than 8.68 lakh farmers of Gujarat have been registered with National Agriculture Market (e-NAM).	No complaint have been registered so far regarding functioning of e-NAM mandis in last three year in Gujarat.  ******
