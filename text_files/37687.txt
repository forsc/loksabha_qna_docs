                                                        THE MINISTER OF NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND POWER (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) The details of solar photovoltaic modules and cells imported during last three years and the current year, as per the website pertaining to Export-Import Data Bank of Department of Commerce, are at Annexure-I.(b) Solar panels are manufactured indigenously as well. The total capacity for manufacturing solar panels in the country, as per the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) is about 11.5 GW.(c) & (d) During the last three years, the annual addition of solar power generation capacity in the country has been as follows: Year	Capacity addition in solar power generation in the country (GW) 2018-19	6.542019-20	6.452020-21	7.63The total capacity for manufacturing solar panels in the country, as per the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) is about 11.5 GW. Thus, the capacity of domestic solar PV manufacturing capacity is more than the annual installed solar power generation capacity. Modernisation of manufacturing technology is a continuous process and the solar PV manufacturers upgrade their technology as per the market demand for higher efficiency modules. In order to incentivize domestic manufacturing of high efficiency solar PV modules, MNRE issued the Scheme Guidelines for Production Linked Incentive Scheme ‘National Programme on High Efficiency Solar PV Modules’, with an outlay of Rs. 4,500 crores for supporting manufacturing of high efficiency solar PV modules by providing Production Linked Incentive (PLI) on sales of such solar PV modules. Letters of Award have been issued to the eligible successful bidders to the extent of funds allocated (i.e. the present scheme outlay of Rs. 4,500 crore). (e) An additional outlay of Rs 19,500 crore in respect of Production Linked Incentive Scheme for High Efficiency Solar PV Modules has been announced in the Budget 2022-23 on 1st February 2022. Measures regarding allocation of additional capacities in respect of additional outlay of Rs. 19,500 crore, have been initiated.(f)&(g) In order to incentivize domestic manufacturing of solar PV panels and equipment and make domestic solar manufacturers globally competitive, the Government has taken various steps which inter alia include:(i) Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS) Scheme of Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology: The scheme mainly provides subsidy for capital expenditure – 20% for investments in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and 25% in non-SEZs. The Scheme was open to receive applications till 31st December, 2018. The Scheme inter-alia covers solar PV cells, solar PV modules, EVA, backsheet and solar glass.(ii) Preference to ‘Make in India’ in Public Procurement in Renewable Energy Sector: Through implementation of ‘Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order’, procurement and use of domestically manufactured solar PV modules and domestically manufactured solar inverters has been mandated for Govt/ Govt. entities. (iii) Domestic Content Requirement (DCR): Under some of the current schemes of the MNRE, namely CPSU Scheme Phase-II, PM-KUSUM and Grid-connected Rooftop Solar Programme Phase-II, wherein government subsidy is given, it has been mandated to source solar PV cells and modules from domestic sources.(iv) Imposition of Basic Customs Duty on import of solar PV cells & modules: The Government has announced imposition of Basic Customs Duty (BCD) on import of solar PV cells and modules with effect from 01.04.2022.(v) Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for High Efficiency Solar PV Modules: Please see the response to parts (c), (d) & (e) of the question.(vi). Discontinuation of Customs Duty Concessions: MNRE has discontinued issuance of Customs Duty Concession Certificates for import of material /equipment for initial setting up of solar PV power projects with effect from 02.02.2021.*****
