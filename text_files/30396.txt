                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW) (a) to (d) Demands, including that from the Hon’ble Member of Parliament, have been received for provision of stoppage of 19225/26 Jammu Tawi-Jodhpur Express at Mandi Dabwali.
