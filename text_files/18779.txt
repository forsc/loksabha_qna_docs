                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	 The Ministry does not have a scheme called Pradhan Mantri Gram Parivahan Yojana (PMGPY). But the Ministry is implementing Aajeevika Grameen Express Yojana (AGEY), the sub-scheme under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) to facilitate transport facilities in the rural areas and also provide alternative sources of income to members of Self Help Groups (SHGs). The scheme was launched in August, 2017. Till 31st December, 2020, a total of 1375 vehicles are operational across 23 States. AGEY has the following two objectives:- i.	To provide safe, affordable and community monitored rural transport services to connect remote villages with key services and amenities (including access to markets, education and health facilities) for the overall economic development of the area by making use of the support available within the framework of DAY-NRLM.ii.	To provide an alternative source of livelihoods to members of Self Help Groups (SHGs) under DAY-NRLM by facilitating them to operate public transport services in backward rural areas, as identified by the States.(b)	 The scheme is to promote livelihood opportunities for the SHG members who are involved in operating the vehicles. The details of the employment generated as result of improvement in Public Transport System is not part of the monitoring framework of the programme. (c)	There is no separate budgetary allocation under AGEY. Under the programme, the Community Investment Fund (CIF) provided to Community Based Organisations (CBOs) under the existing provisions of DAY-NRLM are utilised for providing interest free loans to the SHG members. The estimated total expenditure for the scheme is Rs. 127.50 crores .*****
