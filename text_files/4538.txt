ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) and (b) Yes, Sir. The Government, vide G.S.R. 889(E), dated 16.09.2016 has mandated mass emission standard Bharat Stage-VI (BS-VI) throughout the country for new vehicles manufactured from April 1, 2020. This has been notified after consultation with all stakeholders.(c) to (f) Yes, Sir. The Ministry agrees for the exemption being sought. Exemption has been sought from the new stringent vehicular emission norms which are set to take effect from April 1, 2020 with the reasons that the vehicles involved with the forces operate in remote and inhospitable terrains with most challenging operational and environmental conditions and that due to security challenges and specialized operations required for such operations and that the development of suitable engine would require considerable time. Further, it is difficult to maintain ideal transportation and storage conditions of fuel. The Government, vide G.S.R. 485(E) dated 19.05.2017 has exempted motor vehicle used for Government purposes relating to the defence of the country from BS- IV norms and the Government, vide G.S.R. 871(E) dated 13.09.2018 has exempted special purpose vehicles (armoured and other specialised vehicles) used for operational purposes for maintenance of law and order and internal security from BS-IV norms, for a period up to 31st December, 2019.*******
