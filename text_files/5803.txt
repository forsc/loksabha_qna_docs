ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b) Water being a State subject, measures for management of water resource are primarily undertaken by respective State Governments. Government of India supplements the efforts of State Governments by providing technical and financial assistance through various schemes such as National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP). The status of drinking water coverage in the region of Thiruvannamalai is at Annexure I.           Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) periodically assesses dynamic ground water resources of the country. As per the 2017 assessment, the total annual ground water recharge is 1.1 Billion Cubic Meter (BCM) and the annual extractable ground water resource is 1 BCM in Thiruvannamalai district of Tamil Nadu. The annual ground water extraction for all uses (irrigation, industrial and domestic uses) is 1.1 BCM. As per CGWB, the depth of ground water level in Thiruvannamalai district ranged between 2 and 20 metres below ground level (m bgl) during the pre-monsoon period of 2019.  Further, the decline in ground water levels is mostly in the range of 0-2m as compared with decadal average (2009-2018).(c)      As per National Register of Large Dam  NRLD (2019) gross water storage capacity and height (above lowest foundation) of Sathanur dam is 229.37 Million Cubic Meter (MCM) and 44.81 m respectively. (d) to (f)    De-siltation of dams to increase its storage capacity is primarily the responsibility of dam owners who are generally State Governments or Central/ State PSUs. Usually de-silting of large dams is not techno-economically feasible. However, de-siltation work has been taken up under World Bank assisted Dam Rehabilitation & Improvement Project (DRIP) on a limited scale by Tamil Nadu for two dams viz. Kundahapalam and Papanasm.***** Annexure-IAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) & (b) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 5323 to be answered in Lok sabha on 25.07.2019 regarding “Water Stress in Tiruvannamalai”Status of drinking water coverage in the region of ThiruvannamalaiS No.	Block	Total number of Habitations	Number of Fully covered Habitations	Number of Partially covered Habitations	Number of Quality Affected Habitations1.
