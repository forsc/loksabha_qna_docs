ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) to (f):  Against total stocks of 741.41 LMT (as on 01.06.2019), the total storage capacity available with Food Corporation of India (FCI), Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and the State Agencies (both owned and hired capacity), is 862.45 LMT (as on 31.05.2019) comprising 739.76 LMT in covered godowns and 122.69 LMT in Cover and Plinth (CAP) storage. As such, there is sufficient capacity for storage of central pool foodgrains at the national level.  As on 31.05.2019, FCI has total 2068 depots/godowns in India (both owned and hired)..........2/--2-Depending on requirement in specific areas and for modernization of storage facilities, Government implements the following schemes for construction of godowns and silos in the country for central pool stock of foodgrains:i.	Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) Scheme:  Under this Scheme, which was formulated in 2008, storage capacity is created by private parties, Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and State Government Agencies for guaranteed hiring by Food Corporation of India (FCI). A capacity of 142.62 Lakh MT (LMT) has been created as on 31.05.2019.  Under this scheme, no funds are allocated by Government for construction of godowns and full investment is done by the private parties/CWC/State Agencies. ii.	Central Sector Scheme (erstwhile Plan Scheme):  This scheme is implemented in the North Eastern States along with a few other States. Funds are released by the Government to FCI and also directly to the State Governments for construction of godowns. A total capacity of 1,84,175 MT has been completed by FCI and State Governments during the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-17). This scheme has been extended for 3 years from 01.04.2017 to 31.03.2020. A capacity of 49,375 MT has been created by FCI & State Governments from 01.04.2017 to 31.05.2019.iii.	Construction of Steel Silos:  In addition to conventional godowns, Government of India has also approved an action plan for construction of steel silos in the country for a capacity of 100 LMT in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode for modernizing storage infrastructure and improving shelf life of stored foodgrains. Against this, as on 31.05.2019, steel silos of 6.75 LMT capacity have been created.The utilization of storage capacity depends upon the level of procurement, movement of foodgrains etc., which may differ from time to time. In procuring regions, the capacity utilization is maximum at the time of procurement but, subsequently, the stock is moved to deficit regions.  This leads to liquidation of stock and the utilization of capacity also goes down hence, the capacity temporarily becomes surplus at micro level but overall, i.e., at macro level, the capacity with FCI is as per requirement. FCI monitors and assesses the storage capacity periodically and steps are taken to create additional storage capacity if there is a storage gap. FCI also hires godowns through various State Agencies and private sectors in case of requirement.***
