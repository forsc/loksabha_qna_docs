ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b) The Ministry has issued an Office Memorandum dated 17th January 2022 regarding criteria/methodology for rating the State Environment Impact Assessment Authorities (SEIAAs) and the same is being implemented through PARIVESH portal of this Ministry.  (c) to (f)The ranking system is completely based on the existing provisions of EIA Notification 2006 and various guidelines issued by Ministry from time to time. The EIA notification clearly provides time-line for completion of different stages involved in the Environment Clearance process, viz. Scoping (Terms of Reference), Public Consultation and Appraisal.  The notification also makes it mandatory for SEIAA to convey its decision to the applicant within 45 days of the receipt of recommendations from State Level Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC), which, in turn, has been given 60 days’ timefrom receipt of the complete proposal for completing the appraisal of the application. The aforesaid rating system has been introduced to encourage SEIAAs/ SEACs to ensure time bound appraisal of the projects/activities in an efficient manner without compromising on the environmental safeguards, thus providing an efficient, transparent and accountable framework for the stakeholders. ***
