                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) and (b): Government has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21.10.2016 to stimulate regional air connectivity by making it affordable. In the second round of bidding under RCS -UDAN, Airports Authority of India (AAI), the Implementing Agency, awarded the following network to Selected Airline Operator (SAO) for starting air services from Darbhanga in Bihar:1.   Mumbai - Darbhanga - Mumbai2.   Delhi - Darbhanga - Delhi3.   Bengaluru - Darbhanga - Bengaluru;The Selected Airline Operators (SAOs) are obligated to commence RCS flight operations on a RCS-route within a period of six months from the issuance of Letter of Award or within two months from the readiness of airport, whichever is later, unless any extension is granted by the Implementing Agency. The RCS operations from Darbhanga can be commenced once the runway is strengthened to required capacity for operations of aircraft (B-737) as submitted in the bid by the SAO. AAI has taken up the works for strengthening of the runway and construction of terminal building. ;;Purnea is a Defence airport which is under repair, hence not available for bidding under RCS-UDAN currently. No airline has submitted any bid to operate RCS - UDAN flights connecting Bhagalpur, Saharsa and Valmikinagar airports under RCS - UDAN in the earlier rounds of bidding. Bhagalpur, Saharsa and Valmikinagar Airports figure under tentative lists of unserved Airports/Airstrips in the country of RCS - UDAN document of version 4.0. If any valid bid is received under RCS-UDAN, same shall be considered as per scheme document.
