The details of cities that have opted for greenfield development or a combination of models are as following : State	Smart City	ABD ComponentJharkhand	Ranchi	GreenfieldMaharashtra	Aurangabad	GreenfieldGujarat	Rajkot	GreenfieldAndhra Pradesh	Amaravati	GreenfieldMadhya Pradesh	Satna	GreenfieldWest Bengal	New Town Kolkata	Retrofitting + GreenfieldMaharashtra	Nashik	Retrofitting + GreenfieldChhattisgarh	Atal Nagar	Redevelopment + Greenfield                                             *****
