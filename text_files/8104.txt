ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Urban Planning including Town Planning is a State subject. Government of Maharashtra has intimated that there are 28 buildings constructed by CIDCO which are declared as old and dilapidated buildings, under the	provisions of Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act, 1949, within the jurisdiction of Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation.(b)	The State Government vide Notification dated 04.02.2015, has modified Regulation 46 (3) of Development Control Regulations for Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation, which provides for permission to re-develop these buildings with increased FSI, constructed by CIDCO. The policy offers the following 2 options:(i)	Re-development	by the Co-operative Housing Societies/ Association or Lessees of CIDCO.(ii)	Re-development by CIDCO directly or jointly with the Cooperative Housing Societies/Association or Lessees	 of   CIDCO.(c)	For buildings constructed by CIDCO prior to 1991, CIDCO has formed Apartment Owners Associations (AoA) and registered them under the Maharashtra Apartment Ownership Act 1970. Also, lease of the land is executed with the AoAs. As the ownership rights are already granted, deemed conveyance is not required.  	In case of private developers, if conveyance deed is not executed by the developer, the Apartment owners can approach Joint Registrar Cooperative Housing Societies, for grant of deemed conveyance deed.(d)  Yes Sir. The State Government vide Notification dated 04.02.20I5, has approved policy for CIDCO constructed dilapidated buildings, for grant of increased FSI ranging from 1.80 to 2.50 depending upon the plot size and width of access roads.                                         *****
