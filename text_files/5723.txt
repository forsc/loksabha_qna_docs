ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (e): A Statement is laid on the table of the House.STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 474, REGARDING "IMPACT OF CLOSURE OF JET AIRWAYS" TO BE ANSWERED ON 25.07.2019; (a): Due to suspension of operation by M/s Jet Airways (India) Limited, there was a reduction in capacity in the domestic sectors for some time. However, to mitigate the impact of reduction in capacity, the domestic slots vacated by Jet Airways, starting from April 2019 have been allocated on ad-hoc basis to other Indian carriers. Subsequently, some of the domestic airlines started inducting more aircraft in their fleet which resulted in capacity increase on the domestic sectors.; ; (b) to (d): As per Summer Schedule (SS) - 2019, following scheduled domestic airline is operating to/from Jodhpur Airport. Airline			                Sector				                             Frequency per week Air India		           Delhi - Jodhpur & vice-versa				         07 			                        Mumbai - Jodhpur & vice-versa			       07; ; However, due to resource constraints, Air India has curtailed two flights per week on Delhi - Jodhpur - Delhi sector from 29 July, 2019 to 13 August, 2019. Also, Air India has withdrawn three flights per week on Mumbai - Jodhpur - Mumbai sector from 1 July, 2019 to 6 August, 2019 and from 17 August, 2019 to 15 September, 2019, due to Haj operations. ; Further, with repeal of the Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation was deregulated. Airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type, free to select whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate. Government has however laid down Route Dispersal Guidelines (RDGs) with a view to achieve better air transport services to different regions of the country. It is, therefore, up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability in the country subject to compliance with RDGs.;  (e): In the 3rd round of bidding under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik), tourism routes suggested by Ministry of Tourism were offered for bidding. Under the Tourism UDAN, Airports Authority of India (AAI) - the Implementing Agency awarded tourism routes for Jodhpur - Udaipur and vice-versa. Further, Ministry of Civil Aviation organizes meetings from time to time with Airlines to discuss issues related to Aviation sector including air connectivity across the country and sensitize the airlines to explore operationalization of new routes as requested by various quarters, including tourism routes.
