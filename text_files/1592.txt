                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a):	The Plantations Labour (PL) Act, 1951 regulates the conditions of work in plantations and provide for the welfare of plantation labour.  The Act requires the employers to provide the workers with housing, medical facilities, sickness and maternity benefits and other forms of social security measures.  There are provisions for educational facility for the worker’s children, drinking water, conservancy, canteens, crèches and recreational facilities for the benefit of the tea plantation workers and their families in and around the work places in the tea estates. The PL Act is implemented through the concerned State Governments for which separate Rules have been framed by them.Contd..2/-:: 2 ::Apart from these facilities, the Plantation Commodity Boards under their respective schemes during Medium Term Framework period are extending Labour welfare measures to the plantation workers. The programme is aimed at providing financial assistance to the children of workers belonging to SC/ST category engaged in plantation estates to enable them to continue their studies after X class. The assistance is given in the form of scholarships for meritorious students coming out of high school/ pre-degree and those pursuing graduation /post-graduation in any discipline.Moreover, the workers of the tea industry are covered by various industrial and social security legislations like Employees’ Compensation Act, 1923,  Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, Provident Funds & Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, (Assam Tea Plantation Provident Fund, Pension Fund and Deposit Link Insurance Fund Scheme Act 1955 – only for Assam), Payment of Bonus Act, 1965, Maternity Benefit Act, 1961, Payment of Wages Act, 1936, Equal Remuneration Act, 1976, Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, and Industrial Employment (Standing Order) Act, 1946.Besides, the government implements through the Tea Board various welfare activities for tea plantation workers and their dependants in tea estates. The welfare activities undertaken by the Tea Board under the Human Resource Development (HRD) Scheme aim at improving the health and hygiene of workers, education of wards of workers and imparting training to improve skills for growers/workers. (b):	Plantation workers are not covered under ESI Act.  At present, there is no proposal for coverage of plantation workers under ESI Act.  However, a Group Personal Accident Insurance Scheme is being implemented by the Tea Board for the benefit of the workers of small tea growers.  Tea workers of organized sector in other states are covered under the Employees’ Deposit-Link Insurance Scheme, 1976 of the Employees’ Provident Funds & Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952.*******
