                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b)	The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component and 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). The details of above river linking projects viz., rivers, States concerned are given at Annexure.Under the NPP, four priority links have also been identified for preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) under the Peninsular Rivers Component viz; Ken-Betwa link project (KBLP), Damanganga-Pinjal link project, Par-Tapi-Narmada link project and Godavari-Cauvery link project.The stage of implementation of a project would be reached after its DPR is prepared with the consensus of concerned States and the requisite statutory clearances are obtained. The estimated time for implementation will depend upon the construction schedule as per DPR.(c) to (e)	Due to the vagaries in monsoon rainfall, some parts of the country face flood whereas other parts face drought. The interlinking of rivers project envisages diversion of waters from surplus basins to deficit basins through inter basin water transfer links. The interlinking of rivers project will provide benefits to irrigation, domestic and industrial needs, hydropower apart from the incidental benefits of flood control, drought mitigation, navigation, water supply, fisheries, salinity and pollution control etc. The interlinking of rivers projects has been considered by Government on high priority and has been taken up in consultative manner.***** ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) & (b) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.†3068 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 11.07.2019 REGARDING “STATUS OF RIVER INTER-LINKING”.Names of Inter Basin Water Transfer Links, the States involved, name of rivers and status of Feasibility Reports/Detailed Project ReportSl.
