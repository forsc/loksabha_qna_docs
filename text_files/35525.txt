ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) As per the information received from the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department, four children were killed in separate incidences in Bahraich district adjoining forest of Motipur range in Katerniaghat Wildlife Division.  (b) The following are the important steps taken by the State Forest Department to mitigate the negative interface related incidences:(i)	Identification and capture of animal involved in such incidences in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) of the National Tiger Conservation Authority;(ii)	Organizing frequent awareness drives and workshops in vulnerable villages, designating willing villagers as tiger friends, pursuing with villagers to adopt alternative cropping pattern in order to minimize hiding places in vicinity of villages;(iii)	Installation of solar lights in areas prone to such incidences.(c)	 Fencing is not advisable in ‘in-situ’ conservation as these physical structures could bar the natural genetic exchange between different wild species and this could threaten to their long term survival and could also prove to be detrimental to tiger and wildlife conservation. Besides, fencing of Tiger Reserves and corridors will create artificial barrier to the source-sink and meta-population dynamics of the tiger which will adversely affect their survival. However, selective fencing has been done in the past in extremely vulnerable area. (d) The Government of Uttar Pradesh has declared human wildlife conflict as natural disaster vide 393/1-11-2018-4(G)/2016 dated 17.10.2018, which provides for payment of an ex-gratia amount of Rs. 5.00 lakhs to the next of kin of the deceased person.   (e) As informed by the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department, nine persons were killed in attacks relating to Leopard, Elephant and Tiger during 2021-2022 in  different parts of Katerniaghat Wildlife Division, Bahraich.*****
