                                                                               THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE                 MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                        (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a)	& (b) : Yes Sir, Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on 28.02.2022 for a loop corridor in the Central Vista. DMRC will be responsible for planning and execution of System works of Underground Metro in the Redevelopment of Central Vista, New Delhi including civil finishing works of platform (excluding basic civil structure) for and on behalf of CPWD. This will not result in increase of the expected cost of the Central Vista project as the Metro connectivity is a part of the overall Master Plan for development / redevelopment of Central Vista. (c):  All applicable norms prescribed by Central Pollution Control Board are being followed in the works related to development / redevelopment of Central Vista.(d): 	 No such communication dated 09.03.2022 has been received. (e): 	Department of Justice has received a proposal from Chief Justice of India for setting up of National Judicial Infrastructure Authority of India (NJIAI) for arrangement of adequate infrastructure for courts, as per which there will be a Governing Body with Chief Justice of India as Patron-in-Chief. The other salient features of the proposal are that NJIAI will act as a Central body in laying down the road map for planning, creation, development, maintenance and management of functional infrastructure for the Indian Court System, besides identical structures under all the High Courts.(f):	The primary responsibility of development of infrastructure facilities for judiciary rests with the State Governments. However, to augment the resources of the State Governments, the Union Government has been implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for Development of Infrastructure Facilities  for Judiciary in District and Subordinate courts only by providing financial assistance to State Governments / Union Territories in the prescribed fund sharing pattern. Presently, the fund sharing pattern of the Scheme is 90:10 (Centre : State) for the 8 North-Eastern and 2 Himalayan States (Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh) and 60 : 40 for the remaining States. This Scheme does not cover Supreme Court and High Courts. Since, inception of the Scheme in 1993-94, the Central Government has released total funds amounting to ? 8758.70 Cr under the Scheme to States/ UTs, out of which ? 5314.39 Cr has been released since 2014-15, which is around 60.68 % of the total release under the Scheme.                                     ******
