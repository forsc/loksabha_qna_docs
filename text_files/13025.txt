ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d) The Ministry of Rural Development has a Memorandum of Understanding with National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Indian Space Research Organization, Hyderabad and Centre for Geo-informatics Application in Rural Development (CGARD), National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj, Hyderabad to use remote sensing technology to monitor the length and alignment of the roads constructed under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)-I using satellite imagery. The project is on-going at present. The National Rural Infrastructure Development Agency (NRIDA) through Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) has developed Geospatial Rural Road Information System (GRRIS) website to host Geographic Information System (GIS) data and 27 States data is currently available on http://www.pmgsy-grris.nic.in/. NRIDA has signed an agreement with C-DAC to upgrade existing GRRIS website to further help the States in digitizing their rural road plans on GIS and update them on continuous basis.  For phase-III of PMGSY, the Programme Implementation Units (PIUs) are required to do a survey of rural facilities through Geo-PMGSY android application. The app is used to take geo-tagged and time stamped pictures of facilities targeted by PMGSY-III. Further, NRIDA has developed Trace Maps tool to identify common routes used by habitations to access their nearest schools, hospitals and markets. This algorithm is used as a suggestive planning tool in PMGSY-III. As per the programme guidelines, the PMGSY shall cover only the rural areas. Even in the rural areas, PMGSY covers only the Rural Roads i.e., Roads that were formerly classified as ‘Other District Roads’ (ODR) and ‘Village Roads’ (VR). No road therefore has been sanctioned in Delhi/NCR under the PMGSY and as such, the question of  their Geo-spatial monitoring does not arise. ******
