                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a)  Presently, there is no proposal to set up a Spice Park in the State of Odisha. However, eligible entities including State Government owned agencies, may apply for technical assistance from the Spices Board and infrastructure support under available schemes of Government of India for this purpose.(b) The mandate for production, research, development, post-harvest treatment and domestic marketing of spices is vested in the Union Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, which provides financial assistance to grow horticulture crops, including spices, through various development programmes under the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH). The Directorate of Arecanut and Spices Development (DASD) also implements certain components like production of quality planting materials of high yielding and export oriented varieties of spices, accreditation of spice nurseries, technology dissemination through frontline demonstration, National /State /District Level Seminars/Workshops and Farmers training programmes through Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT), Bhubaneswar.The Spices Board undertakes various activities related to export promotion and quality control of spices exported from India. In order to provide the extension support for the development & export promotion of Spices and coordinating various activities in the State, Spices Board has established its office at Koraput, Odisha. The Board organized Buyer Seller Meets (BSMs) to promote export of Turmeric from Odisha, particularly from Khandamal & Koraput districts. Through the BSMs, more than 100 sellers/producers representing Farmers Producer Organizations, progressive farmers, farmer’s societies, processors & traders and around 50 buyers from Odisha, were benefitted by establishing direct market linkages. Further, Spices Board is coordinating with the State Nodal Agency, APICOL (Government of Odisha) for implementation of the Agriculture Export Policy for development of Spices clusters in the State.*****
