ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)    Government is implementing a placement linked skill development programme, Deendayal Upadhyaya-Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), for rural poor youth under National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) all over the country including the State of Maharashtra.DDU-GKY is being implemented by 877 PIAs operating 2369 Training centres across the country. Under DDU-GKY, a total of 11.23 lakh candidates have been trained [since its inception (September, 2014) till November, 2021] while 7.13 Lakh candidates have been placed.  The State-wise number of candidates trained and placed since 2014-15 till November, 2021 is given at Annexure.(b)   Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) provides long-term support to the community by associating them with the Self Help Groups (SHGs) and their federations which support them in diversifying their livelihoods, improving their incomes and quality of life. While doing so, DAY-NRLM ensures adequate coverage of vulnerable sections of the society such as people belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, minority groups and persons with disability etc. Mobilizing all such vulnerable sections in the community and ensuring their sustainable livelihoods is a challenge. To address these challenges, DAY-NRLM provides for special projects under Innovation Fund. Further, Vulnerability Reduction Fund (VRF) has also been provisioned to meet the specific needs of the vulnerable communities in the rural areas.In the State of Maharashtra, major challenges for effective programme implementation are frequent transfer of Chief Executive Officer (CEO), State Rural Livelihoods Mission, delay in release of funds from State treasury and the lack of sufficient manpower, i.e., only 66% staff are in place to provide hand-holding support to the community. These matters are being regularly reviewed with State government through various review meetings including Performance Review Committee (PRC) meetings of this Ministry. (c) & (d) National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET) is an overarching skills regulatory body which regulates the functioning of entities engaged in vocational education & Training and establish minimum standards for the functioning of such entities. There are no such separate goals set by (NCVET) under DDUGKY. The Action Plan targets for DDUGKY are approved by the Empowered Committee of NRLM.*****
