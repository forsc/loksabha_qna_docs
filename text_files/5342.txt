ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	  The Union Budget for 2018-19 had announced the pre-determined principle to keep minimum support prices (MSP) at a level of atleast one and half times of the cost of production. Accordingly, Government had increased MSPs for all mandated crops with a return of    atleast 50 percent over all India weighted average cost of production for the season 2018-19. Government has recently increased the MSPs for all kharif crops for 2019-20 season in line with the principle of providing 50 percent return over all India weighted average cost of production. Higher MSPs will ensure higher income/return to the farmers. Details of MSP, cost and percent return over cost for kharif crops from 2017-18 to 2019-20 is given in Annexure I.(c) to (e):	 Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices  (CACP) is an expert body tasked to recommend MSPs after a broad consultative process taking into consideration a host of factors like cost of production, overall demand-supply situation of various crops in domestic and world markets, domestic and international prices, inter-crop price parity, terms of trade between agricultural and non-agricultural sector and likely effect of price policy on rest of the economy .Cost of production is one of the important factors in the determination of MSPs. While recommending   its Price policy, the CACP considers all costs in a comprehensive manner. The Contd..2/--2-estimates of cost of cultivation/cost of production are made available to the Commission through the Comprehensive Scheme for Studying the Cost of Cultivation of Principal Crops(CS Scheme), operated by Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India. Under the Scheme, field data is collected for 25 mandated crops based on the Cost Accounting Method through 16 implementing agencies (Agricultural Universities/ General Universities/Colleges) from sample holdings/farmers spread over 20 states. The sampling design of the scheme is a three stage stratified random sampling design with tehsil as the first stage unit, village/cluster of villages as the second unit and operational holdings as the third and ultimate stage unit. Details of agencies implementing CS Scheme State-wise is given in Annexure II.
