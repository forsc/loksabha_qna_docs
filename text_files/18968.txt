ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS [SHRI V MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)	 No foreign government has given support to agitation of Indian farmers against three bills passed by Indian Parliament. In Canada, UK, USA, and in few European countries, protests by a few motivated PIO’s on issues related to the Indian Farm Bill have been reported. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau made a comment on issues related to farmers in India. (c) & (d)	 We have taken up this matter with the Canadian authorities both in Ottawa and New Delhi and conveyed that such comments pertaining to the internal affairs of the India are unwarranted, unacceptable and would damage India-Canada bilateral relations. Government of Canada has welcomed the Government of India’s commitment to ongoing dialogue with the farmers to discuss issues of concern. ***
