ANSWER




MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D. V. SADANANDA GOWDA)                               (a)   Under Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP), dedicated retail outlets known as Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras (PMBJKs) are opened to make available for sale quality generic medicines at very affordable prices. The initial target was to open 3000 PMBJKs by end of financial year 2017-18. This target was achieved in December, 2017. The revised target of 5000 PMBJKs was also achieved in February, 2019. (b) & (c) Opening of PMBJKs in a particular Block or a Gram Panchayat depends on receipt of applications from interested entrepreneurs and availability of pharmacists in that location. The three-year plan of PMBJP made in Standing Finance Committee (SFC) Note envisaged that 1000 PMBJKs will be opened in each financial year. i.e. 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20. The targets for opening 1000 PMBJKs during 2017-18, 2018-19 have already been achieved by the Government. This Scheme is approved upto March, 2020. The budget allocation for PMBJP for the financial year 2019-20 is Rs. 41.99 crores. As on 28.06.2019, 248 new PMBJKs have been opened in the financial year 2019-2020. The endeavour of the Government is to open new PMBJKs in  henceforth unserved geographical locations. *****
