ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL)(a) to (c)Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) has developed the eGramSwaraj portal (eGS) (https://egramswaraj.gov.in), which aims to bring in transparency the planning, progress reporting, financial management and details of assets created in Panchayati Raj Institutions(PRIs). Further, Ministry has also integrated e-Gram SWARAJ with Public Financial Management System for Gram Panchayats to make real time payments to vendors/service providers. So far, 2.62 Lakh GPDPs have been uploaded on eGS for the year 2021-22.  Further, Panchayats have adopted the mechanism to make payments to vendors through Public Financial Management system.Further, for ensuring timely audit of Panchayat accounts, MoPR has devised an online application – AuditOnline (https://auditonline.gov.in).  This application not only facilitates auditing of Panchayat accounts but also provides for maintaining audit records. This application streamlines the process for creating audit inquiries, draft local audit reports, draft audit-paras etc. Thus, proper maintenance of accounts by Panchayats is ensured, improving transparency and accountability. Panchayat is a State subject mandated at Part IX and List II (State List) of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India and as such probe into corruption cases relating to corrupt and illegal practices of the panchayat representatives and officials are the responsibility of the concerned State government.***
