                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a)	Rajasthan has 4 Passport Seva Kendras (PSK) and 24 Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSK). The list of PSKs and POPSKs is placed at Annexure I. (b) & (c)	The opening of Passport Kendras in various States, including in Rajasthan has been an on-going activity and depends on various factors, including distance from the existing Passport Kendras and volume of applications from a particular region. The Ministry in association with the Department of Posts decided in January 2017 to open Passport Kendras at the Head Post Offices (HPO)/ Post Offices (PO) in the country called ‘POPSK’ in every Lok Sabha Constituency, where there is no PSK, to ensure that there is at least one PSK or POPSK available in every Lok Sabha Constituency. A POPSK at Sri Ganganagar is functional since 26.02.2018. At present, Government has no proposal to open any Passport Seva Kendra in Rajasthan.(d) 	No separate funds have been sanctioned for setting up of PSK in Rajasthan. The expenditure on opening of Passport Seva Kendra is met out of sanctioned budget allocation of Passport Seva Programme.   (e) 	Does not arise. (f) 	There are 25 Lok Sabha Constituencies in Rajasthan. In Rajasthan, there is one Passport Office at Jaipur. It has four Passport Seva Kendras (PSK) at Jaipur, Jodhpur, Sikar and Udaipur. There are also 24 Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs) functional in Rajasthan. As such, the passport services are available in all the Lok Sabha Constituencies of Rajasthan.***
