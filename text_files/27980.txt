ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) 	Under the Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM), there is no provision for States/UT-wise / year-wise allocation of funds.  However, the funds are being released based on fulfillment of certain progress achieved as defined in the guidelines of the Mission.  The details of funds released & percentage of fund utilized, State-wise, including to the State of Andhra Pradesh, District-wise, under the Mission are annexed at Annexure-I and Annexure-II respectively. Regarding Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), the Central share of funds for implementation of PMGSY is released by the Ministry to the Sates /UTs.   Further release of funds to the Programme Implementation Units (PIUs) at the district level is done by the respective States depending on the projects sanctioned to the district and their expenditure plan. The details of central share of funds released to the States/UTs and funds utilized, including State share, by the States/UTs since 2019-20 till date, State/UT-wise, are annexed at Annexure-III. The details of utilization of funds for implementation of the scheme in the State of Andhra Pradesh, district-wise, are annexed at Annexure–IV.  (b) & (c) The details of works started since 2019 under SPMRM in the State of Andhra Pradesh is annexed as Annexure-V.  There is no delay in execution of works except for administrative reasons such as tender procedures, and on account of revision as well as approval of DPR by the State.   However, the execution of works has been affected due to covid-19 pandemic during the year 2020. Regarding PMGSY, as per the programme guidelines, the tendering and execution of works under the scheme is the responsibility of the State Government concerned. As reported by the State of Andhra Pradesh, out of 378 road works of 3,022.32 Km and 9 bridges planned for execution since 2019-20, 351 road works measuring 2,770.21 km have started since 2019-20 under various interventions/verticals of PMGSY and are progressing as per the time lines. The district-wise details of projects started under PMGSY since 2019-20, as reported by the State, are given in Annexure-VI.  The start of 27 road works of 252.12 km and 5 bridges have delayed due to pending forest clearance and non-responsive tenders. Rest 4 bridges have been sanctioned on 25th June, 2021. The district-wise details of road and bridge works not started are given in Annexure-VII.(d)    Regarding the payments of bills under SPMRM delayed by the Government of Andhra Pradesh, Ministry introduced Rurban-PFMS integration for real-time tracking of the payments, and the State was requested to keep the funds in the State Nodal Account opened under SPMRM. However, the funds of the Mission are kept by the State Government in the State Treasury instead the State Nodal Account which causes the delay in making the payment through Rurbansoft-PFMS integration. The State Government of Andhra Pradesh has reported the delay for payment of bills under SPMRM which is detailed at Annexure-VIII.   Regarding the delay in releasing State share by the Government of Andhra Pradesh, there has been no delay in releasing State share under SPMRM by the State Government of Andhra Pradesh since 2019.  Regarding the PMGSY, this is to mention that payment of bills is done by the State nodal agencies/ PIUs.   The State of Andhra Pradesh has reported that there were no delays in payment of bills.  As regards release of State share, as per the programme guidelines, the State Government is required to transfer the central share of funds along with the corresponding state share to the Nodal Agency Account within a maximum period of 15 days from the date of receipt of funds. A sum of Rs. 426.47 crore was released to the State in 2019-20 as programme fund and Rs. 15.94 crore in 2020-21.  Of these, Rs. 98.93 crore central share and state share of Rs. 212.20 crore are still pending for release to the State Nodal Agencies by the Government of Andhra Pradesh as on date.  Funds (both central and state shares), which have been released by the State, have been released with considerable delay as per the details given in Annexure-IX.*******
