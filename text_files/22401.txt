MINISTER OF LAW & JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) to (c): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. †*303 FOR ANSWER ON 17.03.2021 REGARDING ‘SHORTAGE OF JUDGES’.(a) & (b):A Statement showing the sanctioned strength, working strength, vacancies and appointment of Judges made in Supreme Court and High Courts during the last three years i.e. 2018-2020 is at Annexure I. As per the Constitutional framework, the appointments of Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts are made under Articles 124, 217, and 224 of the Constitution of India respectively. Judges of the Supreme Court of India and High Courts are appointed as per the procedure laid down in the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) prepared in 1998 pursuant to the Supreme Court judgment of October 6, 1993 (Second Judges case) read with their Advisory Opinion of October 28,1998 (Third Judges case). As per MoP, initiation of proposal for appointment of Judges in the Supreme Court vests with the Chief Justice of India while the same for Judges in the High Courts vests with the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court. Therefore, the filling up of vacancies in the High Courts is a collaborative and integrated process between the Executive and the Judiciary. It requires consultation and approval from various Constitutional authorities both at the Centre and State. A Statement showing the sanctioned strength and working strength of Subordinate Judiciary during the last three years i.e. 2018-2020 is at Annexure-II. Under Article 235 of the Constitution of India, the administrative control over the members of district and subordinate judiciary in the States vest with the concerned High Court.  Further, in exercise of powers conferred under proviso to Article 309 read with Articles 233 and 234 of the Constitution, the respective State Government, in consultation with the High Court, frames the Rules and Regulations regarding the issues of appointment, promotion, reservations, etc. of Judicial Officers in the State Judicial Service. Hence, in so far as recruitment of judicial officers in the States is concerned, respective High Courts do it in certain States, whereas the High Courts do it in consultation with the State Public Service Commissions in other States. Central Government has no role in the matter. Recruitment in the Subordinate judiciary is an ongoing and continuous process and each year vacancies are filled either fully or partially.(c):  Vacancies in Subordinate Judiciary are filled up every year in accordance with the time schedule prescribed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in its order dated 04.01.2007 passed in Civil Appeal no. 1867/2006 Malik Mazhar Sultan & Anr. vs. U.P. Public Service Commission. As per this time schedule, the vacancies for the category of District Judge (Entry Level) and Senior Civil Judge are to be notified commencing on 31st March of a calendar year and end by 31st October of the same year. The sanctioned and working strength of Judicial Officers and vacancies in the Subordinate Judiciary in the State of Chhattisgarh as on 28.02.2021 is as follows:-Sanctioned Strength	Working Strength	Vacancy481	387	94************ANNEXURE-I STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) & (b) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. †*303 FOR ANSWER ON 17.03.2021 REGARDING SANCTIONED STRENGTH, WORKING STRENGTH, VACANCIES AS ON 11.03.2021 AND APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES MADE IN SUPREME COURT AND HIGH COURTS DURING THE LAST THREE YEARS i.e. 2018-2020.
