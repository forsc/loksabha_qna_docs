                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) to (d)	 A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT TO BE LAID ON THE TABLE OF LOK SABHA IN RESPECT OF PARTS (a) to (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *235  FOR 4TH DECEMBER, 2019  ON “USE OF LANDLINE TELEPHONES”.(a) & (b)	Yes, Sir. With the increase in coverage of mobile networks, availability of affordable handsets and low mobile tariff, there has been a decrease in use of landline phones over the years. The details for the last four years are as follows:<pre>S.No.	Date	Wireline Subscribers(in Millions)1.	31.03.2016	25.222.	31.03.2017	24.403.	31.03.2018	22.814.	31.03.2019	21.70</pre>(c) & (d)	As per existing tariff framework, fixing of phone tariffs by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is under forbearance. Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) have a flexibility to design and offer tariff as per prevalent market conditions, subject to the condition that these tariffs have to be consistent with the regulatory framework and regulatory principles. TRAI has, however, reduced the termination charges for local and national long distance calls for wireline services to zero paisa per minute.************
