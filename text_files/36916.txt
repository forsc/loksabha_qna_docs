ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d)	Ministry of Skill development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) in co-ordination with Ministry of Education has launched the Skill Hubs Initiative (SHI) as a pilot on 01.01.2022 under central component of PMKVY 3.0. SHI aims at creating shared infrastructure, aligning with the needs of the local economy and addressing the needs of all target segments for vocational training. It focuses on introduction of skill training programme in the education ecosystem as envisioned in the National Education Policy, 2020 (NEP, 2020).  Skill Hubs are nodal skill centres identified to provide skill development and vocational training opportunities to target population segments from class 6th to 8th (introduction to world-of-work through orientation, industry visits, bag-less days), Class 9th to 12th (aimed at exposing students to skill development avenues), school dropouts, and out-of-education (aimed for academic credit, mainstreaming back to education and or apprenticeship and employment linkages).             The estimated outlay of SHI is Rs. 700 crore. As on 23.03.2022, a total target of around 9.3 lakh students has been earmarked under SHI. Out of which, 1.56 lakh candidates have been enrolled so far. (e) and (f)       SHI is being implemented in the State of Assam. Till 23.03.2022, 22,600 targets have been allocated in State of Assam.
