ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	As per information shared by National Sample Survey (NSS), National Statistics Office (NSO), the Annual Report on Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) (July 2017-June 2018), published by Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, estimates of Unemployment Rate (primary status + secondary status) in India is 5.3% for rural sector and 7.8% in urban sector. (c):	 For generation of employment in rural areas, this Ministry is implementing the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) which provides at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.  It is demand driven wage employment programme. Hence, no targets/milestones are set under the scheme.  As per the information uploaded by the States/UTs in Management Information System (MIS), States/UTs-wise, details of agreed to Labour Budget (Persondays) and Persondays generated during the last three year and current FY 2019-20 (as on 05.12.2019) under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is at Annexure-I. The Ministry of Rural Development is implementing  two welfare schemes in the field of skill development for rural poor youth under the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) to eradicate poverty in the country as follows:-I.	Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) which is a placement linked skill development program for wage employment.II.	Skill development through Rural Self Employment and Training Institutes (RSETIs) enabling a trainee to take bank credit and start his/her own Micro-enterprise. Some of such trainees may also seek regular salaried jobs. Both the above mentioned schemes are aimed at increasing employability of rural poor youths either wage or self and are not primarily concerned with generation of employment. However, both the above mentioned schemes by increasing employability of rural poor youths have led to economic and social development of youths of rural area of the country. The State-wise number of candidates trained and placed in jobs/settled under DDU-GKY and RSETI during the last three years and current year is at Annexure-I.(d):	States/UTs-wise details of central funds released and expenditure (including State share) uploaded by the States/UTs in Management Information System (MIS) during the last three years and the current FY 2019-20 (as on 05.12.2019) under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is given at Annexure-II. Both DDU-GKY and RSETI Schemes are demand driven schemes and funds are allocated to States as per demands against approved Action Plans. The State/UT-wise funds released under DDU-GKY and RSETI during the last three years and current year is at Annexure-II. (e):	The Government is actively engaged with the State Government in establishing systems that ensure provision of work as per demand. To generate awareness about the provisions of the Scheme and to provide adequate employment opportunities to rural households under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS, all States/UTs have been requested to (i) initiate appropriate Information Education and Communication (IEC) campaigns including wall paintings for wide dissemination of the provisions of the Act, (ii) expand scope and coverage of demand registration system to ensure that demand for work under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS does not go unregistered, (iii) prepare plans in a participatory mode and approve them in the Gram Sabha. Under DDU-GKY it is targeted to train 2.5 lakh persons for wage employment and 3.86 persons under RSETI for self-employment during current     FY 2019-20. Further, it is targeted to train 3 lakh persons under DDU-GKY for wage employment and 4.3 lakh persons under RSETI for self-employment during FY 2020-21.
