ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) & (b) All operational fee plazas on National Highways are already equipped with Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) system and are operational on FASTag. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has taken all the required steps to mitigate  issues in the field, such as, creating public awareness through various channels, ensuring easy availability of FASTag, instant recharge facility via various UPI-enabled Apps, etc.  NHAI has mandated the implementation of Application Programming Interface (API)- based transaction processing protocol, for faster & more secure ETC transaction processing. A vendor has been engaged by NHAI for setting up of Toll Monitoring & Control Centers, which have the features of data consolidation, real-time monitoring of fee plazas, thereby serving as repository for all toll collection related data : these will also help in efficient decision making and keeping a close watch on the performance of fee plazas for preparing various Management Information System (MIS) reports. Further, technology upgradation is a continuous process and NHAI is resorting to it, as per requirements.(c) Currently, the section of Thuravoor to Kazhakoottam on NH-66, Walayar to Vadkancherry to Thrissur to Edapally section of NH-544 and ICTT to Valarpadam section of NH-966(A) in the State of Kerala are being maintained through Kerala Public Works Department (PWD), Build Operate & Transfer (BOT) (Toll) concessionaire and Operation & Maintenance (O&M) contractor, respectively. Also, 11 Maintenance & Repair works through State agencies on National Highways in the State of Kerala were sanctioned in the Annual Renewal Plan 2019-20.(d) Maintenance is a continuous process and is being done in a time bound manner, as per the terms of the respective Concession/Contract Agreement.*****
