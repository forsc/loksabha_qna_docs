ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (e):	Detection, detention and deportation of illegally staying foreign nationals, including Bangladeshi nationals, is a continuous process.  The powers of Central Government to detect, detain and deport illegal immigrants under Section 3(2)(c) and 3(2)(e) of the Foreigners Act,1946,  have also been entrusted under Article 258(1) of the Constitution of India to State Governments.  Further, under Article 239 (1) -2-L.S.US.Q.NO.3831 FOR 16.07.2019of the Constitution of India, the Administrators of the Union Territories have also been directed to discharge the functions of the Central Government pertaining to detection, detention and deportation of illegally staying foreign nationals.	Ministry of Home Affairs has issued instructions to State Governments/Union Territories advising them to ensure that no Aadhaar Card is issued to illegal migrants.   State Governments have further been advised to cancel any identification documents fraudulently obtained by illegal migrants viz. voter card, driving license, ration card etc. Since the illegal immigrants enter into the country without valid travel documents in a clandestine and surreptitious manner, accurate data regarding number of such immigrants living in the country is not available. ******
