                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a):  Yes sir. So far, the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan for nation-wide portability National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013 ration cards is enabled in 33 States/UTs, covering almost 86.7% NFSA population (about 69 Crore NFSA beneficiaries) in the country. Delhi being the latest to enable the same from July 2021. Further, regular follow up has been done with 3 remaining States/UT of Assam, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal to enable the ONORC plan for the benefit of migrant NFSA beneficiaries..........2/--2-(b): 	The implementation of ONORC plan is a key component of a Central Sector Scheme on Integrated Management of Public Distribution System (IM-PDS) having a total outlay of Rs. 127.3 Crore for implementation in all States/UTs. So far, the Department has released a total fund of Rs. 63.88 Crore to States/UTs and NIC/NICSI under the scheme. (c): 	Under ONORC, the Department has launched a very simple to use ‘Mera Ration’ mobile application for the benefit of all beneficiaries, including migrant NFSA beneficiaries. Through this application, beneficiaries can easily access useful information and services by just entering their ration card number or Aadhaar number. Similarly, beneficiaries can share either ration card number or Aadhaar number at any ePoS enabled FPS to easily lift their foodgrains under ONROC. (d): 	All ration card holders under National Food Security Act (NFSA) can equally take the benefit of portability under ONORC. State/UT-wise number of NFSA ration cards under ONORC in 33 States/UTs at present is shown at Annexure.(e): 	Under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) ration cards are issued by respective State/UT Governments, and the technology and Aadhaar driven ONORC plan is ensuring the uniqueness of ration cards. *** ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (d) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.1245 FOR ANSWER ON 27.07.2021 IN THE LOK SABHA.State/UT wise numbers of NFSA ration cards covered under ONROC: Sl.
