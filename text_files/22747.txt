ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (d)  Floods are natural calamity that the country faces almost every year, in varying degrees of magnitude. The occurrence floods can be attributed to various factors, including wide variations in rainfall both in time and space with frequent departures from the normal pattern, inadequate carrying capacities of rivers, river bank erosion and silting of river beds, landslides, poor natural drainage in flood prone areas, snowmelt and glacial lake out-bursts.Flood management schemes are formulated and implemented by concerned State Governments as per their priority. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and also promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. Main reason for floods in the State of Bihar is on account of increased discharge in rivers of North Bihar like Gandak, Burhi Gandak and Bagmati, Kamla, Kosi and Mahananda due to heavy rainfall in the upper catchment areas which mainly lie in Nepal.  The management of floods due to these rivers has been a concern. The related issues are discussed in the existing Indo-Nepal bilateral three tier mechanisms comprising of (i) Joint Ministerial Level Commission on Water Resources (JMCWR) (ii) Joint Committee on Water Resources (JCWR) and (iii) Joint Standing Technical Committee (JSTC). Government of India is having regular dialogue with the Government of Nepal for construction of dams on these rivers for mutual benefit of the two countries which includes flood control. In this regard, major projects taken up with Nepal are detailed below:Contd…P/2//2//•	A "Treaty concerning the Integrated Development of the Mahakali River, including Sarada Barrage, Tanakpur Barrage and Pancheshwar Project" was signed during the visit of the then Nepalese Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to India in February 1996. Under this Treaty, India and Nepal have agreed to implement the Pancheshwar Multi-purpose Project as an integrated project. •	Saptakoshi High Dam Multipurpose Project and Sunkoshi Storage-cum-Diversion Scheme: A Joint Project Office (JPO-SKSKI) was constituted in 2003 with the mandate to prepare the Detailed Project Report (DPR) for the project. The JPO-SKSKI is functional since 2004.•	Irrigation and flood management in Kosi river basin is governed by India-Nepal Agreement on Kosi Project signed in 1954 and amended in 1966.•	All the jointly identified river training works in Kamala and Bagmati rivers have been completed with Indian grant assistance.*****
