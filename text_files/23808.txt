The vision of NPE 2019 is to position India as a global hub for Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) by encouraging and driving capabilities in the country for developing core components, including chipsets, and creating an enabling environment for the industry to compete globally. To attract and incentivize large investments in the electronics value chain and promote exports, following three Schemes have been notified under the aegis of NPE 2019: (i) Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing notified vide Gazette Notification No.CG-DL-E-01042020-218990 dated April 01, 2020 provides an incentive of 4% to 6% to eligible companies on incremental sales (over base year) involved in mobile phone manufacturing and manufacturing of specified electronic components, including Assembly, Testing, Marking and Packaging (ATMP) units.  (ii)  Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) notified vide Gazette Notification No.CG-DL-E-01042020-218992 dated April 01, 2020 provides financial incentive of 25% on capital expenditure for the identified list of electronic goods that comprise downstream value chain of electronic products, i.e., electronic components, semiconductor/ display fabrication units, ATMP units, specialized sub-assemblies and capital goods for manufacture of aforesaid goods.  (iii) Modified Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC 2.0) Scheme notified vide Gazette Notification No.CG-DL-E-01042020-218991 dated April 01, 2020 provides support for creation of world class infrastructure along with common facilities and amenities, including Ready Built Factory (RBF) sheds / Plug and Play facilities for attracting major global electronics manufacturers along with their supply chain to set up units in the country. The Scheme shall provide financial assistance for setting up of both EMC projects and Common Facility Centres (CFCs) across the country.  (iv)  Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) for IT Hardware notified vide Gazette Notification No.CG-DL-E-03032021-225613 dated March 03, 2021 provides an incentive of 4% to 2% / 1% on net incremental sales (over base year) of goods manufactured in India and covered under the target segment, to eligible companies, for a period of four (4) years.

Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS): The Scheme was notified on 27th July, 2012 to provide financial incentives to offset disability and attract investments in the electronics manufacturing sector. It was amended in August, 2015 to extend the period of the scheme, enhance scope of the Scheme by including 15 more product verticals, and attract more investment. The scheme was further amended in January, 2017 to expedite the investments. The scheme provides subsidy for capital expenditure - 20% for investments in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and 25% in non-SEZs. The incentives are available for 44 categories / verticals of electronic products and components covering entire electronics manufacturing value chain. The Scheme was open to receive applications till 31.12.2018 and is in the implementation mode.4.    Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC) Scheme: Electronics Manufacturing Clusters Scheme was notified on 22nd October, 2012 to provide support for creation of world-class infrastructure along with common facilities and amenities for attracting investment. Under the Scheme, 20 Greenfield EMCs and 3 Common Facility Centres (CFCs) measuring an area of 3,565 acres with total project cost of INR 3,898 crore including Government Grant-in-Aid of INR 1,577 crore have been approved.5.    Electronics Development Fund (EDF): Electronics Development Fund (EDF) has been set up as a “Fund of Funds” to participate in professionally managed “Daughter Funds” which in turn will provide risk capital to startups and companies developing new technologies in the area of electronics and Information Technology (IT).
