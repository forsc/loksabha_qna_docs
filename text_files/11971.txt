With the launch of Khelo India Scheme, there has been an increased awareness and participation in sports and Indian athletes have earned accolades in sports such as archery, athletics, badminton, boxing, hockey, shooting, wrestling, weightlifting, etc. in international events. (d) Rs. 981.09 crore, Rs. 1229.32 crore, Rs. 1297.38 crore and      Rs. 1583.83 crore have been spent by the Department of Sports in 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 and current financial year 2019-20 upto 31.01.2020 respectively.
