(b) At present, Pathshala is being served by 12 pairs of train services including 15959/15960 Howrah-Dibrugarh Kamrup Express (5 days a week) and 15961/15962 Howrah-Dibrugarh Kamrup Express (Bi- weekly) catering to the needs of Pathshala-Howrah sector. (c) At present, there is no such proposal. (d) Indian Railways do not operate train services on state-wise basis as railway network straddles across State boundaries. However, subject to operational feasibility, availability of rolling stock and track and commercial justification, etc., introduction of train services, including Vande Bharat Express, is an ongoing process.*****
