As per the data compiled by Ministry of Labour and Employment, more than 1.06 crores migrant workers, including those who travelled on foot during the lock-down, returned to their home-state. (b) As per provisional available information 81385 accidents occurred on the roads including National Highways during the period March-June   2020 with 29415  fatalities.

This Ministry had  assisted the movement of migrant labourers walking on foot on the various National Highways all across the Country by providing them food, drinking water, basic medicines and foot wears, etc. They were also provided with the resting places to take rest and assistance in terms of the arrangement of transport with the help of local administration to take them to the places nearest to their destinations. MHA vide orders dated 29th April, 2020 and 01st  May, 2020 allowed movement of migrant workers to their native places by buses and Shramik special trains respectively.*****
