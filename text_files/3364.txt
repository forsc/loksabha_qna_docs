                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) & (b) : 	The Electricity Act, 2003 has entrusted the responsibility of tariff fixation for retail supply tariff on the State/Joint Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERCs/JERCs).  In this regard, the Appropriate Commission notifies the Terms and Conditions of tariff fixation as per provisions and principles contained in Sections 61, 62 and 64 of the Electricity Act, 2003. The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) determines the tariff for Central Government owned companies, companies having inter-state generation of electricity and inter-state transmission of electricity. CERC does not have jurisdiction to determine retail power tariff in respect of consumption of power.  (c) & (d) : 	The Consumer Tariff determination for New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) area falls under the purview of Delhi Electricity Regulatory commission (DERC). The electricity consumers of NDMC area are charged for their consumption at the retail tariff determined by the DERC. As per the information received from DERC and NDMC, there is no case which has been brought to the notice of concerned authorities of consumers being levied more charges than their consumption.***********
