ANSWER




(a)	and  (b):The Government is committed to Open, Safe & Trusted and Accountable internet. The Government has notified the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Codes) Rules, 2021 on 25th February, 2021 to make intermediaries including social media platforms accountable to their users and enhance user safety online. The social media platforms have been mandated to develop a robust grievance redressal system for their users. They are required to publish privacy policy, rules and regulations and terms and conditions. They are also expected to remove any unlawful content as and when brought to their knowledge either through a court order or through a notice by appropriate government or its authorized agency. The Rules also prescribe the additional due diligence to be followed by significant social media intermediaries (SSMI) having 50 lakh or more registered users in India. They are required to have a physical contact address in India and also appoint Chief Compliance Officer, Nodal Contact Person and Grievance Officer resident in India. The SSMIs are also required to publish their monthly compliance on their respective websites / apps.(c):	In case of non-compliance of the above said Rules, rule 7 of these Rules becomes applicable and the intermediaries are liable to lose their exemptions from liability. (d): The Ministry does not maintain such data.  ********
