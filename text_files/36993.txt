MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	to (g):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the HouseSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (g) of LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *399 REGARDING “SDG REPORT, 2021” RAISED BY SMT SANGEETA KUMARI SINGH DEO AND DR. SUKANTA MAZUMDAR DUE FOR ANSWER ON 30.03.2022(a)	Yes Sir, the Covid-19 global pandemic has no doubt imposed several challenges and roadblocks to the achievement of SDGs across the world, including India.  (b)	The challenges faced by India have been across most sectors of SDGs. However, Government of India was determined to safeguard lives and livelihoods and therefore launched the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan and the PM Garib Kalyan Yojna. The Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan is based on the vision of translating immediate COVID-19 related policy measures to bring about transformative changes. The five pillars of economy, infrastructure, systems and technologies, vibrant demography, and demand were identified to steer initiatives for self-reliance. The Prime Minister’s Garib Kalyan Package, announced as early as in March 2020, has been the flagship government effort in the fight against COVID-19 aimed at initiating public works, construction activities and other economic activities on a large scale to meet the livelihood and income requirements of migrant workers and similarly affected rural citizens, with a resource envelope of INR 50,000 crore.(c)	The ranking of countries on SDGs is conducted by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, a non-profit organisation based in the USA, and Bertelsmann Stiftung, a private foundation based in Germany, and not by the United Nations. Thus, the ranking are not official. In the year 2021, India ranked at 120 out of 165 countries. (d)	& (e) According to World Bank January 2021 estimates based on Global Economic Prospects Forecast, Covid19-induced new poor in 2020 was expected to rise between 119 and 124 million. However, June 2021 estimates by the same World Bank group, revised this estimate to 97 million more people being in poverty in the year 2020. This is a reduction of about 20 million people from the January, 2021 estimates.  (Source-- 1. Initial estimate: https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/updated-estimates-impact-covid-19-global-poverty-looking-back-2020-and-outlook-2021 2. Revised estimate: https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/updated-estimates-impact-covid-19-global-poverty-turning-corner-pandemic-2021)(f)	All key stakeholders, including NITI Aayog, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation and Ministries/Departments of Union Government, and all State/UT Governments are committed towards achieving the SDG targets through multi-pronged initiatives, such as capacity building, awareness generation, implementation of Centrally Sponsored Schemes and Central Sector Schemes, and SDG monitoring through the SDG India Indices at various administrative levels.(g)	Government of India has been consistently taking initiatives towards building back better and faster:(i) The Prime Minister’s Garib Kalyan Package, announced in March, 2020 has been the flagship government effort in the fight against COVID-19. The package includes insurance coverage of INR 50 lakhs for health workers, free food grains for 80 crore people, direct beneficiary transfer for 20 crore women, increase in wage rate under the job guarantee programme which benefited 13.6 crore families, financial support to senior citizens, widows, and people with disabilities, and minimum income support to over 8.7 crore farmers.ii) The Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan or Self-Reliant India Movement is based on the vision of translating immediate COVID-19 related policy measures to bring about transformative changes. The five pillars of economy, infrastructure, systems and technologies, vibrant demography, and demand were identified to steer initiatives for self-reliance.iii) With the aim to build back with resilience and focus on climate, India has committed to: achieve the target of net zero emissions by 2070; of meeting 50 percent of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030; reach 500 GW non-fossil energy capacity by 2030; reduce carbon intensity of the economy by 45 per cent by 2030; and reduce total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes from now to 2030. iv) To create a conducive atmosphere for our manufacturing sector to boost post-pandemic recovery and to make companies manufacturing in India an integral part of global supply chains, the Government of India has introduced Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme. The PLI Scheme has been implemented in 14 key sectors including automobiles, pharmaceuticals, food products, mobile manufacturing, drones etc with a total outlay of Rs.1.97 lakh crore (approx. USD 26 billion).v) Government is also implementing a number of targeted programmes for overall balanced development in the country such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM), National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP), Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM), Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY), Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Atal Pension Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Stand-Up India Scheme etc. *****
