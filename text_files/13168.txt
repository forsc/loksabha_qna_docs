(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	 This Ministry has launched an umbrella scheme of ‘Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan’ (PM-AASHA) by incorporating the erstwhile Price Support Scheme (PSS) with certain modifications and rolling out of new schemes of Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) and pilot of Private Procurement and Stockist Scheme (PPSS) in 2018.
