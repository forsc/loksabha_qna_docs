Drudgery reduction of women farmers is an essential element of MKSP and the women SHG members are now operating Custom Hiring Centre and also implementing tool banks comprising of several tools and implements. This initiative to empower women in agriculture has now being successfully scaled up by all the State Rural Livelihoods Missions across the country through their Annual Action Plans (AAP).
