ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c): The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) has been successfully implemented in the rural areas in the country with robust quality control mechanism.  As per PMGSY Programme Guidelines, ensuring the quality of the road works is responsibility of the respective State Governments which are implementing the Programme. The Ministry of Rural Development/ National Rural Infrastructure Development Agency (NRIDA) issue general guidelines on quality control and prescribe Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads to regulate the quality control processes, at work level. There is a very well structured three-tiered Quality Control mechanism for ensuring construction of quality road works and durability of road assets under PMGSY.  Under the first tier, the Programme Implementation Units (PIUs) are required to ensure process control through mandatory tests on material and workmanship at field laboratory.  The second tier is a structured independent quality monitoring at the State level through State Quality Monitors (SQMs) to ensure that every work is inspected at initial stage, middle stage and final stage of the construction.  Under the third tier, independent National Quality Monitors (NQMs) are deployed for random inspection of road works to monitor quality and also to provide guidance of senior professionals to the field functionaries.Whenever, a work is reported deficient by NQMs, on account of both structural and non-structural defects, the PIU ensures that the contractor replaces the material or rectifies the workmanship, as the case may be. The action taken report (ATR), for each such work, is verified on ground by the State Quality Monitors (SQMs). Thereafter, the State Quality Coordinator (SQC) examines the ATR for each such work and furnishes the compliance report regularly through programme Management Information System (MIS)-Online Management, Monitoring and Accounting System (OMMAS). To fast track the compliance on NQM observations, provisions have been made to upload and monitor the action taken report for each work through web based programme. Close monitoring has improved the quality of projects and a consistent decline in overall ‘unsatisfactory’ percentage of completed and ongoing projects has been observed during the last three years, which is evident from the State-wise details at Annexure.***
