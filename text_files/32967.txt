ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a)	The Ministry is primarily responsible for development and maintenance of National Highways(NHs). Tunnels on National Highways are constructed in accordance with guidelines stipulated in IRC:SP:91-2019 (Guidelines for Road Tunnels), which provides for construction of tunnels to avoid passage through snow bound areas, eco sensitive areas, pass below water bodies or congested areas etc. The fundamental objective of road tunnel is to ensure safe transit of the road traffic in difficult terrain. The decision to introduce a tunnel in a road system is taken considering life- cycle cost and overall saving for the traffic using the shortest feasible route.(b)	National Highways Authority of India(NHAI) has proposed construction of a 4.891 km long twin–tube tunnel including ramps on both side faces of the tunnel near Mukundra in the state of Rajasthan on Delhi-Vadodara 8-lane expressway.   (c)	No tunnel has been constructed on NHs in the state of Rajasthan during the last five years. (d) and (e)	Ministry has taken up up-gradation to two lane with paved shoulder of Ajmer-Nagaur section of NH-58 at the sanctioned cost of Rs.255.23 crore, inter-alia including a bypass to Pushkar city. There is no provision of a tunnel in the project.  *****
