KISHAN REDDY)(a to f):	 As per VII Schedule of Constitution of India, ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects. However, the Government of India (GoI) has been implementing National Policy and Action Plan to address Left Wing Extremism (LWE) and supplementing the efforts of States through multi-pronged strategy involving security related measures and development interventions.-2/...-2-LS.US.Q.NO.3826 FOR 17.03.2020To give impetus to the development in the most LWE affected districts, funds are also provided under ‘Special Central Assistance’ (SCA) to fill the critical gaps in public infrastructure and services. List of districts covered under SCA is at Annexure-I. The steps taken by the Government to curb LWE includes deployment of security forces, sanction of India Reserve Battalions/ Special India Reserve Battalions,   strengthening Special Intelligence Branches and Special Forces through “Special Infrastructure Scheme”, establishment of “Fortified Police Stations” (FPS), strengthening security through the scheme “Security Related Expenditure” (SRE), development with major focus on road connectivity and telecommunication.Rs. 71.66 crore each has been released by the GoI for Aurangabad & Gaya districts under SCA during the last three years. In addition to that, Rs. 8.38 crore was released for the State of Bihar under SIS and Rs. 61.62 crore under SRE during the last three years (2017-18 to 2019-20). The funds are not released district-wise in these schemes. Further, 28 FPS have been sanctioned with a cost of Rs. 2.5 crore each for Bihar including 03 in Aurangabad & 04 in Gaya during the last three years.Apart from above, Kendriya Vidyalayas, Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, ITIs, Skill Development Centres have been sanctioned for Gaya and Aurangabad. 1639 kms Roads have been sanctioned under the Road Connectivity Project for LWE Affected Areas (RCPLWEA) for Bihar during the last three years.-3/...-3-LS.US.Q.NO.3826 FOR 17.03.2020The steadfast implementation of the Action Plan, which includes SCA, has resulted in consistent decline in LWE violence and its geographical spread. The incidents of LWE violence have reduced by 70% from all time high of 2258 in 2009 to 670 in 2019. Similarly resultant deaths (Civilians + Security Forces) have reduced by 80% from all time high of 1005 in 2010 to 202 in 2019.
