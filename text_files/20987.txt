                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) & (b): National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has reported that an amount of Rs. 1300 crore has been allocated to the State of Maharashtra for the year 2020-21 under Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF). Out of this allocation, an amount of Rs.1290.06 crore has been sanctioned to the State as on 02.03.2021, which includes projects worthRs. 22.59 crore from Satara district.NABARD does not make district wise allocation and State Government makes prioritisation of projects and poses the same to NABARD for sanction.(c): While project monitoring under RIDF is primarily the responsibility of the implementing Department of the respective State Governments, NABARD also monitors the implementation through Desk Monitoring (off-site) and Field Monitoring (on-site). Further, monitoring is also ensured by NABARD through prescribed returns, periodic reviews, including at the level of High Power Committee under the Chairmanship of Chief Secretary of the State. Social monitoring of projects is ensured through display of boards at project locations.******
