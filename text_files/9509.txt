ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT( SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI )(a)	to (c) Ministry of Women and Child Development  along with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) announced  the Bharatiya Poshan Krishi Kosh (BPKK) in New Delhi on 18th November, 2019. Bhartiya Poshan Krishi Kosh” project has two components – Development of a Food Atlas and Documentation of promising practices for Jan-Andolan for POSHAN Abhiyaan.  The Agro-Food Atlas is to act as a repository of diverse crops across 127 agro-climatic zones of the country  having three parts- crops currently being grown, agro-ecological conditions (soil, organic carbon content, ground water availability etc) and guidance on how a greater diversity of crops could be encouraged in a particular district or block to promote dietary diversity and nutrition. The project includes diverse data sources like National Sample Survey, Agri-Census, Soil Health Cards, ISRO’s Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-Radio meter. The project also documents social, behavioral and cultural practices that promote and reinforce healthy dietary behaviors. Identification of promising practices with the help of a multi-disciplinary group of experts and developments of a tool kit to disseminate best strategies for Social and Behavioural Change Communication, specific to population groups in those regions is also a part of it.  (d)	As per information received, there is no proposal for preparing a framework for a national plan for States and UTs for better implementation of all the Central and State policies. However, a “Technical Support Unit” has been  set-up under NITI Aayog which undertakes/conducts/ facilitates regular monitoring and evaluation of the National Nutrition Mission to assess the impact of the programme. A National Council on India’s Nutritional Challenges under the Chairmanship of Vice-Chairman NITI Aayog has been constituted to provide policy direction, review and effective coordination and convergence between Ministries which have a sectoral responsibility for the challenge of nutrition.(e)	There is no proposal under consideration of this Ministry to create a band of community hunger fighters to deal with hunger among women, expectant mothers and children. However, this Ministry is addressing the issue of malnutrition through various schemes including POSHAN Abhiyaan. Under POSHAN Abhiyaan, Community Mobilization and Awareness Advocacy leading to Jan Andolan- to educate the people on nutritional aspects; are among various components to generate awareness and public participation. ****
