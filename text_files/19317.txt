                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):  “Public Health & Hospitals” being a State subject the primary responsibility for ensuring healthcare services including establishing more public health care facilities lies with respective State Government.To address the healthcare challenges, particularly in rural areas, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in 2005 to supplement the efforts of the State/UT governments to provide accessible, affordable and quality healthcare to all those who access public health facilities. Currently, NRHM is a sub-mission of National Health Mission (NHM).NHM support is provided to States/ UTs including Maharashtra and Rajasthan for setting up of new facilities as per norms and upgradation of existing facilities for bridging the infrastructure gaps based on the requirement posed by them. NHM support is also provided for provision of a range of free services related to maternal health, child health, adolescent health, family planning, universal immunisation programme, and for major diseases such as Tuberculosis, vector borne diseases like Malaria, Dengue and Kala Azar, Leprosy etc. Other major initiatives supported under NHM include Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) (under which free drugs, free diagnostics, free blood and diet, free transport from home to institution, between facilities in case of a referral and drop back home is provided), Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) (which provides newborn and child health screening and early interventions services free of cost for birth defects, diseases, deficiencies and developmental delays to improve the quality of survival), implementation of Free Drugs and Free Diagnostics Service Initiatives, PM National Dialysis Programme and implementation of National Quality Assurance Framework in all public health facilities including in rural areas. Mobile Medical Units (MMUs) & Telemedicine are also being implemented to improve access to healthcare particularly in rural areas.As part of Ayushman Bharat, the States are supported for establishment of 1.5 lakh Health and Wellness Centres across the country by December, 2022 for provision of comprehensive primary care that includes preventive healthcare and health promotion at the community level with continuum of care approach. Further Ayushman Bharat, Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) provides health coverage up to Rs 5 Lakh per family per year to around 1074 crore poor and vulnerable families as per Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC).(b):    In the 15 years of implementation, the NHM has enabled achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for health. It has also led to significant improvements in maternal, new-born, and child health indicators, particularly for maternal mortality ratio, infant and under five mortality rates, wherein the rates of decline in India are much higher than the global averages and these declines have accelerated during the period of implementation of NHM.  The major achivements under NHM are given at Annexure-1.(c) & (d): As per the information received from the Health Department of Rajasthan, Providing Super-speciality Healthcare facilities in the rural areas is not contemplated presently and Super-speciality Healthcare facilities are being provided at Medical Colleges level in State of Rajasthan.  As per the information received from the Health department of Maharashtra, as State Government has set up super-speciality hospital in Pune which is 200 km from Madha, there is no planning to establish separate super-speciality hospital at Madha. Further, under Department of Medical Education, presently, Super Speciality Hospitals are functional in medical colleges at Pune, Aurangabad and Nagpur and are being set up at Mumbai and Sindhudurg.  Similarly, under Public Health Department of Maharashtra, Super Speciality Hospitals are functional at Nashik and Amravti and are also being set up at at Thane.
