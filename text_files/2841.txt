                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) to (c): 	The Government of India has not conducted any specific study in the State of Bihar during the last three years to assess on pre and post–harvest crop losses. However, ICAR-Central Institute of Post Harvest Engineering and Technology (CIPHET) has conducted two studies on “Assessment of quantitative harvest and post harvest losses of major crops and commodities in India” through All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on Post Harvest Engineering and Technology to determine the level of losses during the year 2005-2007 and 2012-2013. The economic value of quantitative loss of 45 crops/commodities was found to be in the tune of Rs.92,651 crore at average annual price of 2014. Estimated monetary value of harvest and post harvest losses in India at production for the year 2012-13 is annexed.(d): 	    The State of Bihar has not submitted any Memorandum seeking financial assistance on account of crop loss due to natural calamity since last five years. In the eventuality of drought and other natural calamities, the State Government is empowered to initiate necessary relief measures from State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) which is readily available with them. Additional financial assistance, over and above SDRF, is considered from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) on receipt of Memorandum from State Government and in accordance with extant   norms and procedure. (e): 	    Question does not arise.
