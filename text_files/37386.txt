                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a): The details of Airports operated by Airports Authority of India and other agencies, State-wise, are attached as Annexure.;(b) & (c): During the last five years, Government of India has accorded ''In-Principle'' approval for development of new Greenfield airports at Hirasar (Rajkot) in Gujarat, Hollongi (Itanagar) in Arunachal Pradesh and Jewar (Noida) in Uttar Pradesh.;The responsibility of implementation of airport project including funding of the project rests with the concerned airport developer and the respective State Government (in case the State Govt. is the project proponent). Out of the three airports approved during the last five years, Airports Authority of India is undertaking development of Hollongi and Hirasar airports and the works at both the airports have commenced. Jewar airport is a project of State Government of Uttar Pradesh which has undertaken the project under Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. The State Government has handed over the project to M/s Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL) and the works at the airport has been commenced.  Timeline for completion of the airport projects depends upon many factors such as land acquisition, availability of mandatory clearances, financial closure, etc.;;(d) & (e): In the Central region, GoI has granted  ''In-Principle'' approval to M/s Gwalior Agriculture Company Limited (GACL), a private developer for setting up of Greenfield Airport at Dabra (Gwalior) in Madhya Pradesh. In addition, ''Site Clearance'' approval has also been granted to the Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation Limited, a State Government agency, for setting up of a Greenfield Airport at Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh. ;;Government of India, Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik) in October, 2016 with the objective to facilitate / stimulate regional air connectivity to currently underserved and unserved airports. Under the Scheme, Gwalior Underserved airport in Madhya Pradesh owned by Indian Air Force (Civil Enclave-AAI) and Jagdalpur & Bilaspur airports in Chattisgarh owned by State Government have been operationalized. In addition, airports/airstrips at Ambikapur & Raigarh in Chattisgarh and Rewa in Madhya Pradesh have been identified for development and operationalization under RCS-UDAN.(f): Proposals have been received from concerned State Governments for ''site clearance'' for establishment of Greenfield Airports at Mandi in Himachal Pradesh, Pantnagar in Uttarakhand, Kottayam and Kasargod in Kerala, Purandar in Maharashtra and Raichur in Karnataka. As regards Mandi airport, Steering Committee has recommended site clearance subject to certain conditions which have to be fulfilled by the State Government of Himachal Pradesh. Matter of development of Greenfield Airport at Pantnagar is sub-judice. For Kottayam (Sabarimala) Airport, based on the observations of AAI and DGCA, Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) has been requested to submit updated Techno Economic Feasibility Study Report. As regards, Kasargod airport, the State Government has clarified that the proposed airstrip is only for non-scheduled flights and not a full fledged Greenfield Airport. In respect of Purandar airport, NOC for Site Clearance has been cancelled by the Ministry of Defence (MoD). As regards site clearance for Raichur airport, the project proponent has been requested to provide additional information.****** AnnexureAnnexure referred to in respect of Part (a) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.4634Details of Operational Airports State-wiseS.No.	Airport	State/Union Territory	Operated By1	PORT BLAIR	A&N ISLAND	AAI2	KADAPAH	ANDHRA PRADESH	AAI3	KURNOOL	ANDHRA PRADESH	State Govt.4	RAJAHMUNDRY	ANDHRA PRADESH	AAI5	TIRUPATI	ANDHRA PRADESH	AAI6	VIJAYAWADA	ANDHRA PRADESH	AAI7	VISAKHAPATNAM	ANDHRA PRADESH	AAI8	PASSIGHAT	ARUNACHAL PRADESH	State Govt.9	TEZU	ARUNACHAL PRADESH	AAI10	DIBRUGARH	ASSAM	AAI11	GUWAHATI	ASSAM	AAI12	JORHAT	ASSAM	AAI13	LILABARI	ASSAM	AAI14	RUPSI	ASSAM	AAI15	SILCHAR	ASSAM	AAI16	TEZPUR	ASSAM	AAI17	DARBHANGA	BIHAR	AAI18	GAYA	BIHAR	AAI19	PATNA	BIHAR	AAI20	CHANDIGARH	CHANDIGARH	AAI21	BILASPUR	CHHATTISGARH	State Govt.22	JAGDALPUR	CHHATTISGARH	State Govt.23	RAIPUR	CHHATTISGARH	AAI24	DELHI (DIAL)	DELHI	AAI25	SAFDARJUNG	DELHI	AAI26	DIU	DIU	AAI27	GOA	GOA	AAI28	AHMEDABAD	GUJARAT	AAI29	BHAVNAGAR	GUJARAT	AAI30	BHUJ	GUJARAT	AAI31	JAMNAGAR	GUJARAT	AAI32	KANDLA	GUJARAT	AAI33	KESHOD	GUJARAT	AAI34	MUNDRA	GUJARAT	Private35	PORBANDAR	GUJARAT	AAI36	RAJKOT	GUJARAT	AAI37	SABARMATI RIVER FRONT (W)	GUJARAT	State Govt.38	STATUE OF UNITY (W)	GUJARAT	State Govt.39	SURAT	GUJARAT	AAI40	VADODARA	GUJARAT	AAI41	HISAR	HARYANA	State Govt.42	KANGRA (GAGGAL)	HIMACHAL PRADESH	AAI43	KULLU (BHUNTAR)	HIMACHAL PRADESH	AAI44	SHIMLA	HIMACHAL PRADESH	AAI45	MANDI (H)	HIMACHAL PRADESH	State Govt.46	RAMPUR (H)	HIMACHAL PRADESH	State Govt.47	JAMMU	JAMMU AND KASHMIR	AAI48	SRINAGAR	JAMMU AND KASHMIR	AAI49	JAMSHEDPUR	JHARKHAND	Private50	RANCHI	JHARKHAND	AAI51	BELAGAVI	KARNATAKA	AAI52	BENGALURU (BIAL)	KARNATAKA	BIAL53	BIDAR	KARNATAKA	MoD/Private54	HUBBALLI	KARNATAKA	AAI55	KALABURAGI	KARNATAKA	AAI56	MANGLURU	KARNATAKA	AAI57	MYSURU	KARNATAKA	AAI58	VIDYANAGAR	KARNATAKA	Private59	COCHIN (CIAL)	KERALA	CIAL60	KANNUR(KIAL)	KERALA	KIAL61	KOZHIKODE	KERALA	AAI62	THIRUVANANTHPURAM	KERALA	AAI63	LEH	LADHAKH	AAI64	AGATTI	LAKSHDWEEP ISLAND	AAI65	BHOPAL	MADHYA PRADESH	AAI66	GWALIOR	MADHYA PRADESH	AAI67	INDORE	MADHYA PRADESH	AAI68	JABALPUR	MADHYA PRADESH	AAI69	KHAJURAHO	MADHYA PRADESH	AAI70	AKOLA	MAHARASHTRA	AAI71	AURANGABAD	MAHARASHTRA	AAI72	GONDIA	MAHARASHTRA	AAI73	JALGAON	MAHARASHTRA	AAI74	JUHU	MAHARASHTRA	AAI75	KOLHAPUR	MAHARASHTRA	AAI76	MUMBAI (MIAL)	MAHARASHTRA	MIAL77	NAGPUR	MAHARASHTRA	AAI78	NANDED	MAHARASHTRA	Private79	NASIK (HAL OZAR)	MAHARASHTRA	HAL80	PUNE	MAHARASHTRA	AAI81	SHIRDI	MAHARASHTRA	State Govt.82	SHOLAPUR	MAHARASHTRA	AAI83	SINDHUDURG	MAHARASHTRA	Private84	IMPHAL	MANIPUR	AAI85	SHILLONG (UMROI)	MEGHALAYA	AAI86	LENGPUI(AIZWAL)	MIZORAM	State Govt.87	DIMAPUR	NAGALAND	AAI88	BHUBANESWAR	ODISHA	AAI89	JHARSUGUDA	ODISHA	AAI90	ROURKELA	ODISHA	SAIL91	PUDUCHERRY	PUDUCHERRY	AAI92	ADAMPUR	PUNJAB	AAI93	AMRITSAR	PUNJAB	AAI94	BHATINDA	PUNJAB	AAI95	LUDHIANA	PUNJAB	AAI96	PATHANKOT	PUNJAB	AAI97	BIKANER	RAJASTHAN	AAI98	JAIPUR	RAJASTHAN	AAI99	JAISALMER	RAJASTHAN	AAI100	JODHPUR	RAJASTHAN	AAI101	KISHANGARH	RAJASTHAN	AAI102	KOTA	RAJASTHAN	AAI103	UDAIPUR	RAJASTHAN	AAI104	PAKYONG	SIKKIM	AAI105	CHENNAI	TAMILNADU	AAI106	COIMBATORE	TAMILNADU	AAI107	MADURAI	TAMILNADU	AAI108	SALEM	TAMILNADU	AAI109	THOOTHUKUDI	TAMILNADU	AAI110	TIRUCHIRAPALLI	TAMILNADU	AAI111	HYDERABAD (GHIAL)	TELANGANA	HIAL112	HYDERABAD BEGAMPET	TELANGANA	AAI113	AGARTALA	TRIPURA	AAI114	AGRA	UTTAR PRADESH	AAI115	AYODHYA	UTTAR PRADESH	AAI116	BAREILLY	UTTAR PRADESH	AAI117	GORAKHPUR	UTTAR PRADESH	AAI118	HINDON	UTTAR PRADESH	AAI119	KANPUR (CHAKERI)	UTTAR PRADESH	AAI120	KANPUR CIVIL	UTTAR PRADESH	AAI121	KUSHINAGAR	UTTAR PRADESH	AAI122	LUCKNOW	UTTAR PRADESH	AAI123	MEERUT	UTTAR PRADESH	AAI124	MORADABAD	UTTAR PRADESH	AAI125	PRAYAGRAJ	UTTAR PRADESH	AAI126	VARANASI	UTTAR PRADESH	AAI127	Chinyalisaur(H)	UTTARAKHAND	State Govt.128	DEHRADUN	UTTARAKHAND	AAI129	Gaucher(H)	UTTARAKHAND	State Govt.130	HALDWANI(H)	UTTARAKHAND	State Govt.131	New Tehri (H)	UTTARAKHAND	State Govt.132	PANT NAGAR	UTTARAKHAND	AAI133	PITHORAGARH	UTTARAKHAND	State Govt.134	Sahastradhara(H)	UTTARAKHAND	State Govt.135	Srinagar(H)	UTTARAKHAND	State Govt.136	BAGDOGRA	WEST BENGAL	AAI137	BEHALA	WEST BENGAL	AAI138	COOCH BEHAR	WEST BENGAL	AAI139	DURGAPUR	WEST BENGAL	Private140	KOLKATA	WEST BENGAL	AAINote:  H- Heliport             W- Wateraerodrome
