                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI  & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  District-wise data of area washed away due to soil erosion is not maintained centrally. Central Water Commission maintains the flood damage data of the country and details of damages due to floods in the State of Bihar for the period 2016-2018 is given in Annexure-I.(b) & (c)  The schemes for anti-erosion works, construction of new embankments and raising/strengthening of existing and protection of embankments are formulated and implemented by concerned States as per their priority. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and also promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. Main reason for floods in the State of Bihar is on account of increased discharge in rivers of North Bihar like Gandak, Burhi Gandak and Bagmati, Kamla, Kosi and Mahananda due to heavy rainfall in the upper catchment areas which mainly lie in Nepal. The management of floods due to these rivers has been a concern. The related issues are discussed in the existing Indo-Nepal bilateral three tier mechanisms comprising of (i) Joint Ministerial Level Commission on Water Resources (JMCWR) (ii) Joint Committee on Water Resources (JCWR) and (iii) Joint Standing Technical Committee (JSTC). Government of India is having regular dialogue with the Government of Nepal for construction of dams on these rivers for mutual benefit of the two countries which includes flood control. Broad outcomes of the dialogues mechanism are given below: i)    Pancheshwar Development Authority (PDA) has been set up jointly by India and Nepal for execution, operation and maintenance of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project on river Sarada. The  DPR of the project has been prepared by M/s WAPCOS Limited. ii)   Survey and investigation including preparation of DPR of Sapta Kosi High Dam Project and Sun Kosi Storage-cum-Diversion scheme proposed in the Sapta Kosi basin in Nepal has been undertaken jointly by India and Nepal.            Water Resource Department, Government of Bihar has informed that flood protection of large areas and habitation, infrastructures, crops and inundation due to flood water is proposed to be done through construction of 1195.87 km new flood embankments in upper reaches of Mahananda basin (i.e river Mahananda, Mechi, Donk, Kankai and Ratwa). This work has already been taken up and is proposed to be constructed in five phases under Mahananda Flood Management Scheme. *****  ANNEXURE -IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 737 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 17.09.2020 REGARDING “SOIL EROSION DUE TO FLOODS”.STATEMENT SHOWING FLOOD DAMAGES IN BIHAR  DURING 2016. 2017 and 2018 Sl.No	Year	Area Affected (Mha)	Population Affected (Million)	Damages to Crops	Damage to Houses	Cattle Lost Nos.
