ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH ANDFAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (d) Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission(ABDM) is implemented by National Health Authority. It aims to create an online platform enabling interoperability of health data within the health ecosystem to create longitudinal electronic health record of every citizen, make healthcare accessible for citizens including reducing the cost of care and enabling greater efficiencies in health service delivery. The digital health ecosystem created by ABDM supports continuity of care across primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare in a seamless manner. It ensures availability of health care services particularly in remote and rural areas where generally as such specialist care may not be available. A case in point is the telemedicine platform, eSanjeevani, which has enabled availability of health care services across the country. As it reduces the need for repeated diagnostics through availability of longitudinal health records, it also will help in reducing the cost of care.Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), launched in 2018, provides for cashless secondary and tertiary care treatment from empanelled public and private hospitals. The beneficiaries of this scheme are provided PM-JAY cards. These cardholders can utilise the advantages of effective monitoring, quality of care and continuity of health care services provided through the digital ecosystem of ABDM.
