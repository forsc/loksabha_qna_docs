ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (f):        The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA) provides at least 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult member volunteers to do unskilled manual work. It is a demand driven wage employment Scheme which provides livelihood security i.e., fall back option for livelihood for the rural households when no better employment opportunity is available. The demand for work is influenced by various factors such as rain-fall, availability of alternative and remunerative employment opportunities outside Mahatma Gandhi NREGS etc. As per information uploaded by the States/UTs including Manipur in the Management Information System (MIS), the number of average days of employment provided per household under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS during the last three financial years and current financial year (as on 13.03.2020) is given at Annexure-I. Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is a demand driven wage employment programme.  Hence no State/UT-wise allocation of funds is made.  Fund release to the States/UTs including Manipur is a continuous and dynamic process, Central Government is committed to making funds available keeping in view the demand for work. The Ministry seeks additional fund for implementation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS from the Ministry of Finance as and when required for meeting the demand for work on the ground. The details of central fund released and expenditure reported by States/UTs in Management Information System (MIS) during the last five years is at Annexure-II.
