                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) to (e):	The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) has been introduced from Kharif 2016 season replacing the erstwhile scheme.  The scheme has further been improved Contd….2/--2-and revamped w.e.f. Rabi 2018 and Kharif 2020 respectively.  New features included in the scheme are – to provide adequate risk coverage for pre-season to post harvest,  the sum insured has been equated to Scale of Finance/notional value of average yield at minimum uniform fixed premium rate payable by farmers i.e. maximum 2% for Kharif crops, 1.5% for Rabi Crop and 5% for commercial/horticultural crops, with balance of actuarial/bidded premium being shared by the Central and State Government on 90 : 10 basis in North Eastern States and for remaining States on 50 : 50 basis;  lowering of unit area of insurance to village/village panchayat level for major crops,  penalty provisions for late settlement of claims by insurance companies and late release of funds by State Governments and to individual farm level assessment of loss for localised risks of hailstorm, landslide, inundation, cloud burst & natural fire and post-harvest losses due to cyclonic/unseasonal rains and hailstorm thereby promoting more realistic assessment of losses. 	Further, linkage of Aadhar/land records, capturing of granular data on National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP), mobile apps and infusion of improved technology has brought more transparency, efficiency and efficacy to ensure timely settlement of admissible claims to eligible farmers. 	Due to these improved features participation in the scheme has been increased from about 23% of Gross Cropped Area (GCA) in the country under erstwhile schemes to 30%.	As per provisions of PMFBY admissible claims are generally paid by the insurance companies within two months of completion of Crop Cutting Experiments/harvesting period subject to availability of yield data and release of total State share of premium subsidy from concerned State Government within time. However, settlement of claims in some States gets delayed due to reasons like delayed transmission of yield data;  late release of their share in premium subsidy by some States, yield related disputes between insurance companies and States, non-receipt of account details of some farmers for transfer of claims and National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) related issues, etc.   	Average payout made during 2020-21 is not available as the claims for the year in respect of notified crops and areas by States are not fully reported.	State-wise and year-wise details of total number of farmer applications covered, total premium collected, claims paid, claims pending and reasons for pendency are given in Annexure-I.(f):	Being a Central Sector Scheme, State-wise allocation/release is not made under the scheme.   The requisite funds are released to the Central fund routing agency i.e. Agriculture Insurance Company of India Ltd. (AIC) which in turn releases the Central Government’s share in premium subsidy on receipt of respective State Government’s share, to the concerned insurance companies.   Details of State-wise share of premium subsidy provided by the Government during 2020-21 under PMFBY is given in Annexure-II.(g) : The scheme has been made voluntary for all farmers w.e.f. Kharif 2020 season.  As per Agri-Census 2015-16, there are 76.21 lakh farmers in Andhra Pradesh and 27.89 lakh farmerContd….3/--3- applications were received for coverage under PFMBY/ RWBCIS in Kharif 2019 season covering 42.2% of net cropped area of the State.  Government of Andhra Pradesh has not notified the scheme from Rabi 2019-20.  Government is persuading the State Government to notify the scheme and more crops and areas under the scheme to bring more  farmers under coverage of crop insurance.(h):	All food crops (cereals, millets and pulses), Oilseeds, commercial/horticultural crops can be notified under the PMFBY by the concerned State Government subject to availability of requisite past yield data and capacity of the State to conduct requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) to assess the claim.  For crops where past yield data is not available or State Government is not able to conduct requisite number of CCEs can be notified under Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS).  Details of claims disbursed for notified crops during last two years (as on 25.01.2021) are given below:Year	Claims disbursed under Crops notified under PMFBY/ RWBCIS (Rs. in crore)2018-19	279342019-20	23645
