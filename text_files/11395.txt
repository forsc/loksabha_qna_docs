ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	Yes, Sir. Under PM-KISAN Scheme funds are transferred to the accounts of beneficiaries in three equal installments, every four months after receipt of verification of beneficiaries from concerned State/UT and their validation through Aadhar/PFMS.Contd….2/-- 2 -(b):	A statement showing the State-wise number of farmers benefited and the amounts of funds transferred since inception of the scheme is at Annexure-I.(c) & (d):	Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan dhan Yojana (PM-KMY) has been introduced as a voluntary and contributory pension scheme for Small and Marginal Farmers (SMFs), the entry age group of 18 to 40 years with a provision of Rs. 3000/- monthly pension on attaining the age of 60 years, subject to exclusion criteria for higher income status. The Eligible SMFs desirous of joining the scheme shall join the scheme by visiting nearest Common Service Centre (CSC) and State Nodal Officers of the Scheme along with a copy of Aadhaar Card and Savings Bank Account. The State-wise details of number of farmers who joined the Scheme as on 30.01.2020 is laid on the Table of the House (Annexure-II). (e) to (g):  Agriculture being a State subject, the State Governments undertake development of perspective plans and ensure effective implementation of the programmes/ schemes. The Government of India also supplements the efforts of the State Governments through various Schemes/ Programmes. A list of various interventions made by the Government is at  Annexure-III. All these steps of the Government of India are for the welfare of farmers of the country.              The Government constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee in April, 2016 to examine issues relating to “Doubling of Farmers Income” and recommend strategies to achieve the same.  The Committee submitted its Report to the Government in September, 2018. To achieve this, the Committee has identified seven sources of income growth viz., improvement in crop productivity; improvement in livestock productivity; resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; increase in the cropping intensity; diversification towards high value crops; improvement in real prices received by farmers; and shift from farm to non- farm occupations. Subsequently an Empowered Body was set up on 23.01.2019 to monitor and review the progress against the recommendations. Due to the efforts made as part of schemes/ programmes of the Department of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare which also aligns with the strategy of doubling farmers’ income, there has been an appreciable improvement in efficiency bringing about a positive impact in the agriculture sector.
