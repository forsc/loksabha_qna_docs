ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a)	& (b): In Handloom Sector, National Handloom Development Programme (NHDP) and Comprehensive Handloom Cluster Development Scheme (CHCDS) are being implemented under which Block Level Clusters are being sanctioned under Make in India for quality production. From the Year 2015-16 to till date 438 such Block Level Clusters have been sanctioned across the country including Jharkhand (30 in Jharkhand).Apart from this, production of Niche Handloom products with high quality, authentic traditional designs with zero defects and zero effect on environment are being promoted under ‘India Handloom Brand’(IHB). Sincethe launch of IHB in August 2015, 1396 registrations have been issued under 184 product categories and sales of Rs. 861.93 crores have been generated.	Further, with a view to boost textiles sector in the country as well as for sustaining employment in the textiles industry government has initiated two important steps which were part of Budget Announcement in Lok Sabha on 01.02.2020. These are; •	Creation of National Technical Textiles Mission with total outlay of Rs 1480 Crore.Technical textiles are textiles which are used for their functional properties, rather than for aesthetics or comfort. There are a large varities of technical textiles some of which are used in important applications such as agriculture, health and hygiene, medical applications, soil and water conservation, roads and highway, railways, airports, sea-ports, defence, protection of personnel in military, para-military, petrochemical/chemical industries, safety of fireman etc. The aim of the Mission is to position India as a major producer, consumer and exporter of technical textile products in the world map, therefore boosting its economy and technological capability.•	Abolition of anti-dumping duty on Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA), which is a critical input for man-made textile fibre and yarns. Its easy availability and competitive pricing is desirable to unlock the immense potential in textile sector which is a significant employment generator.	  In addition, Government is implementing various policy initiatives and schemes for supporting the development of textile sector. These schemes and initiatives which promote technology upgradation, creation of infrastructure, skill development and sectoral development in the textile sector, create a conducive environment and provide enabling conditions for textile manufacturing in the country and helps in boosting textile sector through its various schemes, such as the Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (A-TUFS), Schemes for the development of the Powerloom Sector(Power-Tex), Schemes for Technical Textiles, Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP),Scheme for Additional Grant for Apparel Manufacturing Units under SITP (SAGAM),  SAMARTH- The Scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector (SCBTS), Jute (ICARE- Improved Cultivation and Advanced Retting Exercise), Integrated Processing Development Scheme (IPDS), Silk Samagra, National Handloom Development Programme, National Handicraft Development Programme, Integrated Wool Development Programme (IWDP), North East Region Textiles Promotion Scheme (NERTPS), Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (ROSCTL), Scheme for Production and Employment  Linked Support for Garmenting Units (SPELSGU) etc. The Government had also approved a special package for textile sector with an outlay of Rs. 6000 crores to boost employment generation and exports particularly in Garmenting and Made-ups.  The Government does not maintain district wise details of companies/factories.(c):		 Under the ‘Samarth-Scheme for Capacity Building in Textiles Sector’, Government of India has allocated a training target of 2700 persons to the Directorate of Handloom, Sericulture & Handicraft, Jharkhand. Under the sanctioned target, 2 training centres are registered from Hazaribagh where training is yet to commence. No training centre has been registered in Ramgarh District.****
