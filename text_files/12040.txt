ANSWER




                                                        (a) 	The Women Scientists Scheme (WOS) provides opportunities to women scientists and technologists who had break in their scientific career primarily due to family reasons. The Scheme gives women a strong foothold into the scientific profession, helps them re-enter into the mainstream and provides a launch pad for further forays into the field of science and technology (S&T). The Women Scientists Scheme has three components viz. Women Scientists Scheme-A (WOS-A) provides opportunity in research and development (R&D) and work as bench-level scientist; Women Scientists Scheme-B (WOS-B) provides opportunity to work on S&T based solutions for problems existing in society and Women Scientists Scheme-C (WOS-C) provides opportunity to work in the area of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) through one-year internship in said field. After selection in any of these three components, women scientists come out with better career opportunities in R&D sector, NGOs, IPR related Law firms and Institutions as well as provide avenues for self-employment. Around 30% of women scientists supported under WOS-A and WOS-B are in mainstream science and around 60% women scientists trained under WOS-C are either employed in various firms or have become entrepreneurs. (b)	Yes Sir. The continuous increase in number of proposals/applications under Women Scientists Scheme shows interest of women towards S&T. The proposals/applications received in WOS are 3,574 in 2017-18, 5,164 in 2018-19 and 6,369 in 2019-20. (c)	Under Women Scientists Scheme, the selection of host institution is done by women scientists themselves and Head of the institution gives an endorsement to extend all facilities which also includes safe work place. Further, there is also provision of change of Institution in the scheme if women scientists face any kind of issue during in project implementation, including safety.  *********
