SINGH)(a) to (f) The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) is implementing Off-grid and Decentralised Solar PV Applications Programme Phase-III and Atal Jyoti Yojana (AJAY) Phase-II for installation of solar street lights in the country.Off-grid and Decentralised Solar PV Applications Programme Phase-III is a demand driven Scheme and the States of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have not submitted any demand under the Scheme. Under AJAY Phase-II Scheme 1000 nos. of solar street lights are proposed to be installed in each of the Lok Sabha constituencies of Phulpur and Prayagraj covering Prayagraj district of Uttar Pradesh. Banswara-Dungarpur districts of Rajasthan are not covered under the AJAY Phase-II, as the Scheme covers only aspirational districts of Rajasthan. For 2000 nos. of solar street lights proposed to be installed under AJAY Phase-II in the Prayagraj district, 75% of the cost of solar street lights will be met by MNRE and balance 25% will be provided through Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS). Installation of solar street lights in the area is being done by M/s Central Electronics Limited and M/s Gautam Solar Private Limited and the work is likely to be completed by 31.03.2020. The over all AJAY Phase-II Scheme is being implemented by Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a JV of PSUs of Ministry of Power. Installation work is being monitored by EESL and periodic inspections are conducted by EESL officials. Further, for overall monitoring of the Scheme, an inter-ministerial Committee has been constituted comprising of members from the Ministry of Power, Ministry of Panchayati Raj and Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.*****
