The Government maintains the record of complaints/grievances received from aggrieved citizens including workers and labourers on Centralized Public Grievance Redress And Monitoring System (CPGRAMS), which is an online web-enabled system developed by National Informatics Centre, in association with Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG).  CPGRAMS is a platform based on web technology which primarily aims to enable submission of grievances by the aggrieved citizens from anywhere and anytime (24x7) basis to Ministries/Departments/Organisations who scrutinize and take action for speedy redressal of these grievances.  Further, complaints are also received through social media handles/email/offline mode.   Whenever complaints are received regarding non-payment or less payment of wages/ salaries to labourers under Central Sphere, the same are examined and addressed by the Officers of the Central Industrial Relations Machinery (CIRM) under the Chief Labour Commissioner (Central) by conducting inspections wherever required, in the establishments and filing claims before the concerned authorities under Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and Payment of Wages Act, 1936.  		The Government has received a total number of 2395 complaints/ grievances on CPGRAMS regarding non-payment/less payment/delayed payment of salaries to workers and labourers during the period from 01.01.2020 to 31.01.2021.   Labour being under the Concurrent List, the enforcement of labour laws is carried out by the State Governments and the Central Government in their respective jurisdictions.  The wages/ salaries of workers are protected under Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and Payment of Wages Act, 1936.  The enforcement of these laws is secured through the CIRM Officers in the Central Sphere and through the State enforcement machinery in the State Sphere. Payment of Wages Act, 1936 is aimed at ensuring timely payment of wages to workers and protecting them against any unauthorised deductions.  The Act has penal provisions for contravention with imprisonment or fine or with both.  		The aforesaid Act along with Minimum Wages Act, 1948 has now been subsumed in the Code on Wages, 2019 which has been notified by the Government on   08.08.2019.   The Code has more stringent penal provisions for non-payment/ less payment of wages/ salaries to workers.******
