Government of India (GoI) has engaged itself actively, constantly and consistently with the agitating farmers unions and eleven rounds of negotiations were held between Government and agitating farmers unions to resolve the issues.  	The procurement trend of foodgrains is normal and smooth. There has been no deficit in procurement of foodgrain against stocking norms, in fact it is surplus. Despite all difficulties associated with COVID – 19 pandemic, the Government went ahead in antedating KMS 2020-21 season which witnessed a massive surge in procurement of paddy that has reached to 677.59  LMT (as on 11.03.2021) against the last year’s corresponding procurement of 593.52 LMT, which is an increase of 14.16%. As on 01.01.2021, the total stock of foodgrains (wheat and rice) is 529.59 LMT against the stocking norms of 214.10 LMT, indicating surplus of 315.49 LMT.  Following major steps were taken for smooth handling of procurement operations.  i) Apart from Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMC), large number of additional temporary Paddy Purchase Centres (PPC) were operated at Silos, Depots , Village and Gram Panchayat levels etc., by govt. agencies. ii) Priority was given to Small and Marginal Farmers in order to mitigate their problems.iii) the Government of India announced Minimum Support Price (MSP) at the beginning of the sowing season of crops on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).  FCI and State Govt. Agencies procure the foodgrains at MSP fixed by GOI.iv) MSP (Minimum Support Price) operations were given wide publicity through print & electronic media. v) Farmers were made aware of the quality specifications and purchase system etc. to facilitate the farmers to bring their produce conforming to the specifications...............2/--2-vi) 	Procurement centres are opened by respective State Govt. Agencies/  FCI taking into account the production, marketable surplus, convenience of farmers and availability of other logistics / infrastructure such as storage and transportation etc. Large number of temporary purchase centres in addition to the existing Mandis and depots/godowns are also established at key points for the convenience of the farmers. In view of the steps taken by GoI, the procurement operations were handled smoothly resulting in increase in quantity procured and number of farmers benefited. As per the stocking norms for the Central Pool, Operational stock and Strategic Reserve are maintained to meet the operational requirement of foodgrains and exigencies at any point of time. Foodgrains are drawn from Strategic reserve in case of crisis such as abnormal shortfall in production of foodgrains in the country or natural calamity. Foodgrain stocking norms of the central pool, with effect from 22.01.2015 are as per below table:				(Figures in Lakh MT)As on 	Operational Stock	Strategic Reserve	Grand Total 	Rice	Wheat	Total	Rice	Wheat	1st April	115.80	44.60	160.40	20.00	30.00	210.401st July	115.40	245.80	361.20	20.00	30.00	411.201st October	82.50	175.20	257.70	20.00	30.00	307.701st January	56.10	108.00	164.10	20.00	30.00	214.10 Stock position of wheat and rice in central pool against the stocking norms is enclosed as  Annexure - I.****ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF THE STARRED QUESTION NO. *296 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 16.03.2021 IN THE LOK SABHA.STOCK POSITION OF WHEAT AND RICE IN THE CENTRAL POOL VIS A VIS FOODGRAINS STOCKING NORMS                                                                         					                       ( in lakh MT)AS ON	W H E A T	R I C E	T O T A L	Surplus Stock 	Foodgrain Stocking norms	Actual stock	Foodgrain Stocking norms	Actual stock	Foodgrain Stocking norms	Actual stock	1.01.2019	138.00	271.21	76.10	182.91	214.10	454.12	240.021.04.2019	74.60	169.92	135.80	293.94	210.40	463.86	253.461.07.2019	275.80	458.31	135.40	284.21	411.20	742.52	331.321.10.2019	205.20	393.16	102.50	249.16	307.70	642.32	334.621.01.2020	138.00	327.96	76.10	237.15	214.10	565.11	351.011.04.2020	74.60	247.00	135.80	322.39	210.40	569.39	358.991.07.2020	275.80	549.91	135.40	271.71	411.20	821.62	410.421.10.2020	205.20	437.38	102.50	192.61	307.70	629.99	322.291.01.2021	138.00	342.90	76.10	186.69	214.10	529.59	315.49******
