ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) &(b): NABARD provides financial assistance to States under various funds. State wise details are given below:1. Infrastructure Support:The Government had set up Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) in NABARD, with the objective of providing low cost fund support to the states for critical rural infrastructure projects.  Loans sanctioned and disbursed under RIDF during the last three years viz. 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 to various States including Maharashtra is given in Annexure-I.  Sector wise details of the loans are given in Annexure-II. NABARD provides financial assistance to the States towards State share under Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF) for completion of works of identified irrigation projects. The details of sanction and release of loan to the States (including Maharashtra) during the last three years are furnished in Annexure-III. 2. Storage and Marketing Support:The details of financial assistance provided by NABARD under Warehouse Infrastructure Fund (WIF) and Food Processing Fund (FPF) to various states including Maharashtra in last three financial years i.e 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 are given in Annexure-IV & V. The financial assistance extended under WIF and FPF is by way of low cost term loan, used specifically for development of storage and processing infrastructure, benefitting directly to the agriculture/farming Sector. Thus the WIF/FPF assistance enables to channelize investment in the sector and create capital assets having long term benefits.3. Developmental Support:The details of financial assistance provided by NABARD to various states including Maharashtra pertaining to Watershed Development Fund, Tribal Development Fund, Farmers Producer Organization and Farm Sector Promotion Fund are indicated in Annexure VI to X. (c): 1. Monitoring of RIDF: Monitoring of projects sanctioned under RIDF is primarily the responsibility of the implementing Department of the State Governments.  The monitoring of the progress is also ensured by NABARD through prescribed returns, periodic reviews with implementing department as well as at the level of High Power Committee under the Chairmanship of Chief Secretary of the State.  Social monitoring of projects is ensured through display of boards with the sanctioned details, etc. at project locations.2. Monitoring of LTIF and MIF: The nodal Ministry for Long term irrigation fund (LTIF) is Ministry of Jal Shakti (MoJS).  As per the provisions of Memorandum of association (MoA) executed under LTIF, monitoring of projects assisted under this scheme is primarily the responsibility of the implementing agency/department of the State Govt. 3. Monitoring of other Projects:NABARD has its own monitoring mechanism to ensure the timely implementation of the sanctioned projects.(d): In order to provide effective and hassle free credit to farmers for their short term credit requirements for cultivation of crops, investment credit requirement for agriculture and allied activities and other needs Government fixes agriculture credit disbursement targets for the banking sector every year and banks have consistently surpassed these targets. Details of target and achievement made in respect of agriculture credit flow during the last three years as reported by NABARD is as under:                                                     (Rs.in Crores)Year	Target	Achievement2017-18	10,00,000	11,62,6172018-19 	11,00,000	12,56,8302019-20 	13,50,000	13,92,729(e): While the target for agriculture credit fixed by the Government has been surpassed each year, agriculture loans to farmers have also witnessed an increase over the years, which is indicative of progressive enhancement in the credit flow to the farm sector over time.  The Government has launched a Centralised Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS), an online web-enabled system, which primarily aims to enable submission of grievances with the facility of tracking on real time basis, to Ministries/ Departments/ Organisations who scrutinize and take action for speedy and favourable redress of their grievances.Banks ensure speedy redressal of complaints received by them as well as through the CPGRAMS- portal.  Also, complaints in regard to various issues relating to agriculture credit received by Government/ RBI are taken up for appropriate redressal.                                                ******
