ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b): Yes Sir. 9th Women’s Science Congress (WSC) was organized as a part of 107th Indian Science Congress at University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS), Bengaluru during 05-06 January, 2020. The main theme of 9th Women Science Congress was “Women in Science and Technology for Sustainable Development”.(c) & (d):  In the 9th Women Science Congress, 1635 delegates from diversified fields of science and technology participated. Various issues including nutritional challenges of women and children, agricultural waste utilization, promoting women in science, challenges of climate change, Fulbright fellowship opportunities, biodiversity and biocontrol, bioresource conservation, rural women empowerment, challenges for women in non-traditional areas etc. were deliberated in the WSC.  Women Science Congress brought many women scientists to forefront by enhancing their visibility. It served as a platform to women participants to interact and exchange ideas not only on various fields of science and technology but also on social issues. It showcased and recognized work of women scientists and leaders from academic institutions, industries, administration etc. and their role in progress of society. (e) 	‘Women Scientist Scheme’ under KIRAN is a flagship programme of the Department of Science and Technology (DST) that provides career opportunities including fellowships to unemployed women scientists and technologists, especially those who had a break in career, for pursuing research in frontier areas of Science and Engineering. There are three major components of Women Scientist Scheme namely, i) Women Scientists Scheme-A (WOS-A) for conducting research in Basic & Applied Sciences, ii) Women Scientists Scheme-B (WOS-B) for projects that entail S&T interventions for Societal Benefit and iii) Women Scientists Scheme-C (WOS-C) that enables them to become Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) professional.(f) 	The Department of Science & Technology supports Women Science Congress every year as a part of Indian Science Congress. The DST also supports conferences/seminars related to Women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) whenever an appropriate proposal is received, for example, ‘Women in Physics’ Conference at University of Hyderabad was supported by the Department. Further, Women Conclave under India International Science Festival (IISF) at Kolkata was also supported by DST in addition to Women Conclave on International Women’s Day at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.
