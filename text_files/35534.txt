ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) and (b) The Government is seized of the matter. The actions across Ministries and Departments of the Government of India to assess the impact of environmental change are evolving in keeping with new data and increased scientific knowledge on the subject. Such data and analyses are routinely carried out in the regular work of departments and ministries and incorporated in further schemes, plans and initiatives of the Government as notified from time to time. Experts and scientists in academia and think tanks are also consulted from time to time as need arises on these subjects.The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has notified the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006,as amended from time to time. The notification deals with the process to grant Environmental Clearance (EC) to various development projects that may cause impact to the environment. Any likely impacts of such projects including pollution of groundwater, air and noise pollution, are assessed during its EIA and Environmental Management Plan(EMP) studies, which is mandatory for obtaining EC. The EC is granted to the project based on the appraisal of such project keeping in view EIA/EMP studies, and various conditions are stipulated therein to address and mitigate the environmental impacts. (c) and (d) The impact of environmental changes on agriculture, and vice-versa, is the subject of continuing study and an integral part of the mandate of the Department of Agricultural Research and Education. Such studies and related interventions are carried out regularly by them and their findings made part of Government policies and schemes and programmes. The State agricultural universities and other institutions at State level together with the State agriculture departments also carry out similar work relevant to their State-level circumstances and conditions. With respect to the particular global environmental change problem, that is climate change, the Government is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which provides the overarching framework for climate actions, through eight national missions in specific areas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan eco-system, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. These Missions are institutionalized and implemented by their respective nodal Ministries. Under the NAPCC’s overarching framework, thirty-three (33) States /UTs have prepared State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCC). Further, to support adaptation measures in States / UTs in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change, Government is implementing the National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC). Under NAFCC, 30 projects in 27 States/UTs have been sanctioned for adaptation in agriculture, water, forestry, etc.Under the National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change, a project titled ‘Ecosystem services-based adaptation to climate change in Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh’ is being implemented with a grant of Rs. 19.81 crore covering four forest divisions viz., Banda, Hamirpur, Orai (Jalaun) and Chitrakoot. The project aims to restore degraded forest areas with involvement of local communities and improve community/grazing land, grassland and adjoining lands through agroforestry. Households in the project areas are being supported for informed decision making in the light of their vulnerability to climate change.In Uttarakhand, a project under Adaptation Fund (of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) titled ‘Climate smart actions and strategies in north western Himalayan region for sustainable livelihoods of agriculture-dependent hill communities’ is being implemented with a grant of Rs 5.82 crore. The project supports climate smart interventions in sustainable livelihood management by means of spring rejuvenation, roof top rainwater harvesting, introduction of drip irrigation for increased water use efficiency and introduction of improved horticulture varieties and high value vegetable cultivation under protected conditions using bamboo-based poly houses etc. The communities in the project areas were provided training and exposure visits for understanding vulnerability and adaptation to climatic change.Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India launched a flagship network project ‘National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture’ (NICRA) in 2011. Under NICRA, climate resilient technologies were demonstrated in two (2) districts of Uttarakhand (Tehri Garhwal and Uttarkashi) and three (3) districts each in Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh (Chitrakoott, Hamirpur and Jhansi) and Madhya Pradesh (Tikamgarh, Datia and Chhatarpur).*****
