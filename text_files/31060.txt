A Special Campaign on disposal of pendency and swachta was organized from 2 October to 31 October, 2021 in all Ministries / Departments in Government of India including their attached / subordinate offices, autonomous organizations across the country and Indian Missions abroad. The activities   included   indoor and outdoor cleanliness campaign, disposal of scrap, weeding out of outlived records and disposal of pending references from the Members of Parliament, State Governments, Inter -Ministerial references, Parliament Assurances and Public Grievances. The campaign has brought down pendency in identified categories significantly. It also generated revenue of about Rs.62.00 cr. from disposal of scrap and about 12 lakh sq. ft. of space was freed up in offices for productive use.    (c) & (d):   In order to consolidate the gains during the special campaign,  the Government has decided to monitor pendency  on regularly and strengthen the internal processes for efficient and speedy disposal of references. *****
