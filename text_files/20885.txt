MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a) to (c):	Department of School Education & Literacy, Ministry of Education is implementing the  Samagra Shiksha scheme. Bridging Gender and Social category gaps at all levels of school education is one of the major objectives of the scheme.

For providing universal access to quality secondary education, the neighbourhood norms notified by the state/UT are applicable for opening of new Secondary schools. In the case of the States and Union Territories, which have not notified the  neighbourhood  norms  for  Secondary Schools,  Samagra Shiksha provides  support  for  access  to  secondary  schools  within  a  distance  of  5  Km  of a habitation while ensuring their viability and cost effectiveness.
