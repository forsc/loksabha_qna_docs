ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) & (b):	Koshyari Committee had recommended, in the year 2013, to increase   minimum  pension to Rs. 3000 per   month   and     also Contd..2/-:: 2 ::enhance Government’s contribution from 1.16% to at least 8.33% of wages for the members of Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS), 1995. The Government has, for the first time, in the year 2014, provided a minimum pension of Rs. 1000 per month to the pensioners under EPS, 1995 by providing budgetary support, which was in addition to the budgetary support of 1.16% of wages provided annually towards EPS. For the year 2021-22, an amount of Rs.7364 crore has been provided for minimum pension and towards 1.16% of wages as Government contribution.  (c):		The Employees’ Pension Fund for EPS, 1995 is a self-financed fund. A High Empowered Monitoring Committee (HEMC) was constituted for evaluation and review of EPS, 1995 and the Committee did not recommend any linking of monthly pension with cost of living index as this may severely affect the financial health of the Employees’ Pension Fund, as assessed by the Actuary appointed by the Government under paragraph 32 of the EPS, 1995. However, as recommended by the HEMC, the Government has notified its decision vide G.S.R. 132 (E) dated 20.02.2020 for restoration of normal pension after completion of fifteen years from the date of such commutation, in respect of those members who availed the benefit of commutation of pension under the erstwhile paragraph 12A of the EPS, 1995, on or before 25.09.2008.(d) & (e):	The Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) is an entitlement based scheme and the beneficiary families are drawn from Socio Economic Caste Census database by applying specific deprivation criteria for rural area and occupational criteria for urban area. However, there is no provision in the EPS, 1995 to provide medical facilities to the EPS pensioners.******
