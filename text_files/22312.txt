                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (e):	On the direction of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the hard copies of the supplementary list of inclusions and online family-wise list of exclusions in National Register of Citizens (NRC), Assam have been published  on 31st   August, 2019.   A total of 3,11,21,004 persons are found eligible for inclusion leaving out 19,06,657 persons.  The decision of eligibility of ‘D’ Voters and their descendants has been kept on hold on the direction of Hon’ble Supreme Court. Separate list of exclusion of Gorkhas has not been published. Any person not satisfied with the outcome of the decisions of claims and objections leading to publication of final NRC may prefer an appeal before the Foreigners Tribunal constituted under the Foreigners (Tribunal) Order, 1964 within a period of one hundred and twenty days from the date of such order. On the disposal of appeal by the tribunals the names shall be included or deleted, as the case may be, in the NRC. The State Government was requested on 24.09.2018 to direct all concerned that only those Gorkhas who have come from Bangladesh and are living in the State of Assam can be treated as from the “specified territory” in accordance with Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955.Two hundred appellate Foreigners Tribunals (FTs) in addition to the existing One hundred FTs have been established in 2019. State Government of Assam has made necessary arrangements to provide legal aid to the needy people amongst those excluded from final NRC by providing all assistance through the District Legal Services Authorities.*******
