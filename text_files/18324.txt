ANSWER




MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI) (a) to (d): Ministry of Minority Affairs is implementing various schemes/programmes in the country including Bihar for welfare and development of six centrally notified minorities namely Buddhists, Christians, Jains, Muslims, Parsis and Sikhs. Out of the schemes being  implemented by this Ministry, only one scheme namely Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (earlier known as Multi-sectoral Development Scheme) is Centrally Sponsored Scheme, under which funds are released to the State Governments including Bihar. Other Schemes are Central  Sector Schemes being implemented directly by the Ministry or through implementing agencies empanelled under the various schemes/programmes, where funds are not allocated and released state-wise or district wise,  details of which are available on the website of the  Ministry i.e. www.minorityaffairs.gov.inPradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK) is being implemented  in 1300 identified Minority Concentration Areas (MCAs) of the country with the objective to develop socio-economic infrastructure and basic amenities for the welfare of the people living in the Area.   The MCAs have been identified on the basis of concentration of minority population i.e. 25% or more and backwardness in terms of socio-economic and/or basic amenity indicators as compared to national average.      Under the scheme, from 2014-15 onwards Ministry has sanctioned various  projects of Rs. 941.42 crore for Bihar State. The projects sanctioned from 2014 onwards are 3222 Additional Class Rooms, 19 Additional Class Room Block, 130 Anganwadi Centres, 7 Common Service Centres, 60 Sadbhavna Mandaps, 61 Drinking Water Sanitation Projects, 641 Health Projects, 48 Hostels, 1 ITI, 2 Market Shed, 221 School Buildings, 151 Toilets (in school and community), etc.       Under PMJVK Scheme, Jehanabad, Arwal and Gaya have not been identified as MCAs. However, the feasibility of project proposal from Districts which are not identified as MCAs may be explored through Cluster of Village (CoVs) approach.*******
