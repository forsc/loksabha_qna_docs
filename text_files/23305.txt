ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a):		The Government stands committed to  eradicate the  child labour in the country. The Ministry of Labour and Employment is implementing the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme since 1988 for rehabilitation of child labourers. Under the NCLP, the children in the age group of 9-14 years are rescued/withdrawn from work and enrolled in the NCLP Special Training Centres, where they are provided with bridge education, vocational training, mid-day meal, stipend, health care, etc. before being mainstreamed into formal education system.  The children in the age group of 5-8 years are directly linked to the formal education system through a close coordination with the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan.Contd…2/-::  2  ::           	Further, to ensure effective enforcement of the provisions of the Child and Adolescent  Labour (Prohibition and   Regulation) Act, 1986  and smooth implementation of the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme a separate online portal  ‘Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour’  (PENCiL) has been launched w.e.f. 26.9.2017. The Portal connects Central Government to State Government(s), District(s), all Project Societies and the General public.  Further, online complaints regarding child labour can also be filed by anybody on the Pencil Portal. The complaint gets assigned to the concerned Nodal Officer automatically by the system for further necessary action.          	 Two more modules - ‘Attendance’ and ‘Stipend payment’ have been added to the Portal. These facilitate Stipend payment to the eligible children enrolled at the Special Training Centers directly to   their Bank accounts. (b):		  The amount spent under NCLP Scheme during 2017-18, 2018-19  & 2019-20 was  Rs.94.03 crore,  Rs.89.99  crore and           Rs.77.47 crore respectively. (c):	  	The details of number of children who were rescued/withdrawn from work, rehabilitated and mainstreamed under the NCLP project per State during the last three years is at Annexure.(d) & (e):	 Under the NCLP Scheme, the District Project Society at District level are required to conduct the baseline survey to identify child labourers. Based on the number of child labourers identified and rescued from the survey, Special Training Centres under NCLP Scheme   are opened for rehabilitation of the child labourers in the age group of 9-14 years. However, witnessing a large number of migration of labourers along with their family back to their village from big cities/towns during COVID pandemic and the possibility that the children of these workers / labourers due to circumstances may slip into being Child Labourers, Ministry of Labour & Employment had issued advisory to all  States /UTs  to ensure that all such children are immediately linked to education system and be prevented and pre-empted from being child labourers.  While action needs to be taken as per law against the employers, such children need to be immediately identified and arrangements be made for their food, shelter, safe transportation and re-union with their families.  *                                                    *******
