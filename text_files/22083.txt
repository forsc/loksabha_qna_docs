To reduce dependency on imported pulses and edible oils, Government has been implementing various programmes such as National Food Security Mission (NFSM) and NFSM-Oilseeds & Oil Palm, to improve the production of pulses and essential edible oils in the country. Besides, under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), funds are being provided to states for improving the production of pulses. To address high import of turmeric, steps are being taken to organize cultivation of varieties with high curcumin content in clusters in suitable areas.  To meet the growing demand of raw cashew nuts in the country, the government seeks to increase the area with high yielding varieties, high density planting, rejuvenation of senile orchards, canopy management, etc.(c) & (d):    Yes, sir. During 2019-20 the import of Agri commodities was 19.91 USD Billion and the import of vegetable oils constituted the largest share i.e.  48%. The import of vegetable oils was undertaken with a view to bridge the gap between domestic demand and supply. The Government has been implementing Centrally Sponsored Scheme, National Food Security Mission (Oilseeds and Oil palm) in the country. This mission comprises of three Sub missions namely, NFSM-Oil Seeds, NFSM-Oil palm and NFSM- Tree Born Oil seeds (TBOs) being implemented through Agriculture and Horticulture departments of State Governments. A special programme on Targeting Rice Fallow Area (TRFA) and special programme on rapeseeds & mustard have also been initiated in ten States.  (e):      With a view to ensure self-sufficiency in agriculture, Government is also implementing  several flagship schemes namely, scheme of distribution of Soil Health Cards to farmers so that the use of fertilizers can be rationalized; “Per drop more crop” initiative under which drip/sprinkler irrigation is being encouraged for optimal utilization of water, reducing cost of inputs and increasing productivity; “Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY)” is being implemented for promoting organic farming; Under e-NAM initiative farmers are being provided an electronic transparent and competitive online trading platform; Under “Har Medh Par Ped”, agro forestry is being promoted for additional income;  Bee keeping has been promoted under Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) to increase the productivity of crops through pollination and increase the honey production as an additional source of income to farmers.*********
