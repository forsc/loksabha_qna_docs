The State Government of Tamil Nadu has represented about the problems of the sugar sector specific to the State.(b) to (d): 	Due to severe drought  prevailing in the State on account of failure of rainfall and acute water stress, there has been decline in area under cane cultivation and yield per hectare. It has resulted in shortfall in cane availability, low capacity utilization and reduction in sugar production by sugar mills.(e): 	During sugar season 2011-12, sugar production in Tamil Nadu was 23.79 Lakh MT and it was the fourth largest sugar producing state. However, due to reasons  indicated in reply to part ‘d’ above, sugar production during current sugar season 2018-19 has declined to 7.24 Lakh MT.
