Erstwhile Ministry of Rehabilitation allotted Plots, built up houses and tenementsto such refugees on lease hold basis.All allotments and execution of lease deeds in this regard were done by the erstwhile Ministry of Rehabilitation. From time to time the records were transferred to Land &Development Office, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs and accordingly, this office has been maintaining the records.As per the Act, “displaced person means anyone who, on account of the setting up of the Dominions of India and Pakistan, or on account of civil disturbances or the fear of such disturbances in any area now forming part of West Pakistan, has, after the first day of March, 1947, left, or been displaced from, his place of residence in such area and who has been subsequently residing in India, and includes any person who is resident in any place now forming part of India and who for that reason is unable or has been rendered unable to manage, supervise or control any immovable property belonging to him in Pakistan, and also includes the successors-in-interest of any such person”. The DPCR Act, 1954 has been repealed. Allotments done by erstwhile Ministry of Rehabilitation include around 57,400 residential, 1,600 commercial, 1,430 institutional and 110 industrial properties; out of which about 34,600 properties have been converted into freehold. Total revenue generated during the last five years including current year is approx. Rs.1316.02 crore.                                      *****
