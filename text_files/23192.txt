ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a):	Opening of new Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) is a continuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government/UT administration to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of the permanent building and making available required temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV depends on the availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority. (b):	A JNV is already functioning since 1986–87 in Jaunpur district of Uttar Pradesh under which Machhlishahar town falls. State/UT/District-wise list of 56 JNVs set up during the last five years is annexed.(c) to (f): The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country for providing good quality modern education to the talented children predominantly from rural areas. All the districts                                         (as on 31st May, 2014) of the States/UTs, which have accepted the scheme, have been covered.*****
