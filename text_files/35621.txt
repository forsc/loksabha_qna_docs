ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) Yes, Sir. As per data received from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the total number of e-RUPI vouchers issued so far is 2,29,527 as on 13.03.2022. The category-wise details are as under: Purpose	Sponsor	Number of Vouchers issued till 13.03.2022Covid 19 Vaccination	Private entities	2,29,257Education Scholarship program by Karnataka Government	Karnataka Government	270Total		               2,29,527(b) e-RUPI, which was launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on 02.08.2021, is a cashless and contactless payment instrument for digital payment in the form of a QR code or SMS string-based e-Voucher delivered to beneficiaries. e-RUPI vouchers are person-specific and purpose-specific, i.e., identified beneficiaries can redeem the vouchers only for the purpose for which the benefit is specifically intended by the sponsoring entity (Government or private). Further, the beneficiary does not need to have a linked bank account for receiving and redeeming e-RUPI vouchers. e-RUPI connects sponsors of services with beneficiaries and service providers in a digital manner, and ensures that the benefit reaches the intended beneficiaries in a targeted and leak-proof manner. As on date, e-RUPI vouchers have been used for CoVID-19 vaccination, and the State Government of Karnataka has also initiated e-RUPI voucher disbursement to students under its scholarship programme. (c) and (d): No such proposal has been initiated by NPCI as on date.(e) Private companies/ corporates can be sponsors for issuance of e-RUPI vouchers. NPCI has issued guidelines on the same also, vide their Circular dated 27.09.2021. The first e-RUPI use case (Covid-19 vaccination) involved vouchers sponsored by private entities.***
