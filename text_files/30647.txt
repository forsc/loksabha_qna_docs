ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (d) In occasional isolated cases vaccination certificates are generated for people who were deceased or those who did not receive the vaccine. These cases are due to inadvertent data entry errors by vaccinator in updation of vaccination data of second dose of beneficiaries. The beneficiaries who are due for the second dose of vaccine are traced on the Co-WIN using Mobile Number, Beneficiary reference ID, Photo ID card number and their vaccination status is updated on Co-WIN for second dose. As per the operational guidelines on Covid-19 Vaccination issued by Government of India, each beneficiary should be verified prior to administration of vaccine dose with any of the nine prescribed photo ID cards.Further, a 4-digit secret code feature has also been incorporated on appointment slip for generation through online appointments for vaccination which is shared with vaccinator at the time of vaccination. This is to ensure that the rightful beneficiary receives the vaccine dosage and there is no misuse.MoHFW has also advised States/UTs on multiple occasions to ensure correctness of data entry.
