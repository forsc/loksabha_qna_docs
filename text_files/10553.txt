                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (c) Department of Land Resources (DoLR) has sanctioned 270 watershed development projects in Tamil Nadu during 2009-10 to 2014-15 covering an area of about 13.68 lakh hectare at a total cost of Rs.1643.91 crore. The erstwhile Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) was amalgamated in 2015-16 as the Watershed Development Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (WDC – PMKSY). As on 30.11.2019, an amount of Rs.924.94 crore has been released to Tamil Nadu as Central Share for implementation of Watershed Development Projects.The normative period for completion of a project is 4 to 7 years, i.e. 1 to 2 years for the Preparatory Phase, 2 to 3 years for the Works Phase and 1 to 2 years for the Consolidation Phase. Out of 270 sanctioned projects of Tamil Nadu, 64 projects are in works phase, 94 projects are in consolidation phase and 112 projects are reported to be completed. The Government is focusing on completion of all on-going projects and therefore, no new projects under PMKSY – WDC are being sanctioned to any State including Tamil Nadu. *****
