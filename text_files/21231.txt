                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING (DR. SANJEEV KUMAR BALYAN)(a) to (c) As per the Article 246(3) of the Constitution of India in List II of Seventh Schedule, the Preservation, protection and improvement of stock and prevention of animal diseases; veterinary training and practice is under State list on which the State has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule.       	As per the Eleventh Schedule of Constitution of India, the state may endow Panchyats to establish and run the Cattle Pounds (Kanji Houses)/Gaushala Shelters (community assets). Many States are establishing the Gaushalas and Shelter houses for control of Stray Cattle.  Therefore, it is the responsibility of the local bodies to control the stray animals. Many State Governments have created animal Shelters for the homeless roaming animals.		However, the Animal Welfare Board of India is also providing grant-in-aid under the Scheme for Shelter House for looking after the animals. The objective of this scheme is to establish and maintain shelter houses for distressed animals in the country. Many States are also implementing various programmes for control of stray cattle by incentivizing the gaushalas for feed, fodder and veterinary care.******
