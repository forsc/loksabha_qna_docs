MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a): Education being in the Concurrent List, creation of new institutions and enhancing the quality of education are the responsibilities of both the Central and State Governments. However, recognizing the need for central assistance, the Central Government has implemented various schemes for supporting State Governments.

Although, no MDCs were specifically approved for the districts of Deogarh and Godda, 9 more MDCs, in addition to the one in Dumka, have been approved for the State of Jharkhand under RUSA.(d): Under the scheme of RUSA, it was envisaged to provide central support for 130 units under the component of New Model Degree Colleges and this target has already been achieved.*****
