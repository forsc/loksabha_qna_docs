THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR TEXTILES  (SMT. DARSHANA JARDOSH)(a) to (d):	With an objective to provide financial assistance to a group of entrepreneurs to establish state-of-the-art infrastructure facilities in a cluster for setting up their textile units, confirming to international environmental and social standards and thereby mobilize private investment in the textile sector and generate fresh employment opportunities, the government has been implementing Scheme for Industrial parks (SITP) since 2005.For each park, there is a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) formed by the representatives of local industry, financial institutions, State industrial and infrastructural corporations and other agencies of State and Central Governments.  The SPV is registered under the Companies Act.  The project cost covers common infrastructure and buildings for production/ support activities (including textile machinery, textiles engineering, accessories, packaging) depending on the need of textile park.The total financial support by GoI is limited to 40% of the project cost subject to a maximum of     Rs.40 crores.  However, support will be provided @90% of the project cost subject to a ceiling of  Rs.40 crores for first two projects (each) in the States of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and UT of Laddakh and UT of Jammu & Kashmir.Recently, the Government has approved setting up of 7 (Seven) PM Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM MITRA) Parks in Greenfield/Brownfield sites to develop world class infrastructure including plug and play facility with an outlay of Rs.4445 Crore for a period of seven years upto    2027-28. The PM MITRA Parks Scheme shall be implemented on pan-India basis and is intended for holistic development of the textile sector. The   willing state governments having ready availability of contiguous and encumbrance-free land parcel of 1000+ acres are eligible to apply under the Scheme. It is envisaged to be on Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. There is a provision of Development Capital Support (DCS) @30% of the project cost with a maximum support of Rs.500 Cr and Rs.200 Cr per park for Greenfield and Brownfield PM MITRA Park, respectively for creation of core Infrastructure.
