ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT & HIGHWAYS (Shri NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI) (a) & (b)    Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) has launched Road Requirement Plan-I (RRP-I) in 2009 with an objective to improve road connectivity in Naxal affected/Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas in 9 States, viz., Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhatisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh. A total of 234 works involving improvement of 5362 km of roads were sanctioned by this Ministry under RRP-I, out of which 210 works of 5038 km length have been completed. The details of physical and financial progress of these works during the last three years are at Annexure-I. Subsequently, Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) also launched Road Connectivity Project for Left Wing Extremism Affected Areas (RCPLWEA) in the year 2016 to improve the road connectivity in 44 worst affected LWE districts and some adjoining districts in the above 9 States, viz. Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh. The scheme has twin objectives of ensuring socio-economic development of the area as also enabling smooth and seamless anti-LWE operations by the security forces.  A total of 10,901.45 km road length has been sanctioned by MoRD and 5,560.74 km of road length has been completed. The details of physical and financial progress during the last three years under RCPLWEA, State wise under MoRD are at Annexure - IA. (c)    No proposal has been received and approved under RRP-I by MoRTH during the last three years and the current year as most of the works under RRP-I have already been sanctioned. The details of proposals approved and those pending under RCPLWE by MoRD during the last 3 years and current year, State-wise are at Annexure -II.(d) & (e) While implementing the schemes, challenges like availability of limited construction hours per day, lack of consistent/adequate deployment of security personnel, frequent bandhs/strikes called by naxals, lesser participation of bidders in naxal affected areas etc., have been faced, which had impacted the overall progress of the scheme. Other issues  like delays in land acquisition, forest clearance, poor contracting capacity of States, lack of response to tenders, law and order issues, financial capability of States to release funds in time, execution capacity of states / State Rural Road Development Authorities (SRRDAs), which hindered progress of the scheme are also encountered. Several steps, like delegation of powers to State Government authorities to accept bids with higher tender rates compared to normal cases, increase in deployment of security personnel to the extent feasible, allowing splitting of works to facilitate deployment of more number of local contractors etc., have been taken to expedite the completion of the works as well as to bring remote and naxal affected areas into mainstream through road connectivity program. Similarly, other measures like, making eligible  the Tribal (Schedule V) areas and selected Tribal / Backward Districts / unconnected habitations in these areas with a population of 250 persons and above in the Core Network as per 2001 Census  under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna (PMGSY) for connectivity with roads, additional relaxation to connect habitations with population of 100 persons and above as per 2001 census in the critical Left-Wing Extremism affected blocks (as identified by Ministry of Home Affairs) have also been taken. The programme is being monitored at regular intervals through Regional Review Meetings (RRMs), Performance Review Committee (PRC) Meetings and Pre-Empowered / Empowered Committee Meetings with the States. Necessary hand- holding of the state in this regard was done wherever required through Inter-departmental meetings etc.
