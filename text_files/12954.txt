ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) & (b): There is no such proposal. There is already a well-established mechanism existing for monitoring of expenditure.Rule 57 to 70 of the General Financial Rules (GFRs), 2017 in Chapter 3 under the head, ‘Control of Expenditure against Budget’ (Annexure Refers) lays out clear roles and responsibility centres for effective control and monitoring over-expenditure by Departments/Ministries. Further, the Civil Ministries in the Government of India are using the platform of Public Financial Management System (PFMS) for expenditure monitoring and releasing of Grant in Aid.Public Financial Management System (PFMS) is a web-based online software application of the Controller General of Accounts to provide a sound Public Financial Management System for Government of India by establishing a comprehensive payment, receipt and accounting network and also serving as Management Information System for expenditure monitoring through various modules.******
