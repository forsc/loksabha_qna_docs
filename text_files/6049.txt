                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a): 	No such specific data is maintained centrally. However, as per the Report on “Economic Burden of Tobacco Related Diseases in India”, the total economic costs attributable to tobacco use from all diseases in India in the year 2011 for persons aged 35-69 amounted to Rs. 1,04,500 crores. State/UT-wise details are not available. (b): 	The Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates are prescribed on the recommendation of the GST Council. All tobacco products are covered in the highest slab of 28% under GST. (c) to (e): 	The tobacco control policy of the Government is focused on discouraging the use of tobacco, with special emphasis on protection of children and young people with a view to achieve improvement of public health in general as enshrined in Article 47 of the Constitution. The objective of taxation on tobacco products is not revenue generation. The purpose of the taxation on tobacco products is to increase the prices of these products so that there is a reduction in demand of these products. Taxation supplements the efforts of the Government towards reduction in tobacco use.
