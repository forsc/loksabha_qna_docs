At present, 189 New Line projects are in different stages of planning/approval/execution, out of these 58 New line projects have been included in the Budget during last five years. The Project-wise and Zone wise details including cost and outlay are made available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in > Ministry of Railways > Railway Board > About Indian Railways > Railway Board Directorates > Finance (Budget) > Pink Book (Year) > Railway-wise Works, Machinery & Rolling Stock Programme (RSP).(c): 	Thorough review of the projects has been carried out and projects have been prioritized. Funds have been allocated to these works to complete them expeditiously rather than thinly spreading the resources. Institutional financing for assured funding of viable projects has been arranged, which has increased Railways’ capacity for committed fund provision for these projects.*****
