ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER FOR HEAVY INDUSTRIES & PUBLIC ENTERPRISES(SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR) (a to d):  Job reservation is available to Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) as per the extant Government policy. The Government follows a policy of disinvestment in CPSEs through Strategic Disinvestment and Minority Stake sale. The Minority Stake sale does not involve transfer of management control of CPSE. Strategic Disinvestment implies disinvestment of substantial stake of government shareholding of CPSEs along with transfer of management control. It is expected that the strategic buyer will bring funds / technology / new management etc. for the optimum development of business potential of the CPSEs under Strategic Disinvestment. The growth of the CPSEs, post Disinvestment, would be able to generate higher economic activity including growth of the ancillary industries and will create job opportunities for all including SCs, STs and OBCs. Details of the disinvestment transactions made in various CPSEs company-wise and category-wise during last 3 years are given at Annexure.(e & f):  Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) collects information in respect of CPSEs as per input performa of its Public Enterprises (PE) Survey, which is a public document and placed on the Table of the House every year. As per information available, the total numbers of SCs / STs / OBCs employees in CPSEs as on 31-3-2019 are as follows:Year as on 	Total On-Roll Employees	SC Emp.	ST Emp.	OBC Emp.	Total SC+ST+OBC	% of Total (F/B)	In Lakhs (in %) A	B	C	D	E	F	G31-03-2019	10.31	1.81(17.53)	1.02(9.86)	1.97(19.15)	4.80	46.54CPSE wise and category-wise (Executives, Supervisor and Non-Executives) detail in this regard is available at Statement No. 24, Volume-I of PE Survey.During last two years i.e. 2017-18 and 2018-19, the representation of SCs / STs / OBCs employees in CPSEs stood at 46.30% as on 31.03.2018 and 46.54% as on 31-3-2019. *****
