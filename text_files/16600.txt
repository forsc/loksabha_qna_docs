                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) & (b):	Soon after the outbreak of novel coronavirus  on 7th January, 2020, several measures like progressive tightening of international  travel,  issuing  advisories  for  members  of  the  public, -2-L.S.US.Q.NO.437 FOR 15.09.2020setting up quarantine facilities etc. were taken by the Central Government to contain the spread of COVID-19. World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as pandemic on 11th March, 2020. Experts, keeping in view the global experiences of countries which have been successful in containing the spread of COVID-19, unlike some others where many people died, have recommended that effective measures for social distancing should be taken to contain the spread of this pandemic.Between 16-23 March, 2020, most of the States Governments/UTs resorted to partial or full lockdown in their respective State/UT based upon their assessment of the situation.COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease. Any mass movement of people would have spread the disease very fast amongst people in all parts of the country. Taking into consideration the above facts, the global experience and the need for consistency in the approach and implementation of various containment measures across the country, a Nationwide lockdown was announced on 24th March, 2020 to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the country.-3-L.S.US.Q.NO.437 FOR 15.09.2020(c):	All guidelines/clarifications/ amendments/ addendums, etc, issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) are available at websites of MHA & MoHFW (www.mha.gov.in)and (www.mohfw.gov.in) respectively.(d) and (e): By imposing country-wide lock-down, India successfully blunted the aggressive spread of COVID. The period of lockdown helped the nation create much required additional health infrastructure. During this time, dedicated isolation beds recorded an increase of 22 times and dedicated ICU beds above 14 times to what existed in March 2020. Similarly, laboratory capacity for testing COVID was increased nearly 10 times during this period. Similarly, the limited indigenous manufacturing capacity available for masks, personal protective equipments, ventilators, etc. at the time of lockdown, was also enhanced to attain self-reliance. It has been estimated that the decision of Lockdown, by slowing down the spread of pandemic in India, has prevented 14–29 lakh cases and 37–78 thousand deaths. **********
