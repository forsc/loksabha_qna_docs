Such posts are revived based on the functional justification. There is no system of abolishing posts in the Railways.(e):   Based on the vacancies reported by the user Departments, the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) has started recruitment process to fill up 1,05,338 posts during the year 2019 and 2020. During 2017-18, Centralized Employment Notifications (CENs) for 1,27,573 combined vacancies of various Group ''C'' and Level-1 posts were notified by the Ministry of Railways - for new and future vacancies to arise in two years time. Another five CENs covering 1,56,138 vacancies of various Group ''C'' and Level-1 posts were issued in 2018-19. The Department of Posts have also conducted examination/notified to fill up 19522 vacancies, other than those to be filled up through SSC, in various grades.
