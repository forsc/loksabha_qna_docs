ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	The fluctuations in market prices of agricultural produce is dependent on variety of factors at any given point of time like demand and supply of the produce, climatic conditions, perishable nature of produce and availability of transport. The quality parameters also play an important role in the price of a commodity. 	Impact of climate change on Indian agriculture was studied under National Innovations in Climate Resiilent Agriculture (NICRA). Rainfed rice yields in India are projected to reduce marginally (?2.5%) in 2050 and 2080 and irrigated rice yields by 7% in 2050 and 10% in 2080 scenarios. Further, wheat yield projected to reduce by 6-25% in 2100 and maize yields by 18-23%. Future climates are likely to benefit chickpea with increase in productivity (23-54%).	Government of India has taken several steps to protect the farmers from distress sale, some of which are as follows:	Government launched an umbrella scheme of ‘Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan’ (PM-AASHA) by incorporating the erstwhile Price Support Scheme (PSS) with certain modifications and rolling out of new schemes of Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) and pilot of Private Procurement and Stockist Scheme (PPSS) has been launched. 	With a view to provide better insurance coverage to crops for risk mitigation, a crop insurance scheme namely Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) was launched from Kharif 2016 season. This scheme provides insurance cover for all stages of the crop cycle including post-harvest risks in specified instances, with low premium contribution by farmers.	Further with a view to provide social security net for Small and Marginal Farmers (SMF) as they have minimal or no savings to provide for old age and to support them in the event of consequent loss of livelihood, the Government is implementing a new Central Sector Scheme i.e. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan Dhan Yojana (PM-KMY) for providing old age pension to these farmers. Under this Scheme, provision has been made for a minimum fixed pension of Rs. 3000/- to the eligible small and marginal farmers, subject to certain exclusion clauses, on attaining the age of 60 years.  	Bee keeping has been promoted under mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) to increase the productivity of crops through pollination and increase the honey production as an additional source of income of farmers.(c) & (d):	With a view to provide income support to all farmer families across the country, to enable them to take care of expenses related to agriculture and allied activities as well as domestic needs, Government had started a new Central Sector Scheme, namely, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN). The scheme aims to provide a payment of Rs 6000/- per year, in three 4-monthly instalments of Rs 2000/- . 	To ensure flow of adequate credit, Government sets annual target for the flow of credit to the agriculture sector and Banks have been consistently surpassing the annual target. The agriculture credit flow target has been set at Rs. 13.50 lakh crore for the F.Y.2019-20, Rs.15.00 lakh crore for F.Y. 2020-21 and Rs 16.50 lakh crore for FY 2021-22.	Extending the reach of institutional credit to more and more farmers is priority area of the Government and to achieve this goal, the Government provides interest subvention of 2% on short-term crop loans up to Rs.3.00 lakh. Presently, loan is available to farmers at an interest rate of 4% per annum on prompt repayment.	Further, under Interest Subvention Scheme 2018-19, in order to provide relief to the farmers on occurrence of natural calamities, the interest subvention of 2% shall continue to be available to banks for the first year on the restructured amount. In order to discourage distress sale by farmers and to encourage them to store their produce in warehouses against negotiable receipts, the benefit of interest subvention will be available to small and marginal farmers having Kisan Credit Card for a further period of upto six months of post harvest on the same rate as available to crop loan.	The Government has extended the facility of Kisan Credit Card (KCC) to the farmers practicing animal husbandry and fisheries related activities.  Processing fee, inspection, ledger folio charges and all other service charges for short term crop loans upto Rs.3.00 lakh have been waived off. Collateral free loan limit for short term agri-credit has been raised from Rs.1.00 lakh to Rs.1.60 lakh.. KCC will be issued within 14 days from the receipt of completed application.	Government of India has been promoting agri marketing reforms so as to ensure remunerative prices to farmers, some of which are as follows:i).	The Model Agricultural Produce & Livestock Marketing (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2017 ;ii).	The Farmers’ Produce Trade & Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020;iii).	The Farmers (Empowerment an Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020;iv).	The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020	National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) platform facilitates online trading of agriculture and horticulture commodities to enable farmers to realize better remunerative prices for their produce.*****
