ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (d): Due to COVID-19 pandemic, there are restrictions on international flight operations to/from India. However, India has formalized Air Bubble arrangements with 24 countries as on 20.01.2021. These Air Bubble arrangements provide access directly or through transit facility to more than 100 countries. Under the ambit of these Air Bubble arrangements, all designated airlines including Air India are free to select whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate. It is, therefore, upon the airlines to provide air services to specific places with whichever type of aircraft they decide, depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability.
