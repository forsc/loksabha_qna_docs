ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE; MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MINISTER OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a)	No, Sir. The scientists of the constituent laboratories of Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) have been pursuing cutting edge research innovations in advanced knowledge frontiers of science and thus has been delivering as per national priorities.  CSIR has published around 5370 papers in SCI Journals during 2020 with average impact factor of 3.780.  Pioneer of India''s intellectual property movement, CSIR today is strengthening its patent portfolio to carve out global niches for the country in select technology domains.  During the period 2018-19 to 2020-21, CSIR has filed 522 patents in India and 533 abroad and was granted 592 and 733 patents in India and abroad respectively.  This reflects the motivation of CSIR scientists to aim for excellence in their field of expertise in various research domains.  The Scientists  position during the last three years at CSIR is as under:Scientists in position (in number) as on01.04.2018	01.04.2019	01.04.20203558	3460	3482The total fund allocated and spent by CSIR to promote and pursue R&D in the field of science and technology during the last three years and the current year are as follows:Financial Year	Fund Allocated / Spent(Rs. in Crore)2017-18	4582.122018-19	4521.282019-20 	4831.582020-21 (Revised Estimates)	4208.40                 3914.06 (spent up                 to  January, 2021)(b)	 and (c) CSIR has been receiving strong support from Government and industries since its inception.  Over the years, CSIR is continuously reinventing itself to remain competitive.  In the process, several committees were constituted and CSIR strived to change itself as suggested by these committees.  With the socio-economic scenario in the Country changing with the much desired and enabling interventions of the Government of India, CSIR can play even a bigger role in development of socially and industrially relevant technologies and innovations for masses in the country.  With this view, the competent authority had constituted a very high level committee for re-orientation of CSIR for extending technological support to Indian Industry.  To implement the recommendations of this high level committee, CSIR has initiated appropriate action and constituted an Overarching Committee and eight area-wise sub-committees, and action to provide CSIR the pathway for complete repositioning and making it 21st century ready organization. *****
