                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES & PENSIONS AND PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR.JITENDRA SINGH):  (a)&(b) There are presently twenty two (22) reactors with a capacity of 6780 MW in operation and one more reactor KAPP-3 (700 MW) has been connected to the grid on January 10, 2021. In addition, ten (10) reactors, with a total capacity of 8000 MW (including PFBR being implemented by BHAVINI) are presently at various stages of construction / commissioning. The Government has also accorded administrative approval and financial sanction for ten (10) more reactors with an aggregate capacity of 7000 MW in June-2017. The capital investment for the nuclear power projects is being funded with a debt to equity ratio of 70:30. The equity part is funded from internal resources of NPCIL and Government Budgetary Support. (c)&(d) The  present  policy (Consolidated FDI Policy of Government) puts atomic energy in the list of prohibited sectors.  However, there is no restriction on FDI in the nuclear industry for manufacturing of equipment and providing other supplies for nuclear power plants and related other facilities.  Government of India has amended the Atomic Energy Act, 1962 in 2015 to enable the licensing of NPCIL’s Joint Ventures for setting up nuclear power projects.  To boost domestic investment, Joint Ventures have been formed by NPCIL with public sector majors viz. National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) and Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL).(e)	 Yes, Sir.(f)	 Four indigenous Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs), each of 700 MW are to be set up at Gorakhpur in Fatehabad district of Haryana. These are planned in two phases of twin units – GHAVP 1&2 (2X700 MW) and GHAVP 3&4 (2X700 MW). Construction activities have started on the first phase (GHAVP 1&2), while pre-project activities for second phase (GHAVP-3&4) are in progress.*****
