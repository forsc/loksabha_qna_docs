As of June 2019, the total number of internet and broadband subscribers were 23.8 crore and 20.3 crore respectively in the rural areas of the country. As per data collected from the Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) in 2019, it is estimated that out of total 5,97,618 inhabited villages (as per the Census 2011) in the country, 5,69,897 are covered by mobile services. Mobile coverage in remaining villages is being provided by the Government and Telecom Service Providers in a phased manner.BharatNet project is being implemented in a phased manner to provide broadband/internet connectivity to all the Gram Panchayats (approx. 2,50,000) in the country. As on 07.11.2019, a total of 1,28,376 GPs have been made Service Ready.  The State-wise details are given in Annexure-I. As part of BharatNet project, the Last Mile connectivity, through Wi-Fi or any other suitable broadband technology, to access broadband /internet services, is to be provided at all Gram Panchayats (GPs) in the country. Accordingly, the provisioning of 2 Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) for about 1.25 lakh GPs under Ph-I is under implementation. As of now, Wi-Fi hotspots have been installed in 45,769 GPs and services are being provided in 16,151 GPs. The State-wise details are given in Annexure-I. Under Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) scheme, 25,000 public Wi-Fi hotspots are being set up using the infrastructure of telephone exchanges of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) in rural areas of the country. As of October 2019, Wi-Fi hotspots have been set up /installed in 24,118 rural exchanges and out of them, Wi-Fi services are being provided at 23,082 rural exchanges. (c) & (d)	In order to review the strategy and approach to align National Optical Fibre Network (NOFN) with the vision of Digital India and towards speedy implementation of NOFN, an Expert Committee was constituted by the Government of India in January, 2015. The Expert Committee recommended, inter alia, for renaming the project as “BharatNet”. The Expert Committee also recommended the creation of an Empowered Project Group, mainly to take decisions on matters referred to it by Bharat Broadband Network Limited (BBNL), which are beyond the purview of BBNL to decide.Based on the recommendations of the Expert Committee and implementation experience of Phase-I, the Union Cabinet in the year 2017 approved a modified implementation strategy for the project (renamed as BharatNet). (e)	In the modified strategy approved by the Union Cabinet, the State-led model is also included for implementation of BharatNet Phase-II. Accordingly, based on the Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) submitted by the States, the Telecom Commission (Now known as Digital Communications Commission) has approved the implementation of BharatNet Phase-II under State-led Model in 8 States namely Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Odisha and Telangana. The Memorandum of Understandings (MoUs) have been signed with the States and the project execution is at different stages of implementation.
