ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (d):	The information in respect of the  number  of applications for NEET UG from students who passed out from Government schools between 2015 and 2020 qualified and joined medical colleges is not maintained centrally.(e) & (f):	No. There is no proposal to abolish NEET exam. Section 10D of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 prescribes conducting of a uniform entrance examination namely National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) to all medical educational institutions at undergraduate and post-graduate level.  The provisions of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 for conducting NEET shall apply across the country without any exemption to any State. NEET has resulted in ensuring better and minimum standards of medical education, curbing malpractices in medical admission, led to greater transparency and reduced the burden on prospective students of appearing in multiple entrance exams.
