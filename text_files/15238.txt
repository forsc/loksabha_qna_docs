                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) to (d):	‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibilities to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens including investigation and prosecution of crime against children rest with the respective State Governments. The State Governments are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provisions of laws.	However, Ministry of Home Affairs attaches high importance towards the cases of crimes against  children  and  therefore  issues  advisories  to -2-L.S.US.Q.NO.3859 FOR 17.03.2020State Governments/ Union Territories from time to time to prevent such cases. The details of these advisories are at www.mha.gov.in.  To safeguard the rights of children, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has been constituted, which  is a statutory body under the Commissions for Protection of Child Rights (CPCR) Act, 2005 and is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Women & Child Development, Government of India. The Commission''s mandate is to ensure that all Laws, Policies, Programmes, and Administrative Mechanisms are in consonance with the Child Rights perspective as enshrined in the Constitution of India and also the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. NCPCR is also mandated to take suo moto cognizance of violation of child rights and examine factors that inhibit the enjoyment of rights of children. States have also constituted State Commissions for Protection of Child Rights. NCPCR has issued an advisory dated 14.12.2019 to all Chief Secretaries and DGPs to look into matters involving misuse of children in the protests against the CAA in different parts of the country. Further, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), a statutory public body is also responsible for the protection and promotion of human rights.
