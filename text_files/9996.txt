However, losses due to localized risks of hailstorm, landslide, inundation, cloud burst & natural fire and post-harvest losses are calculated on individual insured farm level, based on the report of the joint committee comprising of representatives of the State Government and the concerned insurance company to survey the extent of loss.  Further, there  is also a provision to pay claims towards prevented sowing/failed germination and adhoc claims in case of mid season adversity.  West Bengal State opted for the scheme in Kharif 2016 season and implemented the PMFBY and Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS) till Rabi 2018-19.  The State Government of West Bengal is implementing its own crop insurance scheme from Kharif 2019 season.  Details of claims paid in West Bengal under PMFBY and RWBCIS are given below :                                                                                                                   (Rs. in crore)Season	Admissible Claim Amount	Approved Claim Amount	Claims Amount paid2016-17	421.70	421.70	418.24*2017-18	257.11	256.63	256.632018-19	372.23	189.44	173.89***   Claims are pending due to National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) failure.** Claims are pending due to non-receipt of State Government share in premium subsidy.
