ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) & (b) The Central Ground Water Board generates ground water quality data on a regional scale during various scientific studies and ground water quality monitoring throughout the country. These studies indicate the occurrence of fluoride and arsenic, beyond the BIS permissible limits, in isolated pockets in certain parts of the country. Fluoride beyond permissible limit has been encountered in certain isolated pockets (point source) of 370 districts in 23 States and arsenic in certain isolated pockets (point source) of 152 districts in 21 States. State-wise details of fluoride and arsenic contamination of ground water in India including the districts of Assam is given in Annexure-I. (c) & (d) Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management, including preventing the contamination of groundwater is primarily States’ responsibility.  However, various steps have been taken by the Central Government in this regard in the country. Some of them are given at Annexure II. Further, the quality of groundwater can be improved to some extent if concerted efforts are made to improve the groundwater resources through appropriate groundwater recharge/rainwater harvesting. Government of India has taken a number of initiatives in this direction which can be seen at URL:http://jalshakti-dowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_ depletion_Feb2021.pdf. To address the contamination problems in drinking water, Government of India in collaboration with States is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) since August, 2019 to provide potable tap water supply of prescribed quality to every rural household in the country by 2024. Under JJM, while planning water supply schemes to provide tap water supply to house-holds, priority is given to quality-affected habitations. The year–wise details of budgetary allocation, fund drawn & reported utilization by States/ UTs under erstwhile National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) for 2018-19 and under JJM for 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 (as on 17.03.2022) are given at Annexure-III. Further, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs has launched Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) - 2.0 on 01st October 2021 for the period of 05 years (FY 2021-22 to 2025-26), with the objective of providing universal coverage of water supply through functional household tap connection in all statutory towns in the country. ***ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) & (b) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3530 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 24.03.2022 REGARDING “CONTAMINATION OF GROUND WATER”.

QUESTION NO. 3530 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 24.03.2022 REGARDING “CONTAMINATION OF GROUND WATER”.  Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in association with State Pollution Control Boards/Pollution Control Committees (SPCBs/PCCs) is implementing the provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control) Act, 1974 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 in the country to prevent and control pollution in water. Guidelines have been notified by Government of India on 24 September 2020 for control and regulation of groundwater extraction with pan-India applicability.  The guidelines include suitable provisions on measures to be adopted to control groundwater pollution. Government of India in partnership with States, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) since August, 2019 to provide potable tap water supply of prescribed quality to every rural household in the country by 2024. Under JJM, while planning water supply schemes to provide tap water supply to house-holds, priority is given to quality-affected habitations. While allocating the funds to States/ UTs in a particular financial year, 10% weightage is given to the population residing in habitations affected by chemical contaminants including arsenic and fluoride, as on 31st March of the preceding financial year.  Since, planning, implementation and commissioning of piped water supply schemes based on a safe water source may take time, purely as an interim measure, States/ UTs have been advised to install community water purification plants (CWPPs) in such habitations, to provide potable water to every household at the rate of 8–10 litre per capita per day (lpcd) to meet their drinking and cooking requirements. Department of Drinking Water & Sanitation had launched a National Water Quality Sub-Mission (NWQSM) on 22nd March, 2017 as a part of National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), which has now been subsumed under JJM, to provide safe drinking water to 27,544 arsenic/fluoride affected rural habitations in the country.  CGWB has constructed arsenic safe exploratory wells in West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh by using innovative cement sealing technique. Further, CGWB is providing technical assistance to the States for implementing cement sealing technology in Gangetic flood plains.  ***** ANNEXURE-III ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (c) & (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3530 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 24.03.2022 REGARDING “CONTAMINATION OF GROUND WATER”.
