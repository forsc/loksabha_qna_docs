ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (d): A statement is laid on the table of the House.******; ; STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 46 REGARDING "COVERAGE OF PILGRIMAGE CENTRES" TO BE ANSWERED ON 04.02.2021.; ; (a) & (b):  UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagarik) is a market driven scheme. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under UDAN from time to time. Sankisa , Buddha pilgrimage centre and Kampil, Jain Pilgrimage centre  are located in the district of Farrukhabad, Uttar Pradesh. Farrukhabad city figures in the tentative list of unserved airports/airstrips of UDAN document. Till the completion of four rounds of bidding under UDAN, none of the airline operators have submitted the proposal to operate UDAN flight from Farrukhabad airport. However, UDAN routes connecting Shravasti , Kushinagar and Gaya of Buddhist Circuit have been awarded to the Selected Airline Operators under UDAN so far.  Further, if any airline submits valid bid for operation of UDAN flight connecting Kampil/Sankisa, Farrukhabad in future, the same will be considered as per provisions of UDAN Scheme. ; ; (c) & (d): After repeal of the Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation market has been deregulated. Consequently as a result, airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type for selecting whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate across the country subject to compliance with the Route Dispersal Guidelines (RDGs). Thus, it is up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and their commercial viability, in compliance with the RDG. However, the Ministry regularly interacts with the stakeholders from time to time with an aim to improve air connectivity.
