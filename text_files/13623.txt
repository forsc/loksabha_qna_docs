ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (c) Water Resources Projects are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priority. In order to supplement their efforts, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes such as Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) and Command Area Development & Water Management (CADWM) Programme under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY). During 2016-17, ninety-nine (99) on-going Major/Medium Irrigation projects under Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (PMKSY-AIBP) having ultimate irrigation potential of 76.03 lakh hectares and balance estimated cost of Rs.77595 crore (Central Assistance (CA) of Rs.31342 crore) have been prioritized in consultation with States for completion along with their Command Area Development & Water Management (CADWM) works. Funding mechanism through NABARD has also been approved by the Government of India for both Central and State Share under Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF). Under these AIBP Projects, use of Piped Distribution Network (PDN) is being promoted to increase the water conveyance efficiency and guidelines in this regard were also issued during July, 2017. The details of CA and State Share released and expenditure incurred in projects for AIBP works is as below: Contd…P/2    //2//                                                                                                                                          (Rs.

As per these included projects, it is targeted to develop 44.34 lakh hectare of Culturable Command Area (CCA) with total estimated cost of 18,507.80 crore (central share Rs.8186.00 crore).  The Structural Interventions under CADWM Programme are directed at bringing hydraulic connectivity to the tail-end farms through greater penetration of lined field channels.  The Project Implementing Agencies (PIAs) are  being encouraged to make use of Underground Pipe Line Network (UGPN) because of their greater acceptability by the farmers (on account of savings of land); long durability of structure ; ease of control and discipline; adaptability (through pumping) for undulating land; establishment of first right  by tail-end users; and prevention of pilferage. Further, it is provisioned in the CADWM scheme that micro–irrigation shall cover at least 10% of the targeted CCA of the Project. The details of CA and State Share released and expenditure incurred in CADWM projects is as below:                                                                                                                             (Rs.
