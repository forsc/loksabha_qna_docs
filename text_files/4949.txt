                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (f):	Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered two cases against the bullion parties of M/s Edelweiss Commodities Ltd. (ECL) and Aaryavart Commodities Pvt. Ltd. (ACPL). While HHEC has submitted that, this as per commercial arrangement and as per business module adopted by others bullion importing nominated agencies, CBI is examining the issue of availing buyer’s credit. Bullion parties whose payments have been withheld by (HHEC) have followed the process of imports as per agreements which are identical to the agreement signed between ECL and HHEC. HHEC has withheld amount of ECL against which CBI investigation is going on and other bullion parties with whom HHEC has identical agreement as signed with ECL, because any adverse decision in the CBI case with ECL will have financial implication on them as well. Further, HHEC has sought clarification from CBI with regard to withheld payment of bullion parties other than ECSL with whom HHEC has identical agreement as signed with ECSL. The CBI has been requested to clarify whether HHEC can release the payment of other bullion parties with whom HHEC has similar transactions. The response is still awaited from CBI. The  details of outstanding as on 31.3.2019 are as under:-                                                                                                            (Rs.
