This has resulted in substantial increase in pace of execution of projects from 2014 onwards. During the period 2014-2020, 15,350 km length (3,395 km of New Line, 4,401 km of Gauge Conversion and 7,554 km of Doubling) were commissioned at an average of 2558 km per year which is 68% more as compared to average commissioning of 1520 km per year during the period 2009-14.*****
