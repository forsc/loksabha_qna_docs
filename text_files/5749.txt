The civil work in the stretch from Vadakanchery to Thrissur was started in September, 2012.  However, the tunnel work was started in May, 2016. Kuthiran tunnel has been designed as 3-lane twin tube tunnel with an approximate length as 960 m, tunnel clearance as 5.5 m and operating speed as 80 kmph.  At present, 83% physical progress has been achieved in the project. As far as Kuthiran tunnel is concerned, the same has been constructed except for minor works in tunnel tube on one side and approaches due to non-availability of land and delay in Forest & Wild life Clearance.(e) & (f) The tunnel works was interrupted 16 times by the local residents between May 2016 to January 2017 for want of compensation against the damages caused to their properties at the time of drilling and blasting operations. The project is now targeted for completion by May, 2020.*****
