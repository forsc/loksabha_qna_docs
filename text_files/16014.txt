                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):	Health is a State Subject.  Hospital services are part of the integrated health services which are regulated by the State Governments concerned. As per the report of National Sample Survey 71st Round conducted by National Sample Survey Organization from January to June 2014, the average medical expenditure per hospitalization in private hospitals is more as compared to Government Hospitals. It is the responsibility of the State Governments to take cognizance of instances of unreasonable charges by private hospitals and take action to prevent and control such practices. Details of such cases are not maintained centrally.(c) & (d):	The Government of India has enacted the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010 and notified Clinical Establishments (Central Government) Rules, 2012 to provide for registration and regulation of Government (except those of Armed Forces) as well as private clinical establishments belonging to recognized systems of medicine. The State/Union Territories (UTs) that have adopted the CE Act, 2010 are primarily responsible for regulating their hospitals including private hospitals as per provisions of the applicable Act and rules thereunder to ensure quality care and for providing affordable medical treatment to patients. In the States/UTs where the CE Act, 2010 is in force, the clinical establishments are required to fulfil the conditions such as minimum standards of facilities and services, minimum requirement of personnel, maintenance of records and reports.  The clinical establishments should also adhere to other conditions including ensuring compliance to Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) issued by the Central/State Governments and display of rates charged by them at a conspicuous place. The National Council for Clinical Establishments, a statutory body provided for under the Act, has approved a standard list of medical procedures and a standard template for costing of medical procedures and the same has been shared with the States and UTs where the CE Act, 2010 is applicable, for appropriate action by them.             Currently, the Clinical Establishments Act, 2010 has been adopted by and is applicable in 11 States, namely, Sikkim, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Assam and Haryana and 5 UTs of Andaman Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Lakshadweep and Pondicherry. Other States may adopt the Act under clause (1) of Article 252 of the Constitution. The Central Government is continuously pursuing with the States to adopt the Clinical Establishment Act, 2010 and to ensure its strict implementation or to consider bringing a State specific legislation in the matter.
