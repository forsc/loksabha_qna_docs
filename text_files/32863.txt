It presents digitized district-wise Hazard Maps with respect to earthquakes, winds and floods for identification of vulnerable areas. MoHUA has requested States/UTs, other Ministries and organizations to incorporate provisions of Vulnerability Atlas of India in the tender documents, quality control and assurance plans, so that disaster mitigation measures are adequately addressed.(b)	In addition, an online edition of the Vulnerability Atlas has been launched for wider dissemination and an e-Course on Vulnerability Atlas of India has been launched in collaboration with School of Planning & Architecture (SPA), New Delhi. Further, propagation and adoption of disaster resistant construction practices is being promoted through Technology Sub-Mission under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban).(c)	Housing being State subject, formulation and implementation of building bye-laws is responsibility of States/UTs. However, for guidance of States/UTs, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has issued Model Building Bye- Laws, 2016 which has a Chapter on Structural safety.(d)	& (e) BMTPC has been organizing thematic workshops, webinars and sessions on Vulnerability Atlas of India, disaster resistant design & construction practices for officials of State/UTs governments and other stakeholders dealing with housing and infrastructure. Further, Bureau of Indian Standards has formulated a number of Indian Standards relating to safety against earthquakes, landslides and cyclones. The National Building Code of India 2016 (NBC 2016) has provisions relating to design and construction of disaster resistant buildings, which are disseminated from time to time through workshops and webinars.                                     ******
