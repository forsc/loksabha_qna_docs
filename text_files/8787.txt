                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) coordinates work of 716 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) having mandate of technology assessment and demonstration for its application and capacity development. KVKs impart training to sensitize farmers to adopt the scientific practices /methods and spread awareness about various scientific farm intensification practices like intercropping, relay cropping, integrated farming, mixed farming, etc. through various extension activities. Besides, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers’ Welfare is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme namely ‘Support to State Extension Programmes for Extension Reforms’, popularly known as ATMA Scheme, since 2005 in 684 districts of the country, wherein latest agricultural technologies and good agricultural practices such as  mixed farming through different  activities namely farmers’ training, demonstrations, exposure visits, Kisan Mela, mobilization of farmers groups and organizing farm schools on the fields of farmers are promoted.(b)	In order to ensure remunerative prices to farmers for their produce, the Government has an umbrella scheme “Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA)” which includes Price Support Scheme (PSS), Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) and Private Procurement and Stockiest Scheme (PPSS) and existing schemes of Department of Food & Public Distribution and of Ministry of Textiles. Besides, there is a Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) for procurement of agricultural/horticultural commodities, which are perishable in nature and are not covered under PSS.  The objectives of intervention is to protect the growers of these commodities from making distress sale in the event of a bumper crop during the peak arrival period when the prices tend to fall below economic levels and cost of production. In addition, the Government is also promoting storage facilities in rural areas through the scheme Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI), which is a sub-scheme under the Integrated Scheme for Agricultural Marketing (ISAM).*******
