Natural uranium fuelled Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs).2.	Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) utilizing plutonium based fuel.3.	Advanced nuclear power systems for utilization of thorium.The first two stages, natural uranium-fuelled heavy water reactors (First stage) and plutonium-fuelled fast breeder reactors (second stage) are intended to generate sufficient fissile material from India’s limited uranium resources, so that all our vast thorium reserves can be fully utilized in the third stage of nuclear power program. In stage three of program, self-sustaining advanced nuclear power systems will use Thorium-232-U-233 fuel to generate power, utilising large resources of thorium and thus ensuring long term energy security and independence.(e)&(f)Yes, Sir. As mentioned above in (d), the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) is    already carrying  out  indigenous Research and Development (R&D) activities for  development of Advanced Nuclear Power systems to meet the long term energy  requirements  of   the   country   in   line  with   our  three-stage     nuclear    power programme.*******
