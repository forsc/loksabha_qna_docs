                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)...........2/--2-(a):	The National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) provides a legal entitlement to 81.35 crore persons to avail foodgrains at highly subsidized rates. The Act provides for coverage of 75% of the rural and 50% of the urban population, i.e. about two-thirds of the total population of the country, for receiving foodgrains at highly subsidized prices of Rs.3/2/1 per kg for rice/ wheat/ coarsegrains respectively.  Under the Act, while Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households that constitute the poorest of the poor are legally entitled to receive 35 kg of foodgrains per family per month, priority households are entitled to 5 kg per person per month. The Act also has a provision for food security allowance to entitled beneficiaries in case of non-supply of entitled foodgrains or meals subject to conditions. Accordingly, Government has notified Food Security Allowance Rules, 2015 on 21.01.2015. The Act also provides for a robust Grievance Redressal and Transparency mechanism to facilitate implementation of provisions of the Act.(b) & (c):  		As part of the Economic measures (Atma Nirbhar Bharat), allocation of foodgrains, free of cost, has been made to all the States/Union Territories, for the month of May and June, 2020, for stranded migrants who are not covered under the National Food Security Act, 2013 or any other State scheme PDS Cards. Such beneficiaries shall be eligible for 5 kg of foodgrains per person per month. Identification of such beneficiaries and distribution of foodgrains to them shall be the responsibility of concerned State Government or Union Territory Administration. States/UTs collectively indicated a total population of about 2.8 crore migrants who do not have NFSA/ State ration cards and who may be potentially benefited from the distribution of free-of-cost foodgrains under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Scheme (ANBS). Under Atma Nirbhar Bharat package, States/UTs have lifted total 6.4 LMT foodgrains against total allocation of 8 LMT from FCI godowns based on estimate of migrant population in their respective state. Total 2.67 LMT foodgrains have been distributed to 2.35 crore, 2.50 crore, 32.18 lakh and 22.38 lakh migrants in the month of May, June, July and August, 2020 respectively..........3/--3-(d) to (f):  	Under Public Distribution System (PDS) reforms, the Department in association with State/UT Governments is implementing ''One Nation One Ration Card'' plan to enable nation-wide portability of ration cards under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), with an objective to enable the migrant beneficiaries to lift their entitled quota of foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) of their choice anywhere in the country by using their existing/same ration card after biometric/Aadhaar authentication on electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) device. So far, the facility is enabled in 26 States/UT, namely – Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Maharashtra, Odisha, Sikkim, Rajasthan, Punjab, Telangana, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Nagaland Manipur, Ladakh and Lakshadweep covering nearly 65 Crore beneficiaries i.e. about 80% of total NFSA population in the country. Further, this Department is continuously pursuing with remaining 10 States/UTs with an objective to enable the facility in all States/UTs by 31.03.2021.  However, integration of remaining States/UTs is dependent on their readiness to implement the same in terms of installation of ePoS devices at FPSs, enablement of biometric/Aadhaar authentication of beneficiaries and other technical aspects.****
