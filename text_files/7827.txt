ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a) Disputes in the coal sector range from grievances of coal-consumer to employees of coal companies, disputes between coal companies with tax authorities, industrial relations related, land acquisition related, and others not limited to these. These disputes are resolved as per the relevant statute and/or the terms of agreement/Memorandum of Understanding entered between concerned stakeholders. Further, a mechanism, namely Administrative Mechanism for Resolution of CPSEs Disputes (AMRCD), has been created by Department of Public Enterprises on 22nd May 2018 for resolution of any dispute or difference relating to the interpretation and application of the provisions of commercial contract(s) between Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs)/ Port Trusts inter-se and also between CPSEs and Government Departments/Organizations (excluding disputes concerning Railways, Income Tax, Customs & Excise Departments). (b&c) There is no proposal in the Ministry to constitute any independent body to resolve these disputes. ***
