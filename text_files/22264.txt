                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (c):  No Sir, no such information specifically regarding alleged bungling and diversion of Rs. 2400 crore earmarked for Scheduled Caste (SC) scholarship to poor students belonging to SC categories in Punjab has been reported to the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. However in August, 2020, the Department has received a complaint regarding alleged misappropriation of funds under the Post Matric Scholarship Scheme for SC students in the State of Punjab for the disbursals made for the period upto 2016-17. Considering the seriousness of the complaints, the Department constituted a three member Committee to examine the various allegations of wrongful payments made to private institutions & other misappropriations and to recommend a further course of action in the matter. With the aim of, inter-alia, ensuring timely delivery, comprehensive accountability, continuous monitoring and total transparency, the scheme has been revised recently. Some of the features include:?	Starting from 2021-22, the Central share in the scheme would be released on DBT mode directly into the bank accounts of the students.?	The scheme shall be run on an online platform with robust cyber security measures eliminating any chance of misuse of the scholarship. ?	Further, awareness drives shall be undertaken by the State Governments/UTs about the scheme through the Gram Panchayats Notice Boards, school committees, and discussions in the parent-teacher association meetings and other public awareness measures in order to minimize any misuse.*****
