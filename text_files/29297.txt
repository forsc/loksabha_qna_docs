ANSWER




MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a)	& (b) Yes, Sir. The process of online registration of Haj Applications for Haj 2022 has commenced with effect from 01.11.2021 and the intending pilgrims have been requested to submit their applications through the portal www.hajcommittee.gov.in and mobile App till 31.01.2022. The entire process of Haj has been made 100% digital/online which has facilitated the dream of “Ease of Doing Haj” for the Indian Muslims. Ladies without Mehram (without Male Companion), who could not perform Haj due to cancellation of Haj 2020 and Haj 2021 due to Covid 19 Pandemic, will be exempted from lottery system to perform Haj 2022.(c)	The number of pilgrims from State of Andhra Pradesh who have performed Haj in the years, 2017, 2018 and 2019 are 2797, 2327 and 1841 respectively. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia did not permit International Pilgrims for Haj 2020 and 2021, due to COVID-19 Pandemic.(d)	 & (e) The requirements for Haj 2022 have been incorporated in the Haj Guidelines which were issued on 01.11.2021. The Haj Committee of India conducts orientation training of Haj Trainers and these trainers impart training at the District level throughout the country, after the final selection of pilgrims is done. It has been decided that special focus is to be accorded on the precautionary measures & observance of COVID-19 protocols in the orientation/training sessions.  The detailed guidelines for Haj 2022 is available at http://www.hajcommittee.gov.in/guidelines.aspx.*****
