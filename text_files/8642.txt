ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d)	Under Skill India Mission, the Government has been implementing various schemes for imparting employable skills to the youth through short term and long term training. Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing a flagship scheme known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY 2.0) for imparting short term training across the country. Long term training is provided through Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs). 	Under PMKVY, Training Partners (TPs) use variety of channels for mobilisation, namely, Mass Media (radio, television, newspapers, mobile phones etc.), Small Media (posters, flyers, leaflets, guidelines, training materials, standalone banners etc.) and Kaushal Melas /Mobilisation Camps (camp-based approach). TPs are mandated to conduct Kaushal and Rozgar Melas every six months with press/media coverage; they are also required to participate actively in National Career Service Melas and on-ground activities. 	MSDE’s Skills Career Counselling Scheme aims to counsel one crore candidates from the age group of 15-35 years focusing on School & College drop-outs, young adults from the community, college students, polytechnic students, ITI students, Diploma students, Graduates, Post-Graduates, NEET category (Not in Employment education or Training), etc. pan India from August 2018. The above mentioned initiatives are undertaken to generate awareness thereby enhancing enrolment of youth in the skill development schemes.	In addition to budget allocations to various skill development schemes, National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), a PPP company under MSDE provides funding to build scalable for-profit vocational training initiatives. NSDC acts as a catalyst in skill development by providing funding to enterprises, companies and organisations that provide skill training. It also partners with corporates across sectors through its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) & Industry Partnerships arm to channelize industry CSR funds towards skill development initiatives.	Besides In order to improve training capacity of institutes or centres, MSDE has undertaken various steps. •	For scaling up availability of quality trainers and assessors, SSCs are mandated to conduct Training of Trainers (ToT) and Training of Assessors (ToA) programs.   •	As per the placement guidelines of PMKVY 2.0 (2016-2020), apart from imparting training, TPs are mandated to facilitate placements of certified candidates. TPs need to organize Placement/Rozgar Melas every six months with support from the Sector Skill Councils (SSCs). NSDC has also empanelled placement partners, with the objective of ensuring placement opportunities to PMKVY certified candidates not placed by TPs within 90 days from date of certification. •	As per the Common Norms, the reimbursement of 20% of training cost to training centres is made only after wage employment or self employment is assured to at least 70% of the certified candidates. There is also a provision to provide post placement support to candidates from special areas/ special groups in order to enable the newly skilled persons to settle into their jobs/vocations.•	The Ministry has also set up Model Skill Centres called Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras (PMKKs) in various districts across the country.
