ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS & SPORTS{ SHRI KIREN RIJIJU }(a) ‘Sports’ being a State subject, the responsibility for promotion and development of sports, including upgradation of sports infrastructure and identification of sports talent is that of State/Union Territory Governments. However, the Central Government supplements the efforts of the State/Union Territory Governments and National Sports Federations (NSFs) under its various schemes, such as Khelo India Scheme and Scheme of Assistance to NSFs and providing training facilities in Sports Authority of India (SAI) Centres.Further, the Khelo India Scheme has two verticals, namely ‘Talent Search and Development’ and ‘Annual Sports Competitions’. The Government is giving priority to scouting and nurturing of talent while considering NSF proposals for Annual Calendar for Training and Competitions (ACTC).(b) For mobilising contributions to National Sports Development Fund (NSDF) from corporate entities both in public sector and private sector, the Ministry has taken up with Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) / Public Sector Bank (PSB) and corporates in private sector for contributing generously to NSDF from their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds. They have also been urged that while making contributions to NSDF, they can choose a cause, such as being part of India’s Olympic Journey by funding training of athletics included in Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) or adopting a training centre or sports academy which can be upgraded having state-of-the-art sports facilities for our future Olympians or adopting a specific sport for its all-round promotion and development.(c) For ensuring success of Indian sportspersons and teams in international sports events, including Olympics, the Central Government is supporting sportspersons through NSFs for their training, foreign exposures and competitions. Under the TOPS, customized training and allied facilities are also being made available to medal prospects and high achievers.****
