However, Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) supplements the efforts of the States, including Uttar Pradesh through its schemes and programmes. The following programmes are also being implemented for providing adequate infrastructural facilities to Panchayats including Uttar Pradesh by the Government of India: (i) The Fourteenth Finance Commission (FFC) for the award period 2015-20 allocated Rs. 2,00,292.20 crore to Gram Panchayats, amounting to an assistance of Rs. 488 per capita per annum at an aggregate level to the Gram Panchayats constituted under Part IX of the Constitution to 26 States including Uttar Pradesh. The Grants were meant for delivering basic services, namely, water supply, sanitation, sewerage, solid waste management, storm water drainage, maintenance of community assets, roads, footpath, street lighting, burial and cremation grounds etc and any other basic services entrusted under State Legislations etc. (ii) Under Fifteenth Finance Commission (XVFC) interim award period 2020-21, grants to the tune of Rs. 60,750 crores have been recommended by the Commission for all tiers of the Rural Local Bodies (RLBs) in 28 States including Uttar Pradesh. 50% of the allocation is Basic (Untied) Grants to be used by the local bodies for location-specific felt needs, except for salary or other establishment expenditure. Rest 50% allocation is Tied Grants to be used for the basic services of (a) sanitation and maintenance of open –defection free (ODF) status and (b) supply of drinking water, rain water harvesting and water recycling. (iii) Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) under the restructured scheme of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) being implemented with effect from 2018-19, is providing financial support for certain infrastructural facilities for GPs such as Gram Panchayat Bhawans, computers and peripherals. Under RGSA scheme till date Rs. 342.6807 crore has been released to Uttar Pradesh. (iv) Implementation of computerization of GPs is being done under various programmes such as RGSA, FFC, etc. An estimated 58753 Gram Panchayats in Uttar Pradesh have computers at present. (v) To facilitate adequate infrastructure, BharatNet project is being implemented by Department of Telecommunications in a Phased manner to create network to connect all the Rural Local Bodies (RLBs) (approx. 2.71 lakh RLBs) by broadband in the country. As on 16.07.2021, a total number of 1,58,266 RLBs (including Block Head Quarters) have been made Service Ready in the country, including 31,776 GPs of Uttar Pradesh. (vi) Towards provision of online services in the rural areas and GPs, Common Service Centres (CSCs) have been setup through a ‘Common Service Centre - Special Purpose Vehicle’ (CSC-SPV), a society of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. The key objective of CSCs is to deliver various citizen centric services, such as Government to Citizen (G2C), Business to Citizen (B2C) services, financial inclusion services, educational services, skill development services etc. (c) MoPR is implementing e-Panchayat Mission Mode Project (MMP) under which a suite of core common applications have been developed to address various aspects of Panchayats’ functioning including planning, budgeting, implementation, accounting, monitoring, social audit and delivery of citizen services like issue of certificates, licenses, etc. to  make  them  more  transparent,  accountable  and  effective  as organs of decentralized self-governing institutions.          Further, for enhancing transparency, accountability of Panchayats across the country and strengthening their financial management, Ministry of Panchayati Raj has launched the Audit Online application on 15th April 2020 for carrying out online Audits of Panchayat accounts which facilitates the auditing of accounts and provisions also for maintaining audit records that have been carried out.****
