STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION No. *254 REGARDING ‘ASPIRATIONAL DISTRICTS PROGRAMME’ RAISED BY SHRI KAUSHALENDRA KUMAR AND DR. NISHIKANT DUBEY FOR ANSWER ON 15TH DECEMBER, 2021.(a)	There are 112 Aspirational Districts, across 26 States and 1 Union Territory. These were selected through a transparent process on basis of published data. List of data sets and the weight attached to them for selection of these districts is attached in Annexure - I. As regards salient features of the programme, it aims at rapid transformation of these backward districts across sectors which are critical for improving quality of life or economic productivity of citizens. These sectors are Health and Nutrition, School Education, Agriculture and Water Resources, Financial Inclusion and Skill Development and Basic Infrastructure. 49 key performance indicators have been selected across these sectors and a district’s performance is monitored on the basis of progress made on these indicators. The broad strategy of the Aspirational Districts Programme rests on the 3 Cs – Convergence (between Central and State Schemes), Collaboration (between Centre, State, District Administration, Development Partners and Citizens) and Competition (between Districts). Every month, districts are ranked on basis of progress made and this instill’s in them a sense of competition which results in rapid improvement. Another strategy of the programme is nomination of Joint Secretary/Additional Secretary level officials from Government of India as Central Prabhari Officers for each of the district. The role of these Prabhari Officers is to guide the district administration on basis of their long experience.(b)	The State-wise list of all 112 Aspirational Districts is attached as Annexure – II.(c)	As the main strategy of the programme is based on convergence of existing schemes which have their own funding arrangement, large infusion of additional fund is not envisaged. However, in order to foster competitive spirit, and for addressing the critical gaps, additional allocation on challenge route is also envisaged. Every month, districts are assessed on the basis of monthly progress and the best performing District in overall terms and in each of the five sectors are identified. The first and second rankers in overall terms are awarded Rs. 10 crores and Rs. 5 crores respectively. The first ranker from each of the five sectors is awarded Rs. 3 crores each. The list of outcomes and indicators on the basis of which Districts are ranked is at Annexure - III.(d)	As stated above, the Aspirational Districts Programme is over and above the existing schemes of the Central and the State Governments concerned and as such it is in the nature of additionality. Based on the performance grant as mentioned in (c) above, districts undertake specific projects to address critical need felt by the District Administration. **** Annexure – IList of data sets and weights used for selection of Aspirational DistrictsDATABASES	SECTOR	WEIGHTLandless households dependent on Manual labour (Socio Economic Caste Census – Deprivation 7)	Deprivation(25%)	25%Ante natal care (National Health and Family Survey (NHFS) - 4) 	Health & Nutrition(30%)	7.5%Institutional delivery (NHFS-4) 		7.5%Stunting of children below 5 years (NHFS-4) 		7.5%Wasting in children below 5 years (NHFS-4) 		7.5%Elementary dropout rate (Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE) 2015-16)	Education(15%)	7.5%Adverse pupil teacher ratio (U-DISE 2015-16)		7.5%Un-electrified households (Ministry of Power) 	Infra (30%)	7.5%Households without individual toilets (Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation) 		7.5%Un-connected PMGSY village (Ministry of Rural Development)  		7.5%Rural Household without access to water (Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation) 		7.5%Total 		100% Annexure-IIState-wise list of all 112 Aspirational DistrictsS.
