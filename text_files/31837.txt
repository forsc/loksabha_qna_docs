ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(Dr. MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)                               (a) to (e) : There are five pharma Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) under the aegis of the Department of Pharmaceuticals, namely (i) Bengal Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals Limited (BCPL), (ii) Hindustan Antibiotics Limited (HAL), (iii) Indian Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Limited (IDPL), (iv) Karnataka Antibiotics & Pharmaceutical Limited (KAPL) and (v) Rajasthan Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Limited (RDPL). But, none of the pharma PSUs are manufacturing any drugs for the treatment of cancer. However, National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), an attached office of Department of Pharmaceuticals, which is mandated for price regulation of scheduled drugs, has fixed the ceiling prices of 86 anti-cancer scheduled formulations under the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM), 2015. Further, NPPA has also put a cap of 30% Trade Margin on 42 selected non-scheduled anti-cancer medicines on pilot basis under ‘Trade Margin Rationalization’ approach. Under this approach, the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of 526 brands of anti-cancer medicines have been reduced by upto 90%. *****
