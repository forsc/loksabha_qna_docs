ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) 	The details of tiger mortality for the last three as reported by States is at Annexure – I. The average life span of the tigers in the wild is generally 10-12 years and in the wild several factors like  old age, diseases, internecine fights, high infant mortality, electrocution, snaring, drowning, road/rail hits etc account for majority of tiger deaths.  (b)	No sir. There has not been any drastic increase in tiger deaths involving poaching and man-animal conflict in comparison to previous years. (c)	For preventing poaching of wildlife including tigers the National Tiger Conservation Authority has issued generic guidelines for formulating a Security Plan for each tiger reserve which is operationalised in the overarching Tiger Conservation Plan, legally mandated under section 38 V of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.  The Government of India, through the National Tiger Conservation Authority, has advocated a three pronged strategy to manage human-tiger negative interactions as follows:- (i)	Material and logistical support: Funding support through the ongoing Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Project Tiger, is provided to tiger reserves for acquiring capacity in terms of infrastructure and material, to deal with tigers dispersing out of source areas.  These are solicited by tiger reserves through an Annual Plan of Operation (APO) every year which stems out from an overarching Tiger Conservation Plan (TCP), mandated under Section 38 V of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.  Inter alia, activities such as payment of ex-gratia and compensation, periodic awareness campaigns to sensitize, guide and advise the general populace on man-animal conflict, dissemination of information through various forms of media, procurement of immobilization equipment, drugs, training and capacity building of forest staff to deal with conflict events are generally solicited.(ii)	Restricting habitat interventions: Based on the carrying capacity of tigers in a tiger reserve, habitat interventions are restricted through an overarching TCP.  In case tiger numbers are at carrying capacity levels, it is advised that habitat interventions should be limited so that there is no excessive spill over of wildlife including tigers thereby minimizing man-animal conflict.  Further, in buffer areas around tiger reserves, habitat interventions are restricted such that they are sub-optimal vis-à-vis the core/critical tiger habitat areas, judicious enough to facilitate dispersal to other rich habitat areas only.(iii)	Standard Operating Procedure (SOPs): The National Tiger Conservation Authority has issued following three SOPs to deal with human-animal conflict, which are available in public domain:i.	To deal with emergency arising due to straying of tigers in human dominated landscapesii.	To deal with tiger depredation on livestockiii. For active management towards rehabilitation of tigers from source areas at the landscape level.The three SOPs inter alia include the issue of managing dispersing tigers, managing livestock kills so as to reduce conflict as well as relocating tigers from source areas to areas where density of tiger is low, so that conflict in rich source areas does not occur. Also as per Tiger Conservation Plans need based and site-specific management interventions are undertaken by the tiger reserves for improving the quality of wildlife habitat and funding support for these activities is provided under the ongoing Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Project Tiger.*****
