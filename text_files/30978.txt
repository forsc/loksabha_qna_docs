                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (d):	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. 241 BY SHRI C. LALROSANGA TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 15.12.2021 REGARDING BAIRABI-SAIRANG RAILWAY LINE(a) to (d):	Indian Railways have taken up construction of Bhairabi - Sairang (51.38 km) New Line project.  Anticipated cost of the project is `6527 crore. So far, an expenditure of `4343 crore has been incurred on the project. An outlay of `1038 crore has been provided for the financial year 2021-22 for the project. The length of the railway line under construction is 51.38 km. Project involves construction of 55 major bridges having total length of 10.68 km, 87 minor bridges, 32 tunnels of total length 12.65 km  and 5 station buildings. Proposed stations are Bairabi (existing), Hortoki, Kawnpui, Maulkhang and Sairang - terminal station.The completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, etc.  All these factors affect the completion time of the project.  As such, confirmed completion time of project cannot be ascertained. Nevertheless, every effort is being made to execute the project expeditiously.	This is a National Project and improving connectivity in isolated portions of North East is a Government of India policy initiative.  Employment generation opportunities have already grown due to ongoing large-scale construction activities in North Eastern Region. Social and economic development will follow as a consequence of improved connectivity with rest of the country.*****
