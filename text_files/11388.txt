                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES (SHRI RAMESWAR TELI) (a) & (b): The Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) is implementing a Central Sector Umbrella Scheme- PRADHAN MANTRI KISAN SAMPADA YOJANA (PMKSY) with the scheme components viz: (i) Mega Food Parks, (ii) Integrated Cold Chain and Value Addition Infrastructure, (iii) Infrastructure for Agro-processing Clusters, (iv) Creation of Backward and Forward Linkages (v) Creation / Expansion of Food Processing & Preservation Capacities, (vi) Food Safety and Quality Assurance Infrastructure and (vii) Human Resources and Institutions for, inter alia, creation of modern infrastructure and efficient supply chain for facilitating preservation and processing of various agricultural produce. The schemes of Mega Food Parks (MFP) and Infrastructure for Agro-processing Clusters (APC) under PMKSY is designed to create common infrastructure facilities like storage including cold storage, ripening chamber, warehousing, food testing laboratories etc. for the food processing units, particularly small units that cannot create such facilities on their own requiring huge capital investment. There is also provision of MSME shed in the MFPs to enable the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) to use the common facilities created in the MFPs for food processing activities.    The MoFPI provides credit-linked capital subsidy in the form of grants-in-aid to the individuals, farmers, Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs), Entrepreneurs, Cooperatives, Societies, Self Help Groups (SHGs), Private Companies and Central/ State PSUs etc. for setting up of projects like MFPs and APCs for creation of common infrastructure for food processing units.   (c):	 The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare with the mandate for enforcement of food safety and standards regulations has informed that the provisions of Food Safety and Standards (FSS) Act, 2006 do not apply to any farmers or fisherman or farming operations or crops or livestock or aquaculture, and supplies used or produced in farming or products of crops produced by farmers at farm level or a fisherman in his operations.         The inspection premise of the food business operators are carried out under FSS Act, 2006 to check the sanitary and hygienic requirements as prescribed under schedule 4 of the Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration of Food Businesses) Regulations, 2011.          Food Safety Compliance through Regular Inspections and Sampling (FoSCoRIS), an IT based system (both web based and App) for inspections has been developed with standardised checklists based on kind of food businesses to assure greater transparency and ease of compliance. States/UTs have been requested to use FoSCoRIS for inspections.  *****
