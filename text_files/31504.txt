ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (e):	The allocation of State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) to the States is based on the recommendations of the successive Finance Commissions, set up under Article 280 of the Constitution, from time-to-time.   Further, the disbursal of funds from SDRF and National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) is governed by the Guidelines and Items and Norms of assistance from SDRF and NDRF, which are framed in  consultation  with all  Stakeholders, including States and which are available on Ministry of Home Affairs website at   https://ndmindia.mha.gov.in/images/NDRFSDRF_06042017.pdf and https://ndmindia.mha.gov.in/images/pdf/SDRF-NDRFNorms-dated8april2015.pdf, respectively.  The primary responsibility for disaster management rests with the State Governments concerned.  The State Governments undertake relief measures in the wake of natural disasters from the SDRF, already placed at their disposal, in accordance with Government of India’s approved items and norms.  In order to supplement the efforts of the State, additional financial assistance is extended from the NDRF, in case of disaster of ‘severe nature’, in accordance with the established procedure.  The entire exercise requires adhering to the established procedure envisaged in the SDRF/ NDRF guidelines. As per the laid down procedure, a three - tier system is followed for calculation of the additional financial assistance from the NDRF.  Firstly, an on-the-spot assessment is made by an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT), comprising of representatives of sectoral Ministries/ Departments, along with the officials of the State concerned. The report of IMCT is then considered by the Sub-Committee of National Executive Committee (SC-NEC) chaired by the Union   Home    Secretary     and   consisting    of   representatives    of    various  Ministries concerned. Subsequently, the recommendations of SC-NEC are considered and approved by the High Level Committee (HLC) chaired by the Hon’ble Union Home Minister and consisting of the Union Finance Minister, Union Agriculture Minister and Vice-Chairman, NITI Aayog as Members. Funds are released from the NDRF after approval of the HLC.  State-wise details of funds disbursed/ released under the NDRF in Financial Years 2018-19 to 2021-22 (as on 09.12.2021) are given at Annexure.*****
