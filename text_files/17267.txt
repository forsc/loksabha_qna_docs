ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRYOF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS [SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) 	The Government has accorded the highest priority to the welfare and safety of Indian nationals abroad. To facilitate return of Indian nationals stranded in various countries due to restriction imposed in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, the Vande Bharat Mission commenced on 7 May 2020. Since then, more than 13, 74, 237 Indians (as on 10 September 2020) have returned to India via air, land and sea. Of them, 3, 08, 099 were workers, not all of them had lost their jobs, but returned on account of Covid-19 situation. Based on the data shared by the passengers with our Missions, no. of workers who have returned to India are attached country wise at Annexure-I. In recent months, Indians have started to return to the Gulf and other countries to rejoin their jobs or for family reunions.(b) & (c)   With the aim of making the best of our skilled workforce returning to the country due to the ongoing pandemic, the Government of India launched an initiative SWADES (Skilled Workers Arrival Database for Employment Support) to conduct a skill mapping exercise of the returning citizens under the Vande Bharat Mission. SWADES, a joint initiative of the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Ministry of External Affairs, aimed to create a database of qualified citizens based on their skill sets and experience to tap into and fulfill demand of Indian and foreign companies. It was aimed at all the citizens from all over the world, across ECR and ECNR categories.  This was done to facilitate reintegration of migrant workers into the labour market and promote effective employment opportunities. For facilitating employment opportunities, details of SWADES registrations have been integrated with Skill India’s ASEEM (Aatmanirbhar Skilled Employee Employer Mapping) portal which was launched on 10 July 2020. Further, all data regarding Indians returning under Vande Bharat Mission was also shared with relevant State Governments, on a real time basis.(d)	Does not arise. ***
