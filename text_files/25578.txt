However, as on 01.04.2021, 37 Railway Projects costing `55,219 crore for 4,643 km length, falling fully/partly in the State of Odisha are at different stages of planning/approval/execution, out of which, 928 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `16,903 crore has been incurred upto March, 2021. These include:11 New Line Projects covering a length of 1,460 km at a cost of `20,346 crore, out of which, 112 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `3,789 crore has been incurred upto March, 2021.1 Gauge Conversion (GC) project covering a length of 159 km at a cost of `1,455 crore, out of which, 90 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `184 crore has been incurred upto March, 2021.25 Doubling Projects covering a length of 3,024 km at a cost of `33,418 crore, out of which, 726 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `12,930 crore has been incurred upto March, 2021.State of Odisha is covered by East Coast Railway (ECoR), South Eastern Railway (SER) and South East Central Railway (SECR) zones of Indian Railways. The project-wise details including cost, expenditure and outlay are available in public domain on Indian Railways’ website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in >Ministry of Railways>Railway Board>About Indian Railways>Railway Board Directorates>Finance(Budget)>Pink Book (year)>Railway-wise Works, Machinery & Rolling Stock Programme (RSP).Completion of any Railway project/s depend on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project/s site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions etc.  All these factors differ from project to project and affect the completion time of the project.  As such, firm completion time of the projects can not be ascertained at this stage.Average annual Budget allocation for Infrastructure projects & safety works, falling fully/ partly in State of Odisha, during 2014-19 has been enhanced to `4,126 crore per year from `838 crore per year (during 2009-14). Thus, the average budget allocation during 2014-19 is 392% more as compared to average allocation during 2009-14 (`838 Cr/Year).  These allocations have been enhanced to `4,568 crore in 2019-20 and `5,296 crore in 2020-21 which are 445% and 532% more than the average allocation of 2009-14 (`838 Cr/Year) respectively.
