ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)	The State-wise details of Central allocation and release of funds under the DRDA Administration Scheme by the Centre  during last three years is enclosed at Annexure “A” and  District wise details of the same in respect of the State of  Maharashtra  is enclosed at Annexure “B” . (b) to (c)  No specific suggestions have been received  to strengthen the DRDAs for its effective functioning and implementation of scheme during the last three years. However, a Committee had been setup under the Chairmanship of Shri V. Ramachandran by Ministry of Rural Development in 2010 in order to review the functioning of the DRDAs in the Country and to make suitable recommendations for its restructuring. The Committee had made certain recommendations for restructuring of DRDA in its report submitted in 2012. The main recommendations of the Committee were as follows: 1.  To set up District Plan Support Unit (DPSU), in each district to assist the District Planning Committee (DPC)/ Zila Parisad in preparations of District Plan etc.2.   To set up a State level supporting unit with identical composition as DPSU.3.   To abolish society status of DRDA.4.   Transitory arrangement may be made for the staff of DRDAs.The total financial implication for implementing the recommendations of the Committee was estimated at Rs.12,671 crore approximately. The recommendations made by the Committee were initially accepted by the Ministry of Rural Development with some modifications and a Note for Expenditure Finance Committee for restructuring the DRDAs was circulated for inter-departmental consultation.  Subsequently, in the backdrop of observations/comments of Department of Expenditure the matter was re-examined in the Ministry of Rural Development. Considering the complexity of the proposal, the volume of financial implication involved and shrunken role of DRDAs in implementation of centrally sponsored schemes, the proposal for implementation of the recommendations of the Committee was dropped. Subsequently, a Committee on Performance Based Payments for Better Outcomes in Rural Development Programmes was setup by MoRD in December 2016 under the chairmanship of Shri Sumit Bose. It recommended merger of DRDAs with District Panchayats. Subsequently, an  evaluation study of the DRDA Administration Scheme was also conducted by Institute of Rural Management, Anand (IRMA).  IRMA submitted its report in April 2020. Among other things, the report gave four alternatives for the way forward.  In brief they are:i.	Closing the DRDAs.ii.	Merging the DRDAs with PRIs in all States.iii.	Drawing and Disbursing Agency for anti-poverty programmes.iv.	District Planning and Monitoring body. After considering the report, Ministry of Rural Development is proposing to close the DRDA Administration Scheme and recommend to States to merge DRDAs with Zilla Panchayats/ Zilla Parishads. ******
