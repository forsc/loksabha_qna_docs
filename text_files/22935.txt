ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	 to (c): The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, under Swachh Bharat Mission – Urban, provides central assistance to projects from States / Union Territories, as per the guidelines of Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban for Municipal Solid Waste Management. The State Governments and Union Territories formulate policies, plans and projects for solid waste management, as per their requirement, taking into account local needs, type of waste generated, availability of waste management facilities etc. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has notified the Solid Waste Management Rules in 2016. The Rules also prescribe to (i) set up of material recovery facilities with sufficient space for sorting of recyclable materials; (ii) collect waste from vegetable, fruit,flower, meat, poultry and fish market and promote setting up of decentralized compost plant or bio-methanation plant at suitable locations; (iii) facilitate construction, operation and maintenance of solid waste processing facilities and associated infrastructure by the local authorities and panchayats as per standards prescribed by CPCB which inter alia include:a)	bio-methanation, microbial composting, vermi-composting, anaerobic digestion or any other appropriate processing for bio-stabilization of biodegradable wastes;b)	waste to energy processes including refused derived fuel for combustible fraction of waste or supply as feedstock to solid waste based power plants or cement kilns.The Rules stipulate specific criteria to encourage the use of solid waste in the waste to energy plants. It has been mentioned that (i) non recyclable waste having calorific value of 1500 Kcal/kg or more shall not be disposed of on landfills and shall only be utilised for generating energy, (ii) high calorific value wastes shall be used for co-processing in cement or thermal power plants.The Rules provides specification for sanitary landfills including criteria for site selection, development of facilities, pollution prevention, water and air quality monitoring etc. The Rules also provide criteria for closure and rehabilitation of old dumps. The solid waste dumps which have reached their full capacity have to be closed and rehabilitated by reducing the waste by bio mining and waste processing followed by placement of residues in new landfills or capping.***
