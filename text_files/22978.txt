ANSWER




MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) & (b):	The Government has a scheme for facilitating State Government in the setting up of Urban Haat in the country. So far, 34 Urban Haats have been set up across the country.                  (list attached). (c) to (f):	The proposals for setting up Urban Haats for Sikar and Alwar were received from the state of Rajasthan. A Project Approval & Monitoring committee (PAMC) meeting was held on 21.05.2013 under the Chairmanship of Development Commissioner (Handicrafts), wherein the proposal for construction of Sikar Urban Haat was not considered as the State Government of Rajasthan had already been constructing Urban Haat at Sikar. In case of Alwar, the land proposed by Implementing Agency for setting up Urban Haat was not found suitable by the committee. Accordingly, the implementing agency was requested to propose new venue for setting up Urban Haat at Alwar. At present, three (03) Urban Haats are functional in the state of Rajasthan located at Jodhpur, Jaipur and Ajmer.
