ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (d) The World Economic Forum, at its 50th Annual Meeting, published an independent survey report “Toward a More Sustainable World – A global study of public opinion” which reinforces that the world urgently needs to start implementing policies and strategies that advance societal and environmental agendas – from reskilling the population for future to ensuring strong education and leadership on climate change from all sectors. The Government is already implementingvarious schemes and programmes to create climate change awareness among various sections of the society. It forms an important component of India’s National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) under which, continuous efforts are being made to build institutional capacity for addressing the knowledge gaps which will contribute to effectiveness of India’s national response to climate change. India’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) submitted under the Paris Agreement contains a dedicated goal on building capacities, creating domestic framework and international architecture for quick diffusion of cutting edge climate technology in India and for joint collaborative Research and Development for such future technologies. Some of the other key initiatives of the Government in this regard include National Green Corps, which aims at building cadres of young children working towards environmental conservation and sustainable development, including climate change. As a part of the initiative, 100,000 Eco clubs are functioning across the country, making it one of the largest environmental networks that enable activities on relevant issues connecting children, youth and general public. The Government has also launched School Nursery Yojana to bring students close to nature by involving them in planting and growing saplings in nurseries created in schools. ‘Green Good Deeds’ campaign is a societal movement launched to protect the environment and promote sustainable lifestyles across the country.The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) provides an overarching policy framework for all climate actions. It comprises of eight core Missions in specific areas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, sustainable habitat, water, sustaining Himalayan ecosystems, Green India, sustainable agriculture and strategic knowledge for climate change.33 States and Union Territories have also prepared State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) consistent with the objectives of NAPCC. As per India’s second Biennial Update Report (BUR) submitted to the UNFCCC in December 2018, emissions intensity of India’s GDP has decreased by 21% in 2014 as compared to 2005 levels. India’s NDC is fair and ambitious. India is on track to achieve its NDC goals. *****
