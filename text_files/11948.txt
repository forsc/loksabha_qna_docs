(c)  Thakurtola fee plaza in the stretch from End of Durg Bypass to Chhattisgarh/Maharashtra Border section was started in February, 2012 on BOT (Toll) basis and hence user fee plaza was established in accordance with National Highways Fee Rules 1997 in which there is no such condition regarding distance between two fee plaza in case of Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects.
