ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a)	& (b) The total number of children vaccinated with Hepatitis-B birth dose, Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG), Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (IPV), first dose of Measles containing vaccine (MCV) and first dose of Diphtheria Pertussis Tetanus (DPT) containing vaccine from 2018-19 to 2020-21, year-wise, vaccine-wise and State/UT-wise is placed at Annexure I to Annexure VI.There has been an increasing trend in child vaccination coverage across different vaccines from 2018-2019 to 2019-2020.  However, due to COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restricted movement, there was a slight decrease in number of children vaccinated in 2020-21 as compared to 2019-20. To cover up the gap, the Government had conducted Intensified Mission Indradhanush from time to time.
