ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING (RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a) & (b)  Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation deals with the MPLAD Scheme. The objective of the scheme is to enable Members of Parliament (MP) to recommend works of developmental nature with emphasis on the creation of durable community assets based on the locally felt needs to be taken up in their Constituencies /eligible areas. Right from inception of the Scheme, durable assets of national priorities viz. drinking water, primary education, public health, sanitation and roads, etc. are being created. In a way, the scheme is based on the participation of citizens in identifying the gaps needed to provide assets which can further the aspirations and developmental requirements of the community. Such requirements are expressed through the public representatives and form the basis of the scheme. MPLADS is not an individual beneficiary-oriented scheme. Release of funds under MPLADS is made on Constituency basis with no geographical or regional bias. It may be appreciated that managing and addressing the challenges faced by the nation on account of COVID-19 pandemic, requires pooling of all available physical, financial, medical, technological and other resources.  Accordingly, the budgetary outlay for FY 2020-21 in respect of the MPLAD scheme has been placed at the disposal of Ministry of Finance for managing the economic and health impacts of COVID-19 pandemic, in pursuance of the decision of the Union Cabinet for not operating the MPLAD Scheme for FY2020-21 and 2021-22. The annual entitlement under MPLADS remains unchanged and at present, there is no proposal to revise the annual entitlement under MPLADS. (c)     In view of (a) & (b) above, need for reply to this sub-part, does not arise.                                                   *****
