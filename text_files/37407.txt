Ministry of Finance shall finalize the procedure, method, rate of conversion, mix of equity and preferential capital (if any), compliance with SEBI and other relevant guidelines.(d)	As per the direction given by the Hon’ble Supreme Court on Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) matter in its judgement dated 01.09.2020, Department of Telecommunications had filed a compliance affidavit on 07.04.2021 in the Hon’ble Supreme Court.  Further, the Government has given a moratorium of four years on payment of AGR dues to all eligible TSPs.(e)	Details of the pending AGR dues of major access service providers are Annexed.
