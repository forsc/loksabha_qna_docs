                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (g):	In the “Crime in India” report, National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) publishes crime data from all the States/Union Territories under various crime heads which are defined under the Indian Penal Code and Special & Local Laws. No separate data for mob lynching is maintained by NCRB.  Details of cases registered under crime head ‘Rioting’ and under its sub-head ‘Communal/Religious’ during the year 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 & 2020 are given below in table:Year	Rajasthan	India	Rioting	Communal/ Religious	Rioting	Communal/ Religious2016	293	0	61974	8692017	345	16	58880	7232018	392	18	57828	5122019	392	18	45985	4382020	342	03	51606	857It is the intention of the Government to comprehensively review the existing Criminal Laws and make them relevant to the contemporary law and order situation as well as to provide speedy justice to the vulnerable sections of the society and create a legal structure which is citizen-centric. The Department–related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs, in its 146th Report dated 23.06.2010, had recommended that there is a need for a comprehensive review of the Criminal Justice System of the country. Earlier the Parliamentary Standing Committee in its 111th and 128th Reports had also stressed upon the need to reform and rationalize the criminal law of the country by introducing a comprehensive legislation in Parliament rather than bringing about piece-meal amendments in respective Acts. Government is committed to make comprehensive amendments to criminal laws in consultation with all the stakeholders.******
