ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT (SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  Central Water Commission (CWC) has 3 flood forecasting stations on river Rapti in Uttar Pradesh namely, Balrampur in Balrampur District, Bansi in Siddharth Nagar District and Birdghat in Gorakhpur District. In current year ‘severe’ flooding situations (river flowing above danger level) have been witnessed in river Rapti during July-August. In previous years also varying degree of flooding had been observed in river Rapti. Flooding in Rapti river is generally due to heavy rainfall in its upper catchment in Nepal. CWC issues level forecasts in respect of above 3 stations with warning time of 24 hours to the concerned District Administration for taking flood mitigation measures. CWC compiles flood damage data for state as a whole which are supplied by the respective State Governments. The flood damage data for Uttar Pradesh for the period 2016-2018 is given at Annexure- I.(b)  The flood management schemes are formulated and implemented by concerned State Governments as per their priority. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. Irrigation and Water Resources Department, Government of Uttar Pradesh has informed that 101 number of embankments have been built with total length of 871.137 km on the banks of Rapti river in Balrampur, Siddharth Nagar, Gorakhpur, Sant Kabir Nagar and Deoria Districts for providing protection to 25,5610 hectares of land.Contd…P/2//2//(c)  Management of floods due to heavy rainfall in the upper catchment areas which mainly lie in Nepal in rivers like Rapti has been a concern. The related issues are discussed in the existing Indo-Nepal bilateral three tier mechanisms comprising of (i) Joint Ministerial Level Commission on Water Resources (JMCWR) (ii) Joint Committee on Water Resources (JCWR) and (iii) Joint Standing Technical Committee (JSTC). Government of India is having regular dialogue with the Government of Nepal for construction of dams on these rivers for mutual benefit of the two countries which includes flood control. Broad outcomes of the dialogues mechanism are given below:i)	Pancheshwar Development Authority (PDA) has been set up jointly by India and Nepal for execution, operation and maintenance of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project on river Sarada. The  DPR of the project has been prepared by M/s WAPCOS Limited. ii)	Survey and investigation including preparation of DPR of Sapta Kosi High Dam Project and Sun Kosi Storage-cum-Diversion scheme proposed in the Sapta Kosi basin in Nepal has been undertaken jointly by India and Nepal.(d)  During 2016-17, ninety-nine (99) on-going Major/Medium irrigation projects (and 7 phases) in the country under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) - Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP), have been prioritised in consultation with States for completion in phases. Saryu Nahar Priyojana (National Project) is one of the prioritized project in Uttar Pradesh. Construction of one barrage is envisaged across river Rapti in Saryu Nahar Priyojana. The ultimate irrigation potential of the project is 1312.00 th.ha. Out of which 630.30 th.ha. had been created by March, 2016. During 2016-2020, additional irrigation potential of 521.40 th.ha. has been created. ****** ANNEXURE IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1947 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 22.09.2020 REGARDING “FLOODING OF RAPTI RIVER”.STATEMENT SHOWING FLOOD DAMAGES IN UTTAR PRADESH DURING 2016. 2017 and 2018 Sl.No	Year	Area Affected (Mha)	Population Affected (Million)	Damages to Crops	Damage to Houses	Cattle Lost Nos.
