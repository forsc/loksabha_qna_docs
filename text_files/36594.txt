To expedite the balance work of ROB at Hulas Nagla, separate work was awarded. However, the work was delayed due to rejection of existing girders (constructed in the terminated contract) by the Railways loading to  a requirement of fabrication of new girders and new approval process. (c)	The length of Balance work of Bareilly Sitapur section of NH-24 from km.262.000 to km 419.590 is 157.59 km. The stretch from km.262.000 to km.325.620 (Bareilly Mod) has been planned for completion by 30.04.2022 including the ROB at Hulas Nagla. The remaining stretch from km.325.620 to km.419.590 has been planned for completion by 31.12.2022.
