(b) Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) is a regular supplier of 90UTS rails to Indian Railways (IR), but from 2015-16 to 2019-20 SAIL was unable to meet full requirement of IR. Hence, two developmental orders were placed on M/s Jindal Steel & Power Limited (JSPL). One for supply of 1.26 Lakh Metric Tonne (MT) was placed by IR and another for supply of 0.89 Lakh MT was placed by Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL).Since SAIL was not manufacturing Head Hardened rails, RVNL awarded an order for supply of 6700 MT to M/s East Metal AG and a developmental order  for supply of 3000 MT to M/s JSPL.All these orders were placed as per IRS Conditions of Contract (Stores). (c) The details of rail tracks laid daily (average per day), including both for new and maintenance replacement, during the last three years and at present is as under:-Year	                           Track laid per day  (in km)2017-18	                                   17.172018-19	                                   21.532019-20	                                   20.292020-21 (upto 28.02.2021)	           21.04(d) Following efforts are being taken for timely completion of track laying :i.	Track renewal works are sanctioned every year on the basis of traffic carried, condition etc. and their execution is prioritized according to condition of track and overall availability of funds.ii.	Mechanisation of track laying activity through use of track machines like PQRS, TRT, T-28 etc. to improve progress of track renewal along with ensuring quality.iii.	Better availability of funds for track renewal through Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh  (RRSK).iv.	Improvement in quantum of supply of rails through close coordination with SAIL.v.	Maximising supply of 10 Rail/20 Rail long panels for increasing progress of rail renewal and avoiding welding of joints, thereby ensuring safety.   vi.	Prioritization of projects.  vii.	Substantial increase in allocation of funds on priority projects. viii.	Regular follow up with State Governments and concerned authorities for expeditious land acquisition, forestry and Wildlife clearances and for resolving other issues pertaining to projects.
