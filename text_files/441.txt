ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) Under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), a deposit free LPG connection is provided to an adult woman member of a poor family with cash assistance upto ? 1600 per connection which includes security deposit of cylinder, security deposit of Pressure Regulator, Suraksha Hose, Installation/demonstration charges and cost of issue of DGCC booklet. Beneficiaries are required to make payment towards purchase of refill and the Hot plate (Stove). As on 19.06.2019, Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) havereleased more than 7.23 crore new LPG connections under PMUY. State/UT-wise details are at Annexure.(b) OMCs have reported that till May 2019, 1.67 crore and 1.45 crore PMUY beneficiaries have purchased the refilled LPG cylinders 4 and 5 times respectively. (c)&(d)OMCs have reported that surveys/studies have been conducted by some Agencies/Institutes/Organizations involving PMUY beneficiaries. OMCs have also reported that nearly 86% of PMUY beneficiaries who are atleast one year old have returned for the second refill. Adoption and use of LPG on sustained basis by a beneficiary of PMUY involves behavioural change. The use of LPG by PMUY beneficiary household depends on several factors which include food habits, cooking habits, price of LPG, availability of free firewood, cow dung etc. (e) The PMUY beneficiaries get subsidy under PAHAL Scheme. The applicable subsidy is directly transferred into the bank account of beneficiaries. Direct transfer of subsidy aids in right targeting of the beneficiary and prevent diversion.
