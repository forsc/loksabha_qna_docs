                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) & (b) : 	The  Annual losses of all DISCOMs (State-wise) in the country are given at Annexure-I.The main reasons for the long running financial problem faced by DISCOMs include high AT&C loss; tariffs not reflective of costs; delayed and inadequate payment of outstanding subsidies as well as Government Departmental dues by the State Government and, inadequate Corporate Governance practices.(c) to (e) :  	Government of India had launched Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY) on 20-11-2015 to improve the financial and operational turnaround of State-owned Power Distribution Companies (DISCOMs). UDAY aimed to reduce the interest burden, cost of power, improvement in AT&C losses and ACS-ARR gap by improving operational and financial efficiency of DISCOMs.  As a result of participation of DISCOMs under UDAY and other efficiency measures, State Power Distribution Utilities have reported improvements which include (i) Reduction in Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses from 23.70% in FY 16 to 20.93% in FY 20 and (ii) Reduction of Average Cost of Supply (ACS) - Average Revenue Realised (ARR) gap from Re.0.48 per kWh in FY 16 to Re.0.30 per kWh in FY 20.  State-wise and Year-wise details of AT&C losses and ACS-ARR gaps are given at Annexure-II and Annexure-III respectively. 26 DISCOMs out of 66 have negative ACS-ARR gaps in 2019-20, which indicate relatively better financial performance.*********
