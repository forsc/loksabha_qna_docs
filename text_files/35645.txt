ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (SHRI PANKAJ CHAUDHARY)(a) Household consumption expenditure data collected by National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) was used as a proxy to capture the income inequality in terms of consumption expenditure. However, the latest data of large sample survey on household consumer expenditure collected by NSSO in its 68th round is for 2011-12. (b) There is no proposal under consideration of the Government for imposition of a wealth tax. (c), (d) & (e) The erstwhile Planning Commission estimated poverty line and poverty ratio on the basis of Large Sample Surveys on Household Consumer Expenditure carried out by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The last data of Large Sample Survey on Household Consumer Expenditure has been collected by NSSO in its 68th round conducted in 2011-12. Based on this data, the erstwhile Planning Commission estimated poverty lines and poverty ratio in 2011-12, and the same was released on 22nd July 2013. Using National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-4 (2015-16) report, NITI Aayog has prepared a Multidimensional Poverty Index at the national, states and districts level. It aims to enable measuring deprivation across twelve indicators at national, States and districts level. However, since the Multidimensional Poverty Index is based on NFHS-4 data of 2014-15, it can only serve as the baseline for measuring deprivation in future studies. Government is implementing several targeted schemes that aim to reduce poverty and inequality, provide social security, income generation and livelihood options, and improve the quality of life of the vulnerable sections of the population in the country. Some of these include Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana, Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission, Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Urban Livelihoods Mission, Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana, National Health Mission, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, Atal Pension Yojana, Aspirational Districts Programme, Pradhan Mantri Kisan Mandhan Yojana, Stand Up India Scheme, Skill India Mission, Start Up India Scheme, One nation one ration card scheme, Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Man-dhan yojana, PM Mudra Yojana, Ayushman Bharat Scheme, AMRUT Scheme, Sansad Adharsh Gram Yojana. *****
