ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a)	No, Sir. NITI Aayog has been mandated to identify CPSEs for strategic disinvestment. For this purpose, NITI Aayog has classified CPSEs into “high priority” and “low priority”, based on (a) National Security (b) Sovereign functions at arm’s length, and (c) Market Imperfections and Public Purpose. The CPSEs falling under “low priority” are covered for strategic disinvestment. Profitability of CPSEs is not the relevant criteria for this purpose. (b) & (c)	Representations with regard to the strategic disinvestment of the CPSEs are received from various stakeholders from time to time, and are examined and responded to as per the procedure, keeping in view the extant disinvestment policy of the Government. (d) No, Sir.*****
