ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a): 	Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has taken a number of steps for checking food adulteration in the country. FSSAI has developed over 500 food product standards, reviewed and expanded standards for food additives that now has over 9000 provisos covering 350 additives and food processing aids by harmonizing the standards of food additives with Codex Standards. It has also put in place a mechanism for approval of products which are not covered in the existing regulations. All Food Business Operators (FBOs) have to ensure adherance to these standards.  FSSAI has established a robust food testing   infrastructure across India by notifying adequate number of food testing laboratories. It has provided assistance under a Central Sector Scheme for strengthening of State Food Testing Labs. FSSAI has promoted self testing by consumers through simple tests which can be conducted at home through ‘Detect Adulteration with Rapid Test (DART)’ booklet which is available on website. FSSAI has announced a policy for adoption of Rapid Analytical Food Testing (RAFT) Kit/Equipment/Method for regulatory purpose (either on field, in laboratory or both) which includes kits for analysis of milk including adulterations.  Risk based sampling and digital inspection called Food Safety Compliance through Regular Inspections and Sampling (FoSCoRIS) has been introduced for revamping Inspection System.Robust feedback mechanism has been put in place to enable seamless reporting of cases of food adulteration by the consumers. Food category specific provisions have been made such as ban on sale of loose oil, mandatory BIS certification for packaged drinking water etc.  (b):	The Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 does not supplant the penal provisions available under the other Acts but supplement them. Therefore, action can be taken against adulterators under Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and other Acts.  (c):	The sanctioned strength of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has been increased from 356 to 824 in August, 2018. (d):	FSSAI at present has a network of 262 laboratories across the country which is sufficient. This network comprising of 244 laboratories for primary testing and 18 laboratories for appellate (referral) testing both in Private as well as Government Sector. Most of the private laboratories notified by FSSAI have adequate modern equipment to test food samples in the country. No funding is required for such laboratories. FSSAI has supported State Food Testing Laboratories through a Central Sector Scheme for “Strengthening of Food Testing System in the Country including Provision of Mobile Food Testing Labs” with an outlay of Rs.481.95 crore from the financial year 2016-17. (e):	Yes. These labs are accessible to the general public for testing of food samples. Further, Section 40 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, also enables the purchaser of any article of food to get analyzed such food from the Food Analyst after informing the food business operator at the time of purchase of his intention to have such article so analyzed.
