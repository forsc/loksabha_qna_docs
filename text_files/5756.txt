ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a) to (d) A statement is laid on the table of the House.Statement in reply to parts (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha starred question No. 463 for 25/07/2019 regarding training programmes for various sports asked by Smt. Keshari Devi Patel, Hon’ble MP.(a) & (b) Sir, decision was taken to open Sports Authority of India Training Centre (STC) at Allahabad on 18.01.2001 on residential basis. The STC could not be started for want of infrastructure facilities from the State Government for running it. The Centre was made functional as a day boarding centre from the financial year 2006-07 till 31st July, 2017. The Centre was again re-opened on 11th April, 2018 as a day boarding centre and a badminton coach was posted on 7th January, 2019. The issue of irregular availability of sports infrastructure of the State Government, which is hampering smooth running of the STC, is being discussed with the State Government.(c) Sports being a State subject promotion of sports, including setting up new indoor/outdoor stadium, is the primary responsibility of the State Government. Central Government supplements efforts of the State Government for bridging gaps in sports infrastructure. Central Government has sanctioned 25 sports infrastructure projects for the State of Uttar Pradesh. Release of further funds depends upon physical progress of these projects and receipt of utilization certificates of funds released so far.(d) Central Government does not provide district wise funds for development of sports and training of sportspersons. Based on their sporting talent all athletes, including from District Prayagraj (Allahabad), are eligible to avail SAI training facilities and benefit under Khelo India Scheme.*****
