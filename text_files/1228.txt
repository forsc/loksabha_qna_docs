                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE (IC) OF THE MINISTRY OF AYURVEDA,YOGA & NATUROPATHY, UNANI, SIDDHA AND HOMOEOPATHY(SHRI SHRIPAD YESSO NAIK)(a) & (b):       Yes, the 5th International Day of Yoga (IDY) was celebrated on 21.06.2019 in thecountry and world-wide. The main theme of this IDY was “Yoga for Heart Care”.                Ministry of AYUSH has the mandate of being the Nodal Ministry for the observation of International Day of Yoga (IDY). As the nodal Ministry, it encourages other Ministries, State governments, local self government bodies and other stake-holding institutions to observe International Yoga Day in a befitting manner, and suggests detailed lists of activities. These Ministries and stake-holding institutions prepare their own sets of activities and implement them. The activities so implemented include Mass Yoga Demonstrations, Yoga training camps, lectures, seminars etc. The Ministry of AYUSH does not provide financial support to these agencies.              The main event of Mass Yoga Demonstration for the observation of 5th IDY was held at Prabhat Tara Ground, Ranchi, Jharkhand on 21.06.2019 in which around 30,000 people participated.              The details of the funds allocated/ expenditure incurred by the Ministry of AYUSH on the celebration of the event this year including expenses incurred on promotion, publicity, advertisement and awareness is given at Annexure.(c):      In addition to the main event at Ranchi, Ministry of AYUSH has also organized events of Mass Yoga Demonstrations for IDY at following places in NCT of Delhi:S. No. 	Place	No. of participants (approx.)1.	Rajpath, New Delhi 	15,0002.	Lodhi Garden, New Delhi	1,3003.	Talkatora Garden, New Delhi	8004.	District Park, Sector-11, Dwarka, New Delhi	4,8005.

Lal Quila, Delhi	40,000              The participation in the Yoga events for International Day of Yoga was on voluntary basis. Events were organized by various agencies like States/UTs at the State, District, Block and Panchayat level and also by other stake-holding organizations like Govt. and Educational Institutions, NGOs, RWAs etc. The details of events organized by other agencies, including the venues and the number of participants are not maintained by this Ministry.(d):      The State/UTs plan and execute their own programs for the observation of IDY,voluntarily and by their own initiative.          There is no such proposal sent by any State/UT regarding the selection of venues and other facilities for organizing International Day of Yoga.  (e):        The Government of India does not maintain data on number of youth trained in Yoga in other countries. However, empirical information indicates that there is a significant spurt in the number of youth getting trained in Yoga in recent years.              The Government has set up a Yoga Certification Board (YCB) to standardize and strengthen Yoga training by providing certification to individuals and accreditation to Institutions. This is a significant step in spreading Yoga in India and other countries. The Government has also included Yoga training in the “Study in India” programme of Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource and Development to encourage Yoga seekers from abroad to obtain authentic Yoga training in India.               Under the Information Education and Communication (IEC) Scheme of the Ministry, many activities are taken up to reach out to people and to create awareness about Yoga. IEC activities include programs on TV, Radio, Print-media, seminar, Arogya Fairs, Seminars/ Conference/ Workshops to create awareness about Yoga among the people.            Indian Missions in foreign countries, the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) and the Ministry of Tourism take up a series of activities every year to promote Yoga world-wide, the highlights of which are the Mass Yoga Demonstrations organized at on the International Day of Yoga in different cities across the world including iconic locations Eiffel Tower, Times Square etc.………………
