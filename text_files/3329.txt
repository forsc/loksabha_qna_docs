ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                          (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a):   Yes, Sir. As per Census of India, the slum population of India has increased from 5,23,71,589 in 2001 to 6,54,94,604 in 2011. The State/ Union Territory (UT)-wise slum population in India as per Census of India 2001 and 2011 are at Annexure-I. Since ‘Land’ and ‘Colonisation’ are State subjects, the data regarding details of slums are available with the concerned States/ UTs. (b) to (d): The Government of India through various programmatic interventions has been assisting States/ UTs both technically and financially in order to address their housing shortage. In this regard the MoHUA has been implementing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) {PMAY(U)} Mission since June 2015 for construction of all weather pucca houses to all eligible urban households including slum dwellers by the year 2022. Under PMAY(U) Mission, States/ UTs undertake demand survey for assessing actual demand of housing. On the basis of demand survey, States/ UTs prepare Housing for All Plan of Action (HFAPoA) and Annual Implementation Plan (AIP), validate and prepare the list of beneficiaries. Based on this, the States/UTs formulate project proposals under various verticals of PMAY(U) Mission including “In-situ” Slum Redevelopment (ISSR). Under PMAY(U) Mission, the details of funds released to States/ UTs for preparation of HFAPoAs and the status of HFAPoAs are at Annexure-II and Annexure-III respectively.                           *****
