ANSWER




THE MINISER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS(SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)& (b): Yes, Sir. Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has set up a Technology Sub-Mission (TSM) under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban (PMAY-U) Mission to facilitate adoption of modern, innovative and green technologies and building materials for faster and quality construction of houses. Under TSM, MoHUA initiated Global Housing Technology Challenge - India (GHTC-India) to identify and mainstream globally best available proven innovative technologies that are rapid, sustainable, green, resource efficient and disaster resilience. As a result, 54 innovative technologies from across the globe have been shortlisted, out of which, six Light House Projects (LHPs) are being constructed at six places across the country namely Indore, Rajkot, Chennai, Ranchi, Agartala and Lucknow to showcase the use of innovative technologies on ground. These LHPs aim to serve as Live laboratories for field level application, learning and replication. In order to propagate the various aspects of transfer of technologies, MoHUA has initiated an enrolment drive for different stakeholders including students and faculty of Engineering and Architecture Institutes, officials/ Engineers  of State Government, Developers and builders etc. from across the country as Technograhis, who will get latest information about the projects and also get opportunity to visit the sites to see physically the use of such technologies.Further, an e-course on ''Vulnerability Atlas of India has been started to create awareness and understanding about natural hazards and help in identification of regions with high vulnerability such as earthquakes and landslides. Additionally, a certificate course named NAVARITIH (New, Affordable, Validated, Research Innovation Technologies for Indian Housing) has been lunched to familiarise the stakeholders with the latest materials and technologies being used worldwide for housing. MoHUA is also undertaking 13 Demonstration Housing Projects (DHPs) in various parts of the country to showcase the field application of new emerging, green, sustainable and resource efficient technologies. These initiatives will facilitate transfer of technologies to States/Union Territories (UTs) including Andhra Pradesh.                                                 *****
