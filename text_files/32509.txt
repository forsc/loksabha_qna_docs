ANSWER




MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a) & (b): There is no shortage of coal in the country. Due to increased demand of power, less power generation by imported coal based power plants and some interruption in supply of coal due to heavy rains, the coal stock at the power plants depleted to 7.2 Million Tonnes (MT) as on 8th October, 2021. Subsequently with increased coal supplies, the coal stock has started increasing and has now reached 24.16 MT as on 26.01.2022 with respect to the plants based on domestic coal.CIL has provided more coal during the current fiscal (up to 26th January’22) in comparison to last year same period. During April-January’22 (upto 26th January’22), CIL has dispatched coal to the tune of 532.41 Million tonnes in comparison to last year same period figures of 453.98 Million tonnes achieving a growth of about 17%. (c) & (d): As per the current import policy, coal is kept under Open General License (OGL) and consumers are free to import coal from the source of their choice as per their contractual prices on payment of applicable duty. In view of limited domestic production of coking coal, coking coal will continue to be imported for use by the steel sector. Thermal power based on domestic coal may use imported coal up to 10% for blending with domestic coal, where technically feasible, to meet the increased power demand in the country.*****
