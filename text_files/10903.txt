                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):	 As per available estimates, India had more than 4.4 million people with Dementia in 2015.  Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most common cause of Dementia and accounts for 50 to 60 per cent of total demntia cases. Early onset of AD occurs between the age ranging from the thirties to mid sixties. Onset of AD at a younger age is unusual and often suggests a genetic cause. There is, however, no data to indicate that more persons of younger ages are getting affected with AD in India. (b) to (d):	 Risk for Dementia can be potentially reduced by better management of Diabetes and Hypertension. Government of India is implementing the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) with focus on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, screening, early detection and management of common Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) including diabetes and hypertension. Under this programme, 599 NCD clinics at district level and 3274 NCD clinics at Community Health Centre level have been set up.  Population based screening of persons above 30 years of age for common NCDs including diabetes and hypertension has also been rolled out.  Screening for common NCDs is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres.   Government is also implementing the National Programme for Health Care of the Elderly (NPHCE). The major activities of NPHCE include setting up of Geriatric Department in regional Geriatric Centres (RGC) with OPD care services and 30 bedded Geriatric Ward, setting up of Geriatric units at District Hospitals to provide specialized Geriatric Services including a 10 bedded Geriatric Ward, establishment of a rehabilitation unit at all Community Health Centres and Geriatric Clinics twice a week, setting up of weekly Geriatric Clinic by trained Medical Officers at Primary Health Centres and information, education and communication activities on healthy lifestyle, home care to the bed ridden and supporting devices for the needy elderly persons at sub-centre level.  Further, to address the burden on mental disorders, the Government is implementing the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) and the District Mental Health Programme (DMHP) in the country.  As on date, the DMHP has been approved for implementation in 655 districts.  The Government has also funded   establishment of 25 Centres of Excellence    and upgradation of 47 post graduate departments in mental health specialities of 19 medical colleges/mental health institutions to increase the availability of trained manpower in mental health specialities as well as to improve the tertiary care facility.    The Central and State Mental health Institutions and the Psychiatric Wings of the Central and State medical colleges also have facilities for early detection and treatment for AD.
