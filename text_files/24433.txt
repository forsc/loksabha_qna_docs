                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)& (b)	Rural Roads is a State subject. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) was launched as a one-time special intervention to support enhancement of rural connectivity, by way of a single all-weather road, to the eligible unconnected habitations of designated population size (500+ in plain areas and 250+ in North-Eastern States, Himalayan States and Himalayan Union Territories as per 2001 census) in the core network for uplifting the socio-economic condition of the rural population. Relaxation has been provided to the Tribal (Schedule V) areas and Selected Tribal and Backward Districts (as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and Planning Commission), and unconnected habitations in these areas with a population of 250 persons and above in the Core Network as per Census 2001 are eligible for connectivity under the scheme. In the critical Left Wing Extremism affected blocks (as identified by Ministry of Home Affairs), additional relaxation has been given to connect habitations with population 100 persons and above as per 2001 census.   The unit for PMGSY programme is habitation. Against 1,78,184 habitations of the population size 250+ and 500+ identified for coverage under PMGSY, 16,086 habitations have been provided connectivity by the States/UTs out of their own resources and 4,716  habitations have either been dropped or have not been found feasible.
