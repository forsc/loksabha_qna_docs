Many schools during lockdown, made use of technological platforms as Youtube, DIKSHA, Whatsapp, Google Classroom, Mobile Apps (StepApp) etc..   Some of the processes adopted by States to reach out to students where availability of smart device or connectivity was a challenge are as follows: a.	Delivery of study materials to the houses of students including postal delivery.b.	Telephonic counselling and guidance by teachers and principals.c.	Special campaigns for reaching the doorstep of students and providing them with the required learning materials including books, etc., like Shikshan Setu Abhiyan, Project Unlock Learning, School on Wheels.d.	Physical visit by teachers to the villages of students for guiding the students through Village Learning Circles, Alternate Mentorship and Learning Programmes (ALMP)e.	In case of availability of televisions, students were encouraged to make use of satellite TV channels like EDUSAT, Gyan Darshan etc.*****
