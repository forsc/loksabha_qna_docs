                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PG & PENSIONS AND IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE(DR. JITENDRA SINGH):	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.****STATEMENT LAID ON THE TABLE OF THE LOK SABHA IN REPLY TO STARRED QUESTION NO. 306 REGARDING “CHANDRAYAAN MISSION” ASKED BY SHRI G.S. BASAVARAJ FOR ANSWERING ON WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17, 2021.Chandrayaan-2 was a highly complex mission to develop and demonstrate the key technologies for end-to-end lunar mission capability, including soft-landing and roving on the lunar surface. It comprised of an Orbiter, Lander and Rover.But for achieving soft landing at the intended spot, the other objectives of the mission have been significantly attained. So much so, that against an initially envisaged one-year life of orbiter, we expect it to be serving for seven years. The mission has accomplished the objective of expanding the lunar scientific knowledge through detailed study of topography, mineralogy, surface chemical composition, thermo-physical characteristics and tenuous lunar atmosphere leading to a better understanding of the origin and evolution of the moon.*****
