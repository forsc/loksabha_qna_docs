These authorised dismantlers and recyclers have capacity of 7,82,080.62 MTPA. In the said rules, all authorized dismantlers/ recyclers are required to maintain data on E-waste processed by them and subsequently submit annual report to respective State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/ Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) for their assessment & verification.
