ANSWER




(a) to (d) To ensure better monitoring and efficient implementation, presently in the XVth Finance Commission Cycle, all the schemes for women and children of the Ministry have been clubbed together into three verticals, viz. (1) Saksham Anganwadi & Poshan 2.0 for improving nutrition indicators in the country (2) Mission Shakti, for safety, protection and empowerment of women; and (3) Mission Vatsalya, for protection and welfare of children. The details of these schemes are as under: (i) Saksham Anganwadi & Poshan 2.0: This programme has been reorganized into 3 primary verticals: (i) Nutrition Support for POSHAN and for Adolescent Girls (ii) Early Childhood Care and Education [3-6 years] and (iii) Anganwadi Infrastructure including modern, upgraded Saksham Anganwadis. (ii) Mission Shakti: Mission Shakti comprises of two sub-schemes ‘Sambal’ and ‘Samarthya’ for safety and security of women and empowerment of women respectively. The existing schemes of One Stop Centres (OSC), Women Helplines (181-WHL) and Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) have been made part of Sambal sub- scheme; while the existing schemes of Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), Ujjwala, Swadhar Greh and Working Women Hostel and National Creche Scheme have been subsumed in ‘Samarthya’. (iii) Mission Vatsalya: Under Mission Vatsalya, the Child Protection Scheme(CPS) has been strengthened for better outreach and protection for children in need and care in a mission mode with the objective to: (i) Support and sustain Children in difficult circumstances, (ii) Develop context-based solutions for holistic development of children from varied backgrounds, (iii) Provide scope for green field projects for encouraging innovative solutions, (iv) Cement convergent action by gap funding, if required. The funds under the schemes of the Ministry are released to the State Governments for their implementation. However, funds are released directly to districts under the schemes of Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP), One Stop Centre (OSC) and Universalization of Women Helplines (WHL) only. In the State of Madhya Pradesh, while fund under the WHL scheme is released to Bhopal district, district-wise fund allocation in respect of the  Bhind and Datia districts under One Stop Centre and Beti Bachao Beti Padhao schemes during the last three years are annexed at Annexure-I.  ******Annexure-IDistrict-wise details of the funds allocation in respect of Bhind and Datia districts in Madhya Pradesh during the last three years1.
