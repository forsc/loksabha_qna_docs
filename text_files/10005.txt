ANSWER




(a) & (b):	As per the provisions of Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO, 2013), the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) fixes the ceiling/retail price of scheduled formulation and new drugs. The pharma companies are liable to comply with the prices fixed by the NPPA. The NPPA also monitors non-scheduled formulations to ensure that no manufacturer increases the maximum retail price of a drug more than ten percent of maximum retail price during preceding twelve months. Whenever a company is found violating the provisions of the DPCO, and selling the medicine at a higher price, the NPPA initiates appropriate action for recovery of the overcharged amount in terms of the provisions of the DPCO read with Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Details of overcharging cases including the amount recovered from Pharmacompaniesupto 31st October, 2019 is available on the NPPA’s website www.nppaindia.nic.in.(c):	The NPPA undertakes following activities as per the provisions of the DPCO, 2013 to curb malpractices of selling medicines at higher prices:(i)	Samples are procured from open market to check compliance of the notified ceiling price for a scheduled drug/formulation. State Drug Controllers forward cases relating to violation of ceiling price for a scheduled drug / formulation.(ii)	NPPA monitors permissible annual increase in Maximum Retail Price (MRP) for a non-scheduled drug / formulation, and permissible annual increase in maximum retail price based on wholesale price index.(iii)	NPPA also takes action on complaints received from individuals, NGOs, etc. relating to violation of the provisions of the DPCO by the pharmaceutical companies.(d):	The prevailing Pricing Policy i.e. National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Policy (NPPP), 2012 is applicable to all the states across the country including Gujarat. Copy of NPPP, 2012 is available on the website of Department of Pharmaceuticals (DoP) i.e. www.pharmaceuticals.gov.in.*******
