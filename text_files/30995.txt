ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (f): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (f) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. 251 BY SHRI BHAGIRATH CHOUDHARY TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 15.12.2021 REGARDING AJMER-TONK NEW RAILWAY LINE(a) to (f): Ajmer (Nasirabad) – Sawai Madhopur (ChauthKa Barwara) via Tonk (165 km) new line project was included in the Budget 2015-16 with the commitment from Government of Rajasthan to provide land free of cost and to share 50% cost of the project. Accordingly, State Government was requested for funding 50% of the project cost and to provide land free of cost. Government of Rajasthan has not agreed for providing land free of cost and share 50% cost of project and expressed their inability for cost sharing.Since Government of Rajasthan has expressed their inability in cost sharing, refused cost sharing of Ajmer (Nasirabad) – Sawai Madhopur (ChauthKa Barwara) via Tonk (165 km) new line project, Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the project has not been signed yet with Government of Rajasthan and therefore execution of project is held up on this account.Presently, 28 projects (11 new lines, 05 gauge conversion and 12 doubling), costing ` 56,261 crore for 5,069 km length falling fully/partly in Rajasthan are under different stages of planning/approval/execution. Out of which, 769 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `9,690 Cr. has been incurred upto March 2021. These include:•	11 New Line Projects covering a length of 1,228 km at a cost of `15,920 crore, out of which 107 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `2,260 crore has been incurred upto March 21.•	05 Gauge Conversion Projects covering a length of 1,319 km at a cost of `12,690 crore, out of which 520 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `3,030 crore has been incurred upto March 21.•	12 Doubling Projects covering a length of 2,522 km at a cost of `27,651 crore, out of which 142 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `4,400 crore has been incurred upto March 21.On the request of Government of Rajasthan, Bankability study of project was carried out by Railway. As per report Rate of Return of project is (-) 7.85% with land cost and (-) 7.08% without land cost.  Considering the huge shelf of ongoing projects and Rate of Return     (-)7.85% of the project, it is not possible for Railways to take up the Ajmer to Tonk via Sawai Madhopur new line project solely with Gross Budgetary Support (GBS).	Since 2014, there is substantial increase in Budget allocation for infrastructure projects and commensurate commissioning. Average annual Budget allocation on infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/partly in Rajasthan during 2014-19 has been increased to `2,951 crore per year from `682 crore per year during 2009-14. Thus, the average annual Budget allocation during 2014-19 is 333% more than average annual allocation of 2009-14.  Budget allocation for these projects in 2019-20 has been increased to `4,686 crore (587% more than average annual budget allocation of 2009-14) and `4,582 crore in financial year 2020-21 (572% more than average annual Budget outlay of 2009-14). Highest ever Budget outlay of `6006 crore (original Budget outlay `4,986 crore and additional outlay `1,020 crore) has been provided for these projects for financial year 2021-22 which is 781% more than average annual budget outlay during 2009-14.During 2014-21, 1947 km sections (176 km New line, 637 km Gauge conversion and 1134 km Doubling), falling fully/partly in the state of  Rajasthan, have been commissioned at an average rate of 278.14 km per year, which is 74% more than average annual commissioning achieved during 2009-14 (159.60 Km/year).*****
