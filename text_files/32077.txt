                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) The bio-medical waste (BMW) generation in the state of Rajasthan is 18.9 Tons per day (TPD) as per the Annual Report furnished by Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB) for the year 2020.(b) The District-wise details of Common Bio-medical Waste Treatment Facilities (CBWTFs) in the State of Rajasthan is Annexed.(c) The RSPCB has reported that none of the CBWTFs has reached their saturation capacity.(d) Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has reported that there are 208 operational CBWTFs in the country for treatment and disposal of BMW. Further, additional 32 CBWTFs are under construction. All the operational CBWTFs are successfully engaged in handling, treatment and disposal of BMW generated during the pandemic.(e)&(f)	Yes, Madam/ Sir. To enhance capabilities of already existing CBWTFs, CPCB has prepared technical guidelines for effective implementation of BMW Management Rules, 2016 and proper treatment and disposal of BMW by CBWTFs. The CPCB had also issued “Guidelines for Handling, treatment and disposal of waste generated during treatment, diagnostics and quarantine of COVID-19 patients”. Further, an app namely, ‘COVID19BWM’ is functional to track the generation of COVID-19 related BMW in the country.The CPCB guidelines prescribe for extended operation of CBWTFs (in terms of hours) to treat and dispose incremental quantity of BMW generated from COVID-19 treatment in consultation with respective SPCBs/ PCCs. The guidelines also prescribe that in case of increased generation of yellow color-coded (incinerable) COVID-19 waste (i.e. beyond the capacity of existing CBWTFs and captive BMW incinerators), respective SPCBs/ PCCs may permit disposal of such BMW through Hazardous Waste incinerators at existing Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facilities or captive industrial incinerators ensuring separate arrangement for COVID19 BMW handling and waste feeding. *****
