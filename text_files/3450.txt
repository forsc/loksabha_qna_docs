This Programme, under the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, will focus on integrated demand and supply side management of water at the local level, including creation of local infrastructure for source sustainability like rainwater harvesting, groundwater recharge and management of household wastewater for reuse in agriculture. The Jal Jeevan Mission will converge with other Central and State Government Schemes to achieve its objectives of sustainable water supply management across the country. An amount of Rs. 10000.66 crore has been allocated in the current financial year 2019-20 for the Programme. (b) Under National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), coverage of clean drinking water is maintained in terms of fully covered habitations (i.e. getting more than 40 litre per capita per day safe drinking water) and partially covered habitations (i.e. getting less than 40 litre per capita per day safe drinking water).

The Government has launched the Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), a time-bound, mission-mode water conservation campaign.

During the campaign, officers, groundwater experts and scientists from the Government of India will work together with State and district officials in India’s most water-stressed districts for water conservation and water resource management by focusing on accelerated implementation of five targeted interventions. The JSA aims at making water conservation a ‘Jan Andolan’through asset creation and communication campaign.(e) Water being a State subject, measures for management of water resources is primarily taken by respective State Governments.
