ANSWER




MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) & (b) To prevent the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, Indian Railways discontinued all regular passenger carrying trains w.e.f. 23rd March, 2020 as per the extant guidelines issued by Government of India.  In accordance with the further guidelines issued by the Government from time to time, Indian Railways resumed passenger train operations w.e.f. 1st May, 2020 by operating Shramik special trains followed by operation of Rajdhani Special services w.e.f. 12th May, 2020 and other special trains w.e.f 1st June, 2020. The number of services has been increased in a phased manner and as on 05.03.2021, Indian Railways is operating 2288 Mail/Express Special Trains, 650 Passenger trains and 5362 Suburban Trains.  (c) During Pre- COVID time for long distance passengers two types of train services were running over Indian Railways (i) Regular time tabled trains and (ii) Special trains during festivals / peak demand period /rush period etc.  Further, Special trains were of three types (1) Second class unreserved specials on normal fare (2) Special trains on special charges on normal fare plus special charges (10% in second class reserved and 30% in other classes subject to prescribed maximum and minimum limit), and (3) Suvidha Specials on minimum tatkal fare and maximum three times of tatkal fare.  For both special trains on special charges and Suvidha trains, fare for second class unreserved was normal second class Mail/Express superfast fare.In view of health advisory due to COVID-19, regular train services are running as COVID specials on the fare as applicable for regular time Tabled trains.  During COVID times as passenger demands are not uniform over different sectors, some special trains on special charges have been introduced to meet the additional demands over different sectors as per already published fare for special trains on special charges vide (2) above.  Further, unreserved second class has been declared as reserved second class in view of pandemic situation.(d) to (f) Indian Railways is keeping a close watch on the prevailing situation and is resuming train operations in a phased manner.
