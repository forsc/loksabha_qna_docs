ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT( SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (c): The Central Government has taken several initiatives to assess and improve thequality of teaching in the country as follows:(i) In order to focus on quality education, the Central rules to the Right of Children to Freeand Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 have been amended to include reference on classwise,subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages(Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science upto the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs.These would serve as a guideline for State and UTs to ensure that all children acquire appropriatelearning level.(ii) The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) conducts periodicnational surveys of learning achievement of children in classes III, V, VIII and X. Four rounds ofNational Achievement Survey (NAS) have been conducted so far for class V and three roundsfor classes III & VIII. These reveal improvement in learning achievement levels of pupils, inidentified subjects from first round to fourth round. Further, a National Achievement Surveybased on learning outcomes was conducted for Classes III, V and VIII on 13th November, 2017with a sample frame upto district level to enable states/UTs to identify gaps in learning outcomesat district level and design strategies to address those gaps. Similarly, NAS for Class X wasconducted on 5th February, 2018. NAS Reports show students’ learning levels against theexpected learning outcomes of a particular grade and are used to provide feedback to the districtsfor further improvement.(iii) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period of in-servicetraining for untrained elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019 in all the States and UTs. As perthe above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Governmentaided,and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by anacademic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The NationalInstitute of Open Schooling (NIOS) was entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (OpenDistance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has been started from 3rd October, 2017and completed on 31st March, 2019.(iv) A four year B.Ed integrated course to bring about qualitative improvement in teachereducation programmes in India has been conceptualised and regulations for this course havebeen published in official gazette on 29th March, 2019 and applications have been invited w.e.f.3rd June, 2019. The model curriculum prepared for this course includes crucial aspects likeGender, Inclusive education, ICT, Yoga, Global Citizenship Education (GCED) and Health &Sanitation. The teaching specialization would primarily be for the primary levels and thesecondary level.(v) The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Amendment) Act, 2018 hasbeen notified on 11th January, 2019. The said Act provides to empower the appropriateGovernment to take a decision as to whether to hold back a child in the 5th class or in the 8thclass or in both classes, or not to hold back a child in any class till the completion of elementaryeducation. The Act seeks to improve the learning levels of children and will lead to greateraccountability and improvement in the quality of education.(vi) The Central Government has launched an integrated scheme for school education namedas Samagra Shiksha, w.e.f. 2018-19 which subsumes the three erstwhile Centrally Sponsoredschemes of school education i.e Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik ShikshaAbhiyan (RMSA), and Centrally Sponsored Scheme on Teacher Education (CSSTE). Thecommon objectives of all these Schemes were to enhance access, to promote equity through theinclusion of disadvantaged groups and weaker sections and to improve the quality of education.The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to seniorsecondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels.(vii) Government of India has decided to participate in the Programme for InternationalStudents Assessment (PISA) to be conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD) in 2021. PISA is a competency based assessment which unlike contentbased assessment, measures the extent to which students have acquired key competencies thatare essential for full participation in modern societies. Learnings from participation in PISA helpto introduce competency based examination reforms in the school system and help move awayfrom rote learning. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and NCERT are part ofthe process and activities leading to the actual test.(viii) In order to experience and celebrate the rich cultural diversity of India, Rangotsav washeld from 7th to 21st December, 2018 in schools, with participation of students, teachers andother stake holders. Rangotsav is focused on creating a non-judgmental platform for theparticipants to explore and express their artistic minds through dance, music, theatre, paintingcraft making etc. The fortnight-long event promoted a joyful learning environment with norestriction on expression of different forms of arts. It is a gate way for each state to get exposedto the cultures, arts and languages of other States and UTs and enrich the minds of students andenhance their thrust for knowledge.(ix) In order to objectively evaluate the performance of the school education system in theStates/UTs, MHRD has designed a 70 indicators based matrix called Performance Grading Index(PGI) to grade the States and UTs. The indicators have been chosen after detailed stakeholderconsultation and the information on these indicators is drawn from the inputs provided by therespective States and UTs. This grading system will assist the States and UTs to identify the gapand design appropriate interventions to bridge them.(x) Timely and accurate data is the basis of sound and effective planning and decisionmaking. Towards this end, the establishment of a well-functioning and sustainable EducationalManagement Information System is of utmost importance today. In 2018-19, the UDISE+ (i.e.UDISE plus) application has been launched to collect data from all schools, so that it becomesan effective tool for decision making.(xi) In order to provide supplementary learning material for students and for upgrading theskills of teachers, MHRD has developed a dedicated Digital Infrastructure for KnowledgeSharing (DIKSHA) platform. The high quality e-learning material both for students and teachersare uploaded by Ministry and States/UTs on this portal. This is expected to substantially augmentthe knowledge base of the students and technical skills of teachers at no additional cost.(xii) The Government has launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group of 6-18 years in Science,Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, modelbuilding, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities. The Central Government alsosupports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and earlyMathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely ‘Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat’(PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.(xiii) A single point repository of e resources called e- PATHSHALA containing NCERTtextbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing anddisseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and avariety of other print and non-print materials.(xiv) MHRD has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularlyknown as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9th July,2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education.NCERT is developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) forschool education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry,economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology andsociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have beencompleted in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAMplatform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students wereregistered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.(xv) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission ofeducational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV hasbeen launched. Central Institute of Educational Technology (CIET)-NCERT is the nationalcoordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018.
