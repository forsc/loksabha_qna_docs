                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (f):	Arthritis is a disease of joints (inflammation of joints) and  different type  of Arthritis include  Osteo Arthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Infectious Arthritis and Gout.	The reasons of Arthritis include injury, abnormal metabolism leading to gout, genetic such as Osteo Arthritis, Infectious and Immune system disfunction.  Ageing and unhealthy life style remain the major contributory factors. Public health and hospitals is a State subject. The Central Government, however, supplements the efforts of State Government.  Information about number of people suffering from Arthritis and number of Rheumatologists working in different Government hospitals  is  not maintained centrally.Arthritis is managed by  orthopedics surgeon, general physician, rheumatologist etc. depending upon type of Arthritis. There is no specific national programme for prevention and control of Arthritis.  However, the   National Programme for Health Care of the Elderly (NPHCE) addresses the issue of Arthritis among elderly.  Treatment in Government Hospitals  including treatment for arthritis is free or  subsidised. In addition, Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment (AMRIT) Deendayal outlets have been opened at more than 200 Institutions/Hospitals with an objective to make available drugs and implants at discounted prices to the patients.  Jan Aushadhi stores are set up by Department of Pharmaceuticals to provide generic drugs at affordable prices. Pradhan Mantri Jan ArogyaYojna (PMJAY) provides for benefit coverage of Rs. 5,00,000/-to over more than 10 crore beneficiary families, giving cashless access to services  in empanelled hospitals (both public and private) across India.
