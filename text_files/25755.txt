ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)	States and other stakeholders can, on a voluntary basis, submit mid-term reports to the Human Rights Council in respect of recommendations received during the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). This is not a mandatory requirement. In the case of India, the National Human Rights Commission has already submitted a mid-term report in May 2020 on the status of implementation of recommendations received during India’s third UPR.(c) & (d)	India believes in using the UPR national report drafting process as an opportunity to receive feedback on its laws and policies for advancing human rights. For this reason, India followed a broad-based consultative process in drafting the national report for the third cycle of the UPR that was submitted in 2017. During the drafting process, a series of national-level consultations were held with civil society representatives, national human rights institutions, line Ministries and academicians to aid in the identification of issues, achievements, challenges and constraints. A similar approach is likely to be followed in drafting the report for India’s fourth Universal periodic Review (UPR).***
