ANSWER




(a)	No such data is maintained by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.(b) 	Managing urban flooding falls under the purview of the Urban Local Body/Urban Development Authority and the State Governments as they are responsible for maintaining the drainage and sewerage systems of the city/town concerned. For the guidance of Urban Local Bodies/Urban Development Authorities and State Governments, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has issued Urban and Regional Development Plans Formulation and Implementation (URDPFI) Guidelines, 2014 by integrating the guidelines on mitigation, prevention and preparedness for urban flooding issued by the National Disaster Management Authority.  Also, the Ministry has issued Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Urban Flooding in 2017.  The SOP lays down, in a comprehensive manner, the specific actions required to be undertaken by the city administration, various departments under the district administration and the State Government with respect to urban flooding. Further, the Ministry has published a Manual on Storm Water Drainage Systems, 2019 to provide necessary guidance towards all aspects of sustainable design, planning and management of storm water drainage system in urban areas of the Country. The Manual also provides for necessary measures to be taken and emergency plan for flood response in urban areas.                                 *****
