                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(DR. SUBHAS SARKAR)(a)	to (d) As per the latest figures of Analysis of Budgeted Expenditure on Education, there has been a significant 53% increase in Public Expenditure on Education incurred by States/UTs in 2019-20 compared to 2015-16. The increase is seen in almost all the States during the period 2015-16 to 2019-20. The State-wise Expenditure for the five years i.e. from 2015-16 to 2019-20 is at Annexure.(e) to (g) One of the fundamental principles of National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 is ‘substantial investment in a strong, vibrant public education system as well as the encouragement and facilitation of true philanthropic private and community participation’. Accordingly, NEP 2020 also unequivocally endorses and envisions a substantial increase in public investment in education both by the Central government and all State Governments. The Centre and States work together to increase the public investment in Education sector to reach 6% of GDP at the earliest. Accordingly, Ministry has written to all its implementing agencies, regulatory bodies, State/UT Governments, other stakeholder Ministries/Departments, etc for taking steps for implementation of NEP 2020. In this regard, the Ministry of Education has, for the first time, been allocated a record Budget    of more than Rs. One Lakh Crore for its activities for the upcoming financial year 2022-23.      The NEP 2020 provides different timelines as well as principles and methodology for its implementation.******
