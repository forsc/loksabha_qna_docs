Only two Indian Air Force Helicopters have crash landed since August this year. Details of all Helicopter Accidents in last five years in all three services are appended below:-Date of Accident	Type of Helicopter	Number of persons killed/injured	Service8th Dec 2021	Mi-17 V5	14/ Nil	Indian Air Force18th Nov 2021	Mi-17 Helicopter	Nil/ 01 	Indian Air Force21st Sep 2021	Cheetah	02/ Nil	Indian Army3rd Aug 2021	ALH WSI	02/ Nil	Indian Army25th Jan 2021	ALH Weapon System Integrated (WSI)	1 /1 	Indian Army9th May 2020	ALH	Nil/ 05 	Indian Army24th Oct 2019	ALH	Nil/09 	Indian Army27th Sep 2019	Cheetah	02 / Nil	Indian Army10thApr 2019	Chetak	Nil/ Nil	Indian Navy23rd  May 2018	Cheetah	Nil/02 	Indian Air Force3rd April 2018	Mi-17 V5	Nil/Nil	Indian Air Force6th Oct 2017	Mi-17 V5	07/Nil	Indian Air Force5th Sep 2017	ALH	Nil/02 	Indian Army4th Jul 2017	ALH	03 /Nil	Indian Air Force15th Mar 2017	Cheetah	Nil/Nil	Indian Air Force(c) & (d):  Yes, Sir. Lt Col A S Bath and Capt Jayant Joshi lost their lives after their helicopter Rudra-WSI crash landed in Ranjeet Sagar Dam on 3rd August 2021. There is no restriction on the helicopter flying over water.  However, low flying over water needs specific authorisation. A Court of Inquiry has been ordered to investigate the crash. (e) The training has been structured to meet the operational requirements. However, operations over large expanse of water are restricted and generally a fraction of the total overall flying. Nevertheless, all recommendations of the Court of Inquiry are implemented to avoid recurrence of accidents.*****
