The requirement of hospital beds varies from one region to another based on age mix of population and disease profile; their incidence & prevalence rates.  Under AB-PMJAY, hospitals are empanelled based on defined criteria, including the requirement of minimum beds, and hospital empanelment guidelines, which have been issued to all the States. The empanelment of hospitals is being done by the State Health Agencies of respective States. The guidelines and list of empanelled hospitals are available on the website www.pmjay.gov.in. As on 25.11.2019, AB-PMJAY has 19,668 empanelled hospitals.
