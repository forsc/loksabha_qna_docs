                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (e)	Government of India commenced operations under the Vande Bharat Mission on May 7, 2020 to facilitate the return of stranded Indian nationals abroad in a phased manner. The Vande Bharat Mission is the largest and most complex exercise ever undertaken by the government for repatriation of its nationals stranded overseas. As of 1 March 2021, more than 45 lakh people have returned under the Vande Bharat Mission. Most stranded Indians with compelling reasons have returned to India and those still wishing to return to India can do so under the various Vande Bharat flights. Our Missions arrange for the welfare of Indian nationals, where required, including through Indian community associations. In some cases, arrangements were also made for flight tickets, boarding and lodging and emergency medical assistance.The Government of India has launched an initiative SWADES (Skilled Workers Arrival Database for Employment Support) to conduct a skill mapping exercise of  returning citizens under the Vande Bharat Mission for re-employment purposes through the creation of a database.***
