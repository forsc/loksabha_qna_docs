ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to  (f)	Till date, no proposal has been received in this Ministry to implement biodiversity conservation as new criterion to grant environmental and forest clearances. However, the overall biodiversity conservation criteria are already incorporated in forest, wildlife and environmental clearances. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has notified the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006, as amended from time to time, under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, which deals with the process to grant environmental clearance, stipulates conditions for safeguarding the environment which includes biodiversity conservation. The Expert Appraisal Committees (EAC) while appraising the projects for grant of environmental clearance duly considers impacts on the biodiversity, flora and fauna in the study area based on the EIA studies carried out for the project by the accredited consultants. Based on the same, specific conditions regard to implementation of biodiversity conservation plan are stipulated on case to case basis by the EAC while granting environmental clearance (EC). In case of presence of any Schedule-I species under Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and RET (Rare, Endangered and Threatened) species under International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is found in the study area, the EAC seek for biodiversity/wildlife conservation plan to minimise the impact due to project activity to the rare biodiversity present in study area of the project. In addition, the following standard EC conditions have already been stipulated for industries in the interest of conservation of biodiversity:i.	Green belt shall be developed in an area of 33% of the total project with indigenous native tree species in accordance with CPCB guidelines. The green belt shall inter-alia cover an entire periphery of the plant.   ii.	In-situ/ex-situ Conservation Plan for the conservation of flora and fauna should be prepared and implemented.iii.	Suitable screens shall be placed across the intake channel to prevent entrainment of life forms including eggs, larvae, juvenile fish, etc., during extraction of seawater.***
