ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b) According to the information received from the Ministry of Earth Sciences, sea level rise is a slow phenomenon and varies globally depending on local site factors. Recent studies by Indian scientists find that the trend in sea level rise is about 1.3mm/year along the Indian coasts during the last 40-50 years. (c) and (d) A wide range of coastal vulnerability maps on different spatial scales have been generated for the entire coast of India by various agencies primarily for providing forewarning of various ocean hazards viz., tsunami, cyclone-related storm surges. An atlas on Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) on a 1:1,00,000 scale has been prepared for the entire Indian coast. On a pilot scale, 3-Dimensional Geographical Information System (3D GIS) maps for the coastal stretch between Cuddalore and Nagapattinam have been completed in association with industry partners. A set of shoreline change maps have been prepared for the entire country on a 1:25000 scale to assess the erosion and sediment deposition rates. A National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) has been established by MoEFCC in Chennai to promote research and development in the area of coastal management including demarcation of hazard line for mapping the entire coastline of mainland India.
