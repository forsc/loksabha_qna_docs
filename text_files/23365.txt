Central and State Governments through their field agencies ensure that farmers are provided right knowledge/ information about recommended fertiliser and pesticide use. Judicious and balanced use of fertilisers and pesticides as per prescribed recommendations do not pose adverse effects on human beings, animals and environment.  11.93 crore farmers in the country have been provided Soil test based crop specific recommendations about integrated and balanced use of fertilisers (chemical, bio and organic fertilisers) under Soil Health Card programme during Cycle II (2017-19). Trainings and demonstrations on INM are integral part of schemes like National Food Security Mission, and Soil Health Management (SHM).Under ‘Sub-Mission on Plant Protection and Plant Quarantine programme trainings are imparted to farmers and State Extension Officers through Farmer Field Schools and Human Resource Development (HRD) programs on judicious use of chemical pesticides, safety in use of pesticides, alternate tools for pest management viz; cultural, physical, mechanical methods of pest control as well as use of bio-pesticides and bio-control agents, effects of pesticides on natural enemies of pests, do’s and don’ts of pesticide including proper application equipment and the technique. 	Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) conducts trainings and organizes front-line demonstrations etc. through Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) to educate farmers on IPM, INM, split application of fertilizers, use of slow releasing N-fertilizers and nitrification inhibitors, growing leguminous crops and use of Resource Conservation Technologies (RCTs) to reduce excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.Organic farming as a sustainable alternative to chemical farming for soil, environment and human wellbeing is encouraged under dedicated schemes of Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) & Mission Organic Value Chain for North Eastern Region (MOVCNDER).
