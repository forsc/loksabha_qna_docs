ANSWER




MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a):	There is no plan of Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) to export 10 lakh bales of cotton during the current cotton season. However, CCI is offering its cotton for export on daily basis through e-Auction. (b):	During current cotton season 2020-21, (from 1.10.2020 to 30.09.2021), as on 6thFebruary 2021, CCI has procured 90.87 lakh bales under Minimum Support Price (MSP) operations. State-wise procurement under MSP operations is annexed.(c):	CCI has not stopped the purchase of cotton at MSP. Further due to substantial increase in kapas rates during last three weeks, the ruling price of kapas are more than MSP rates in most of the cotton growing states and farmers are getting better price for their produce from market. Hence, Minimum Support Price (MSP) intervention is not presently required in these states. However, CCI is procuring around 25,000 to 30,000 bales per day in the cotton growing areas wherever the prevailing kapas prices are ruling below MSP.(d):	India is net cotton surplus country wherein production is more than its consumption. As there is sufficient availability of cotton in the country, export of surplus available cotton may not affect the textile units in the country. Rather, it will help the farmers to receive better price for their cotton.(e) & (f):	There is no such information available regarding demand for reducing the price of cotton in Tamilnadu due to COVID-19 Pandemic.
