CSR is a Board driven process and the Board of the company is empowered to plan, decide, execute and monitor CSR activities of the company based on the recommendation of its CSR Committee.  The CSR architecture is disclosure based and CSR mandated companies are required to file details of CSR activities annually in the MCA21 registry.  The existing legal provisions such as mandatory disclosures, accountability of the CSR Committee and the Board, provisions for statutory audit of accounts of the company etc. provide sufficient safeguards. Whenever any violation of CSR provisions is reported, action against such non-compliant Companies are initiated as per provisions of the Act after due examination of records and following due process of law. All CSR related defaults are compoundable. So far, sanction for prosecution has been accorded in 366 cases. Of these, 148 applications for compounding have been made and 75 cases have been compounded.  Further, through Companies amendment Act, 2019, the non-compliance of CSR has been a civil wrong from financial year 2020-21 onwards. As per filings made by the Companies in the MCA21 registry, the CSR spent by various public and private sector companies during last three financial years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 respectively are given below:  Nature of Company	FY 2017-18	FY 2018-19	FY 2019-20	No. of Companies	Total Amount Spent (in Cr.)	No. of Companies	Total Amount Spent (in Cr.)	No. of Companies	Total Amount Spent (in Cr.)Public Sector Undertakings(PSUs)	535	2,704.32	609	3,835.50	14	    438.29 Non-PSUs	20,915	11,185.53	24,323	14,819.32	1,061	 7,384.21 Grand Total	21,450	13,889.85	24,932	18,654.82	1,075	7,822.50 (Data upto 30.09.2020) [Source: National CSR Data Portal]                                                                                           Contd…2/-                                                    -2-The Companies (Amendment) Act, 2019 and 2020 have made requisite amendments to Section 135 of the Act and provided for treatment of unspent CSR fund by companies. In case a company has any ongoing project, the company shall open a special account in any scheduled bank in order to discharge its CSR obligation.  Further, the amendments in the Companies (CSR Policy) Rules, 2014 have been notified on 22nd January 2021. These amendments aim at strengthening the CSR ecosystem by enhancing the disclosures, simplifying the compliances, bringing in more objectivity, transparency and entrusting more responsibility on the Board of the company.                                               ******
