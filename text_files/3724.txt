It was reported by West Bengal Police that flow of FICNs continues from Indo-Bangladesh border, particularly from Malda area. However, all such FICNs were of low quality i.e. computer generated/manipulated. (b)	After the withdrawal of legal tender status of Specified Bank Notes of denomination of Rs.1000 and Rs.500 on 8thNovember, 2016, there have been no reported cases of seizure of High Quality Fake Indian Currency Notes of Rs.2000 and Rs.500 denomination till early 2019. As such, there does not appear to be any appreciable loss now.(c) As per Reserve Bank of India’s master circular dated July 1, 2019, no credit to customer’s account is to be given for counterfeit Notes, if any, detected in the tender received over the counter or at the back-office/currency chest.             Reserve Bank of India has advised all the bank to accept mutilated/defective/solid notes at all their branches vide master circular on “Facility for exchange of Notes & Coins” dated July 1, 2019.  However, small finance bank and payment banks may exchange mutilated and defective notes at their option. The mutilated notes are exchanged at all bank branches in terms of Reserve Bank of India (Note Refund) Rules, 2009, as amended in 2018.  (d) & (e) Government has taken various steps to check the smuggling and circulation of Fake Indian Currency Notes in the country, which inter-alia, include: (i) Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) Coordination Group (FCORD) has been formed by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to share intelligences/information among the security agencies of the States/Centre to counter the problem of circulation of fake currency in the country. As per the report of the agencies, there have been instances where it has been found that the fake currency has been smuggled from the neighboring countries. (ii) A Terror Funding and Fake Currency Cell (TFFC) has been constituted in National Investigation Agency (NIA) to investigate terror funding and fake currency cases. (iii) A memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed between India and Bangladesh to prevent and counter smuggling and circulation of fake currency notes. (iv) Security at the international border has been strengthened by using new surveillances technology, deploying additional manpower for round the clock surveillance, establishing observation posts along the international border erection of border fencing and intensive patrolling. ******
