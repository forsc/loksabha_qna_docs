                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	The Government has approved phase-III of Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) for consolidation of Through Routes and Major Rural Links connecting habitations, inter-alia, to Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs), Higher Secondary Schools and Hospitals at  an estimated cost of Rs. 80,250 crore. The Government is taking steps for implementation of phase-III of PMGSY. (c):	The information in respect of PMGSY roads are maintained Block-wise/District-wise and not Parliamentary Constituency-wise. However, as reported by the State Government of Madhya Pradesh, 28 such roads are lying incomplete in Rajgarh Lok Sabha Constituency. All actions, as per contractual provisions like imposition of Liquidated Damage (LD) for delay in completion, termination of contracts and also debarring of defaulting contractors after due consideration of all reasons/circumstances of the cases, are being taken by Madhya Pradesh Rural Roads Development Agency.

The Ministry of Rural Development/ National Rural Infrastructure Development Agency (NRIDA) issue general guidelines on quality control and prescribe Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads to regulate the quality control processes, at work level.  Further, as per the Operational Manual of PMGSY, whenever a work is graded as Unsatisfactory during quality inspections by National Quality Monitor (NQM), Programme Implementation Unit (PIU) is required to furnish action taken report to remove the defects.  Each work, post rectification, is verified by the State Quality Monitor (SQM) on ground before it is submitted online with all the requisite documents on website through State Quality coordinator (SQC). The State Government is required to take action against the erring officials and defaulting contractors for lapses committed. The State Government of Madhya Pradesh has intimated that  on account of delay in completion of road works in Rajgarh district, an amount of Rs. 190.32 lacs has been withhold from the running bills of the contractors till the works are completed and quantum of LD is decided. *****
