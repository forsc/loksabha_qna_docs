The Ministry runs the Childline (1098) service, a 24X7 emergency phone outreach for children in crisis which links them to emergency and long term care and rehabilitation services. *****ANNEXURE-I ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (A) & (B) OF LOK SABHA UN-STARRED QUESTION NO.5030 FOR ANSWER ON 01.04.2022 BY SHRI SHANMUGA SUNDARAM K.
