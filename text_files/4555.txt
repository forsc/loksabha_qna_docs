ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): No such proposal to take a part of the Arakkonam air base on lease from the Defence Ministry and to develop it as airport for landing and taking off small aircraft is under consideration at present.;However, Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)-Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN) in 2016 for promotion of Regional Connectivity by way of revival of un-served and under-served airports/airstrips in the country. The expansion of airports under the scheme is ''demand driven'', depending upon firm commitment from airline operators as well as from the State Government for providing various concessions. Arakkonam air base has been included in the scheme under un-served category. So far, no bids under RCS have been received to commence civil flights from the air base.
