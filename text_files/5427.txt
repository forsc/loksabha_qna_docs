                                                         MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a)&(b): The State–wise outstanding cane price dues of sugarcane farmers against sugar mills during current sugar season 2018-19 and last  three sugar seasons as on 17.07.2019 is at Annexure.(c)&(d): Surplus sugar production over domestic consumption requirement had led to subdued sugar prices  stressing the liquidity position of the sugar mills and leading to build up of cane price arrears of farmers. To improve the liquidity position of the sugar mills enabling them to clear cane price arrears of farmers, Minimum Selling Price (MSP) of sugar was fixed at Rs.29/kg  w.e.f 07.06.2018  which  has been revised to Rs.31/kg w.e.f 14.02.2019.      Minimum Selling Price (MSP) of sugar has been implemented simultaneously alongwith the imposition of mill-wise stockholding limits so that a level playing field is provided to all the sugar mills. Keeping in view the domestic demand/consumption requirements, sugar mills are allowed to sell sugar in the domestic market in accordance with their allocated monthly quota. Apart from the sale of sugar for domestic consumption, sugar mills are also free to export sugar from the country. ***ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) & (b) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.5004 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 23.07.2019 IN THE LOK  SABHA.
