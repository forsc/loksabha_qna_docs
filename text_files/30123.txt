ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS (SHRI DEVUSINH CHAUHAN)(a) 	Sir, mobile towers of any technology, including 3G and 4G, emit non-ionizing Electro-Magnetic Field (EMF) radiations. Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has prescribed norms for exposure limit for the EMF radiation (i.e. Base Station Emissions) which are 10 times more stringent than the safe limits prescribed by International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and recommended by World Health Organization (WHO).	Further, Government has put in place a well-structured process and mechanism so that Telecommunications Service Providers (TSPs) strictly adhere to these prescribed norms including submission of self-certificate by TSPs before commercial start of Base Transceiver Station (BTS) site.	The Licensed Service Area (LSA) field units of DoT carry out EMF measurement audit for upto 10% BTSs annually on random basis.	(b) 	DoT has already launched Tarang Sanchar web portal for information sharing on Mobile Towers and EMF Emission Compliances for general public. The portal has the complete collated technical details including latest certified EMF level of all the BTSs installed in the country. The portal can be accessed at www.tarangsanchar.gov.in. (c) & (d) 	The prescribed norms for exposure limit for the EMF radiations, as detailed in (a) above, are applicable to all areas at all the time including peak hours.(e) to (g) 	As has already been stated in part (a) above, the LSA field units of DoT carry out EMF measurement audit for upto 10% BTSs annually on random basis. Additionally, the BTS sites, against which there are public complaints, are also tested by LSA field units of DoT. *******
