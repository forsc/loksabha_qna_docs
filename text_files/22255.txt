ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI KRISHANPAL GURJAR)(a) to (c)  The Government has enacted the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016 which came into force on 19.04.2017. The Schedule of the said Act contains the list of specified disabilities. The Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD) constituted a High-Powered Inter-Departmental Committee under the Chairpersonship of Secretary, DEPwD to consider requests for inclusion of new disabilities. This Committee in its meeting held on 10.01.2018, inter-alia considered representation regarding inclusion of new categories of disabilities such as cancer, polycystic kidney disease/kidney post-transplant, Type I diabetes etc. The Committee was of the view that there is a clear distinction between disability and medical condition. The RPwD Act, 2016 mainly focuses on disability, whereas, medical condition relates to specific disease only. Any person suffering from disease conditions, if in the long term, develops any of the specified disabilities mentioned in the Schedule to the RPwD Act, 2016, is already covered within the ambit of the said Act. The Committee, therefore, was against inclusion of these conditions, per se, as ‘Specified Disability’, in the Schedule to the Act.*****
