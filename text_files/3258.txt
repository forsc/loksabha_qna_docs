                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS(KIREN RIJIJU)(a): The authorities like Court, Executive Council, Academic and Activity Council, Board of Sports Studies and Finance Committee in National Sports University (NSU), Manipur have not yet been constituted.(b): The Vice-Chancellor and other statutory posts are provided for in the National Sports University Act, 2018. For the present, Secretary, Department of Sports, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports has been appointed as the Interim Vice-Chancellor of NSU. It has been decided to engage TATA Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) for academic and professional consultancy. TISS would assist the Government for collaboration with expert foreign Universities / Institutions, identification of suitable persons in faculty and managers/leaders etc., so that the best people are appointed to develop NSU into a Sports University of global standard.(c): NSU has become functional only from 15.01.2018. As of now, there is no inspection report on functioning of NSU.(d): Sports being a State subject the responsibility for promotion of sports, including opening of Sports University in Karnataka, rests with the State Government. No new NSU is proposed to be set up. NSU being set up at Manipur, Imphal would cater to students and athletes of all States/UTs, including Karnataka.****
