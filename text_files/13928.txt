ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE; MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MINISTER OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????, ??????? ?? ???????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ??????? ????????. ???? ?????(a) to (c):	Government is aware of the fact that many Indian scientists are returning to India through different schemes / programmes of the Government. The Indian origin scientists’ return to India has increased to 709 during the period from 2013 to 18 from 314 during period from 2008-13. The increase in number of Indian scientists returning to India is primarily due to proactive schemes and programmes instituted by the Government. Department of Science and Technology (DST) through Ramanujan Fellowship Scheme and the Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE) Faculty Scheme and Department of Biotechnology (DBT) through Ramalingaswami re-entry Fellowship provide attractive avenues and opportunities to Indian researchers of high calibre, who are residing in foreign countries, to work in Indian Institutes/Universities of their respective interest and domain. ‘Visiting Advanced Joint Research (VAJRA) Faculty’ Scheme of Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) is another scheme aimed to bring overseas scientists and academicians including Non-resident Indians (NRI) and Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) to work in Indian public funded Institutions and Universities for a specific period of time. Welcome Trust / DBT India Alliance Programme offers fellowship to any national for undertaking basic, clinical and public health research work in Indian Institutes/Universities etc.(d) & (e): Government has taken several measures to stop migration of Indian Scientists to other countries. This includes implementation of schemes / programmes such as Fund for improvement of S&T infrastructures in universities and higher educational institutions (FIST) to build research infrastructure for enhancing research capabilities, Core Research Grant, Research fellowships such as JC Bose and Swarnajayanti are targeted at scientific community to continue global level research in the country. Special attention has been given to young scientists through schemes like Start-up Research Grant, National Postdoctoral Fellowship etc. for making them independent and motivate them to remain in the country. Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) encourages the talented scientists to start their own start-ups and entrepreneurship. The Flexible Complementing Scheme / Merit based promotion scheme positioned in scientific departments and  implementation of VII Pay Commission pay scales and introduction of Performance Related Incentive Scheme (PRIS) in strategic Departments have also been instrumental in recruiting and retaining scientists. The propitious policy frameworks developed by the Government and the sophisticated research facilities available in our academic and research institutions have shown good results in terms of quality and quantity of research output and help in arresting migration of Indian Scientists.***********
