ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (c)  : 	As on 31.10.2019, the installed generation capacity in the country is around 3,64,960 Mega Watt (MW), which is sufficient to meet the electricity demand in the country. The details of actual power supply position in terms of energy and peak of the country during the current year i.e. 2019-20 (upto October, 2019) is given at Annexure. It may be seen that the gap between demand and supply of power during the current year 2019-20 (upto October, 2019) both in terms of Energy and Peak is less than 1%. This gap is generally on account of factors other than inadequacy of power availability in the country e.g. constraints in sub-transmission and distribution network, financial constraints of State Power Utilities to purchase power etc. Further to meet the shortfall, if any, in the power requirement, Distribution Company can also purchase power from power exchanges on daily basis. Government of India is supporting the States/UTs in augmenting and strengthening the intra-state transmission and distribution network through various schemes including Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) and Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS). The coal supply has also improved as the coal stock in power plants as on 21.11.2019 is 23.1 Million Tonnes for the 14 days as against 12.1 MT for 7 days on the same day last year.                                           ***********
