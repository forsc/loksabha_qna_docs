ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) to (c):  The eCommittee of the Supreme Court has designed and rolled out in the year 2018, an e-filing system Version 1.0 and created a portal (efiling.ecourts.gov.in) for this purpose. The portal enables electronic filing of legal papers. E-filing being the principal foundation for future technological enhancement in the Indian Judiciary, Version 1.0 is already available in High Courts and District Courts.  The e-Filing application is integrated into the DistrictCourt CIS 3.2 & High Court CIS 1.0 software. The upgraded Version 2.0 and Version 3.0 for e-filing with enhanced user-friendly features have also been developed by e-Committee, Supreme Court of India. Upgraded version of eFiling software application have been developed with the latest features like Advocate Portfolio, Advocate Clerk entry module, Calendar and integration with social media platforms etc. Draft Model e-filing rules have been framed and circulated by the eCommittee of the Supreme Court for adoption by the various High Courts to develop a standard operating procedure. Keeping in view the present state of preparedness of courts, lawyers and litigants, the timing for mandatory efiling of all cases/ documents is yet premature. Establishment of Virtual Courts have helped to reduce paper wastage and to eliminate the burden of court cases. Virtual Courts have been rolled out to try traffic challan cases and have met with appreciable results. Presently there are 9 such courts in 7 States viz Delhi (2 courts), Faridabad (Haryana), Pune & Nagpur (Maharashtra) Kochi (Kerala), Chennai (Tamil Nadu), Gauhati (Assam) and Bengaluru (Karnataka). Environment friendly, these Virtual Courts enable adjudication of cases in paperless manner with e-payment of the fine imposed. The litigants can file the complaint electronically through e-filing, appears before a Judge virtually and also pay the court fees or fine online. To reduce the burden of court cases, the Government has adopted a co-ordinated approach to assist judiciary for phased liquidation of arrears and pendency in judicial systems, through various strategic initiatives like improving the infrastructure for courts including computerization, increase in strength of judicial officers/judges and filling up of vacant positions in High Courts/Supreme Court, policy and legislative measures in areas prone to excessive litigation, repeal of outdated and archaic laws, initiatives to fast track special type of cases and emphasis on Alternate Dispute Resolution etc. -----
