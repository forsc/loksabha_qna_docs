Part-II of the Rules, broadly administered by MeitY provide for due diligence to be followed by intermediaries and the additional due diligence to be followed by significant social media intermediaries. The rules aim to protect the rights of users and make the social media intermediary platforms accountable to laws of India against the online content, information and activities. The social media platforms are enjoined to develop a robust grievance redressal system. The intermediaries are required to publish privacy policy, rules and regulations and terms and conditions.  They are also expected to remove/disable content as and when brought to their knowledge either through a court order or through a notice by appropriate government or its agency. Intermediaries are required to inform their users not to publish/share/host any unlawful content. They are also expected to remove any unlawful content as and when brought to their knowledge either through a court order or through a notice by appropriate government or its agency.Part-III of the Rules, administered by Ministry of Information & Broadcasting,  require that publishers of news and current affairs shall observe the Code of Ethics which includes adherence to :(i)	Norms of Journalistic Conduct of the Press Council of India under the Press Council Act, 1978;(ii)	Programme Code under section 5 of the Cable Television Networks Regulation Act, 1995;(iii)	 Content which is prohibited under any law for the time being in force shall not be published or transmitted.The Rules also suggest a balanced approach to create a soft-touch self-regulatory architecture and a Code of Ethics and three tier grievance redressal mechanism for digital media in the nature of News and Current affairs in the online platform and Films and Audio-visual programmes made available by the online content providers.The Rules have come in effect from the date of their notification, i.e. 25-02-2021, except for the additional due diligence for significant social media intermediaries, which shall come in effect 3 months after notification of these Rules.******
