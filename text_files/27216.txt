                                                        THE MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a) & (b) Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT) was constituted by the Government of India in April, 1969. The Tribunal gave its report in 1973 and Further Report in 1976.Subsequently, on the requests made by the States of erstwhile undivided Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra, under Section 3 of the Inter-State River Water Disputes Act of 1956 (the Act), Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT-II) was constituted by the Central Government in April 2004 for adjudicating on  inter-State river Krishna and the river valley thereof between the States of Maharashtra, Karnataka and erstwhile Andhra Pradesh. The Tribunal gave its report and decision on 30.12.2010. The party States and the Central Government sought clarification from the Tribunal under Section 5(3) of the Act. The Tribunal  forwarded its report on 29.11.2013 under section 5(3) of the Act. However, on account of stay by Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its order dated 16.09.2011, the Award as per report of KWDT-II dated 29.11.2013 was not published in the official gazette in terms of section 6(1) of the Act.Further, in order to address the terms of reference specified in clauses (a) and (b) of the section 89 of Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act (APRA), 2014, the Ministry of WR RD&GR has extended the tenure of the Tribunal for 2 years w.e.f. 01.08.2014. Subsequently, the term of the Tribunal has been extended from time-to-time on yearly basis. Recently the tenure of the Tribunal has been extended for a period of one year with effect from 01.08.2021.However, Government of Telangana vide letter dated 14.7.2014 submitted a complaint under Section 3 of the ISRWD Act, 1956 requesting Union Government to refer the same to a new Tribunal or to the existing KWDT-II regarding use, distribution, control of Krishna River Waters.Recently, during the 2nd Meeting of the Apex Council held under the Chairmanship of Hon’ble Minister for Jal Shakti on 06.10.2020, it was, inter alia, decided that “For considering the request of Telangana for a Tribunal under Section 3 of the ISRWD Act of 1956, Telangana has to withdraw the case it has filed in the Supreme Court on the subject.  After receiving such assurance, Ministry of Jal Shakti, GOI will seek legal opinion on whether a new Tribunal has to be appointed or new terms of reference can be issued to KWDT-II to hear the matter. Hon`ble CM of Telangana agreed to withdraw the case in Supreme Court.”The Government of Telangana informed that they have filed an Interlocutory Application (IA) before the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the WP(C) 545 of 2015 on 09.06.2021 to withdraw the said Writ Petition from Hon’ble Supreme Court.*****
