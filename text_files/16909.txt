In addition, regular patrolling of important cable routes is done to prevent cable thefts/cable damages.4	Monitoring of the network has also been strengthened to ensure performance as per the quality of service parameters prescribed by TRAI.5	Timely availability of store items like cable and drop-wire to field units of BSNL to maintain and improve the network.6	Rehabilitation/Upgradation of outdoor network is being done to reduce the landline faults.7	Round the clock Toll free complaint booking mechanism. A stringent monitoring procedure is being adopted for prompt and timely clearance of customers complaints through exclusive section at all level of the organization.8	BSNL has upgraded all CDOT TDM Telephone Exchanges by IP based exchanges.************
