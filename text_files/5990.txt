                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (c)The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in 2005 estimated 1.47 lakh ton of e-waste in the country. As per the United Nations University report, “The Global E-Waste Monitor 2017”, 20 lakh ton of e-waste generation was reported in 2016. Recently, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has developed a guideline on uniform inventorization of e-waste in the country. (d) and (e) The country’s economic growth, rise in per capita income and technological innovations coupled with high obsolescence rate of electronic and electrical equipmentshas resulted in increase in the rate of generation of e-waste. In order to ensure safe disposal of e-waste the Government has notified E-Waste (Management) Rules in March, 2016. The Rules aim at channelizing e-waste generated in the country towards authorized dismantlers and recyclers to prevent adverse effects of e-waste on environment. The responsibilities have also been given to all major stakeholders such as producers, manufacturers, dismantlers, recyclers, collection centers, dealers, refurbishers, consumers, bulk consumers etc. to address various aspects of e-waste handling, management and disposal. The Rules further provide for Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), authorization of dismantlers and recyclers, reduction of hazardous substances (RoHS) in manufacturing of electrical and electronic equipment, registration of Producer Responsibility Organizations (PROs), Deposit Refund Scheme, etc.The State Governments have been entrusted with the responsibility for earmarking industrial space for e-waste dismantling and recycling facilitiesand to undertake industrial skill development and establish measures for safety and health of workers engaged in these activities.The MeitY is involved in developing technology to recycle e-waste in an environmentally sound manner. MeitY has also set up a demonstration plant at Bangalore through a project titled “Environmentally Sound Methods for Recovery of Metals from Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) – Phase II”, which is being implemented by the Centre for Materials for Electronics Technology (C-MET), Hyderabad and E-Parisara, Bengaluru at a total budget outlay of Rs. 1126.80 lakhs, over a period of five years since August 2014.  A processing technology through physical separation and chemical leaching methods has been developed for recycling and reuse of electronic waste at National Metallurgical Laboratory (NML), Jamshedpur. MeitY has also established demonstration process at the Central Institute of Plastics Engineering & Technology (CIPET), Bhubaneswar- Autonomous academic institute under Department of Chemical & Petrochemicals, Government of India on converting plastics of e-waste to virgin master batch, which can be used for value added products. *****
