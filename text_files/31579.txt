ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)    The Hon’ble Members of Parliament have identified 105 Gram Panchayats (GPs) under Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana(SAGY) since inception of the scheme in October 2014 in the State of Madhya Pradesh. The district wise details of GPs adopted under SAGY in the State of Madhya Pradesh are placed in the Annexure. (b)    As per the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) Guidelines, the resource envelope for the development of Gram Panchayats may include resources from fully tied Central/State schemes such as PMAY-G, PMGSY, etc; partially tied schemes that permit flexibility of use such as Mahatma Gandhi NREGA, NRLM, etc; largely untied schemes that permit a great deal of flexibility such as Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS), purely untied resources of the Gram Panchayat such as own revenue, resources that can be mobilised locally in cash, kind and labour, and resources from private, voluntary and cooperative sectors such as Corporate Social Responsibility funds. Data on funds utilised through MPLADS and CSR for the development of villages adopted by Hon''ble Members of Parliament under SAGY in Madhya Pradesh are not maintained centrally. (c) & (d) Under the SAGY framework, the development of Gram Panchayats has been envisaged through the convergence and implementation of existing Government Schemes and Programmes under the administrative control of respective Ministries. Under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is implementing a flagship scheme called Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) with an objective to provide skilling to 1 crore prospective youth under Short Term Training (STT) courses and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) across the country including youth from SAGY Gram Panchayats in Madhya Pradesh. Ministry of Rural Development is implementing two welfare programmes for poverty alleviation and for the rural poor youth under the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) – Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), placement linked skill development program for wage employment and Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs) that enable trainees to take Bank Credit for starting Micro-enterprises. Both the Schemes are being implemented all over the country including SAGY Gram Panchayats in Madhya Pradesh. Further, this Ministry vide its notification dated 2nd January 2015 has issued instructions that all State Rural Livelihood Missions (SRLMs) and Project Implementing Agencies (PIAs) shall give priority in obilization of candidates from Gram Panchayats identified under SAGY in the districts allotted in the sanctioned projects. *****
