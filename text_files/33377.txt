Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), Jan Sikhshan Sansthan (JSS), National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) and Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), to youths across the country. There is no state-wise fund allocation under CSCM component of PMKVY, JSS, NAPS and ITIs.  However, funds are allocated/released to States under CSSM component of PMKVY.
