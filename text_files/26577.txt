As per the provisions of the Act, survey is being done from time to time for verification of beneficiaries and Social Audit is conducted twice a year (on 26th January and 15th August) for monitoring and review of implementation of the National Food Security Act and to assess that the benefits envisaged under the Act are reaching the needy people.(d):  	Yes Sir.(e): 	State Government of Rajasthan is taking necessary steps to ensure rightful targeting of beneficiaries to be covered under the National Food Security Act.
