(b): 	To provide access to justice to the citizen at their door steps and bring about reduction in case pendency, the Central Government has enacted the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008.  It provides for establishment of Gram Nyayalayas at intermediate panchayat level.  The State Governments are responsible for establishing Gram Nyayalayas in consultation with the respective High Courts.  As per information made available by State Governments / High Courts, 395 Gram Nyayalayas have been notified so far by 12 States, of which 225 are operational at present. Civil and criminal cases pending before District / Session Courts or Courts subordinate to it falling within the jurisdiction of the Gram Nyayalayas can be transferred to Gram Nyayalayas.(c)&(d): The issues affecting operationalization of the Gram Nyayalayas were discussed in the Conference of Chief Justices of High Courts and Chief Ministers of the States on 7th April, 2013.  It was decided in the Conference that the State Governments and High Courts should decide the question of establishment of Gram Nyayalayas wherever feasible, taking into account the local issues and situation. The Central Government has been encouraging the States to set up Gram Nyayalayas by providing financial assistance.  As per the scheme for assistance to State Governments for establishing and operating Gram Nyayalayas, the Central Government provides one-time assistance to States towards non-recurring expenses for setting up of Gram Nyayalayas subject to a ceiling of Rs. 18.00 lakhs per Gram Nyayalaya.  The Central Government also provides assistance towards recurring expenses for operating these Gram Nyayalayas subject to a ceiling of Rs. 3.20 lakhs per Gram Nyayalaya per year for the first three years. The Central Government has requested the Chief Ministers of States and Chief Justices of High Courts for setting up of Gram Nyayalayas in the respective States.  Recently, the Registrars General of High Courts and Law / Home / Finance Secretaries of State Governments were requested through video conferences held in January 2018, July 2018, November, 2018, 24th September – 3rd October, 2019 and 18th May – 22nd May, 2020 to set up Gram Nyayalayas and seek financial assistance for operationalising them under the Scheme mentioned above.***Annexure - IDetails of Pending Cases in the High Courts  Sl.
