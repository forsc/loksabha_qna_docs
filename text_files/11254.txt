ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	The salient features of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) are annexed.(b):	Yes Sir.  Penetration under the PMFBY has been increased from 23% of Gross Cropped Area (GCA) under erstwhile schemes during 2015-16 to over 30% of GCA under PMFBY.(c):	As per provisions of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) admissible claims are generally paid by the insurance companies within two months of completion of Crop Cutting Experiments/harvesting period subject to availability of yield data and total State share of premium subsidy from concerned State Government within time. To bring down the claim settlement time, many steps in addition to regularly monitoring the implementation of PMFBY, has been taken by the Government.    These steps include use of improved technology, revision of Operational Guidelines wherein provision has been made for timely release of State Govt. share in 3 instalments and settlement of claims by insurance companies without waiting for final/3rd installment by the States and advancement of 15 days in seasonality discipline for early settlement of claims. Penalty provisions for late settlement of claims by insurance companies and late release of funds by State Governments have also been stipulated under these guidelines.(d):	PMFBY provides for use of technology for better implementation of the scheme. Accordingly, National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP) has been developed for ensuring better administration, co-ordination, transparency, dissemination of information and delivery of services including uploading/obtaining details of individual insured farmers for better monitoring and to ensure transfer of claim amount electronically to the individual farmer’s Bank Account.  To ensure timely payment of claims, scheme envisages mandatory use of smartphone/CCE-Agri App for real time transfer of data on national crop insurance portal. Farmers’app has also been launched, on which farmers can track their crop insurance and get all information about it. Further, the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, through Mahalanobis National Crop Forecast Centre (MNCFC) had carried out pilot studies for Smart Sampling Technique/Optimization of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) in various States involving  8 agencies/ organizations during Kharif 2018 and Rabi 2018-19 under PMFBY.   The review of these pilot studies was carried out by High Level Committee constituted for the purpose.  Accordingly, based on these results and the technologies which were verified during the Pilot studies, the Government rolled out Smart Sampling Technique (CCE location selection using satellite data) and optimization of CCEs, in 96 districts of 9 States, for rice crop, during Kharif, 2019. Around 1 lakh CCEs for Rice crop are conducted, during Kharif 2019, using Smart Sampling Technique.Pilot studies have been undertaken for estimation of yield at Gram Panchayat level, during Kharif 2019, through 12 agencies, by use of technology (Satellite data, UAV, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, etc.).   As soon as statistically sound methodology for yield estimaton through technology is established for the crop, the same may be adopted.
