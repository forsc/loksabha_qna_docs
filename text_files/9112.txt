                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) & (b): A Statement showing the Sanctioned Strength, Working Strength and Vacancies of Judges in the various High Courts of the country is at Annexure.(c) & (d): The disposal and pending of cases in Allahabad High Court  comes within the domain of judiciary.

Allahabad	9,16,046	Not available	7,24,7267,31249           However, the Union Government is committed to speedy disposal of cases and reduction in pendency of cases to improve access to justice in line with the mandate under Article 39A of the Constitution. The National Mission for Justice Delivery and Legal Reforms, established by the Union Government in 2011, has adopted many strategic initiatives, including improving infrastructure [court halls and residential units] for Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Courts, leveraging Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for better justice delivery, filling up of vacant positions of Judges in High Courts, reduction in pendency through follow up by Arrears Committees at District and High Court emphasis on Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) and initiatives to fast track special type of cases.(e) & (f): Proposals for appointment of 13 Advocates and 19 Judicial Officers are under various stages of process as per the procedure prescribed in the Memorandum of Procedure.
