(b) & (c):	No, Sir.  Land was not given on lease to the British Government.  (d):	There is no official demarcation of tea garden areas for free roaming of wild elephants.  However, wild life migrate or stay for a short duration in some tea garden areas adjoining the Protected Areas and Forests of Assam.(e) & (f):	Gradual expansion of tea plantation in Assam during the British period led to acute shortage of labourers in the new plantations.  Accordingly, the British Government facilitated the migration of labourers from what is present day West Bengal, Bihar, UP, Madhya Pradesh, Odhisa etc.   The Plantation Labour Act enacted in 1951 and rules made thereunder through Assam Plantation Labour Rules, 1956 assure medical facilities, drinking water, canteens, crèches, education facilities, housing, conservancy, recreation facilities, other facilities (umbrella, blankets, raincoats etc.) to the tea garden workers in Assam. **********
