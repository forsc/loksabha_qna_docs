                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ?? ????? ?????? ??????		                      (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	Yes, Sir.(b)	Sixty three (63) State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), Three (3) Central Agricultural Universities (CAUs), Four (4) ICAR-Deemed Universities and Four (4) Central Universities with Agriculture Faculty produce thousands of Post-Graduates and Ph.D. holders every year.  University-wise and year-wise details of the Post- Graduates and Ph.D. holders produced in the last three years are given at Annexure-I.  (c) to (e):	The recruitment of scientists is a continuous process as vacancies arise continuously due to retirements, resignations, selection to higher positions within ICAR, deputation, death etc.  The recruitment to all scientific posts in ICAR is done by the Agricultural Scientists Recruitment Board (ASRB) following a prescribed procedure, on the basis of specialized qualification prescribed for a particular scientific post, subject to availability of appropriately qualified candidates in the required areas of specialization.    	All Scientific posts in ICAR are filled through ASRB.  Since the delinking of ASRB from ICAR was in process, the vacancies could not be filled.  Now as  the ASRB has been restructured with the approval of Government of India, necessary steps for filling up of the vacancies have already been initiated by the ASRB.  *******
