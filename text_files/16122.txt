ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TOURISM (INDEPENDENT CHARGE)(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) to (d):	The Ministry of Tourism, Government of India has launched the “Adopt a Heritage: Apni Dharohar, Apni Pehchaan” project which is a collaborative effort by the Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Culture, Archaeological Survey of India and State/ UTs Government for developing tourism amenities at heritage/natural/tourist sites spread across India for making them tourist friendly, in a planned and phased manner. The project aims to encourage companies from public sector, private sector, trusts, NGOs, individuals and other stakeholders to become ‘Monument Mitras’ and take up the responsibility of developing and upgrading the basic and advanced tourist amenities at these sites as per their interest and viability in terms of a sustainable investment model under CSR. They would also look after the Operation & Maintenance of the same. Under the project, 27 Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs) have been awarded to 12 Monument Mitras for twenty-five (25) sites and two (2) Technological interventions across India (List at Annexure). Implementation of amenities agreed to under the MoUs has already commenced at several sites and Operation and Maintenance activities are also ongoing for these sites. (e):	MGNREGA, 2005 is an act which aims at enhancing the livelihood security of poor households in rural areas of the country by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment to every poor household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. The ACT is funded by the Central/State Government under National/ State Employment Guarantee fund, whereas Adopt a Heritage is a project which focuses on developing tourism amenities at heritage/ natural/ tourist sites. The Adopt a Heritage project provides the platform for active contribution from public sector, private sector, companies, trusts, NGOs, individuals in which the Central or State Government has no role in funding. The MGNREGA ACT, therefore, cannot be merged with the Adopt a Heritage project.*******
