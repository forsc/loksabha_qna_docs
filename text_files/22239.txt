ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)The Ministry of Rural Development is implementing a scheme namely Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) through the States and UTs for development of model villages. Under the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana framework, the development of Gram Panchayats is envisaged through convergence and implementation of existing Government Schemes and Programmes under the administrative control of respective Ministries without allocating additional funds.The Gram Panchayats adopted under SAGY prepare Village Development Plans (VDP) through a participatory process under the guidance of Hon’ble Members of Parliament. The VDP includes prioritised time-bound activities to achieve holistic and integrated development of the villages. SAGY aims at instilling certain values in the villages and their people so that they get transformed into models for others. These models of local level development and effective local governance motivate and inspire neighbouring Gram Panchayats to learn and adapt. The Hon’ble Members of Parliament have adopted 2,046 Gram Panchayats under Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) till 11 March, 2021.The State/UT-wise details of Gram Panchayats adopted under Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY)   is given in Annexure-I. Till date, 48,988 projects have been completed out of 77,457 projects planned under VDPs as per information uploaded on SAGY portal (http://saanjhi.gov.in). The progress of implementation of the Village Development Plans (VDP) in the SAGY Gram Panchayats is given at Annexure-II. *******
