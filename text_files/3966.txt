MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a):	The existing policy for opening of offices in place is based on the norms prescribed by National Productivity Council which was approved by the Executive Committee of the Central Board of Trustees (CBT), Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) in the year 1999. The norms for deciding the opening of offices are further based on statistical data of workload, in terms of establishments and subscribers, enforcement parameters i.e. coverage of establishments, defaulters and prosecution cases pending and lastly service parameters i.e., the workload of claims and claims settlements.  Contd..2/-:: 2 ::(b):	No new office has been opened in Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) in the last three years.
