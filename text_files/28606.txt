(DAMEPL) vs. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and C.A. No. 5628 of 2021 titled Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) vs. Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd. (DAMEPL) wherein the Hon’ble Court has upheld the Arbitration award dated 11/05/2017 passed in the matter of Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation.
