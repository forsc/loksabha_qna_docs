ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE(DR BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)a) to d) Omicron variant is the dominant variant in the country presently. The total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported the country during the months of December 2021 and January 2022 is as given at Annexure. According to World Health Organization, Omicron variant has a significantly increased transmissibility as compared to the Delta variant, and as a result, it is rapidly replacing the latter globally. As per the available evidence, vaccines help in terms of lesser people getting infected, lesser hospitalization and lesser severity of disease amongst the patients.Government of India is supporting States in their endeavor to manage COVID-19 since the beginning of pandemic. Given the emergence of mutated variants with variable impact on transmissibility, virulence and effectiveness of vaccines, likelihood of resurgence of COVID-19 trajectory in the country is monitored by various expert committees under Indian Council of Medical Research, Directorate General of Health Services and other relevant Ministries/Departments. Union Ministry of Health & FW continues to keep a close watch over COVID-19 situation across the country and globally.With the reporting of Omicron Variant and its classification as a Variant of Concern by the World Health Organization, the Union Ministry of Health & FW revised its Guidelines for international arrivals. Following a risk based approach; provisions for mandatory pre-departure & post arrival RT-PCR testing on day 8th of arrival and a mandatory home quarantine for 7 days have been made in the present guidelines for all international travelers to India. Union Ministry of Health & FW is accordingly coordinating and collaborating with other stakeholder Ministries/departments including Ministry of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, Ministry of Railways and all States/UTs etc. Besides regular review meetings at the level of Union Health Minister with all relevant stakeholders including subject experts, review meetings with States/UTs through video conferencing have been conducted under Union Health Minister and senior officials of Health Ministry to review preparedness and response measures for COVID-19 pandemic. States/UTs have been repeatedly urged to undertake the following activities:•	Strict monitoring of International travelers in the community. •	Contact tracing of positive individuals & follow up for 14 days.•	Genome sequencing of positive samples through INSACOG Labs in a prompt manner.•	Continued monitoring of areas where cluster of positive cases emerges.•	Further strengthening of COVID-19 testing infrastructure and ensuring early identification of cases through adequate testing across the States.•	Ensuring preparedness of health infrastructure (availability of ICU, oxygen supported beds, ventilators, etc.) and upgrading health infrastructure under ECRP-II including in rural areas and for pediatric cases. •	Commissioning all PSA plants, ensuring sufficient logistics, drugs etc.•	Ensuring COVID-19 vaccination for the eligible population including coverage among young adolescents (15-18 years) and precaution dose for health care workers, frontline workers and elderly with comorbidities.•	Ensuring adherence to COVID Appropriate Behaviour.Ministry of Health & FW vide letter dated 28th June 2021 has circulated to all States/UTs guiding principles for imposition of restrictions or allowing relaxation in context of COVID-19 based on COVID-19 testing confirmation rates and hospital bed occupancy rates. This has been reiterated by Ministry of Home Affairs under Disaster Management Act, 2005 vide order dated 29th June 2021. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) is a national multi-agency consortium of Genome Sequencing Laboratories (RGSLs) of Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Dept. of Biotechnology, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), established by the Government of India for whole genome sequencing in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. 52 labs are presently functional.Ministry of Health & Family Welfare continues to provide technical guidance for managing various aspects of COVID-19. To disseminate various clinical guidelines for appropriate management of cases, a series of webinars were held under MoHFW''s Center of Excellence initiative for all State Level Centers of Excellence and district level public and private COVID health facilities in collaboration with AIIMS, Delhi and Indian Medical Association.Union Ministry of Health & FW continues to provide support to States/UTs to enhance preparedness and response capacities against COVID-19 and other public health emergencies. Funding support is also provided to States/UTs through National Health Mission, State Disaster Response Funds (SDRF) and Emergency COVID-19 Response and Preparedness packages. Under ECRP Phase II, a package of Rs. 23,123 crores (with Rs. 15,000 Cr as Central Component) has been approved to upgrade health infrastructure including maintaining buffer stock of essential drugs. Of this, as on 31st January 2022, funds to the tune of Rs. 7245.95 crore have been released to States/UTs as part of Central component to strengthen health infrastructure to manage any surge in cases.
