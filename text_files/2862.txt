ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a)  to (f):  The quantum loss of crops destroyed by stray and wild animals are managed by concerned State/Union Territories.  Moreover, the Ministry has not received any information from the States regarding quantum of loss of destroyed crops.  The amount of compensation paid to the farmers and details of losses as a result of destroyed crop by stray and wilds animals are not collated by the Ministry. Contd…2/--2-             The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change provides the financial assistance to States under Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats, Project Tiger and Project Elephant for management of wildlife and its habitats in the country.  The activities supported under the schemes inter alia include construction/ erection of physical barriers, such as solar powered electric fence including others like barbed wire fence, bio-fencing using cactus boundary walls, etc. to prevent the entry of wild animals into crop fields.                In order to check the losses of crops by stray and  wild animals, Ministry of Environment, Forests  and Climate Change is taking following steps:•	The Ministry has approved a project for undertaking ‘Immuno-contraceptive measures’ for controlling the population of wild animals responsible for damage and destruction of crops. •	A network of protected areas namely, National Park, Sanctuaries, Conservation Reserves and Community Reserves covering important wildlife habitat have been created all over the country under the provision of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 to conserve wild animals and their habitats.•	To mitigate wildlife conflict along the linear infrastructure like rail tracks, roads/highways and power transmission lines passing through the protected areas and other wildlife rich areas, Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife has recommended that all linear infrastructure development agencies shall submit wild animals passage plan based on the Wll Guideline “Eco- Friendly Measures to Mitigate Impacts of linear infrastructure on Wildlife”.  These guidelines suggest for modification in the design of the linear infrastructure by way of providing eco-friendly structure will ensure safe movement of wildlife across these linear infrastructures.        In the revised operational guidelines of the “Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) from Rabi 2018-19, States have been given liberty to consider providing add–on coverage for crop loss due to attack by wild animals wherever the risk is perceived to be substantial and identifiable.*********
