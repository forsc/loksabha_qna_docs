                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) & (b)	BharatNet project is being implemented in a phased manner to provide broadband connectivity to all the Gram Panchayats (approx. 2,50,000) in the country. In December 2017, the phase-I of the BharatNet project was completed by connecting one lakh Gram Panchayats (GPs). A modified strategy to implement BharatNet has been approved by Cabinet on 19.07.2017, which provides an optimal mix of media to connect GPs, implementation by State-led Model, Private Sector, and Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) Model; laying of fresh fibre from Block to GPs and setting up of last mile architecture at all GPs. As on 04.07.2019, a total of 1,21,416 GPs (including Block Headquarters) have been made Service Ready. The State-wise status of BharatNet is attached at Annexure-I.The delay in the initial implementation of the project was on account of:(i)	Delay in the initial commencement of project as the work on the project began in the second half of 2014 due to field survey of GPs and pilot testing of the technology model.(ii)	Only one media that is underground Optical Fibre Cable (OFC) to cover GPs, and Right of Way (RoW) issues. Since May 2016, with the constitution of the following committees, the issues are being resolved timely:i)	Empowered Committee under Secretary, Department of Telecommunications (DoT)ii)	Steering Committee under Administrator, Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF).iii)	State Committee under Chief General Manager (CGM), Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) for resolution of State level issues. (c)	As per the information provided by the Vigilance Wing of Department of Telecommunications (DoT), and Bharat Broadband Network Limited (BBNL), the details are given in Annexure-II.
