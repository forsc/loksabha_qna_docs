ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	As per the second Long Range forecast released by IMD rainfall during the monsoon 2019 over the country as a whole is likely to be normal. Proper distribution of rainfall is more important for normal crop production. It is too early to determine the drought like situation in any areas from agriculture point of view. Further, till date no State Government has submitted any Memorandum seeking financial assistance from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) during Kharif, 2019 season. However, Government has prepared contingency plans to cope with any adverse rainfall situation.(c) to (e):	The first official estimates of production of Kharif crops are normally released in the month of September. Therefore, it is too early to assess the production of Kharif crops for the current season.********
