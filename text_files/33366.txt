ANSWER




                                                        (a) and (b)	Under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is implementing a flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) to impart short duration skill development training to youth of the country. PMKVY has two training components, namely, Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). RPL enables individuals to obtain skill certification. Individuals with prior learning experience or skills can register themselves and get assessed and certified. RPL mainly focuses on the individuals engaged in unregulated / informal sectors. The state-wise details of candidates enrolled, oriented and certified under RPL in the last two years (i.e., 2019-21) till 31.12.2021, is given at Annexure I (c)        Under PMKVY, Short Term Training (STT) is linked to placement, while Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) does not mandate placements as it recognizes the existing skills of candidate. Under PMKVY-STT till 31.12.2021, 16.36 lakh candidates have been certified in the last two years (i.e., 2019-21); out of which, 8.25 lakh candidates have been provided with the placement. The State-wise details are given at Annexure II (d)       PMKVY-RPL is not linked with placements as it recognizes the existing skills of candidate. (e)       The RPL component of PMKVY has been implemented across the country covering all States/UTs except Lakshadweep. Presently, there are 37 Sector Skill Councils and PMKVY-RPL has been implemented in all 37 sectors.
