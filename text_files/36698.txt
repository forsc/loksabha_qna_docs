ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) The National Perspective Plan (NPP), prepared in year 1980, envisages inter basin transfer of water from water surplus river basins, where there is flooding, to water deficit basins, where there is drought / scarcity of water. After carrying out the studies, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified surplus and deficit river basins for proposal of link canals for transfer of water. 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component & 14 under Himalayan Component) have been identified for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). NPP envisages no inter-State link in the State of Chhattisgarh. (b) to (d) The ILR programme has been accorded priority by the Government and it is being pursued based on the principle of consensus and agreement among the concerned States. Consultation with the States and review of the progress of ILR projects are being carried out at various platforms. On the direction of Hon’ble Supreme Court, a Committee known as “Special Committee on Interlinking of Rivers” was constituted in September, 2014 for the implementation of ILR programmes. Nineteen meetings of this Special Committee have been held so far. Further, a Task Force for Interlinking of Rivers has been constituted in April, 2015 and fifteen meetings of the Task Force have been held so far. Efforts have been made for building consensus among the concerned States on water sharing, etc, as the implementation of the ILR projects depend mainly on consensus among the concerned States.   Under the NPP, four priority links have been identified for preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) under the Peninsular Rivers Component viz; Ken-Betwa Link Project (KBLP), Damanganga-Pinjal link project, Par-Tapi-Narmada link project and Godavari-Cauvery link project. The DPRs of KBLP, Damanganga-Pinjal link project, Par-Tapi-Narmada link project and Godavari-Cauvery link project {consisting of three links viz; Godavari (Inchampalli/Janampet) – Krishna (Nagarjunasagar), Krishna (Nagarjunasagar) – Pennar (Somasila), Pennar (Somasila)-Cauvery (Grand Anicut) link projects} have been completed and sent to the concerned States. The DPR of Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundaar link project was also completed and sent to party States.Ken-Betwa Link Project is the first Inter-linking project under NPP, which is under implementation. A tripartite agreement was signed among the States of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh and Central Government for implementation of Ken-Betwa Link Project on 22.03.2021. The project has been approved for implementation by the Government of India with an estimated cost of Rs. 44,605 crore (at year 2020-21 price level) and central support of Rs. 39,317 crore, through a Special Purpose Vehicle.***
