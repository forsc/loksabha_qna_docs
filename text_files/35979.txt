In the current financial year 2021-22, the budget provision at Budget Estimate (BE) stage was Rs. 73,000 crore.  The Ministry had requested for additional budget allocation which has been enhanced to Rs. 98,000 crore at the Revised Estimate (RE) stage as per the requirement of funds. The Ministry seeks additional funds under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS from Ministry of Finance as and when required for meeting the demand for work on the ground.
