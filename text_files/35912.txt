ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (e) :	The Fourteenth Finance Commission (FFC) has not made any distinction between General Category States and Special Category States in the horizontal distribution of shareable taxes amongst the States. As per the recommendations of the FFC, the Union Government has decided to increase the share of net shareable taxes to the States from 32% earlier to 42% for the period 2015-20. The same has also been retained by the Fifteenth Finance Commission at 41% (1% adjusted on account of creation of UT of J&K) for the period (2020-21 & 2021-26). The objective has been to fill the resource gap of each State to the extent possible through tax devolution. Also, Post-Devolution Revenue Deficit Grants have been provided to States where devolution alone could not cover the assessed gap. A large number of provisions of Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation (APR) Act, 2014 have been implemented and the remaining provisions of the APR Act, 2014 are under implementation. The infrastructure projects and Educational Institutions mentioned in the Schedule XIII of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 are at various stages of implementation. The provisions relating to setting up of infrastructural projects and educational institutions have long gestation period for which a time period of ten years has been prescribed in the Act.****
