ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	to (d)	In order to ensure environmentally sound management of solid waste in the country, the Ministry, in supersession of Municipal Solid Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000, has notified Solid Waste Management (SWM) Rules, 2016. The Rules prescribe that no waste generator shall throw, burn or bury solid waste, on the streets, in open public spaces outside his premises or in the drain or in the water bodies.The Rules, inter alia, prescribe the waste generators to segregatewaste at source and hand over the segregated waste to authorized waste pickers or waste collectors.The Rules provide for scientific methods of segregation, collection, transport, processing, material recovery and disposal of such waste. The local bodies in the State/UTs are responsible for setting up of  material recovery facilities with sufficient space for sorting of recyclable materials; collect waste from vegetable, fruit,flower, meat, poultry and fish market and promote setting up of decentralized compost plant or bio-methanation plant at suitable locations; facilitate construction, operation and maintenance of solid waste processing facilities and associated infrastructure including the following:i.	bio-methanation, microbial composting, vermi-composting, anaerobic digestion or any other appropriate processing for bio-stabilization of biodegradable wastes;ii.	waste to energy processes including refused derived fuel for combustible fraction of waste or supply as feedstock to solid waste based power plants or cement kilns;The Rules stipulate specific criteria to encourage the use of solid waste in the waste to energy plants such that i.	non recyclable waste having calorific value of 1500 K/cal/kg or more shall not be disposed of on landfills and shall only be utilised for generating energy, ii.	High calorific wastes shall be used for co-processing in cement or thermal power plants.Plastic waste forms a part of solid waste. Therefore, for management of plastic waste, key technologies prescribed are (i) Utilization of plastic waste in road construction, (ii) Co-processing of plastic waste in cement kilns, (iii) Conversion of plastic waste into liquid RDF (Oil) and (iv) Disposal of plastic waste through Plasma Pyrolysis Technology (PPT).Above provisions in the Rules are aimed to ensure scientific processing of waste in the country. Regarding the existing landfill sites, the Rules specify the criteria for closure and rehabilitation of old dumps sites. The solid waste dumps which have reached their full capacity have to be closed and rehabilitated by reducing the waste by bio mining and waste processing followed by placement of residues in new landfills or capping. The local bodies in association with the state urban development departments have been mandated to ensure compliance of the provisions of the SWM Rules 2016. *****
