ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c)   Yes, Sir. Under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) 2.0, around 1.07 crore candidates have been trained / oriented across the country as on 19.01.2021.(d)       Under PMKVY 2.0, placement opportunities are being provided to candidates certified under Short Term Training (STT). Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) does not mandate placement as it orients and certifies candidates with prior learning experience or skills. As on 19.01.2021, 46.27 lakh and 36.04 lakh candidates have been respectively trained and certified under STT. Out of these certified candidates, 18.95 lakh candidates have been provided with placement.(e)       NITI Aayog has done a quick assessment study of the PMKVY 2.0. The report of NITI Aayog highlighted a mismatch between industry requirement and candidate expectation.  In addition, National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), an implementing agency of PMKVY, has also engaged a third-party agency, Sambodhi Research and Communications Pvt. Ltd., for the impact evaluation of PMKVY 2.0. This report highlighted about 15% increase in average monthly salary under STT and 19% under RPL. Under RPL, 70% participants reported for better chance of finding employment. This report also suggested for stronger role of State Skill Development Missions (SSDMs) for better implementation of scheme.         Based on the above said studies and learning from the implementation of PMKVY 2.0, Ministry has launched a modified version of PMKVY, i.e., PMKVY 3.0 on 15.01.2021 with a demand-driven and bottom-up approach.(f) and (g)  The study on PMKVY2.0 was conducted at the national level and aggregated data was considered for findings. However,  district-wise training data with respect to number of candidates trained, certified and placed under STT, and candidates oriented and certified under RPL of PMKVY 2.0 in State of Tamil Nadu as on 19.01.2021 is given at Annexure.Annexure District-wise number of candidates trained, certified and placed under STT, and candidates oriented and certified under RPL of PMKVY 2.0 in State of Tamil Nadu, as on 19.01.2021 S.
