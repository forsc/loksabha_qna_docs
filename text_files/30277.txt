                                                        THE MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a) to (d)      A statement is laid on the Table of the House.  STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (d) OF STARRED QUESTION NO.*161 TO BE ANSWERED ON 09.12.2021 REGARDING “INTER-LINKING OF RIVERS” RAISED BY DR. HEENA GAVIT AND DR. SHRIKANT EKNATH SHINDE. (a)   The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in 1980 for development of water resources through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component & 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports. The details of above river linking projects are given at Annexure-I. The ILR programme is pursued by Government of India in a consultative manner through consensus building amongst the party States.(b)   Under the World Bank assisted Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP), Phase-I, which was implemented during April 2012 to March 2021, new technologies and innovations were utilized for dam rehabilitation and repairs. Details of the same are given at Annexure-II.  Apart from structural measures to improve hydrologic safety, hydro-mechanical measures, seepage reduction, structural stability etc., non structural measures such as dam break analyses, emergency action plans, O&M manuals, were put in place for the selected dams. In addition, DHARMA (Dam Health and Rehabilitation Monitoring), a system to monitor the health of dams, has been developed. A seismic hazard analysis information system (SHAISYS) has also been developed. This project has also laid emphasis on the dam safety institutional strengthening as per details given at Annexure-III.  (c)   The “Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch The Rain” campaign was launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister, mainly to conserve rain water, with active participation of the people in all districts (rural as well as urban areas) in the country, during the pre-monsoon and monsoon period, ie from 22.03.2021 to 30.11.2021.  The main theme of the campaign is "Catch the rain, where it falls, when it falls”. In order to build adequate awareness about the campaign, Ministry of Jal Shakti in collaboration with Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan (NYKS), had started “Catch The Rain: Awareness generation campaign”, which was launched on 21 December, 2020.  NYKS has implemented the awareness generation campaign in 623 districts of the country. Capacity building trainings were organised for over 700 officials of NYKS and volunteers at the district levels, in January 2021. The activities of NYKS have resulted in the participation of over 2.50 crore people, including District Magistrates, Municipal Commissioners, public representatives, Hon’ble MPs, etc. In all about 18.88 lakh activities like talks, oath taking programmes, rallies, quizzes, debate competitions, writing of slogans, posters, banners, wall writings, nukkad-nataks, community work etc have been organized. These activities covered all districts in the country, including Kolhapur, Sangli, Ahmednagar, Thane, Jalgaon and Nandurbar districts of Maharashtra. All the State Governments, including State Government of Maharashtra, have been requested to set up ‘Jal Shakti Kendras’ in every district headquarters as a part of the campaign. ‘Jal Shakti Kendras’ (JSK) are to act as “knowledge centers” for disseminating information related to water conservation techniques and will provide technical guidance to people.  276 Jal Shakti Kendras have been set up in various States/UTs so far including the districts of Kolhapur, Sangli, Ahmednagar, Thane, Jalgaon and Nadurbar districts of Maharashtra.   (d)      Government of India in partnership with States, is implementing "Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) – Har Ghar Jal” which aims at providing potable water in adequate quantity and of prescribed quality on regular and long-term basis to every rural household, through tap water connection, by 2024. This scheme has an estimated outlay of Rs.3.60 lakh crore. At the time of announcement of JJM, out of total 18.93 crore rural households, 3.23 crore rural households (17.07%) of the country had tap water connections. Since then, over 5.38 crore (28%) families living in rural areas have been provided with tap water connections in their homes and as on 06.12.2021, about 8.62 crore (48.84%) households are having tap water connections.  ***** ANNEXURE-I ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) OF STARRED QUESTION NO.*161 TO BE ANSWERED ON 09.12.2021 REGARDING “INTER-LINKING OF RIVERS”.
