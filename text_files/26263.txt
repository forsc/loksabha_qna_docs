ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF TEXTILES  (SMT. DARSHANA JARDOSH)(a) to (f):	Yes, Sir.   Due to Covid-19 pandemic and nationwide lockdown imposed by the various State Governments, the production activities in all National Textile Corporation (NTC) Limited mill units including Minerva mill unit were put on hold since 25.03.2020.  During this period, the employees were paid salary regularly as per their status by NTC out of its cash reserve.  After lifting up of the lockdown and as per availability of raw material, NTC restored operation of 14 mill units from January 2021 onwards. The second wave of Covid-19 pandemic again led to closure of all NTC mill operations in April, 2021.  Now NTC has restored operations in some of its mills in July, 2021 as per raw material availability.***
