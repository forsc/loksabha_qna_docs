                                                        (a) & (b):	Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is implementing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) [PMAY(U)] since 25.06.2015 for providing assistance to States/UTs for addressing the housing requirement in urban areas including subsumed projects of Rajiv Awas  Yojana (RAY) and also  monitoring  the  left-over  work under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), which has since ended on 31.03.2017.A total 11,18,360 houses have been completed under JNNURM; out of which 1,09,091 houses are yet to be occupied. Land and colonization are State subjects. Construction of houses and their allotment comes under the purview of the State/UT Government concerned. Non-occupancy under JNNURM could be due to various factors like lack of basic infrastructure/transportation facility, livelihood issues, non-receipt of beneficiary contribution, litigation issues etc.A total 4,79,503 houses have been completed/delivered under In-situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) and Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP) verticals of the PMAY(U); out of which 3,83,736 houses are at various stages of allotment/occupancy.(c):   MoHUA through Central Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee (CSMC) meetings and other review meetings, inter-alia, reviews the matter of non-occupancy of houses at regular intervals. State/UT Governments have been advised to ensure allotment and occupancy of completed houses under JNNURM to the beneficiaries by the end of December 2019. States/UTs have been advised that in cases where original beneficiaries are not available the unoccupied houses may be allotted afresh to the eligible beneficiaries under PMAY(U). Further, States/UTs have also been requested to facilitate suitable bank linkage for the beneficiaries who are not able to pay the beneficiary share.                             *****
