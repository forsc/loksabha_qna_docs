ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a)  to (e): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 5214 BY KUMARI SHOBHA KARANDLAJE TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 24.07.2019  REGARDING  DOUBLING OF TRACKS(a) to (d): Birur-Shimoga doubling project was included in the budget    2016-17 subject to requisite Government approvals. Detailed Project Report (DPR) of the project has been prepared vide which it was found that present capacity utilization of existing single line is only 53% and there is no likelyhood of increase in anticipated originating loading.  In fact, a reduction in number of rakes dealt at Steel Plant at Bhadravathi is anticipated.  As such, this project is not found operationally desirable and financially viable.  Therefore, Government of Karnataka has been requested in March  2017 for their consent to provide land free of cost and share 50% construction cost of the project as is being done for some other projects in the state. However, State Government’s consent to provide land free of cost and share 50% construction cost of above project is not received so far due to which taking forward this project for requisite Government approvals is held up. 36.04 Km on Arsikere-Tumkur(96 Km), 137.05Km on Hospet-Hubli-Vasco-da-Gama (300.6 Km) and 37 Km on Hubli-Chikjajur (190 Km) doubling projects have been commissioned and works have been taken up in balance sections of these doubling projects.The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, encountering unforeseen conditions like flooding, excessive rains, cyclones, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions of working agencies/contractors etc. All these factors affect the completion time and cost  of the project, which is finally worked out at the completion stage. In the overall interest of the Nation and to ensure that projects are completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, Divisional level, Zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues that are obstructing the progress of projects.To ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects.        For important projects, capacity enhancement projects, last mile connectivity etc. institutional financing has been done by arranging loan of  ` 1.5 lakh crore, which has increased Railways’  capacity for committed fund provision for essential projects.(e): The details of all works in progress and new works including cost, funds spent on each project, allotment of funds and expenditure made are available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in >Ministry of Railways >Railway Board >About Indian Railways >Railway Board Directorates >Finance(Budget) >Railway-wise Works Machinery & Rolling Stock Programme_Regular Budget 2019-20 or 2018-19 or 2017-18 or 2016-17.*****
