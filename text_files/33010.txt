                                                        (a)	      Yes Sir, with the approval of the then Ministry of Shipping an MoU was signed on 15.03.2017 between Chennai Port Trust and Puducherry Port as feeder port to Chennai Port. A trial run was carried out on 25.02.2018 between Chennai Port and Puducherry Port by a special Container Vessel. It was observed that there were few areas in the Channel and mouth of the Puducherry Port where the draft was less and capital dredging has to be carried out to sustain the operation. In order to mitigate the siltation problem, Tender for capital dredging to a tune of 7,30,000 cubic meters at Puducherry Port was invited by Port Department, Government of Puducherry and the work order issued. It was ascertained from Puducherry Port Authorities that 45-50 % of the dredging has been completed as on 27 01.2022.(b)	       Government of Puducherry had forwarded the proposal for development of Puducherry Port for financial assistance under Sagarmala from the Government of India. As per DPR, details of the three Phases are as follows: Phase-I- Capital Dredging and Container Berth- Rs. 75.00 Cr.Phase-II- Approach Jetty, Main Jetty and ancilliary facilities- Rs. 59.60 Cr Phase-III-Extension of Container Berth, approach road and bridges -    Rs.170.20 Cr. After obtaining mandatory EC and  CRZ clearances from  MoEF & CC, an          e -tender was floated in July 2020 and work has been awarded. An amount of Rs.44.00 Crores has been sanctioned by the Government of India under "Sagarmala Scheme" on 30.03.2018 to take up the dredging work at Puducherry Port.                                     *****
