MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)	Information available with the Ministry on attacks on Indians living abroad is placed at Annexure.(c) & (d) 	Whenever any instance of an attack on Indian nationals comes to notice, our Mission/Post promptly takes up the matter with that country’s Foreign Ministry and other concerned authorities to take appropriate measures for the safety and security of Indian nationals. When approached, host Governments normally provide necessary assistance and security to Indian nationals living in that country. Missions / Posts also provide follow-up action, including provision of consular assistance to the affected Indian nationals, security and shelter. Further, constant monitoring with the concerned local authorities for follow-up on violence cases, their investigation, trial processes, etc. is also pursued.
