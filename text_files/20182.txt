ANSWER




                                                        (a) and (b):  Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) vide notification dated 13.11.2013 notified Information Technology Investment Region (ITIR) in Hyderabad with a central financial assistance of Rs. 3,275 crore. The developmental activities were to be carried out by Government of Telangana with financial assistance from concerned Ministries of Government of India viz; Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Road, Transport & Highways and Ministry of Urban Development. The progress and issues in implementation of the ITIR in Hyderabad was reviewed during the meeting held at MeitY on 11.01.2017 with representatives from concerned Ministries/ Department and IT (E&C) Department and Government of Telangana wherein Government of Telangana was asked to submit requisite information to the concerned Ministries with intimation to MeitY. No information was furnished by Government of Telangana. Subsequently, a review of the ITIR Policy was undertaken on requirement of continuation of such ITIR scheme. Based on the review, ITIR Policy 2008 has been discontinued considering the fact that the objectives of the ITIR policy are now being better served and achieved by direct promotion of industrial units in industrial clusters and industrial townships that are taking shape through various programmes viz; DMIC, Smart Cities and other Industrial/Electronics Park schemes implemented by concerned Ministry’s/ Departments wherein considerable financial support is available.(c):  No fund is released so far for the said ITIR. ********
