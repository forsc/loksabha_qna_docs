(SHRI NARENDRA  SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (c):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 149 DUE FOR REPLY ON 2ND JULY, 2019.(a):	State-wise details of claims paid during 2016-17, 2017-18 and Kharif 2018 season under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima yojana (PMFBY) are given in Annexure.   (b) & (c):	As per provisions of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) admissible claims are generally paid by the insurance companies within two months of completion of Crop Cutting Experiments/harvesting period subject to availability of yield data and total State share of premium subsidy from concerned State Government within time. However, settlement of claims in some States get delayed due to reasons like delayed transmission of yield data;  late release of their share in premium subsidy by some States, yield related disputes between insurance companies and States, non-receipt of account details of some farmers for transfer of claims and NEFT related issues, etc.  However, this Department is regularly monitoring the implementation of PMFBY including timely settlement of claims.  Penalty provisions for late settlement of claims by insurance companies and late release of funds by State Governments have also been stipulated under the revised Operational Guidelines of the scheme which have come into effect from Rabi 2018-19.
