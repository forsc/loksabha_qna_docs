(b): The scheme is implemented by the State Governments, therefore Central Government does not conduct audit of Aanganwadi Centre. The implementation and utilization of funds is monitored by way of obtaining Utilization Certificates/Statement of Expenditure and also through Data Capturing on Poshan Tracker.(c) Does not arise. *****ANNEXURESTATEMENT REFERRED IN REPLY TO PART (A) OF LOK SABHA UN-STARRED QUESTION NO. 2073 FOR 10.12.2021 ASKED BY SHRI MAHESH SAHOO, M.P.
