                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(SHRI PRATAP CHANDRA SARANGI)(a)	to (e): During the initial days of the lockdown, like other sectors,  the fisheries sector was also impacted due to COVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate the impact, the Central and State/Union Territories (UTs) Governments took several initiatives. For supporting fishermen, fish farmers and fish workers, the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India vide its order dated 10th April, 2020 allowed commencement of operations of the fishing(marine)/aquaculture industry including feeding & maintenance, harvesting, processing, packaging, cold chain, sale and marketing, hatcheries, feed plants, commercial aquaria, movement of fish/shrimp and fish products, seed/feed and workers. Further, the Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying with a view to avoid adverse impact on fisheries due to COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, issued advisory to State Governments/ UTs to include fish and shrimp in the list of commodities to exempt from lockdown and also allow movement of fish and fish products, fish seed & fish feed for fish-farmers/fishers, aquaculture farms and other commercial establishments like aquarium shop etc. In order to support the fishermen, fish farmers, fish workers and lakhs of people depending on this sector for their livelihood, the Government of India has launched a new flagship scheme namely Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) as a part of Atmanirbhar Bharat COVID-19 relief package with highest ever investment of Rs. 20050 crore in fisheries sector for a period of 5 years with effect from the financial year 2020-21 for implementation in all States/Union Territories including Tamil Nadu. Under PMMSY, the Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying has approved the proposals of Government of Tamil Nadu for various fisheries developmental activities which includes establishment of new freshwater finfish hatcheries, construction of Biofloc ponds, establishment of open sea cages, seaweed culture rafts including inputs, ornamental fish rearing unit, providing boats and nets for traditional fishermen etc. All the efforts of government have resulted in mitigation of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fisheries sector and the sector has revived over last few months. *****
