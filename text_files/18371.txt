ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	and (b) Yes Sir. This assessment report published by the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MOES) contains details of observed changes in our climate system and future projections of climate change based on observations and climate model simulations. It provides a detailed overview and synthesis of the published scientific literature on climate change over India and adjoining regions. The report mentions that since the middle of the twentieth century, India has witnessed a rise in average temperature; a decrease in monsoon precipitation; a rise in extreme temperature and rainfall events, droughts, and sea levels; and an increase in the intensity of severe cyclones, alongside other changes in the monsoon system. (c) India is taking pro-active action to combat, adapt and mitigate the effects of climate change through various initiatives. Government is implementing National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which provides an overarching policy framework for climate actions in the country with eight Missions-(i) National Solar Mission (ii) National Mission on Enhanced Energy Efficiency (iii) National Water Mission (iv) National Mission on Sustainable Habitat (v) National Mission on Sustaining Himalayan Ecosystem (vi) National Green India Mission (vii) National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture and (viii) National Mission on Strategic Knowledge on Climate Change. Three of these Missions namely the Missions on solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency and sustainable habitats focus on mitigation, while the rest are focused on adaptation. Climate actions at the state level are based on the State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCC). Thirty-three States/Union Territories have prepared their SAPCC in line with NAPCC taking into account State’s specific issues relating to climate change. These SAPCCs inter-alia outline sector specific and cross sectoral priority climate actions. The Government is also implementing National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC) to support adaptation measures of States/UTs in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Under NAFCC, 30 projects have been sanctioned in 27 States to tackle the issues related to adaptation in agriculture, water, forestry, etc. Government of India has also embarked upon ambitious actions in the areas of renewable energy, afforestation, energy efficiency and urban development. (d) There is no such proposal under consideration. *****
