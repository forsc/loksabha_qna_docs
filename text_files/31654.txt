ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS (SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) to (c) Various steps are taken by the Government to monitor and check the construction quality and work progress of National Highways (NHs). All NHs are constructed as per quality standards specified in the Ministry and Indian Roads Congress (IRC) specifications. The sub- standard works found, if any, are got rectified and re-laid as per specifications. This is ensured by appointment of consultants as Authority’s Engineer/ Independent Engineer for day-to-day supervision for implementation of quality assurance/control as specified in contract/ concession agreement. In case of any defaults, action against defaulting agencies are taken as per the provisions of agreements.Projects sometime get delayed due to various reasons, namely delay in land acquisition, utility shifting, environment/forest/wildlife clearances, ROB & RUB issues with Railways, public agitation for additional facilities, non-availability of soil/aggregates, geographical constraints & soil conditions, poor performance of contractors, arbitration/contractual disputes with contractors, inadequate cash flow by the contracting agency, etc. Government holds regular review meetings at various levels with State Governments, executing agencies (such as National Highways Authority of India, National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited, Border Roads Organisation, Public Works Departments/ Road Construction Departments/ Corporations of State Governments/ Union Territories, etc.) and concessionaires/contractors to ensure taking up of corrective actions and completion of projects within stipulated time. *****
