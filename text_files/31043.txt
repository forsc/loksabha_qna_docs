ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR TEXTILES  (SMT. DARSHANA JARDOSH)(a) & (b):	The Government has approved setting up of 7 (Seven) PM Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM MITRA) Parks in Greenfield/Brownfield sites with an outlay of ? 4445 cr for a period of seven years upto 2027-28 to develop world class infrastructure including plug and play facility.  The PM MITRA Parks Scheme shall be implemented on pan-India basis including the state of Haryana and is intended for holistic development of textile sector. State Governments having ready availability of contiguous and encumbrance-free land parcel of 1000+ acres are eligible to apply. World-class industrial infrastructure in PM MITRA Parks would attract cutting edge technology, boost FDI and local investment and thereby generate employment on large scale. The evaluation of proposals received from the states will be on the basis of Challenge Method. ***
