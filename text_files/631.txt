The  Act casts an obligation   to   provide  a  safe  and   secure  environment   to    women --2--L.S.US.Q NO. 464 FOR 25.06.2019  personnel at the workplace. The Act also casts an obligation upon all the employers to constitute Internal Complaint Committee. Section 23 of the Act casts responsibility on the appropriate Government to monitor the implementation of the Act and maintain data on the number of cases filed and disposed of. State-wise record of complaints of sexual harassment at the workplace of women police personnel is not maintained centrally. ******
