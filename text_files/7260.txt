The Children’s Science Congress (CSC) is a programme being implemented in North Eastern states to instill scientific approach among students. The programme benefits the students to understand the science better through the eye of common man and identifying the societal relevance of their research. The students are encouraged to learn by doing innovative theme-based project in science. The students identify a community problem and apply their scientific knowledge to find out an innovative solutions to these problems. This benefits the society as the student community are now aware of problems and are thinking of solutions to solve problems. The students also enjoy learning science by doing the innovative projects. Every year nearly 700 students participate at National event of Children’s Science Congress where they demonstrate their scientific thinking and approach to problem solving.The Department is also implementing INSPIRE Award - MANAK (Million Minds Augmenting National Aspiration and Knowledge) scheme for school children in the age group of 10-15 years and studying in Class 6th -10th to promote research and innovation among them.  Though, the scheme is not specifically targeted towards students from all over the country, the scheme has good outreach in schools located in North Eastern States of the country and all the North Eastern States only, however, the scheme has good outreach in schools located in North Eastern States of the country and all the State of North-East are participating in this scheme. Under INSPIRE Award - MANAK scheme, in a Financial Year, ten (10.0) lakh ideas are targeted from more than five (05) lakh middle and high schools across the country, out of which one (1.0) lakh ideas are to be shortlisted for an initial award of Rs. 10,000/- for preparation of project/model/showcasing of idea. The awardees then participate in three tier competition i.e. District, State and National Level. Participants of National Exhibition are also provided mentoring support at premier Educational and technical institutions of the country. In 2018-19, 344 INSPIRE Awards were sanctioned to the students from North-Eastern States.Department of Science and Technology through its novel initiative Augmenting Writing Skills in Articulating Research (AWSAR) is encouraging PhD students working in R&D Universities and S&T Institutions across the country, to connect with society through popular science writing about their research work in simple language. National Council of Science Museums (NCSM) has set up Science Centres in North Eastern States as listed at Annexure ‘A’ in order to popularize Science & Technology in cities, urban and rural areas of North Eastern States to develop scientific attitude and temper and to create, inculcate and sustain a general awareness among the students of NE states. Science Museums and Science Centres under NCSM are better known for their extensive round the year educational activities aimed at the young student community, teachers, young entrepreneurs, physically challenged, house wives. The basic idea is to help our youth and common man to understand science better through hands-on-activities/ experiments, create an interest for science as carrier option and foster creativity and innovation.
