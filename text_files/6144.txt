ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a)	& (b): The Anganwadi Services under the Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme envisage the Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) & Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) as “honorary workers” from the local community who come forward to render their services, on part time basis, in the area of child care and development.  The Government of India has recently enhanced the honorarium of Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) at  main-Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) from Rs. 3,000/- to Rs. 4,500/- per month; AWWs at mini-AWCs from Rs. 2,250/- to Rs. 3,500/- per month; Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) from Rs 1,500/- to Rs. 2,250/- per month; and introduced performance linked incentive of Rs. 250/- per month to AWHs, effective from 1st October, 2018. AWWs are paid Rs. 500/- per month under POSHAN Abhiyaan for using ICDS-CAS. 	For any additional work assigned to them from time to time, the States/UTs are also paying additional honorarium to these functionaries out of their own resources. The details of additional honorarium being paid by respective States/UTs are at Annex-I.    (c) 	& (d): There is no such proposal under consideration to regularise Anganwadi Workers under Anganwadi Services (Umbrella ICDS Scheme). Moreover, being honorary workers, these functionaries cannot be declared as “Government employees/regular employees” or extended the benefits as admissible to employees of the Government. Further, the Supreme Court of India in ruling of 07.12.2006 in Civil Appeal No.4953-4957 of 1998 State of Karnataka & Ors. Vs. Ameerbi & Ors. has held that AWWs/AWHs do not hold any civil post.  There is no provision under the scheme for employing casual labourers.(e):	The state-wise and year-wise details of funds contributed by the Central Government for implementation of Anganwadi Services since 2014 is at Annex-II.******** Annexure-IStatement referred to in part (a) & (b) of the Lok Sabha US Q No.5553 by Shri Hemant Sriram Patil and Dr. Amar Singh regarding ‘Welfare of Anganwadi Workers’ for 26.07.2019Statement indicating additional honorarium given by the States/UTsto AWWs/AWHs from their own resources(As on 30.06.2019)S.
