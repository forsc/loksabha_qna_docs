ANSWER




                                                        (a)	& (b) : Yes, Sir. The city of Udaipur was selected to be developed as a Smart City in Round-I of the Smart Cities Mission (SCM) in January, 2016. The Smart City Proposal (SCP) prepared by the Udaipur City is for Rs. 1221 crore out of which projects worth Rs. 880 crore are proposed for Area-Based Development (ABD) and projects worth Rs. 341 crore are for Pan City Development.  These projects, inter alia,  relate to tourism development, water-front  development,   smart   and   resilient   infrastructure   to  support growing tourism & urban activity and conservation of areas in the walled city. In Udaipur Smart City, as on 18th November, 2019, tenders have been issued in 43 projects worth Rs. 337.7 crore, work orders have been issued in 46 projects worth Rs. 1175.69 crore and 16 projects worth 35.46 crore have been completed.(c) The implementation of the Smart Cities Mission at the city level is done by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) created for the purpose. The SPVs plan, appraise, approve, implement, manage, operate, monitor and evaluate their Smart City projects. At State level, Mission implementation is coordinated by the State level High Powered Steering Committee (HPSC) chaired by the Chief Secretary of the State. At the National level, the implementation of Smart Cities Mission is being monitored by an Apex Committee headed by Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). The Nominee Directors of MoHUA, on the Boards of SPVs, are also monitoring the progress in respective cities on a regular basis. The MoHUA regularly interacts with the States/Smart Cities through video conferences, review meetings, field visits, regional workshops etc. at various levels to assess the performance of the cities and to handhold them for improving the same. Besides, the guidance of domain experts participating in the regional workshops, cities also benefit from peer-to-peer learning during these interactions.  The Smart Cities are also regularly reporting implementation status of projects, including utilization of funds, under SCM through the Online-Management Information System (MIS). In addition, all the Smart Cities have been advised to furnish utilization status of GoI funds on a monthly basis for monitoring the utilization of funds more closely.                                               *****
