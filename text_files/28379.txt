The priority groups are women, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, minorities and other backward sections of the society.In addition to above short-term training, Directorate General of Training (DGT) under MSDE is implementing long duration vocational courses through Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) which offer range of one or two years’ vocational /skill training courses.
