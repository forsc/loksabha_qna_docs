ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)&(b)	Flood is a natural calamity and is attributed to various factors like wide variation in rainfall both in time and space with frequent departure from normal pattern, inadequate carrying capacities of rivers, river bank erosion, silting of river beds, landslides, poor natural drainage, snow melts and glacial lake outbursts.Deforestation in the catchment areas of any river leads to change in morphology of the river and impacts the discharge, runoff pattern, behaviour, etc of the river. The deforestation also adversely increases the silt load being carried by rivers, which in turn develops meandering and other effects in the downstream reaches of the river. As reported by the Government of Bihar, phenomenon such as above are being witnessed in the rivers of north Bihar.The State Governments formulates and implements the flood management schemes as per their priorities. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas.(c)&(d) India has bilateral engagement with Nepal in the areas of flood forecasting, data-sharing, river training and flood control for cross border rivers. The bilateral mechanisms between India & Nepal in this regard are being coordinated by the Government of India as well as by the State Governments of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.While Government of Nepal is actively engaged through these mechanisms, it has so far not approached Government of India for seeking assistance regarding afforestation. Government of India is regularly interacting with the Government of Nepal for construction of dams on rivers for mutual benefit of the two countries which also includes flood control. ***
