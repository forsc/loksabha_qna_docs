ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) and (b): Government of India is keen to provide the Indian students world class education in India itself and it has no specific and separate plan for promoting the education of Indian students in foreign countries. However, the Department of Higher Education signs agreements with foreign countries for academic and research collaborations in the area of higher education. The Ministry also operates the Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC) where Indian  students work on joint research projects with students from foreign Higher Educational institutions.  Further, Indian Higher Educational Institutions also collaborate with foreign Higher Educational Institutions in academic and research areas involving   students.  *****
