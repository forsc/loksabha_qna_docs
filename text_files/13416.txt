                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS,  HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) to (c)	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) in its recommendations  on “Auction of Spectrum in 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz, 3300-3400 MHz, 3400-3600 MHz Bands” dated 01.08.2018 has recommended that entire available spectrum should be put to auction and based on the decision of the DCC it is proposed to put a total of 8303.05 MHz of spectrum for auction at a reserve price of Rs.5,23,400.70 Crores.The Department of Telecommunications in its back reference to the TRAI recommendations dated 01.08.2018 had highlighted, among others, that due to competition, concerns have been expressed about the financial health of the sector, revenue growth and capability of the companies to meet their contractual commitments and requested TRAI to reconsider their recommendations on spectrum valuation and reserve prices. However TRAI in its response reiterated its earlier recommended Spectrum Valuation and Reserve Prices. The Digital Communications Commission (DCC) has agreed to the TRAI recommendations, including the Reserve Price; on which further action will be taken as per approval of the Cabinet.(d) 	At this stage, the Government, in consultation with the Industry, is considering grant of experimental license for 5G trials. Based upon the outcome of the trials and market conditions, the Telecom Service Providers may chart-out their future strategy on adoption and rolling out of 5G services in the country.************
