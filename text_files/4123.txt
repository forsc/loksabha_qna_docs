                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana (PMAGY) is being implemented by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. As per the evaluation of the Scheme it has succeeded greatly in the development of the villages predominantly inhabited by the Scheduled Castes. The convergence approach has been utilized effectively to fulfil the needs of the village communities as identified in the Village Development Plan (VDP) prepared with the participation of the residents.(b) & (c):	Under this Scheme there is no provision of adoption of villages by the MPs for implementation of the scheme.(d):	The Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana (PMAGY) is being implemented since 2009-10 with the aim of integrated development of villages having Scheduled Castes population of more than 50%. The Scheme was launched on a pilot basis during 2009-10 and 1000 villages were taken up in five States. Thereafter, in 2014-15, the Scheme was further extended to cover another 1500 villages across 11 States. In 2018-19, 4094 new villages, along with 390 villages covered earlier in 2014-15, have been taken up. For proper implementation of the PMAGY the Scheme was evaluated and based on the recommendations, the Scheme Guidelines were revised in October, 2018 to bring focus on proper implementation and an exhaustive framework for planning, execution, monitoring and taking further corrective actions was prepared. Also, an online MIS System has been developed to enable need assessment, Village Development Plan preparation, execution, monitoring and reporting the physical and financial progress. Regular meetings/conferences, field visits, Video Conferences etc., are held with the representatives of the State Govt./UT Administration for effective implementation and proper utilization of the funds released by the Government of India.*****
