                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) FOR NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND POWER (SHRI R. K. SINGH)(a) to (d) A statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****StatementStatement referred to in reply to parts (a) to (d) of Lok  Sabha Starred Question No. 181 to be answered on 04/07/2019 regarding setting up of bio-gas plants(a) The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) is implementing the New National Biogas and Organic Manure Programme (NNBOMP), a Central Sector Scheme, for setting up small Biogas plants (in the size range of 1 to 25 cubic metre) based on cattle dung and other mixed biodegradable wastes in remote, rural and semi-urban areas of the country. The scheme aims to provide biogas as a clean fuel for cooking, lighting, and meeting other thermal and small power needs in remote, rural and semi-urban areas of the country. The organic bio-manure produced in the process can be used for sustaining soil health and increasing crop yield.   (b) Under NNBOMP a target of setting up 76000 small biogas plants has been fixed for the current year.   The State/UT-wise details of targets fixed for the current year are given in Annexure-I. The details of available Central Financial Assistance (CFA) under NNBOMP are given in Annexure-II.(c) The State/UT-wise details of biogas plants installed and number of villages covered under the erstwhile National Biogas and Manure Management Programme (NBMMP) during 2016-17 & 2017-18 and under NNBOMP during 2018-19 & current year, 2019-20 are given in Annexure-III.   The indicative targets for the current year set under the New National Biogas and Organic Manure Programme (NNBOMP) as detailed in Annexure-I have been communicated to various States/UTs on 14.05.2019.  (d) In order to promote and encourage the use of biogas as clean cooking fuel, the earlier scheme, NBMMP was modified and is now being implemented as New National Biogas and Organic Manure Programme (NNBOMP) w.e.f. 01.04.2018. The Rural Development Departments of the State Governments/UT Administrations have been designated as the main Programme Implementing Agencies.  Under NNBOMP, the maximum size of family type biogas plants has been enhanced from 6 cubic metre capacity to 25 cubic metre capacity to cover untapped potential of Biogas Energy in the remote/ rural and semi-urban areas. In addition, Central Financial Assistance (CFA) has also been enhanced under the NNBOMP, which varies from a minimum of Rs.7500/- per plant for 1 cubic metre size Biogas Plants to Rs.35,000/- per biogas plant  in the small biogas plant size range of 20-25 cubic metre depending upon the location and category of  the beneficiaries. The details of CFA available are given in Annexure-II. In order to encourage the use of biogas plant linked with sanitary toilets, an additional subsidy of Rs.16,00/- per plant up to 10 cubic meter size is also available.
