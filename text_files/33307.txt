ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (e): The Ministry of Tribal Affairs implements various Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Scheme through States /UT Government.  Ministry in last few years  has undergone a major strategic shift and has developed scheme specific portals with end to end digitization of  various processes ensuring  physical and financial monitoring of the funds released under different schemes. Ministry is not aware about specific announcement of the Government for setting up of PMUs in states.  However, the NITI Aayog has initiated Data Governance Quality Index which evaluates various Ministries on data-based Governance and has advised all Ministries to set up Data and Strategy units in Ministry for digitization of processes related to implementation and monitoring of Central Sector/Centrally sponsored schemes of ministries/Departments. Till 14th Finance Cycle (from 2016-17 to 2020-21), amount ranging from 1-2% of the scheme was given to States/UTs as administrative cost for implementation of the Schemes. While approving the continuation of Centrally Sponsored and Central Sector Scheme for Development of STs over the 15th Finance Commission  (2021-22 to 2025-26), funds  have been provided to set up State Programme Management Unit (SPMU) at State level  for effective implementation and monitoring of the combined schemes of the Ministry.  Funds  have also been earmarked under the scheme  "Monitoring, Evaluation, Survey and Social Audit" including setting up of Central PMU.  The role of central PMU is to co- ordinate with the State units for providing data in respect of various schemes. *****
