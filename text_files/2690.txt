ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STEEL			   (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a)&(b): Yes, Sir. During the period 2018-19, finished steel import stood at 7.83 million tonnes, an increase of 4.7% in comparison to 2017-18. Stainless Steel, Flat Products such as HR/CR Coils, GP/GC Coated and Electrical Sheets are the major categories that are being imported from other countries. Among the steel grades that are imported, there are some that are not manufactured in adequate quantity in the country viz. CRGO, CR sheets with zero bends, API grade steel sheets/coils, special alloy steels of some grades used in Automobile components etc. Some of the reasons for these grades not getting manufactured in India vary from lack of availability of technology, not enough demand to justify a separate production line.(c)	Details of finished steel imports in India are as under:-Year	Steel Imports (in million tonnes) 	Value of import( in Rupees crore)2015-16 	11.71	450442016-17	7.23	341042017-18	7.48	394842018-19	7.83	49317(d)	No, Sir.Contd……../2- -: 2 :-(e)	The imports of steel for the past two years namely 2017-18 and 2018-19 has been stable and there was an increase of 4.7 % in finished steel imports in 2018-19 over 2017-18 levels.  Imports from China have reduced by 11.7 % from 2017-18 to 2018-19.(f)	Steel is a deregulated sector. However, the following steps have been taken by the Government to protect/promote indigenous steel industry:- (i)	Domestically Manufactured Iron & Steel Products Policy, 2017 has been revised on 29.05.2019 by not only reducing the threshold minimum value of contract from Rs 50 Cr to Rs. 25 Cr, but also by including Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contracts within the ambit of this policy, increase in minimum value addition levels and inclusion of Capital goods. (ii)	Government has also notified National Steel Policy, 2017 to promote domestic steel sector.(iii)	Government has notified 53 Steel and Steel Product (Quality Control) Orders which is applicable for both domestic productions as well as imports. The Steel Quality Control Order are implemented in the public interest for protection of human, animal and plant, safety of environment, prevention of unfair trade practices and national security. (iv)	In order to protect the domestic industry from unfair external competition, appropriate trade measures such as anti dumping duties and countervailing duties have been/are imposed.********
