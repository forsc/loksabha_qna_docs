JITENDRA SINGH)(a):  Data regarding vacancies in Civil Services is maintained by respective Cadre Controlling Authorities including the State Governments.

Each Cadre Controlling Authority intimates to UPSC the vacancies to be filled up in the respective Services through CSE every year through direct recruitment mode. In Promotion Quota too, prompt actions are being taken for holding of Selection Committee Meetings timely for appointment by Promotion of State Civil Service and State Police Service Officers to IAS and IPS respectively; as well as for appointment by Selection of Non-State Civil Service Officers to IAS.   For IAS, as per the recommendations of Baswan Committee and with the approval of the Competent Authority, 180 IAS officers are recruited through CSE each year since CSE-2012. For IPS, 150 Officers have been recruited through CSE each year since CSE-2009, which has been further increased to 200 since CSE-2020.*****
