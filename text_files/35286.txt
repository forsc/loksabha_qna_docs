                                                                                 THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE                     MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                              (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a) to (d): Government of India launched Smart Cities Mission (SCM) on 25 June 2015.  100 Smart Cities have been selected through 4 rounds of competition from January 2016 to June 2018.  As per SCM Guidelines, Central Government will provide financial support to the extent of ? 48,000 crore over five years i.e., on an average ? 100 crore per city per year.  An equal amount on a matching basis will be contributed by the State Government/Urban Local Body (ULB).  Projects under SCM are aimed at improving liveability, economicability, and sustainability of cities. The focus is on sustainable and inclusive development and the idea is to look at developing compact areas, creating replicable models which will act as lighthouses to other aspiring cities through work on four pillars of comprehensive development — institutional, physical, social, and economic infrastructure. Projects under the Mission, inter alia, include development of Integrated Command & Control Centres, Smart Roads, Smart Solar, Smart water & Wastewater infrastructure, Vibrant Urban Spaces.As on 4 March 2022, 100 Smart Cities have tendered out 6,928 projects worth ? 1,91,238 crore; work orders have been issued in 6,282 projects worth ? 1,65,503 crore; 3,576 projects worth ? 59,958 crore have been completed.  So far, Government of India has released          ? 29,213.60 crore for 100 Smart Cities, out of which ? 25,177.65 crore (86%) has been utilized. Presently, there is no proposal under consideration of the Government for adding more cities under SCM.  However, to support States/Union Territories (UTs) and cities in undertaking their journey towards Smart Cities, a workbook titled ‘Making a City Smart: Lessons from the Smart Cities Mission’ has been released Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs. The workbook encapsulates learnings from on-ground implementation of SCM over the past five years and can be used by State Governments/UTs/cities to understand the What, Why and How to make a city ‘Smart’. The workbook is available online at: https://smartnet.niua.org/content.                                      *****
