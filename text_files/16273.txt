                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN MINISTRY OF FINANCE(Shri Anurag Singh Thakur)(a) & (b): The month-wise gross Goods and Services Tax collection for FY 2018-19, 2019-20 and FY 2020-21 (till August, 2020) are as under:                                                                   (in Rs. Corore)Month	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21 (till Aug,20)April	103459	113865	32174May	94016	100289	62151June	95610	99939	90917July	96483	102082	87422August	93960	98202	86499September	94442	91916	October	100710	95379	November	97637	103491	December	94726	103184	January	102503	110818	February	97247	105361	March	106577	97590	Total 	1177368	1221604	359163Average	98114	101843	71833The average gross GST collection in the FY 2020-21 has shown declining trend as compared to the previous Financial Year. This may be attributed to the COVID Pandemic induced Lockdown and relief measures extended to the taxpayers by the Government by way of waiving the interest, late fee and extending the return filing dates.(c) to (g): As per provisions in Section 7 of the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 loss of revenue to the States shall be calculated and released at the end of every two months’ period, for 5 years. Accordingly, admissible GST compensation for the period April, 2019 to March, 2020 has been released to all States/ UTs including Karnataka and Kerala. Due to short GST Compensation Cess collection in the current financial year, GST compensation is yet to be paid for the period April-July, 2020, as per details in Annexure. 	Accordingly, issue of pending GST compensation and future course of action to meet the GST compensation shortfall has been discussed in 41st GST Council meeting on 27.08.2020 wherein States were given two options to meet their GST compensation shortfall for current FY from market borrowing.	It was also decided that States will give their preference views thereon. Thereafter on finalization of scheme, the states can chose either Option 1 or Option 2 and accordingly, their compensation, borrowing, repayment etc will be dealt as per their individual choice. ****
