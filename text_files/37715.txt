                                                                                         ANSWER                     THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE                     MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                           (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a)	 to (d): Yes, Sir. Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has launched Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHCs) as a sub-scheme of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) to provide dignified living to urban migrants/ poor near their workplace. This scheme is being implemented through two models as under: i.	Model-1: Utilizing existing Government funded vacant houses constructed under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JnNURM) and Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY) to convert into ARHCs through Public Private Partnership (PPP) or by Public Agencies;ii.	Model-2: Construction, Operation & Maintenance of ARHCs by Public/ Private Entities on their own available vacant land. ARHCs Scheme was launched with the following aims and objectives:(i) To address the vision of ‘AatmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ significantly by creating a sustainable ecosystem of affordable rental housing solutions for urban migrants/ poor.(ii) To achieve overall objective of “Housing for All” encompassing the need of affordable rental housing for urban migrants/ poor. ARHCs will provide them dignified living with necessary civic amenities near their place of work.(iii) To create a conducive environment by incentivizing Public/ Private Entities to leverage investment for creating affordable rental housing stock to take care of their own requirements for workforce and also cater to neighboring areas, if they have available vacant land. Under Model-1, out of total 83,534 existing government funded vacant houses constructed under JnNURM and RAY in different States/ Union Territories, 5478 houses have been converted into ARHCs and 7,483 units are under process of getting converted as ARHCs and are at various stages of completion across the country. Under Model-2, proposals for construction of 78,885 new ARHC units have been sanctioned. The State and Urban Local Body (ULB)-wise details are at Annexure.(e): As per scheme guidelines, affordable rent of ARHCs is fixed by the local authority based on a local survey.  (f): So far, 5,478 ARHC units have been developed and allotted to urban migrants/ poor, under Model-1.                                               *****
