MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION, MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)&(b) The Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation (MoSPI) initiated the efforts of compilation of the Environment Accounts since 2018 using the internationally agreed standards and methodology adhering to the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting 2012 —Central Framework (SEEA Central Framework). MoSPI compiled the stock of mineral reserves for the years 2005, 2010 and 2015 using information from Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM), Ministry of Mines and Coal Controller’s Organization, Ministry of Coal and published in the publication “EnviStats India 2018 (Supplement on Environmental Accounts)”. The publication is available on Ministry’s website. Subsequently, Government Accounting Standards Advisory Board (GASAB), an intergovernmental body established under the aegis of Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG India), initiated their efforts towards preparation of a road-map for implementation of Natural Resource Accounting (NRA) in India. GASAB developed a Concept Paper on Implementation of NRA in India in July 2020 envisaging short, medium and long term goals, which included a short term goal to assist the governments in preparation of Asset Accounts on Minerals and Non-Renewable Energy Resources. The document is available in the website of GASAB. Further, GASAB has released formats of certain templates in October 2021 for preparing the Asset Accounts supported by detailed guidelines for use by the States.                                               *********
