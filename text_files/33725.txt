                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI A. NARAYANASWAMY)(a) to (c): The Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment had been implementing the Central Sector Scheme for Prevention of Alcoholism and Substance (Drug) Abuse since 1985-86, with the objective of creating awareness and educate people about the ill-effects of alcoholism and substance abuse and for providing a whole range of community based services for identification, motivation, counseling, de- addiction, after care and rehabilitation for Whole Person Recovery (WPR) of substance and alcohol users. However, in order to have a comprehensive scheme under which all Drug demand reduction activities can be conceptualized and implemented, now the Scheme of Assistance for Prevention of Alcoholism and Substance (Drug) Abuse has been merged into NAPDDR. Under NAPDDR scheme, all the initiatives towards DRUG DEMAND REDUCTION in the country can be carried out through Government of India, State/UT Governments, implementing agencies like PRIs, NGOs, Trusts, ULBs, Autonomous organizations, Technical Forums, Hospitals, Prison Administrations and so on. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has also been running a National Toll Free Helpline 14446, 24*7 for Prevention of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse. The main purpose of the toll free helpline is to provide tele-counseling to Drug Abusers and refer them to the nearest de-addiction centres that are being financially assisted by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. *****
