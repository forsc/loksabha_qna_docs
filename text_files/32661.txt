                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (d):	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 85 BY SHRI RAJU BISTA TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 02.02.2022 REGARDING SEVOKE - RANGPO RAIL PROJECT(a) and (b):	     Total estimated cost of Sivok - Rangpo new railway line project is `8,153.22 crore. Railway has paid due compensation to Forest Department for forest land diverted for construction of railway line. For the infrastructure project like Sivok – Rangpo new broad gauge line project which is mainly being constructed through tunnels, thereby, damage to environment is negligible. However, Net Present Value (NPV) and Compensatory Afforestation (CA) amount has been paid by the Railways for the forest land diverted for the project after following process of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC).Apart from NPV and CA, cost of compensation amounting to `235 crore has also been paid by Railways (`189 crore for Wildlife Conservation Plan and `46 crore for Soil Moisture Conservation Plan).The completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, priority of project, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations etc. All these factors affect the completion time of the project.  As such, confirmed completion time of project cannot be ascertained at this state. Nevertheless, every effort is being made to execute the project expeditiously.(c):	Total 22 villages are coming in the vicinity of the project area, out of which, only 30 households in 2 villages are affected and are required to be shifted/re-located.(d):	Compensation for shifting of these 30 families amounting to `2.77 crore has already been deposited by Railways to State Government in October, 2014. The amount has also been distributed by State Government to the affected families.*****
