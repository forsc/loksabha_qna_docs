ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) and (b) Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) is an initiative of three organizations viz. Germanwatch, New Climate Institute and Climate Action Network International. The ranking of countries in CCPI is based on their performance in addressing climate change as per parameters and methodologies employed in the construction of the index. CCPI ranking for the year 2022 was published on November 9, 2021. CCPI 2022 evaluates and compares the climate protection performance of 60 countries and the European Union (EU), which collectively account for more than 92% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The CCPI aims to deliver a comprehensive and balanced evaluation of the diverse countries evaluated. It uses 14 indicators under the four categories namely; GHG Emissions (40% of overall score), Renewable Energy (20% of overall score), Energy Use (20% of overall score) and Climate Policy (20% of overall score).The CCPI indicators, however, are not based on the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities that are foundational to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, but focus only on current and future emissions and ignore historical responsibility.(c) and (d) CCPI 2022 ranks India at 10th position. The CCPI rank for India during the last four years is as follows:Year	CCPI Rank2018	142019	112020	92021	10 India ratified the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and submitted ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for combating climate change. India is on track to meet its NDCs, which are compatible with a well-below-2°C scenario. Several policies and programs for low carbon development across key sectors of the economy were launched and further strengthened. These include, inter alia, policies for promotion of non-fossil energy that has resulted in enhancement of such capacity from 75 GW in March 2014 to more than 156 GW in October 2021, enhancing energy efficiency through schemes like Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA) where 36.78 crores LED bulbs have been distributed, transition towards sustainable mobility through the promotion of mass transportation, promotion of biofuels and advanced fuel efficiency norms, increasing forest and tree cover to 24.56% of geographic area, etc. Further, supercritical thermal power units have risen from 40 in 2015 to 85 in 2021 with a capacity of 59 GW. As a result, India has already achieved a 24% reduction in the emissions intensity of its GDP in 2016 over 2005 levels. It has also achieved 40% cumulative installed electric capacity from non-fossil sources.*****
