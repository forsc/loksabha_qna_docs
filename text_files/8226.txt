ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) : 		Central Electricity Authority (CEA), on daily basis, monitors 134 number of Thermal Power Plants (TPP) having coal linkages with Coal India Limited (CIL) and Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL). The total coal stock available at these power plants, as on 24.11.2019, is 23.80 Million Tonnes (MT), which is sufficient to run these plants, for an average of 14 days. The daily coal stock report showing stock position at these power plants, state-wise as on 24.11.2019, is at Annexure-I. CEA also monitors Coal Stock Position of 34 TPPs on monthly basis. The monthly coal stock report showing stock position at these 34 power plants, as on 31.10.2019 is at Annexure-II.(b) : 		As per Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) Tariff Regulations 2019-24, for the purpose of interest on working capital for proper generation of power, the coal stock required is 10 days for pit-head generating stations and 20 days for non-pit-head generating stations.(c) : 		Providing uninterrupted supply of power is the responsibility of concerned State Governments / Distribution Utilities. Government of India is supplementing the efforts of the States through its schemes such as Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana–Saubhagya, Ujjwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY). These schemes help them to strengthen distribution network/grid connectivity to achieve 24x7 power for all and would facilitate uninterrupted power supply to consumers.Government of India also assists the States/UTs by allocating power from Central Government Stations (CGSs). State can also purchase power through various market mechanisms including power exchanges to meet any gap in demand and supply.                                         ***************
