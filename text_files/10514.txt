                                                    (a) whether the Government has entered into an international agreement called Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) relating to aviation emissions on international flights and if so, the details thereof;(b) whether as per CORSIA obligations, airlines are required to report their carbon emissions during the calendar years 2019 and 2020, which will be the baseline for the future and if so, details thereof;(c) whether the Government recognizes that presently Indian carriers are predominantly having narrow body fleets which limits their ability on long haul operations resulting in limited baseline establishment in calendar years 2019 and 2020 and if so, the details thereof;(d) whether the Government recognizes that after 2020, if airlines of India enhance long haul international operations, they will have to offset the emissions by the way of carbon trading, which will make the airlines in India non-competitive vis-a-vis other established airlines?






ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) At the 39th Session of the General Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) held in September, October, 2016, a resolution A39-3 was passed by majority support for adopting a global market based measure called Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) relating to emissions from international aviation. This resolution has been affirmed by majority of nations at the 40th General Assembly Session of ICAO held in September/ October, 2019 by passing Resolution A40-19. India has raised its voice at the ICAO Assembly Session against the design elements of CORSIA stating that they are not fair to the airlines of developing states who have potential to grow much more after 2020 compared to the airlines of developed states. India has also filed reservations with ICAO in this regard, both in 2016 and 2019.(b) & ( c)    Yes, Sir. The salient features of CORSIA are attached as Annexure.(d) The level of international operations by Indian carriers is currently on a high growth path.  As mentioned in the Annexure, CORSIA is being implemented in two phases, viz. Voluntary Phase (2021-2026) and Mandatory Phase (2027-2035). India is not joining CORSIA in the Voluntary Phase. The offsetting requirements under CORSIA, determined by the baseline level set as per emissions in 2019 and 2020, which will come into force from 01.01.2027 will impose financial burden on a large number of global airlines including the airlines of India.
