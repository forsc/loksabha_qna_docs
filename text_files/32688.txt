                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI   PRAHLAD SINGH  PATEL)  (a) to (g) A statement is laid on the table of the House. Statement referred in reply of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 24 to be answered on 03.02.2022(a) Since August 2019, Government of India, in partnership with States, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), to make provision of potable tap water supply to every rural household of the country by 2024.(b) District-wise fund allocation is not made and maintained by this Department. However, details of Central funds allocated, funds drawn and funds utilization reported by States of Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Bihar and Gujarat under Jal Jeevan Mission in 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 (as on 31.01.2022) is at Annex-I.	(c) The State/ UT-wise status of tap water connection in rural households across the country, including those in Maharashtra, Bihar and Rajasthan, is at Annex-II.(d) to (g) States plan, design, approve and implement drinking water supply schemes as Drinking Water is a State subject. Government of India supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical and financial assistance. As such details of individual projects/ schemes for rural water supply projects are not maintained at the Government of India level. For ensuring tap water supply in drought-prone & water-scarce areas/ areas with inadequate rainfall or dependable ground water sources, including those in the State of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Bihar and Rajasthan, provisions have been made under JJM for planning and implementation of bulk water transfer from long distances and regional water supply schemes. In addition, provisions have been made for source recharging, viz. dedicated bore well recharge structures, rain water recharge, rejuvenation of existing water bodies, etc., in convergence with other schemes such as MGNREGS, Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP), 15thFinance Commission tied grants to RLBs/ PRIs, State schemes, CSR funds, etc. In order to enhance recharge of aquifers, especially in arid and semi-arid areas, State Governments have been urged to strengthen/ extend existing canal networks and/ or build canals so as to transfer surplus flood waters from dams/ reservoirs to ponds/ lakes and other water bodies and also recharge groundwater during monsoon season. Further, for villages in water-scarce areas, in order to save the precious fresh water, States are also being encouraged to plan new water supply scheme with dual piped water supply system, i.e. supply of fresh water in one and treated grey/ waste water in another pipe for non-potable/ gardening/ toilet flushing use. Moreover, the households in these areas are to be encouraged to use the faucet aerators that save a significant amount of water, in multiple taps they may be using inside their house.*****
