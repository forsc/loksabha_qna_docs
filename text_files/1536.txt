PMKVY 2016-20 has two components known as Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed (CSCM) being implemented by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and Centrally Sponsored State Managed (CSSM) being implemented by State Skill Development Missions (SSDMs) of the States/ UTs popularly known as State- Engagement Component of PMKVY (2016-20).Under CSSM component of PMKVY 2016-20, funds and corresponding physical targets have been allocated to the States/UTs. Under this component, after evaluation of proposal received from of 36 States/UTs, Ministry has given in-principle approval of a total target of 20.18 lakh candidates and corresponding financial allocation of Rs. 3,050 Cr. for FY 2016-20. However, due to slow performance of States/UTs and keeping in the mind that the scheme is going to end by March’2020 the financial allocation was rationalised to Rs. 2,419 crore (approx.), out of which, as on 12.06.2019, Rs. 782.31 Cr. has been already disbursed to State Governments / SSDMs. Similarly, under this component, after evaluation of proposal received from Punjab Skill Development Mission (PSDM), Government of Punjab, Ministry had given in-principle approval of a total target of 55,028 candidates and corresponding financial allocation of Rs. 80.69 Cr. for FY 2017-20, out of which, Rs. 26.39 Cr. was disbursed to State of Punjab vide sanction order dated 19.04.2017 for the implementation of CSSM component of PMKVY across the State including border areas. After rationalisation, the fund allocated for State of Punjab has been reduced to Rs. 67.49 crore.
