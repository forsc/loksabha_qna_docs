ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):   Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) is a contributory scheme of 36 lakh Central Government employees and pensioners and is operational in 72 cities only, whereas Ayushman Bharat- Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) is a pan-India scheme which provides free health assurance cover of upto Rs. 5 lakh per year per family on family floater basis to around 10.74 crore poor and vulnerable families. There is no element of co-payment in PMJAY and introduction of concept of co-payment in PMJAY might lead to moral hazards.  	For the above reasons, package rates under CGHS and PMJAY may differ slightly in some cases, including PTCA-single stent. Contd……..-2-(c):   CGHS covers only 36 lakh beneficiaries spread in 72 cities. CGHS package rates in other cities except Mumbai are limited to 90% of Delhi rates. In CGHS Mumbai, the earlier CGHS package rates are continuing as no tender process for revision of rates was held in 2014 due to a pending Court case.PMJAY is a centrally sponsored scheme, where funding of the scheme is shared between Centre and States/ UTs in the ratio of 60:40 for all States/ UTs except North-eastern States and Himalayan States, where the ratio is 90:10 and UTs without legislature, where the central share is 100%. Under PMJAY, the States have the flexibility to decrease to any extent or increase upto 10% the package rates depending upon the state specific requirements. Also, hospitals are incentivized on certain parameters like NABH/JCI/NQAS accreditation, PG seats and location (metro urban areas or aspirational districts)(d):    No such proposal is pending before the Government at present.……………………….
