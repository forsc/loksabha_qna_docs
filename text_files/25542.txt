The States/UTs have been requested to expedite the completion of houses approved under PMAY-G with specific focus and priority of houses for which 2nd and 3rd instalments have been released. iii.	Daily monitoring on various parameters like Gaps in sanction of houses, cleaning of Permanent Wait List (PWL) of PMAY-G and release of Central Share/StateMatching Share from treasury to Single Nodal Account (SNA).iv.	Timely allocation of targets to the States/UTs andrelease of adequate funds at the level of the Ministry.v.	Promotion of eco-friendly & innovative technologies for house construction. vi.	Regular follow ups with the State to ensure provision of land to landless beneficiaries in rural areas.vii.	Expeditious resolution of technical issues and other constraints faced by the States.viii.	Steps are being taken to increase the coverage of Rural Mason Training (RMT) programme which would increase the availability of trained masons leading to faster construction of quality houses.ix.
