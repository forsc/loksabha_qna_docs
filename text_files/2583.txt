ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF FINANCE(SMT. NIRMALA SITHARAMAN)(a) The government is constantly taking various initiatives to encourage investment in the economy, including investment by private sector, which, inter-alia, include measures to improve ease of doing business, comprehensive reforms in the Foreign Direct Investment policy, various facilitation measures under flagship programmes like Make-in-India, Start-up India, reduced corporate tax rate of 25 per cent for companies with turnover up to Rs. 250 crore, launch of a support and outreach program for helping the growth, expansion and facilitation of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises sector, etc. Further, steps taken to boost private sector investment in infrastructure sectors include launching of innovative financial vehicles such as Infrastructure Debt Funds, Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs), Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), mainstreaming of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) across infrastructure sectors through viability gap funding, periodic review of Harmonized Master List of Infrastructure Sub-sectors, and establishment of the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF).  Besides this, a Project Monitoring-Invest India Cell (PMIC) has also been set up for resolving of issues and fast tracking the setting up and expeditious commissioning of large Public, Private and Public-Private Partnership Projects (b) & (c): A comparative statement indicating industry-wise data relating to GFCF for private corporations and households for the years 2014-15 to 2016-17 at current and constant 2011-12 prices, available with National Statistical Office is at Annexure.  The data does not reveal a uniform trend of slowdown in private sector investment across sectors.   The pace of investment on each sector depends on various factors, domestic as well global. However, the overall GFCF for the private sector has steadily increased over the last 3 years.
