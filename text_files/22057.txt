A five year scheme (2016-17 to 2020-21) was approved by State Government for development of Eco-tourism with budgetary allocation of Rs. 56 Crores.  Forest dependent communities were made stakeholders in ecotourism projects and major share of revenue generated from the Eco-tourism projects is given to them as their wages, for recurring expenses of the Nature Camps, infrastructure development, developmental works in villages etc.  Booking for all the Eco-tourism destinations is through a portal www.ecotourodisha.com.
