ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER FOR MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES(SHRI NITIN GADKARI)(a): 	To celebrate the Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Day instituted by United Nations General Assembly, Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises supported an International Convention organized by National Institute of MSME (ni-msme), Hyderabad, an autonomous organization under the Ministry, in association with India SME Forum, Mumbai, on 27.06.2019 at New Delhi on the theme – “Indian MSMEs Global Aspirations”. The objective of the Convention was to boost the competitiveness of Indian MSMEs by apprising them of global trends, best business practices and provide them an opportunity to understand the opportunities in international market.  The Convention was attended by 1385 Indian entrepreneurs and 175 international delegates from different countries.(b) & (c):	Lack of access to latest business skills affects the capability of MSMEs to compete in the global market. In order to enhance the competitiveness and viability of  MSMEs,  the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises implements a number of schemes targeted at providing marketing assistance,  credit support, skill development, technological and quality upgradation.  Further, to provide skilled manpower, access to advanced technology and business advisory services for the MSME Sector, Ministry of MSME is running 18 Technology Centres catering to MSME units across the country.(d)&(e): 	The growth of micro, small and medium enterprises depends on various factors such as access to market, quality of products, availability of timely credit, up-gradation of technology, etc.  For capacity building of Indian MSME Sector, the Government has taken several measures such as implementation of National Manufacturing Competitiveness Programme, adoption of lean manufacturing practices, providing design expertise to enterprises etc. To ease the credit flow to MSMEs, the Government is implementing schemes like Credit Guarantee Trust Fund for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) under which the corpus has been enhanced from Rs.2500 crore to Rs.7500 crore.  Interest subvention of 2% on fresh or incremental loans is being provided to all GST registered MSMEs.  Further, to provide marketing support to micro and small enterprises (MSEs), the Public Procurement Policy mandates 25% of annual procurement from MSEs by the Central Ministries/Departments & CPSEs including 4% from MSEs owned by SC/ST and 3% from Women owned MSEs.
