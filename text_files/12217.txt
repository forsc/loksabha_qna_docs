ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (e) Stubble burning in states like Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and biomass burning in Delhi during the months of October and November, is one of the contributors to the poor air quality in north India specifically in Delhi and NCR.  Other factors like industrial emissions, vehicular emissions, road and soil dust, construction and demolition activities also contribute to it.  Delhi faces the problem of poor air quality particularly during winter months due to local and regional emissions coupled with its unique geography and adverse meteorological conditions. As per, SAFAR portal (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune) the stubble burning was estimated to have contributed between 2% to 44% for PM2.5 levels in Delhi during October- November 2019 and the contribution was more than 30% only for 3 days during the said period. In order to control stubble burning, a new Central Sector Scheme on ‘Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi’ is being administered by Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, with allocation of Central funds to the tune of Rs. 1178.47 Crore.  Under this Scheme, machines and equipment for in-situ crop residue management such as Super Straw Management System (SMS) for Combine Harvesters, Happy Seeders, Hydraulically Reversible MB Plough, Paddy Straw Chopper, Mulcher, Rotary Slasher, Zero Till Seed Drill and Rotavators etc. are provided with 50% subsidy to the individual farmers and 80% subsidy for establishment of “Custom Hiring Centers”. The State Governments during 2018-19 have supplied around 56,290 machines on subsidy for in-situ management of crop residue with similar targets during 2019-20. As a result of continuous efforts in this direction a reduction of about 18.8%  and 31%  in active fire incidences in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh has been recorded  in 2019 over 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The Government of Punjab brought out a scheme for providing compensation @ Rs. 100/-per quintal to small and marginal farmers to manage paddy residue, in-situ, without burning.  The Government of Haryana also brought out a scheme to provide operational charge of Rs. 1000/-per acre for in-situ crop residue management. *****
