                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (e):	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3868 BY SHRI UNMESH BHAIYYASAHEB PATIL TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 11.12.2019 REGARDING ONGOING/PENDING RAILWAY PROJECTS IN MAHARASHTRA(a) to (e):	Presently, 38 projects costing ?73,485 crore for ?5,879 km length falling fully/partly in the State of Maharashtra are under different stage of planning/approval/execution, out of which, 797 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of ?13,172 crore has been incurred upto March, 2019. These include:16 New Line projects covering a length of 2,043 km at a cost of ?38,129 crore, out of which, 63 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of ?3,479 crore has been incurred upto March 2019. An outlay of ?987 crore has been provided for 2019-20.5 Gauge Conversion projects covering a length of 1,135 km at a cost of ?11,102 crore, out of which, 500 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of ?4324 crore has been incurred upto March 2019.  An outlay of ?806 crore has been provided for 2019-20.17 Doubling projects covering a length of 2,701 km at a cost of ?24,255 crore, out of which, 234 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of ?5,369 crore has been incurred upto March 2019. An outlay of ?2,858 crore has been provided for 2019-20.	Survey for new line between Chalisgaon - Aurangabad (93 km) was completed in 2017-18. As per survey report, cost of the project was assessed as `1,689.51 crore with Rate of Return (RoR) (-) 2.23%. In view of negative RoR and poor freight potential, the project could not be taken forwarded.Gauge Conversion of Pachora-Jamner with extension upto Malkapur (84 km) has been included in Budget 2019-20 subject to requisite Government approvals at a cost of ?850 crore.The details of all ongoing and pending (for want of requisite Government approvals) Railway projects falling fully/partly in the State of Maharashtra including project-wise allotment of funds and expenditure are made available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in>Ministry of  Railways>Railway Board>About Indian Railways>Railway Board Directorates>Finance (Budget).Thorough review of throughput enhancement projects has been carried out and with focused approach, the projects have been prioritized into Super Critical, Critical and other throughput enhancement projects.  All out sincere and focused efforts are being made by Railway for quick execution of these projects so as to get early returns to Railway.In order to ensure that projects are completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, Divisional level, Zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and other concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues that are obstructing the progress of projects.Till 2013-14, due to overall limited availability of funds, most of the projects were not progressing satisfactorily. Since 2014-15, based on physical progress of projects, last mile connectivity projects and projects for decongesting the existing routes have been given sufficient funds. For this purpose, funds for capacity enhancement projects have been arranged through institutional financing by tying up loan for `1.5 lakh crore for assured funding of viable projects. Thus, there is no constraint of funds for execution of doubling / 3rd line / 4th line projects.Average annual Budget allocation for Infrastructure projects and Safety works for the projects falling fully/partly in the State of Maharashtra, during 2014-19 has been enhanced to ?4,801 crore per year from ?1,171 crore per year (during 2009-10 to 2013-14). Thus, the average Budget allocation during 2014-19 is 410% of average annual Budget allocation of previous five years (2009-14). Total allocation of Budget for Infrastructure projects and Safety works falling fully/ partly in State of   Maharashtra, in 2019-20 is ?7,281 crore, which is 622% of average annual Budget allocation of 2009-14.During 2009-14, 292 km (111 km of New Line, 135 km of Gauge Conversion and 46 km of Doubling projects) have been commissioned in the State of Maharashtra at an average rate of 58 km per year.During 2014-19, 596 km (87 km of New Line, 92 km of Gauge Conversion and 417 km of Doubling projects) have been commissioned in the State of Maharashtra at an average rate of 119 km per year, which is 204% of commissioning during 2009-14.  To ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects. 	Completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions of working agencies/contractors etc. and all these factors differs from project to project and affects the completion time of the project. As such, firm completion time of the projects cannot be fixed at this stage. *****
