                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a)	Yes Sir. Government has amended the 2014 notifications and extended the jurisdiction of Border Security Force (BSF) in certain States including Punjab vide notification S.O. No. 4196 (E) to 4198 (E) dated 11.10.2021.-2/...-2-LS.US.Q.NO.305 FOR 30.11.2021(b)	Section 139(1) (i) of the BSF Act, 1968 empowers the Central Government to confer powers and duties on members of the force in respect of any Central Acts for the purposes specified therein. (c) to (e) Government of West Bengal  and Government of Punjab have expressed their apprehension that such a move encroaches upon the powers   of the State Government. Their apprehension are ill-founded. The extension of territorial jurisdiction of BSF would result in better and more effective control on trans-border crimes in conjunction and co-operation with State Police. *****
