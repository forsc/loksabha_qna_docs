                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(SHRI PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a) & (b): In the ongoing negotiations on fisheries subsidies in World Trade Organization (WTO), the member countries including India are participating as per the mandate of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDG) target 14.6 and the WTO Ministerial Conference Decision of 2017(MC-11). The scope of ongoing negotiations is limited to marine capture fisheries. Aquaculture and inland fisheries are excluded from the scope of WTO Regulation on Fisheries subsidies. For securing livelihood of our traditional and small-scale fishermen, India is advocating for appropriate and effective special and differential treatment (S&DT) for the developing countries including least developed countries (LDCs) and has sought policy space to develop and modernize its fisheries sector. The WTO Regulation on Fisheries subsidies is still under negotiation. (c):  The Twelfth Ministerial Conference (MC-12) of the WTO scheduled to be held during 30th November to 3rd December, 2021 has been indefinitely postponed in view of the serious epidemiological situation that arose and resultant travel restrictions imposed by the authorities concerned. For MC12, issues of priority include a permanent solution to public stockholding for food security purposes; WTO Response to pandemic, including a temporary waiver from certain provisions of the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS); WTO Reforms; and Fisheries Subsidies Negotiations.   (d) & (e): The Department of Fisheries, Government of India has constituted a Task Force on Fisheries Subsidies regulations, comprising representatives from all the Coastal States and Union Territories, Department of Fisheries (Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying), Department of Commerce (Ministry of Commerce & Industry), Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways, Marine Products Export Development Authority, Coast Guard, Center for WTO Studies, etc. to inter alia examine various proposals being discussed in the WTO and to suggest/formulate any proposals for tabling by India in the WTO for negotiations on fisheries subsidies. *****
