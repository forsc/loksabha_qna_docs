                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)& (b) The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 provides for ensuring ecologically compatible land uses in the tiger reserves and adjoining areas linking one Protected Area or Tiger Reserve with another for addressing the livelihood concerns of local people, so as to provide dispersal habitats and corridors for spill over population of wild animals especially tigers from the designated core areas of Tiger Reserves or from tiger breeding habitats within other Protected Areas. Besides, Section 38 O (1) (g) of the said Act mandates the National Tiger Conservation Authority to ensure that Tiger Reserves and areas linking one Protected Area or Tiger Reserve with another Protected Area or Tiger Reserve are not diverted for ecologically unsustainable uses, except in public interest and with the approval of the National Board for Wild Life and on the advice of the National Tiger Conservation Authority. In compliance of this, the Government of India has identified 32 major tiger corridors at macro level in the country which are codified in the Tiger Conservation Plans mandated for each Tiger Reserve as per section 38 V of the said Act. The Gajah Task Force report had also recognized 88 elephant corridors in the country.(c) 	In context of managing human-animal conflict, the Government of India has advocated an approach to mitigate human-wildlife negative interactions as follows:•	Providing financial assistance for logistics such as rapid response teams, its infrastructure, veterinary infrastructure, compensation and ex-gratia payment. •	Restructuring habitat interventions in Protected Areas vis-e-vis to carrying capacity of wild animals.•	Advisories have been issued dated 24th December, 2014 and 1st June, 2015 in the context of human-wildlife conflict to the Chief Wildlife Wardens of all State Governments/ Union Territory Administrations. In context of elephant, the Gajah Task Force has laid out a set of recommendations for managing conflict which inter-alia  include constitution of anti depredation teams, barriers to movement and removal via capture of problematic animals. ****
