                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):  Yes Sir, during Kharif season  farmers practice rainfed traditional farming  in approximately 80 per cent farming area in Rajasthan. 	        District wise cropped area (hectare) in Churu, Nagaur and Bikaner (2018-19 fourth advance estimate) is as under:- Distt.	Kharif	Rabi	Total Churu, 	1115169	298525	1413694Nagaur 	1226402	286261	1512663Bikaner	1486646	559063	2045709(d) & (e):  There is no proposal  under   consideration of the Government  for providing  minimum support price to organic produce . However, any organic food manufactured, packed, sold, offered for sale, marketed or otherwise distributed in the country is regulated as per the provisions of Food Safety and Standards (Organic Food) Regulations, 2017, which were notified on 29.12.2017 and enforced from 01.07.2018. These regulations require Organic Food to comply with the provisions of National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) or Participatory Guarantee System (PGS). However, to support small original organic producer or Contd…2/--2-producer organisation, those with annual turnover not exceeding 12 lakhs per annum have been exempted from certification through NPOP or PGS. The Organic food covered through these regulations should bear FSSAI organic logo i.e. jaivik Bharat Logo.	To further boost production of organic produce, a dedicated web portal- Jaivikkheti.in- has also been created to connect farmers involved in organic farming with consumers directly for better prices.*******
