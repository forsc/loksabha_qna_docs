ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI KRISHANPAL GURJAR)(a) & (b) Yes,Sir. The Government implements Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS) under which financial assistance is provided to Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) for promoting the welfare of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) in the country, including the State of Uttar Pradesh. A statement indicating State/UT wise number of proposals received and number of proposals sanctioned during the last three years and current year under DDRS, including the State of Uttar Pradesh is at Annexure.(c) & (d) All complete proposals which fulfill the norms of the scheme, received during a financial year, are normally processed in the year itself, subject to the availability of funds.  However, in case of deficiency of documents etc., the proposal is processed and grant is released only after the rectification of the deficiency. Such proposals are then considered in the subsequent years in consonance with the provisions of General Financial Rules.*****
