                                                                     THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                             (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a) to (e):  Since land and urban administration is a State subject,  it is the responsibility of  States/Union  Territories  (UTs)  to Frame appropriate policies and implement mechanisms for development of integrated infrastructure. Government of India through various programmatic interventions assists States/UTs, both technically and financially in their efforts. Government of India launched the Smart Cities Mission (SCM) on 25 June 2015 for development of 100 cities as Smart Cities. Cities under the Mission have taken several steps to address issues related to hazard risk caused by exposed wires and constant digging of multiple trenches in urban areas. These Cities are implementing 776 Smart Road projects worth ? 26,205 crore which include, inter alia, provisions of replacement of overhead wires with underground wiring, creation of utility ducts for common infrastructure to avoid multiple trenching etc. Besides, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation & Urban Transformation (AMRUT) empowers States to design, prioritize, approve, and implement projects in Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) based on their local priorities. Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs (MoHUA) approves State Annual Action Plans (SAAPs) submitted to it by State High Powered Steering Committees (SHPSCs).  States may choose to incorporate laying of integrated underground utility ducts in the projects undertaken by them under their SAAPs.                                   *****
