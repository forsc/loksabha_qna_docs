                                                        MINISTER OF TOURISM 			        (SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) to (c):	Tourism sector is a major engine of economic growth of the country including the Union Territory (UT) of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K).The tourism industry in the country including UT of J&K, has been affected due to lock down, suspension of regular international flights and tourist visas on account of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, domestic tourism in the country including the UT of J&K is showing signs of recovery. As per inputs of Ministry of External Affairs, Indian Missions/Posts abroad regularly keeps foreign interlocutors briefed about political, social and developmental endeavours in the UT of Jammu & Kashmir, and its positive impact on the people, economy and tourism. Tourism promotion, including of Jammu & Kashmir is part of activities carried out by Missions/Posts.(d):	The promotion of tourist destinations and products is primarily the responsibility of the concerned State Governments /Union Territory Administrations. However, the Ministry of Tourism (MoT) promotes India as a holistic destination in the tourism generating markets to promote various Indian tourism products and to increase India’s share of the global tourism market. MoT has been regularly organising webinars under the Dekho Apna Desh campaign to create awareness among domestic travellers and encourage them to explore the various tourist destinations/products in the country including UT of J&K. MoT in association with the Tourism Department of J&K, Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce & Industries (FICCI) and the Indian Golf Tourism Association (IGTA) organized a three day event, titled “Tapping the Potential of Kashmir: Another Day in Paradise” from April 11-13, 2021 in Srinagar. The objective of the event was to showcase the various tourism products of the UT of J&K and promote it as a destination for leisure, Adventure, Eco, Wedding and MICE Tourism. In addition, promotion of tourism in the UT of J&K is also undertaken through MoT’s website, Social Media handles, various promotional activities through the India Tourism offices overseas, etc.MoT has recognised the immense potential of Rural Tourism in the country, and has been actively working on development and promotion of this niche area of tourism. MoT under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme has identified rural circuit as one of the thematic circuit for development and leveraging tourism as a force multiplier for revitalizing the rural economy and for giving both domestic and international tourists glimpse of the rural aspects of the country. The projects for development under the circuit are identified in consultation with the State Governments/UT Administrations and are sanctioned subject to availability of funds, submission of suitable detailed project reports, adherence to scheme guidelines and utilization of funds released earlier.*******
