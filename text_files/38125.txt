ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c):  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal Ministry for specification of a community as Scheduled Tribes under Article 342 of the Constitution of India. Article 366 (25) of the Constitution of India refers to Scheduled Tribes as those communities who are scheduled in accordance with Article 342 of the Constitution.  Article 342 prescribes the procedure to be followed in the matter of specification of Scheduled Tribes. In this regard, the Government of India on 15-6-1999 (further amended on 25-6-2002), has laid down the modalities for determining the claims for inclusion in, exclusion from and other modifications in the Orders specifying lists for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. According to these modalities, only those proposals which have been recommended and justified by the concerned State Government and concurred with by the Registrar General of India (RGI) and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) are to be considered for amendment of legislation. All actions are taken as per these approved modalities. *****
