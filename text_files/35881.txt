                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b):  The Ministry has commissioned several impact evaluation studies to understand the overall impact of the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM). An impact evaluation study of DAY-NRLM was conducted during 2019-20 -2020-21 by the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) with the support of the World Bank. The assessment covered 9 States with around 27,000 respondents and 5,000 SHGs across Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The evaluation indicates that an additional exposure to the Mission for 2.5 years led to:i.	Increase in income by 19% over the base amount. ii.	Decline in share of informal loans by 20% iii.	Increase in savings  by 28% iv.	Improved labour force participation - proportion of females reporting secondary occupation is higher (4%) in treatment areas.v.	Improved access to other Schemes - Significant increase in number of social schemes availed by treatment households (6.5% higher over the base value of 2.8 schemes).The study provided encouraging evidence to suggest that the program has positive impacts on livestock assets, income and savings etc. The total number of households mobilized into Self Help Groups along with the Capitalization support provided and bank loan to SHGs in Haryana (including Rohtak district) and Madhya Pradesh (including Chhatarpur district) during the last three Financial Years (From FY 2019-20 to 2021-22 ) is as follows:                                 Progress in HaryanaIndicators	        2019-20	                2020-21	                 2021-22 (up to Feb’22)	              Haryana	 Rohtak      Haryana	Rohtak	           Haryana	RohtakNo. of Households Mobilized	      139943	  3355	      57136	 1400	           44675	1241No. of SHGs promoted	       13087	   322	       5548	  133	            4314	 120Capitalization Support provided (amount in Rs Lakh)	2200.88	   281.30      2522.23	 275.60	           2288.54	 204.20Bank Loans disbursed to SHGs (amount in Rs Lakh)	        7998.01	  585.47     13765.84	 1125.77	  19722.98	 1084.46 Progress in Madhya PradeshIndicators	              2019-20	             2020-21	           2021-22 (up to Feb’22)	                 M.P	Chhatarpur	  M.P	Chhatarpur	 M.P	 ChhatarpurNo. of Households Mobilized	        474646	   2385	       440935	  9742	       329787	      2961No. of SHGs promoted	 43753	   209	        40104	   896	        28966	      279Capitalization Support provided (amount in Rs Lakh)	         9439.14   49.07	13243.95  128.39        13787.12      107.36Bank Loans disbursed to SHGs (amount in Rs Lakh)	        30285.29  210.76	50993.73  202.85	114139.85    1054.90*Constituency-wise data is not being maintained**Source of data MIS portal of DAY-NRLM(c) 	Does not arise.  *****
