ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY ANDCONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) There are over 926 rake points on Indian Railways distributed all over the country which have the necessary infrastructure for handling fertilizers.  A list giving state-wise distribution of fertilizer rake points is appended as Appendix-I.(b) Creation or strengthening of infrastructure at existing fertilizer rake points in the country is a need based ongoing process subject to operational and technical feasibility along with resource availability. For creating infrastructure, specific works are sanctioned in the Budget and funded through the Railways’ Annual Capital Expenditure. In the last three years, infrastructure has been created at various rake points by sanctioning 60 such works in the budget at a cost of `1975 Cr.. The details of fund allocated, released and utilized in the last three years state-wise are appended as Appendix-II.  Allocations are usually made in the beginning of the financial year which are subject to change and there is a established practice of re-appropriation of funds from one plan head to another depending on the priority of work. The amount spent in creation of infrastructure in the last three years is much higher in comparison to allocation over the three years which clearly indicates that Indian Railways gives high priority to creation of infrastructure and development of its freight terminals.(c) No, Sir.  Transportation of fertilizers is done by Railways as per requirement of Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers. There has been no report from Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers that supply of fertilizers and its distribution has been affected due to non-availability and poor infrastructure at rake points.(d) As and when proposals for new rake points are received from the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers for the year 2021-2022, the same shall be considered by the Ministry of Railways based on operational and technical feasibility.*****
