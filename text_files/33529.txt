The financial benefits are released to the beneficiaries on the basis of correct and verified data of farmers prepared and uploaded by respective State/UT Governments on the PM-KISAN web-portal. The data uploaded by States/UTs goes through verifications at the level of PM-KISAN portal, PFMS portal, and the IT database. The data rejected at any of these verification levels is sent back to States/UTs for corrections. For the data that passes all verifications, the States/UTs are requested to sign the Request for Transfer (RFT) for their respective States.  The RFTs are signed by the State Nodal Officers (SNOs) and uploaded on the portal.  This bulk data is again sent to PFMS for generation of Fund Transfer Order (FTO) post which the funds are directly transferred into the bank accounts of beneficiaries through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode.Government has taken steps to weed out any ineligible beneficiaries registered under the PM-KISAN scheme. As per the provision of the Scheme, benefits passed to ineligible farmers are liable to be recovered. The concerned States/UT authorities are in the process of recovering money from these individuals and so far a total of 47,43,806 ineligible farmers have been identified who have received benefits under the Scheme and an amount of Rs. 296.63 Crore has been recovered from such ineligible farmers. On account of fraudulent registrations in respect of few states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Gujarat, FIR has been lodged against miscreants and recovery of funds from these individuals is under process.
