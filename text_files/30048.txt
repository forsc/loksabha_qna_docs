                                                        ):   The state-wise data on e-waste collected and processed since Financial Year (FY) 2016-17 to FY 2020-21, based on annual reports submitted by 35 State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/ Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) to CPCB, is attached at Annexure-I. (b):   Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) is the policy maker for management of e-waste in the country, and has notified the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/ Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) are the regulating agencies. Under the Rules, producers and their service providers, dismantlers, recyclers, refurbishers are responsible for collection of e-waste.  SPCBs/ PCCs provide information on e-waste collected and processed in their respective States/UT to CPCB. (c):     E-waste, as such, when collected and stored in safe and secured manner does not cause any harm or adverse effects on the health and environment within the prescribed guidelines issued by MoEF&CC.
