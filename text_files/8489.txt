ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (c)	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.	 STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (c) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 183 TO BE ANSWERED ON 02.12.2019 ASKED BY SHRI PATEL HASMUKHBHAI SOMABHAI, MP REGARDING ‘UNIFORM SYLLABUS’.(a)	The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), developed by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), sets the guidelines and direction for the development of syllabi and textbooks at all the school stages. Based on the NCF, NCERT has developed model syllabi and textbooks across different stages of schooling.However, education is a subject in the Concurrent List of the Constitution and a substantial majority of schools are under the jurisdiction of the State Governments, it is for the respective State/ Union Territory Governments to decide about the syllabus and curriculum for their schools.   Therefore, the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERTs) and State Education Boards either adopt or adapt NCERT’s model syllabi and textbooks or develop their own syllabi and textbooks based on NCF, so as to suit the State-specific needs, and to cater to the diversity in the country across States in culture, language and topography.  The Ministry of Human Resource Development has set up only two National level Education Boards, namely, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS).  The Education Boards in the States/UTs are set up or recognized by the concerned State/UT in terms of their Act, Regulations, instructions, etc., made for the purpose. (b) & (c)	As mentioned at (a) above, the NCF, developed by the NCERT, sets the guidelines and direction for the development of syllabi and textbooks at all the school stages.   The common core of NCF includes the history of India’s freedom movement, the constitutional obligations. These elements cut across subject areas and need to be designed to promote values such as India’s common cultural heritage, egalitarianism, democracy and secularism, equality of sex, protection of environment, removal of social barriers and inculcation of scientific temper.
