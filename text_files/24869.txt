The Act also has provisions to prevent and control overcharging by hospitals/Nursing Homes. In the States/UTs, where the said Act is applicable, among other conditions, the clinical establishments, shall ensure compliance of Standard Treatment Guidelines as may be determined and issued by the Central or State Government, as the case may be, from time to time and display the rates charged for each type of service provided and facilities available in the local as well as in English language, at a conspicuous place for the benefit of the patients. The Central Government has also approved a standard list of medical procedures and a standard template for costing which has been shared with all States and UTs, where the Act is applicable, for appropriate action by them.  The Act further provides for a registering authority in each district, which is empowered to conduct inquiry in case of violation of the provisions of the Act and take necessary action including imposing penalties and cancellation of registration, if applicable.
