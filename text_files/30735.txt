                                                        The Finance Minister(a) to (e) : A statement is laid on the table of the house.STATEMENT AS REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION No. *201 FOR ANSWER ON 13th DECEMBER, 2021 REGARDING ‘SHORTAGE OF BANK STAFF’ TABLED BY SHRI ANUMULA REVANTH REDDY, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT.(a) to (e): No, sir. As per inputs received from Public Sector Banks, as on 1.12.2021, 95% staff is in position against the sanctioned staff strength. The small proportion of vacancies is substantially attributable to attrition on account of superannuation and other usual factors. As on 1.12.2021, there are 8,05,986 sanctioned posts and 41,177 vacant posts in Public Sector Banks, details of which are at Annexe. No post/vacancy has been abolished during last six years in all Public Sector Banks except one (01) post in Punjab & Sind Bank in 2016. Banks undertake staff recruitment to fill vacancies on ongoing basis as per their requirement.***Annexe referred to in reply to part-(c) of the Lok Sabha Starred Question No. *201, for answer on 13.12.2021ANNEXEBank	Sanctioned Posts	Vacant Posts	Officer	Clerk	Sub-staff	Officer	Clerk	Sub-staffBank of India	28664	19831	8100	3448	0	1400Bank of Baroda	42243	27725	9532	15	0	0Bank of Maharashtra	6768	4009	2221	190	0	0Central Bank of India	20039	10358	6771	3528	1726	1041Canara Bank	52061	24609	12446	761	564	0Indian Bank	25214	14221	4001	733	1412	0Indian Overseas Bank	12556	7961	2077	1242	2058	1812Punjab National Bank	53694	30990	20005	1210	716	4817Punjab & Sind Bank	7414	2309	1672	728	407	0State Bank of India	115998	96985	34530	3423	5121	0UCO Bank	13184	7901	4195	1078	1336	1313Union Bank of India	42119	25014	8569	1024	0	74TOTAL	805986	41177Source: Public Sector Banks
