ANSWER




                                                        Yes, Sir.   Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY) took cognizance of the WhatsApp announcement of its new Privacy Policy stated to be applicable to Indian users from February 2021. To safeguard the interest of Indian users, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has asked WhatsApp to review the proposed privacy policy changes and also to explain the rationale of the same.WhatsApp in its public blog dated 15.01.2021 has stated that it has extended the date of implementation of privacy policy change to 15.05.2021. (b):   A petition has been filed by Confederation of All India Traders before the Hon’ble Supreme Court to issue a writ of Mandamus directing the Union of India to lay down guidelines in exercise of its powers of the Information Technology Act and under Constitution of India to ensure that WhatsApp does not share any data of its users with any third party or Facebook and its companies for any purpose whatsoever. The case has been disposed off as the petition was withdrawn.*******
