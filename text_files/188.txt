The criteria/norms of standard level water pollution for major rivers are generally based on Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)levels, a key indicator of organic pollution. These criteria have been categorized into five priority classes based on BOD concentration (viz. Category I: exceeding to BOD levels >30 mg/l; Category II: BOD between 20&30 mg/l; Category III: BOD between 10&20mg/l; Category IV: BOD between 6-10 mg/l, and Category V: BOD between 3& 6 mg/l).As per the report published by CPCB, in September 2018, the 351 rivers stretches on 323 rivers are identified as polluted river stretches, based on the Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) level. The State-wise details of polluted river stretches are at Annexure.(d) & (e)	As per the information provided by CPCB, the details of the public complaints received against sugar and various industrial sectors for the last three and current year is provided as below;S.

CPCB has issued directions under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 on the basis of inspections reports. (f)To ensure proper treatment of municipal sewage before discharge into the rivers, CPCB has issued directions under Section 18 1(b) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 in April, 2015 to all the SPCBs/Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) in the country, regarding setting up of sewage treatment plants in their respective States. CPCB has also issued directions from time to time to municipal authorities under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for proper treatment and disposal of sewage generated to control pollution in rivers. To control discharge of industrial effluents, CPCB and respective SPCBs/ PCCs monitor industries with respect to effluents discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. To improve the monitoring of compliance, directions have been issued to specific industries to install online 24x7 effluent monitoring devices. *****
