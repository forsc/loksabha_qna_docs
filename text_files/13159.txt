ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	The estimated number of farmers targeted to reach out for benefit under PM Kisan Saman Nidhi Yojana based on Agri Census 2015-16 is about 14 crore.(b):	Budget Allocation of Rs.75000 crore has been made in the current financial year 2019-2020 under PM Kisan Saman Nidhi Yojana.(c):	A statement of farmers benefitted under PM Kisan Scheme, gender and State-wise is at Annexure.(d):	Registration of farmers for this scheme and subsequent installment-wise transfer of benefits to them is a continuous and ongoing process.The transfer of benefits to the identified eligible beneficiaries takes place as and when their correct and verified data are uploaded by the concerned State / UT Governments on PM-Kisan web-portal www.pmkisan.gov.in.The data of beneficiaries   uploaded by the State / UT Governments undergoes a multi-level verification and validation by various concerned agencies, including the banks, which includes rejection of data for errors at various levels and re-uploading of error-free data by the State / UT Governments. Thereafter only the amount is transferred into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. This entire process is replicated for transfer of every installment.The reasons for non-payment of benefits to the eligible farmer families include mismatch of names in land records and Aadhaar Cards, failure in Account validation at the PFMS level due to reasons like wrong Account number, wrong IFSC etc. To release benefits to these farmer families, the State/UT Governments have been requested to furnish corrected data. In addition, the facility of Aadhaar correction by the beneficiary has been provided on the PM-KISAN portal and for this purpose, Common Service Centres (CSCs) have also been authorized to make corrections.
