Whether the levy of differential tax rates on lottery i.e. @ 12% on State-run lottery and @ 28% on lottery authorised by a State was violative of Article 304 of the Indian Constitution, andb. Whether or not Place of supply Rules of lottery, if made from one state to another through two distributors, one located in organising state and another in consuming state, with distributor in the consuming state having no direct link with or responsibility towards discharge of non-tax revenue to the organizing state, would be ultra vires of the Lotteries (Regulation) Act, 1998.*****
