Dial 108 is predominantly an emergency response system, primarily designed to attend to patients of critical care, trauma and accident victims etc. Dial 102 services essentially consist of basic patient transport aimed to cater the needs of pregnant women and children, though other categories are also taking benefit and are not excluded. Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakaram (JSSK) entitlements e.g. free transfer from home to facility, inter facility transfer in case of referral and drop back for mother and children are the key focus of 102 service.An ALS is supported for an average population of 5 Lakh and a BLS Ambulance is supported for over one lakh population. States are at liberty to propose the number of ambulances as per the norm to fill the gap. Total of 27,810 vehicles (which includes 12,053 ambulances under 108 Dial, 10,633 ambulances under 102 Dial and 5,124 Other patients transport vehicle) are supported in various States/ UTs as reported by States/ UTs (as on 30.09.2021).
