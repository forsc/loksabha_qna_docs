Upgradation and replacement of equipments in use over Indian Railways is a continuous process and is undertaken based on its condition, operational needs and availability of resources. The details of modernisation of Railway Signalling implemented in last two year viz financial years 2019-20 & 2020-21 and up to Oct’ 2021 are as follows: (i)	Electrical/ Electronic Interlocking: Total 356 Stations commissioned during the period taking total no of installations to 6242 Stations as on 31.10.2021. (ii)	Block Proving Axle counter (BPAC): Total 504 Block Sections commissioned taking total no of installations to 5867 Block Sections as on 31.10.2021.(iii)	Automatic Block Signalling (ABS): Total 466 Route km installations commissioned taking total no of installations to 3505 Route km as on 31.10.2021.(iv)	Intermediate Block Signal (IBS): Total 75 IBS commissioned taking total no of installations to 649 IBS as on 31.10.2021.(v)	KAVACH: Total 677 Route km commissioned taking total no of installations to 927 Route km as on 31.10.2021.(b)	To provide additional facilities to travelling passengers, increase in frequency of train services, which is an on-going process on Indian Railway, is done keeping in view operational feasibility, traffic demand and availability of resources etc.(c)	Railway network straddles across the State boundaries, as such Indian Railways neither operates nor increases the speed of train services on state-wise basis.
