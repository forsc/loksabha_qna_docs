According to “A Statistical Analysis of Child Marriage in India based on Census 2011”, prepared by Young Lives and the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), girls aged 15 to 19 years are twice more likely than older women to die from childbirth and pregnancy.  (d) & (e): The Government has introduced a Bill namely ''the Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2021 in the Parliament on 21.12.2021 for raising the age of marriage of women to 21 years to make it at par with the men and also to make consequential amendments in the enactments, inter alia, relating to age of marriage of parties, such as the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872, the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936, the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937, the Special Marriage Act, 1954, the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, and the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969.   *****Annexure-I ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) TO THE LOK SABHA UN-STARRED QUESTION NO. 5047 FOR ANSWER ON 01.04.2022 ASKED BY SHRI PARVESH SAHIB SINGH VERMA “CHILD MARRIAGE”  STATE-WISE AND YEAR-WISE NUMBER OF CASES OF CHILD MARRIAGE REPORTED DURING LAST THREE YEARS Sl.
