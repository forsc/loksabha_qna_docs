ANSWER




(a) The Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing the Swadhar Greh Scheme revised with effect from 1st April 2016. The Scheme caters to primary needs of women in difficult circumstances – women and girls rendered homeless due to family discord, crime, violence, mental stress, social ostracism or are being forced into prostitution and are in moral danger. Through the provisions of shelter, food, clothing, counseling, training, clinical and legal aid, the Scheme aims to rehabilitate such women in difficult circumstance economically and emotionally. Details of State-wise funds allocated and spent under the scheme during the last two years including Odisha are at Annexure-I.(b) to (d) Swadhar Greh Scheme envisages monitoring of the implementation of the scheme at District, State and Central level. Swadhar Grehs are monitored by a District Monitoring Committee where at least two members are women. District committee meets at least once in a quarter. Monitoring committee at State level meets at least twice a year and monitors the projects. Continuation of grant to any agency depends on the satisfactory performance as assessed by the State/UT level committee. Ministry of Women and Child Development also reviews the functioning of the Swadhar Greh at regular intervals with the State Government/ UT Administration. As per scheme guidelines, in case of unlawful activities including sexual, mental and physical harassment of inmate by the members of management and staff, the grant will be stopped and blacklisting of the implementing agency will be done without prejudice to criminal action. Data on the number of complaints received and disposed off is not maintained at the Central level.******Annexure-IAnnexure referred to in reply of part (a) of Lok Sabha Un-starred Question No. 4934 for 01.04.2022 regarding Redressal Mechanism under Swadhar Greh Scheme.
