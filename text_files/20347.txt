                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)	The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) had identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component & 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). The details of above river linking projects viz. Rivers, States concerned is given at Annexure. (b) & (c) Under the NPP, it is proposed to link Ganga to Cauvery river through a series of links viz., Ganga (Farakka)-Damodar-Subernarekha, Subernarekha-Mahanadi of Himalayan Component and Mahanadi-Godavari-Krishna-Pennar-Cauvery link system under Peninsular Component. The proposal envisages diversion of surplus waters to be delivered by the preceding Manas-Sankosh-Teesta-Ganga(MSTG) link upstream of Farakka barrage through Ganga-Damodar-Subernarekha link and further south. NWDA has completed the draft feasibility reports of Ganga(Farakka)-Damodar-Subernarekha, Subernarekha-Mahanadi links and circulated among party States in July 2020. The feasibility reports of the links viz., Mahanadi-Godavari, Godavari-Krishna, Krishna-Pennar, Pennar-Palar-Cauvery link projects have also been completed and circulated to party States. Moreover, alternate study to divert unutilized waters of Indravati sub-basin of Godavari basin has been carried out and the draft DPR of Godavari-Cauvery link project consisting of three links viz; Godavari (Inchampalli/Janampet) – Krishna (Nagarjunasagar), Krishna (Nagarjunasagar) – Pennar (Somasila), Pennar (Somasila)-Cauvery (Grand Anicut) link projects has been prepared and circulated to party States in March 2019 by NWDA.(d) & (e) The eighteenth meeting of the “Special Committee on Interlinking of Rivers” (SCILR) was held on 07.12.2020. In the meeting, various issues including the status of priority links under NPP, status of proposals of various intra-state link with NWDA, status of works of sub-Committees constituted to assist SCILR were discussed. The suggestions of the State Governments were also discussed for implementation of ILR programme. As a follow up, matter of Par-Tapi-Narmada link project has been discussed in the Sub-Committee – IV meeting held on 10.12.2020. Also, the status of intra-State links of Bihar State have been reviewed in the meeting held on 28.01.2021 by NWDA with Government of Bihar.*****ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1644 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 11.02.2021 REGARDING “INTER-LINKING OF RIVERS”.Names of Inter Basin Water Transfer Links, the States involved, name of rivers and status of Feasibility Reports/Detailed Project ReportSl.
