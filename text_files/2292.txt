ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FORJAL SHAKTI(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)to (c) Under centrally sponsored National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), the norm for providing safe drinking water in rural areas is 40 litre per capita per day (lpcd). As reported by States on Integrated Management Information System (IMIS), 76.25% rural population are getting safe drinking water as per norms and 19.77 percent of rural population is getting safe drinking water lesser than the norm . Further, State Governments have been given the flexibility to adopt their own higher service delivery norms based on water availability, demand and funds available.Water supply is a state subject.It is the State Governments who plan, design, approve, execute and operate & maintain the schemes for providing safe drinking water to rural population. The Ministry provides technical and financial assistance to States including Rajasthan under NRDWP for improving the coverage of safe drinking water in rural areas. (d) Under NRDWP, the delivery mechanism of rural drinking water supply has been institutionalized at State, District and Village / Panchayat level and emphasis is laid on decentralized approach. The aim has been to create awareness among rural people and to enhance the capacity of Panchayati Raj Institutions / Local Bodies/ Village Water and Sanitation Committee (VWSC) /Gram Panchayat Water and Sanitation Committee (GPWSC) with the objective of enabling them to take up planning, implementation and operation and maintenance activities related to rural water supply systems. For this, States may utilize up to 5 % of NRDWP funds under Support component. In addition, States may utilize enhanced devolution of funds under 14th Finance Commission to improve basic facilities in rural areas including drinking water.
