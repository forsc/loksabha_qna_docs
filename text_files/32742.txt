ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) to (c): Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)- UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21-10-2016 to stimulate regional air connectivity from unserved/ underserved airports in the country and making air travel affordable to the masses. Under RCS - UDAN, 948 valid routes have been awarded, of which, 403 Routes connecting 65 unserved and underserved airports including 8 Heliports & 2 Water Aerodromes have been operationalized. UDAN has transformed the way people travel in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. Regional airports like Jharsuguda, Kishangarh, Belgaum, Darbhanga, etc. have been witnessing  exponential growth in air traffic. The linkage between the Civil Aviation Sector and Economic Growth is well recognized. International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) study shows that the air connectivity has an economic multiplier of 3.1 and employment multiplier of 6.1. RCS - UDAN is an ongoing scheme where bidding rounds are conducted periodically for covering more destinations/stations and routes under the scheme.(d) & (e):  UDAN is a market demand driven Scheme. Interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes, submit their proposals at the time of bidding under UDAN. Airports Authority of India(AAI), the Implementing Agency, has identified Nagarjuna Sagar (Water Aerodrome) in Telangana for seaplane operations under UDAN. Kadapa, Kurnool and Prakasam Barrage (Water Aerodrome)  have been identified  in  Andhra Pradesh under the Scheme. Selected Airline Operators(SAOs) have commenced operations from Kadapa & Kurnool airports under UDAN. (f): Under the UDAN Scheme, an indicative airfare of Rs. 2500/- per passenger indexed to inflation for a distance of 500 km to 600 km for UDAN seats on RCS routes (equivalent about 1 hour of flight) has been fixed.
