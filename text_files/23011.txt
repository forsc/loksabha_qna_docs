                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b): All States and UTs across country are being supplied with COVID-19 vaccines as per the target beneficiary load. Once a vial of COVID-19 vaccine is opened the same has to be used within 4 hours. To ensure that full doses of COVID- 19 vaccines are utilized once a vial is opened, the states/UTs have been guided to efficiently plan vaccination sessions in multiples of vaccine doses per vial. Also, the vaccinators have been trained to optimally utilize the vaccine doses and reduce wastage.
