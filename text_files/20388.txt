ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation(now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the Peninsular component of NPP for water resources development, the following three link projects have been conceived as passing near the Kolar district of Karnataka State:i.	Krishna (Almatti) – Pennar link;ii.	Pennar-Palar-Cauvery (part of Godavari – Cauvery link); andiii.	Krishna (Srisailam)-Pennar link. NWDA has completed the Pre-feasibility and Feasibility Reports of these links and sent to the party States.  The draft DPR of Godavari-Cauvery link project has also been completed in which the Pennar-Palar-Cauvery link project is an integral part and has been sent to Party States. (b) & (c) The Ministry of Jal Shakti has received a representation from Shri S. Muniswamy, Hon’ble Member of Parliament regarding linking of Palar-Pennar and Krishna River Basins to address water scarcity problem in Kolar district of Karnataka. Taking into account the study conducted by NWDA under NPP, three links passing near the Kolar district are mentioned above. Out of these, the nearest link to Kolar district is Krishna (Almatti) – Pennar link. The Krishna (Almatti) – Pennar link is conceived for diversion of a part of Krishna waters from Almatti reservoir to the Pennar river in partial exchange to the surplus water of Mahanadi and Godavari rivers proposed to be brought to the Krishna basin. The supply of water from this link to Kolar district will involve a lift of around 400m. Regarding the drinking water requirement of Kolar district from this link, the proposed irrigation requirement in Middle Krishna, Tungbhadra and Vedavati sub-basins in Karnataka State from the link will have to be reduced appropriately to make up for the drinking water supply of 6.7 TMC (190Mm3) to Kolar district. However, this diversion also depends on diversion from Mahanadi- Godavari and Manas-Sankosh-Teesta-Ganga links.*****
