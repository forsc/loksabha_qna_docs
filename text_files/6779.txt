                                                        ???????? ??? ?????? ?????? (???? ????? ????) THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI  PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) & (b):	The pilot phase report of Industrial Park Rating System (IPRS) considered nominations received from States/ UTs. Nominated parks needed to have minimum 25% occupancy.177 parks out of the 202 nominated parks were considered for assessment. Response in respect of 25 parks nominated by States/UTs was incomplete. The State/UTs wise distribution of 177 industrial parks is given at Annexure – I.     	These 177 industrial parks were assessed across 34 parameters under four pillars contributing to the development of industrial ecosystem viz., Internal Infrastructure and Utilities, External Infrastructure and Connectivity, Business Support Services & Facilities and Environment & Safety Management. The details of 34 parameters considered for assessment are given at Annexure-II.  (c): 	The World Bank’s Doing Business Report does not assess Industrial Parks.  However, improvement of infrastructure and facilities in industrial parks have positive impact on the overall business environment in the country.     (d): 	Industrial Park Rating System is being translated into an annual exercise with wider coverage of industrial parks assessment across parameters relating to the development of industrial ecosystem. The parameters will be updated to address ongoing investor expectation trends and to bring in deeper qualitative assessment feedback including technological intervention in order to develop Industrial Park Rating System as a tool that enables demand driven interventions both by policy makers and investors effectively. **********
