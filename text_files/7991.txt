                                                        Statement referred to in reply to parts (a) to (e) of Lok Sabha *Starred Question No.*152 for 28.11.2019 raised by Dr. Bharati Pravin Pawar & Shrimati Darshana Vikram Jardosh, Hon’ble M.Ps on “Development of Inland Waterways”  (a) to (c)   Yes, Sir.  To promote inland water transport in the country as an economical, environment friendly supplementary mode of transport to rail and road, 111 inland waterways (including 5 National Waterways declared earlier) were declared as ‘National Waterways’ under the National Waterways Act, 2016 as per details at Annex.-1.   The details of works initiated on national waterways are as given below. National Waterway (NW)-1 (Ganga-Bhagirathi-Hooghly river system from Allahabad to Haldia), NW-2 (River Brahmaputra from Dhubri to Sadiya), NW-3 (West Coast Canal from Kottapuram to Kollam along with Udyogmandal and Champakara Canals) have been developed with fairway navigational aids, jetties and terminals with mechanized equipment handling facilities for loading and unloading of cargo.   These NWs are operational and vessels are plying on them.   In addition, NW-10 (River Amba), NW-68 (River Mandovi), NW-73 (River Narmada), NW-83 (Rajpuri Creek), NW-85 (Revadanda Creek-Kundalika River System), NW-91 (Shastri river–Jaigad creek system), NW-97 (Sunderbans Waterways), NW-100 (River Tapi) and NW-111 (River Zuari) are also operational. The Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) is being implemented at an estimated cost of Rs. 5369.18 crore for capacity augmentation of navigation on the Haldia–Varanasi stretch of NW-1 with the technical and financial assistance of the World Bank.   Projects worth Rs. 1800 crore (approx.) have commenced on ground in a time period of three years after statutory clearances. Fairway development works on the Vijayawada–Muktyala stretch of river Krishna (Part of NW-4) has commenced at a cost of Rs. 96 crore. Based on the outcome of techno-economic feasibility and Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) prepared for 106 new NWs, technical interventions have been planned for safe navigation and shipping on technically viable NWs by the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI).   As per the DPRs completed so far for the new NWs, 36 NWs have been found to be technically viable and development activities have been initiated on 10 NWs viz. NW-9, NW-16, NW-27, NW-37, NW-40, NW-58, NW-68, NW-86, NW-97 and NW-111.(d)   Under the Inland Waterways Authority of India Act, 1985, IWAI is mandated for regulation and development of inland waterways for the purpose of shipping and navigation.   In pursuit of this objective, interventions are carried out by IWAI to facilitate cargo movement on National Waterways as per feasibility study and Detailed Project Report (DPR).   Besides, it also develops infrastructure facilities for Ro-Ro, Ro-Pax and river cruise across National Waterways, the details of which are at Annex-2.(e)    No such proposal is under consideration.Annex-1List of 111 National Waterways under the National Waterways Act, 2016 enforced on 12.04.2016)<pre>Sl.
