                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	& (b) With a view to combat vehicular pollution,  following measures have been initiated by the Central Government.•	BS-VI emissions standard have been notified for adoption throughout the country from 01st April, 2020.  •	To promote electric vehicles, Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) -2 scheme has been rolled out with an outlay of Rs 10000 crore for 3 years.•	Streamlining the issuance of Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificates.•	Expansion of  Public Transport network through Rail, Metros, etc.•	Introduction of RFID ‘Fast tags’ on Expressways to avoid congestion at Toll Plazas.•	Proliferation of cleaner fuels such as CNG. (c) Other initiatives taken by the Central Government include leapfrogging from BS-IV to BS-VI fuel standards by 1st April, 2020 for the entire country. There would be an expected   50% reduction in PM due to BS-VI as compared to BS-IV fuels.  BS VI fuel has 5 times less sulfur content (10 ppm) as compare to BS IV fuel (50 ppm) which will help in reducing emissions from vehicles. Hydrocarbon emissions are expected to be reduced by 72% in BS-VI (0.13 g/kwh) compared to BS-IV (0.46 g/kwh) in diesel based Heavy Duty Vehicles.  (d) & (e) The Government is promoting Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme with the broader objectives of reducing import dependency, promote employment generation, better remuneration to farmers and address environmental issues. Under the EBP Programme implemented through Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs), Public Sector OMCs are selling up to 10% ethanol blended petrol. To promote the ethanol blending with fuel, the Government has notified the National Policy on Biofuels-2018 which indicates the target of 20% blending of ethanol in petrol by 2030.******
