                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):   The data regarding number of people who died due to unavailability of organs is not maintained by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.(b) & (c):  There are many reasons hampering organ donation in the country including lack of knowledge, awareness and infrastructure.(d):    All the States in the country are yet to adopt the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues (Amendment) Act, 2011, are  yet to link up with the National Registry which compiles data of organ transplants in the country.  However, the annual estimated need for kidney transplants and the annual number of kidney transplants done are two lakh and 8,000-10,000 respectively. Contd……-2-(e):   To improve access to the transplantation for needy patients by promoting deceased organ donation, the Government is implementing National Organ Transplant Programme (NOTP). Under this programme, an apex level National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO) at New Delhi and Five Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organizations (ROTTOs) at Chandigarh, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Guwahati have been set up. The Government has released funds to establish State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organizations (SOTTOs) in the States of Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan, Haryana, Goa, Jammu & Kashmir, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh to organize an efficient mechanism for organ and tissue procurement/retrieval to promote deceased organ and tissue donation. National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO), Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organizations (ROTTOs) and State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organizations (SOTTOs) are disseminating relevant information to all concerned. A 24x7 call centre with a toll free helpline number (1800114770) has been made operational. A number of activities, for generating awareness and for imparting training to all those associated with transplant activities including doctors and transplant coordinators, such as celebration of Indian Organ Donation Day every year, seminars, workshops, debates, sports events, walkathons, participation in marathons, nukkad Natak, etc. are organized at different places in the country. Audio-visual messages to promote cadaver organ donation are also telecast on Doordarshan and other television channels.
