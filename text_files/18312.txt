ANSWER




                                                        (a)	: As per Census 2001 and 2011, the slum population has reduced in the cities of Delhi and Mumbai. However, in Chennai, the slum population has increased over the period. Such increase of slum population is attributed to agglomeration of nearby towns with Chennai Municipal Corporation, leading to increase in municipal area.The details of number of slum population for cities of Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai are given below: Name of City 	                     Year of Census 	                          2001	                          2011Delhi 	                       18,51,231	                  17,85,390Mumbai 	                       64,75,640	                  52,06,473Chennai 		       08,19,873	                  13,42,337(b): The required basic facilities for slum dwellers/ urban poor such as water supply, electricity, toilets etc. are provided by respective ULBs. As per Census of India 2011, 74% of slum households have tap water supply and 20.3% have hand pump/ tube well. 90.5% of them have electricity connection. A total of 66% have latrine facility within the premises and 81.2% have drainage facility. (c) & (d): No, Sir. The data-base of slums in the country is captured by the Union Government through Census of India on decadal basis. (e) & (f): Yes, Sir. Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) is implementing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) to provide all weather pucca house with basic amenities to all eligible beneficiaries of urban India including slum dwellers with the vision of ‘Housing for All’ by 2022. The “In-situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR)” component under PMAY-U Mission mandates use of land as a resource for providing houses to slum dwellers across the country including the metro cities. This approach aims to leverage the locked potential of land under slums to provide houses to the eligible slum dwellers by bringing them into the formal urban settlement. So far, a total of 6.32 lakh houses for slums dwellers have been grounded, of which 4.37 lakh houses have been completed with basic facilities under the scheme.                                *****
