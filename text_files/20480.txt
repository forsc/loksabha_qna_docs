ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b): Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has informed that all Food Business Operators (FBOs) have to follow the norms and standards for different categories of food products  as prescribed under Food Safety and Standards (FSS) Act and various Regulations notified there under  by FSSAI. Implementation and enforcement of prescribed norms and standards primarily rests with the State/UT Governments. Regular surveillance, monitoring and inspection are undertaken by State/UT Governments.  Where the samples drawn are found to be non-conforming to prescribed norms and standards, action is taken under the penal provisions of Chapter IX of the FSS Act, 2006.As per the information available from State/UT Governments, the State/ UT-wise (including Andhra Pradesh and Telangana) details of samples collected, tested, found not conforming (including misbranded food products) and action taken during last three years are at Annexure-I to III. (c):	Per se, the act of counterfeiting is an infringement of IP laws which is not the domain of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. However, such products are likely to be substandard and unsafe. Therefore  FSSAI has   discussed the issue of  counterfeiting of food items  with stakeholders and in the light of discussions,  the Commissioners of Food Safety of all States/UTs  as well as  all Central Licensing Authorities and all Authorised Officers ( handling food imports were addressed on  9th March,  2020  to take proactive action  such as :I.	Conduct regular market surveillance for food products selling significantly below MRP and, thus, likely to be counterfeit and take action in coordination with local police or other authorities related to counterfeiting. II.	Develop local intelligence and coordinate with major brands to identify commodities, hot spots and trends in counterfeit food goods. III.	Conduct regular surveys to identify selling of imported /foreign food goods which do not have FSSAI license.IV.	Sensitise e-commerce players to  put in place mechanisms to prevent sale of counterfeit food goods and illegal imported goods on their platforms and allow only those products which have FSSAI  registration/license. V.	Strengthen enforcement/technical manpower.
