ANSWER




                                                        (a)	The State/UT-wise progress in terms of number of candidates (highest to lowest) trained, certified, placed, number of Training Centres in Short Term Training and funds disbursed under Centrally Sponsored State Managed (CSSM) component of PMKVY (2016-20) is given at Annexure.(b) to (e)	Under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) in the country. PMKVY 2016-20 does not mandate the establishment of skill development centres. The scheme provides for taking up Short Term Training (STT) courses and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) through accredited and affiliated training centers (TCs) throughout the country. Under the scheme, empanelment of TCs is done through the process of accreditation and affiliation for respective job roles on digital platform known as SMART (Skill Management and Accreditation of Training Centres). As on 17.01.2020, 13,209 TCs have been empanelled under PMKVY 2016-20 across the country including 407 TCs in State of Gujarat.Additionally, Ministry promotes establishment of model and aspirational skill centres known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) in every district for imparting skill training in every district throughout the country. At present, skill training at PMKKs is being imparted under the PMKVY (2016-20). The Ministry through National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) provides capital expenditure upto 75% of the project investment as well as operational support to each PMKK. As on 17.01.2020, 812 PMKKs have been allocated in 707 districts across the country; Out of allocated PMKKs, 723 PMKKs have been established including 34 PMKKs in State of Gujarat. Funds disbursed for establishment of PMKKs in State of Gujarat are Rs. 9.4 Cr.Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) (2016-20) has two components known as Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed (CSCM) being implemented by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and Centrally Sponsored State Managed (CSSM) being implemented by State Skill Development Missions of the States/ UTs popularly known as State- Engagement Component of PMKVY (2016-20).Under CSCM component of PMKVY 2016-20, there is no provision of State-wise funds allocation. However, under Centrally Sponsored State Managed (CSSM) component of PMKVY, funds and corresponding physical targets of PMKVY 2016-20 have been allocated to the States/UTs for the implementation of scheme through State Skill Development Missions. Under this component, Ministry has received proposals from 36 States/UTs and after evaluation of proposals, Ministry has given in-principle approval of a total target of 20.18 lakh candidates and corresponding financial allocation of Rs. 3,050 Cr. for FY 2016-20. However, due to slow performance of States/UTs and keeping in the mind that the scheme is going to end by March’2020, the financial allocation was rationalised to Rs. 2,419 crore (approx.) with the corresponding physical target of 12.45 lakh. As on 17.01.2020, Rs. 869.06 Cr. (approx) has been disbursed to 36 States/UTs including State of Gujarat. AnnexureThe State/UT-wise number of candidates trained (highest to lowest), certified, placed, number of TCs in STT and funds disbursed (CSSM) under PMKVY (2016-20), as on 17.01.2020, is given below:S.
