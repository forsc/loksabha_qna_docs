ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ''Nishank'')(a) to (e) At present, there is no proposal for setting up a new Central University in Rajasthan.However, as per the Andhra Pradesh Re-organisation Act 2014, one Central Tribal University isproposed in the State of Telangana. Further, the Prime Minister announced a package for Bihar on18.8.2015 which includes establishment of a Central University near Bhagalpur at the historic siteof Vikramshila University. As per the 12th Plan (2012-17), as approved by the NationalDevelopment Council, the thrust was on consolidation of the higher education system. Expansionwas to be mainly done by scaling up capacity of the existing institutions in place of setting up newinstitutions. The Central Government has launched Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA)on cost sharing basis to assist States to open new institutions. Further, ‘education’ being aconcurrent subject, the State Government also takes initiative in establishing new universities.*****
