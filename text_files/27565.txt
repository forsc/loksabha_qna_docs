                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) and (b) 	As a result of concerted efforts made for protection and conservation of wildlife, the population of several wildlife species like Tigers, Elephants, Asiatic Lion, Rhino etc. in the country has increased. Assessments of human-wildlife conflicts indicate that the main causes of human wildlife conflict include habitat loss, growth of population of wild animals, changing cropping patterns that attract wild animals to farmlands, movement of wild animals from forests area to human dominated landscapes for food and fodder, movement of human beings to forests for illegal collection of forest produce, habitat degradation due to growth of invasive alien species, etc. (c)	The Ministry provides financial assistance to States/UTs under the Centrally Sponsored Schemes of ''Development of Wildlife Habitats’, ‘Project Tiger’ and ‘Project Elephant’ for management of wildlife and its habitat in the country. The activities supported under these schemes include restoration of natural water bodies, creation of artificial waterholes, augmentation of food/fodder sources in Protected Areas, construction/erection of barriers such as solar powered electric fences, bio fencing using cactus, boundary walls, animal proof trenches etc. The details of financial assistance released to States/UTs under these schemes during the last three years are at Annexure –I, II and III.***
