Organic tea production in the country has increased in recent years, as indicated below: Year	Quantity (M.T)2017-18	8117.392018-19	10831.652019-20	11192.81 (Source: Tea Board/APEDA)(b):       The details of Organic tea exported during each of the last three years and the current year and the foreign exchange earned, is given in the following Table: Year	Exported quantity (in MT)	Value (in USD Million)2017-18	5221.72	35.522018-19	5897.30	48.762019-20	6210.89	49.712020-21   (Apr-Aug)	2056.99	16.90                        (Source: Tea Board/APEDA) (c):       The export of organic tea has declined marginally by 99.78 M.T (4.63%) during the period April-August 2020-21 over the corresponding period of the previous year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
