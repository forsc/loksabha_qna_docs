                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) 	The Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) is being implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India since 2016 in the countryto provide assistance to eligible rural households for construction of 2.95 crore Pucca houses with basic amenities to achieve the objective of “Housing for All”.  Under PMAY-G, a total target of 18,79,149  has been allocated to Chhattisgarh from the year 2016-17 to 2021-22.  Out of this, 10,96,624 houses have been sanctioned and 8,15,563 houses have been completed as on 6.8.2021. (b)to(d)  During the period of Covid-19 pandemic induced nation-wide lockdown, all construction activities including construction of houses under PMAY-G were also affected. It resulted in retarding the pace of construction of PMAY-G houses. Besides, the delays are also due to cases of unwillingness of beneficiaries, migration, death of beneficiaries without legal heir, delay in allotment of land to landless beneficiaries by the States/UTs and General/Assembly/Panchayat elections. The States/UTs have been requested to expedite the completion of houses approved under PMAY-G. Other steps taken including timely allocation of targets to the States/UTs under PMAY-G, provision of adequate funds and promotion of eco-friendly &innovative technologies for house construction, follow up with the States to ensure provision of land to landless beneficiaries in rural areas, expeditious resolution of technical issues faced by the State, advisory to all States/UTs to resume activities under PMAY-G with due Covid-19 protocol and regular review of progress at the level of Ministry to ensure timely completion of targeted houses. As against the allocated target of 2.63 crore houses till the Financial Year 2021-22, 2,00,28,861 houses have been sanctioned and 1,52,22,724 houses have been constructed.  *****
