ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Department of Science and Technology (DST) restructured women specific programmes and started a new scheme “Knowledge Involvement in Research Advancement through Nurturing (KIRAN)” in 2014-15 to provide various career opportunities to women scientists and technologists. ‘Women Scientist Scheme (WOS)’ under KIRAN is a flagship programme of DST that provides career opportunities including fellowships to unemployed women scientists and technologists, especially those who had a break in career, for pursuing research in frontier areas of science and engineering. There are three major components of Women Scientist Scheme namely, i) Women Scientists Scheme-A (WOS-A) for conducting research in basic & applied sciences, ii) Women Scientists Scheme-B (WOS-B) for projects that entail science & technology (S&T) interventions for societal benefit and iii) Women Scientists Scheme-C (WOS-C) that enables them to become Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) professionals. In addition to WOS, under ‘Consolidation of University Research through Innovation and Excellence in Women Universities (CURIE) Programme’ the ‘women only’ Universities are being supported for development of research infrastructure and creation of state-of-the-art research laboratories to enhance women’s participation in Research & Development (R&D) activities in S&T domain. In 2016-17, ‘Mobility’ component has been introduced under KIRAN to address relocation issues of working Women Scientists. In 2017-18, a new program ‘Indo-US Fellowship for Women in STEMM’ (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics & Medicine) to provide opportunities to Indian women scientists, engineers & technologists to undertake international collaborative research in premier institutions in USA for duration of 3-6 months, has been started.  Further, women scientists & technologists are also encouraged to avail capacity building programmes pertaining to R&D, entrepreneurship, managerial skills and leadership under ‘National Programme for Training of Women Scientists & Technologists working in Government Sector’. In2019-20, the Department has started Phase-I of a new scheme “Vigyan Jyoti” in 50 districts of the country for girl students of Classes 9 to 12 in order to increase the number of women in STEM education particularly in the areas where women are under-represented.(b)	An amount of Rs. 381.45 Crore has been spent under KIRAN since its inception in 2014-15.(c)	The State-wise number of women scientists who have benefitted under different programmes of KIRAN during last three years is as follows: Sl.
