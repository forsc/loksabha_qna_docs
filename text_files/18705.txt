                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a)  The detail of the requirement, availability of foodgrains and sufficiency i.r.o. of Maharashtra as on 31.12.2020 is as under : Commodity	Requirement/ month in MT	availability of foodgrain	Sufficiency for monthsWheat	242867 	1071106	4.4Rice	223067 	477086	2.1Total	465934	1548192	3.3Sufficient stocks have been maintained in Maharashtra Region for ensuring smooth supply of foodgrains to PDS. Stocks are being replenished regularly from surplus States like Punjab, Haryana and M.P.............2/--2-(b):  The percentage of foodgrains getting Non-issuable (damaged) in FCI during storage and transportation due to various reasons is tabulated below:Year	% of Damaged foodgrain against offtake quantity2017-18	0.0062018-19	0.012019-20	0.0042020-21 (as on 31-12-20	0.0030Steps taken by FCI to preserve the quality of procured foodgrains to avoid damage is at Annexure-I.(c):    No damage of foodgrains in FCI occurred in open storage and due to shortage of godowns during the last three years and current year.    (d):  	FCI continuously assesses and monitors the storage capacity and based on the requirement and storage gap assessment, storage capacities are created/hired under following schemes :-(i)  Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG)Government of India has formulated a scheme called Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) Scheme for construction of covered storage capacity.  Under this Scheme, storage capacity is created by private parties, CWC, SWCs and other State Agencies for guaranteed hiring by FCI. Under this scheme, a capacity of 5.63 lakh MT has been constructed as on 31.12.2020 in Maharashtra. (ii)  Construction of SILO''s  Steel Silo storage with bulk handling facility is highly efficient, mechanized and modernized way of storing foodgrains in bulk. It ensures better preservation of foodgrains and enhances its shelf life. If foodgrains are stored in silos and transported in bulk, losses due to theft, pilferage and transportation would be negligible compared to foodgrains storage in bags in conventional warehouses. Moreover, silos can be operated round the clock which brings in flexibility and improve overall efficiency. All these silos are being developed in PPP (Public Private Partnership) mode...........3/--3-Accordingly, in order to upgrade and modernize the storage facilities, Government of India has chalked out an Action Plan for construction of steel silos in PPP (Public Private Partnership) mode in the country. Till date Silos with capacity of 30.75 LMT at various locations throughout country have been awarded. Out of which a capacity of 8.25 LMT has already been completed and remaining is under various stages of development. In addition a capacity of 5.5 LMT has been created under circuit base model in 2007.(iii)   Hiring of godown from CWCs/SWCs/FCI hires godown from CWCs/SWCs on guaranteed reverberation basis to meet the requirement of storage space.  As on 31.12.20, a capacity of 1.76 LMT from CWCs and 2.27 LMT capacity from SWCs has been hired in Maharashtra.(iv)    Godowns hiring through PWSIn addition, as and when required godowns are being hired through e-tender under Private Warehousing Scheme (PWS) to address immediate / urgent requirement of storage space.  As on 31.12.20, a capacity of 1.88 LMT has been hired in Maharashtra through PWS.Under PWS scheme, godowns are hired by FCI from private parties on Lease only and Lease with Services basis through open Tender Enquiry for a minimum period of two years extendable by another one year (maximum). Minimum capacity of godown shall be 2500 MT (however, for hilly area it shall be 1670 MT).  The validity of the scheme is upto 31.03.2023.**** Annexure-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (b) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION No. 59 FOR ANSWER ON 02.02.2021 IN THE LOK SABHASteps taken by FCI to preserve the quality of procured foodgrains to avoid damage are(i)	All godowns are  constructed as per specifications.(ii)	Foodgrains are stored by adopting proper scientific code of storage practices.(iii)	Adequate dunnage materials such as wooden crates, bamboo mats, polythene sheets are used to check migration of moisture from the floor to the foodgrains.(iv)	Fumigation covers, nylon ropes, nets and insecticides for control of stored grain insect pests are  provided in all the godowns.(v)	Prophylactic (spraying of insecticides) and curative treatments (fumigation) are carried out regularly and timely in godowns for the control of stored grain insect pests.
