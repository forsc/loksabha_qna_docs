( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a):	Government is implementing various missions and schemes aimed at improvement in agriculture production, productivity as well as upliftment of farmers. Recently, the Government has initiated  the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme, effective from 1.12.2018, to provide income support to all small and marginal landholder farmer families across the country, subject to certain exclusions, to enable them to take care of expenses related to agriculture and allied activities as well as domestic needs. The Scheme provides a payment of Rs.6000/- per year in three 4-monthly instalments of Rs.2000/- to the farmers’ families with cultivable land holding up to 2 hectare, subject to certain exclusions relating to higher income groups. The ambit of the Scheme has now been expanded to cover all farmers in the country irrespective of the size of their land holdings subject to all other exclusions.Contd…2/--2-Further, the Government has recently approved a pension scheme for all Small and Marginal Farmers (SMF) in the country, subject to certain exclusion clauses, with a view to provide them a social security net as they have minimal or no savings to provide for old age and to support them in the event of consequent loss of livelihood. The scheme provides for payment of a minimum fixed pension of Rs.3,000/- per month to the eligible farmers on attaining the age of 60 years. It is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme, with entry age of 18 to 40 years. The beneficiary can opt to become a member of the Scheme by subscribing to a Pension Fund, managed by the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC). For example, the beneficiary is required to contribute Rs 100/ - per month in the pension fund at median entry age of 29 years, with matching contribution of Rs.100 by the Central Government.(b) to (c):	 The Government of India continuously evaluates the performance of all Centrally Sponsored and Central Sector Schemes, all of which contribute to the objective of doubling of farmers income by 2022. Impact and concurrent evaluations of schemes are carried to rectify shortcomings.  As a result of such an evaluation, the RKVY scheme was revamped as RKVY-RAFTAAR to focus on pre and post harvest management and value chain linked project.  (d):	The new initiatives, schemes will contribute to improving the quality of life of farmers, especially small and marginal farmers.The newly launched Scheme PM-KISAN has already provided financial benefit to 33,082,811 farmers amounting to Rs. 66,165,622,000/- up to 31.03.2019.
