In addition, the Government of India has also made efforts to put in place a suitable ecosystem for fortified rice in the country including all relevant stakeholders like States, industries, Fortified Rice Kernel (FRK) manufacturers, research institutions and development partners. Advisories have also been issued to States/UTs to consider distributing fortified atta as per Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) standards. Strategies to effectively tackle hunger are already in place under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), which has a maximum coverage of 81.35 crore persons in the country. In addition, free of cost foodgrains have been distributed to nearly 80 Crore beneficiaries under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) for a total period of 19 months during 2020-21 and 2021-22.(c): 	For full scaling up of supply of fortified rice under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman (PM-POSHAN) and Other Welfare Schemes (OWS), an annual quantity of about 350 LMT of fortified rice would be required.(d): 	As per information available, currently around 3400 rice mills in the country have blending equipment having cumulative monthly blending capacity of approximately 28.0 LMT. The following infrastructure may be required for blending of FRKs and normal rice for proper and continuous operations: (Equipment may vary as per the existing set up and desired Fortified rice production capacity)•	Storage Bins (depending on the existing set up and capacity)•	Load cells/Flow Balancer•	Vibratory Feeder (Calibrated as per desired production capacity)•	Elevators•	Blender (for the rice mills where modification of cylindrical grader is not feasible or cylindrical grader is not available)•	Programmable Logical Controls (PLC) (electrical)•	Other ancillary machineries (e.g. hopper, lid, agitator, magnet, electric motor, control system etc.)(e) & (f): 	The incremental cost of rice fortification is paid in addition to the normal cost of rice to the States/UTs. *****
