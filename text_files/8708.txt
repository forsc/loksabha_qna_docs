                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a):	Yes, Sir. The rate of the Employees’ State Insurance (ESI) contribution has been reduced from 6.5% (employer’s share – 4.75% and employee’s share – 1.75%) to 4% (employer’s share – 3.25% and employee’s share – 0.75%) with effect from 01.07.2019. Contd..2/-:: 2 ::(b):	ESI is a self-financing scheme and no grant/aid is provided by the Government of India.  All the benefits as available before the rate cut even after this reduction.(c):	ESI Scheme, which is now available in 566 districts of the country, is to be gradually extended to entire country by the year 2022. (d):	The rate of ESI contribution has been reduced, w.e.f. 01.07.2019, from 6.5 % to 4%, as detailed in part (a) above, to bring more and more employees under the ambit of ESI Act, 1948. (e):	The reduction in rate of contribution will reduce the burden on employer & employees and improve the coverage as well as compliance.(f):	As ESI is self-financing scheme where the expenditure is met out from the ESI fund generated through contribution received from the employers and employees, there is no burden on the Government. Further, in line with the recommendations of the Second National Commission on Labour, the Government has taken steps for drafting four Labour Codes i.e. the Code on Wages; the Code on Industrial Relations, the Code on Occupational Safety, Health & Working Conditions & the Code on Social Security by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the relevant provisions of the existing 29 Central Labour Laws.******
