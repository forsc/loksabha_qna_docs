The Central Pollution Control Board vide Orders dated 06th April, 2018 and 25th June, 2019 directed M/s Punjab State Power Corporation Ltd. to retrofit or install Electrostatic Precipitator, Flue-gas De-sulphurisation Unit, low NOX burners & Over Fire Air systems and install Cooling Tower Systems in the Guru Gobind Singh Super Thermal Power Plant (GGSSTP), Roopnagar, Punjab by 31stDecember, 2019 and 30th June, 2022, respectively.(b)	The purpose of directing to the install above mentioned pollution control devices is to meet the revised flue-gas emission norms and specific water consumption as mandated vide Ministry’s Notification no.S.O.3305(E) dated 7th December, 2015. The estimated cost of installing Flue gas De-sulphurisation Unit at GGSSTP is Rs.122 Crores.(c)	As per the CEA’s assessment, the estimated cost for compliance of new emission norms at about 0.73 crore per MW may not lead to shutting down of plants. In fact, the implementation of new emission norms will lead to reduction of emission of Particulate Matter (PM), Sulphur Di-oxide (SO2) and Oxides of Nitrogen (NOX) by 40%, 48% & 48% respectively which will in turn, improve air quality in and around the thermal power plant.	(d)&(e)  	The installation of new pollution control equipment will not lead to closure of plant, so there will be no effect on workers and their families. ***
