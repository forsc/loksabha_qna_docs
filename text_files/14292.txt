ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (e): State Government of Chhattisgarh has developed airports at Bilaspur and Jagdalpur with the technical assistance of Airports Authority of India (AAI). Bilaspur and Jagdalpur airports are licensed for Code 2C type of aircraft. Government of Chhattisgarh submitted proposal for upgradation of Jagdalpur for 3C category. Operationalization of Jagdalpur Airport for 3C Category depends on the compliance of the relevant Regulations/Civil Aviation Requirements by the State Government, being the operator of the Airport. After first round of bidding under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik), RCS routes connecting Bilaspur and Jagdalpur were awarded to Selected Airline Operator (SAO), which were subsequently terminated/cancelled due to non-compliance of SAO agreement by SAO. However, no valid bid for operation of RCS flights connecting Bilaspur was received in subsequent rounds till completion of third round of bidding under the scheme. Details of the routes connecting Jagdalpur, awarded to the SAO after completion of third round of bidding under RCS - UDAN, are attached as Annexure. SAOs under RCS - UDAN are obligated to commence RCS flight operations on an RCS-route within a period of six months from the issuance of Letter of Award or within two months from the readiness of airport, whichever is later, unless any extension is granted by the Implementing Agency.
