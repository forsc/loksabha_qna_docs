ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a)	to  (d):		In order to provide social security benefits to the workers in the unorganised sector, the Government has enacted the Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008, implemented across India including Madhya Pradesh. This Act stipulates formulation of suitable welfare schemes for unorganised workers on matters relating to: (i) life and disability cover, (ii) health and maternity benefits, (iii) old age protection and (iv) any other benefit as may be determined by the Central Government. The Life  and  disability  cover is  provided Contd..2/-::  2  ::through Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) to the unorganised workers depending upon their eligibility. Government of India and State Governments pay the annual premium in equal share. The health and maternity benefits are addressed through Ayushman Bharat scheme. For old age protection in the form of monthly assured pension, Government of India has recently launched Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandhan (PM-SYM). Under the scheme, minimum assured monthly pension of Rs. 3000/- will be provided to the unorganised workers after attaining the age of 60 years. Prescribed monthly contribution is payable by the beneficiary and equal matching contribution is paid by the Central Government. Welfare schemes like Provident Fund and Employees’ State Insurance are usually not available to the workers in unorganised sector. This have been the constant endeavour of the Central Government to provide the equivalent benefits to the unorganised workers as available to the workers in the organised sector.*****
