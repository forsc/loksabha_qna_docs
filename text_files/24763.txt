ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b)   Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) is mandated for regulation and development of National Waterways for the purpose of shipping and navigation under the Inland Waterways Authority of India Act, 1985.    To promote inland water transport (IWT) in the country, 111 waterways (including 5 existing NWs and 106 new waterways) have been declared as National Waterways (NWs) under the National Waterways Act, 2016 spread over 24 States in the country which came into effect from 12th April, 2016.   Based on the outcome of techno-economic feasibility and Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) of NWs, Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has concluded that 23 NWs have been found viable for cargo movement.    The list of the 23 NWs viable for cargo movement is at Annexure. (c) & (d)    Government of Tripura has proposed for declaration of Gumti River as National Waterway.   However, the proposed waterway does not have potential for declaration as National Waterway (NW) in terms of cargo potential and economic Inland Water Transport (IWT) operation.   The only notable factor is that the above stretch of Gumti river shall connect Tripura State hinterland with Bangladesh through IBP route 9 & 10 (Daudkandi -  Sonamura stretch of the river in Bangladesh).  	   A proposal to declare waterway stretches from Kollam (Quilon) to Kovalam in South and Kottapuram to Hosdurg in North of Kerala as National Waterway was received from Hon’ble Chief Minister, Kerala in May, 2016.   A Techno-Economic Feasibility (TEF) study through National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (NATPAC- a Govt. of Kerala Institution) was conducted in 2014 with regard to extension of West Coast Canal in the South of Kollam (Quilon) up to Kovalam and North of Kottapuram up to Kasargod.   TEF study found only Kottapuram - Kozhikode (Calicut) stretch in the North of Kottapuram technically feasible for development of shipping and navigation and accordingly extension of West Coast Canal up to Kozhikode (Calicut) in the North of Kottapuram was considered in the National Waterways Bill, 2015.  Calicut- Neeleswaram stretch which is part of Kottapuram-Hosdurg stretch was not found feasible for development of shipping & navigation as per TEF report.   The Kollam (Quilon) – Kovalam stretch (South of Kollam) was also not found technically feasible due to the presence of Varkala tunnel.  The above position was conveyed to the Hon’ble Chief Minister of Kerala in July, 2016.  However, later Govt. of Kerala forwarded a proposal for formation of SPV for developing Inland Waterways from Kollam to Kovalam and Kozhikode to Kasargod at a cost of Rs. 6,000 crore.  Hon’ble Chief Minister of Kerala was informed by Hon’ble Minister for Road Transport Highways and Shipping in March 2018 that in the absence of any scheme of Govt. of India, the Shipping Ministry would find it difficult to provide financial assistance to implement fairways development of stretches which are not part of declared National Waterways (NWs).
