                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) & (b):  Yes Sir. The Government has taken serious note of the impact of COVID-19 on the rural sector particularly on the agricultural supply chain. The Government vide their letter dated 02nd April, 2020 had issued advisory to States/Union Territories (UTs) to facilitate Direct Marketing, enabling direct purchase from the farmers/ Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs)/ Cooperatives etc. by liberalizing regulations under respective State Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Acts.           The Government also issued advisories to States/UTs to ensure inter-state and intra-state movement of vehicles carrying the agriculture produce in addition to setting up of monitoring cell to keep watch and extend immediate help for seamless movement of such vehicles including coordination for issue of permits to trucks. States also made various arrangements including nomination of nodal officer for coordination and setting up monitoring cell to facilitate free movement of vehicles carrying fruits, vegetable and other essential food items.           Further, to address the transportation issues of Farmers and other stake holders during Covid-19, the Government has launched the Kisan Rath Mobile App on 17.04.2020.  The App facilitates the Farmers, FPOs and Traders to post their load requests which are sent to transport aggregators and individual transporters who in turn respond to the load requests.(c):    At present, there is no proposal to give special compensation to farmers affected due to COVID -19 on the supply chain side. However, to help the farmers during COVID-19 period, Government has been providing assistance to farmers under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN). Under the scheme, an income support of Rs. 6000/- per year is transferred in three 4-monthly installments of Rs. 2000/- directly into the bank accounts of the eligible beneficiary farmers’ families.
