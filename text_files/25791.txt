                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)	Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, normal international travel services remain suspended.  International air travel is taking place through special arrangements, including air bubble and Vande Bharat Mission. Such travel is not directly linked to the possession of vaccination certificates. Further, at present, there is no multilateral protocol on the travel of COVID-19 vaccinated people. Most countries require a negative COVID19 report, along with compliance with country specific Covid protocols. (c) to (e)	While there have been multilateral discussions, including under the framework of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), regarding COVID-19 vaccination certificates, no multilateral arrangements in this regard have been reached so far.  India has been part of ongoing discussions to ensure that Indian manufactured vaccines are duly recognised in any multilateral arrangement.  India is also engaging with countries for mutual recognition of vaccination certificates. ***
