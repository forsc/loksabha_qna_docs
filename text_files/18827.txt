Government of India has taken a number of policy initiatives to promote exports and to make the Indian industry more competitive and resilient to face the global challenge. Some of these measures include various export facilitative schemes under the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP), assistance under the Market Access Initiative (MAI) scheme, Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES), setting up districts as export hubs, Transport and Market Assistance Scheme and Remission of Duties and Taxes on Export Products (RoDTEP) Scheme. Government of India also utilizes the various trade defense instruments available in the domestic and WTO laws to ensure fair trade.  ****
