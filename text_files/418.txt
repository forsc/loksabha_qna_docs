On the recommendation of the Task Force on Improving Employment Data, this Survey  has been discontinued and replaced by the Periodic Labour Force Survey(PLFS) being conducted by the Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation. Based on the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) conducted during July 2017-June 2018, estimates of Worker Population Ratio (WPR) in usual status (ps+ss) are 34.7% at All India level. However, methodology varies in both the surveys and figures are not comparable. (b) & (c):	No such data is available.

Under the New Series, the sector-wise details regarding level estimates under  first round and change estimates of employment under 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th  & 7th Rounds from April 2016 to Oct, 2017 are presented in Annexure-I.  (d):		The Unemployment Rate based on Usual Principal Status (UPS) approach for persons aged 15 years & above during the 4th & 5th round of Employment-Unemployment Survey(EUS) is given at Annexure-II(a) and Annexure-II(b) respectively. The Unemployment Rate according to Usual Status (ps+ss) approach for each State/UT as per the PLFS is given in Annexure-III. However methodology varies in both the surveys and figures are not comparable.(e):		Employment generation coupled with improving employability is a priority concern of the Government. Further, Government has taken various steps for generating employment in the country like encouraging private sector of economy,  fast tracking various projects involving substantial investment and increasing public expenditure on schemes like Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) run by the Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and Pt.

Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana has been initiated by the Ministry of Labour and Employment in the year 2016-17 for incentivizing industry for promoting employment generation. Under this scheme, Government is paying the entire employer’s contribution (12 % or as admissible) towards the EPS and EPF w.e.f. 01.04.2018 to all eligible new employees and is applicable for all sectors for the next 3 years from the date of registration of the new employee.
