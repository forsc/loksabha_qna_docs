ANSWER




                                                        (a)        The objectives of setting up of National Science & Technology Entrepreneurship Development Board (NSTEDB)are mentioned below: 1.	To act as a policy advisory body to the Government in matters relating to S&T Entrepreneurship Development.2.	To guide the Department in implementation, monitoring and evaluation of Schemes/programmes related to Innovation and Entrepreneurship.3.	To guide in generating new programmes/schemes. (b)        Since inception, NSTEDB has made pioneering efforts to foster the Entrepreneurship Ecosystem in the country. NSTEDB is one of the first government agencies to promote institutional mechanisms to support technology based entrepreneurship in the country through speed, scale and skills. Under its National Initiative for Developing and Harnessing Innovations (NIDHI) umbrella program, NSTEDB has aligned its programs with Startup India initiative. In the last 5 years, the number of Technology Business Incubators (TBI) established has doubled and have now reached more than 150 TBIs. NSTEDB has enabled Innovation Ecosystem Policy Frameworks like: Service Tax exemption to both incubators and incubates (year 2007), Permission to hold equity in incubatees by DST recognized incubators (year 2007), CSR Funding for incubators (year 2014). NSTEDB has pioneered Innovative Partnership Models leveraging the strengths of diverse stakeholders by programs in PPP mode for scouting & supporting innovation. NSTEDB backed TBI''s were one of the first incubators to get support from (multilateral) international developmental agencies. NSTEDB was first to initiate supporting accelerator programs (year 2016) through TBIs to accelerate growth-stage companies at the post incubation stage. So far, NSTEDB has supported 417 startup companies through its 27 accelerator programs conducted at various Technology Business Incubators (TBI) across the nation. TBIs supported with NIDHI-PRAYAS Program under which 401 innovators have been supported in last 5 years. NSTEDB pioneered initiating NIDHI Entrepreneurs-in-Residence (EIR) fellowship to support aspiring entrepreneurs. So far, 221 EIR fellowships have been extended through TBIs. According to a latest study conducted during 2014-2019 through Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, on NSTEDB programs, the total turnover of both the graduated and incubated startups at NSTEDB supported TBIs is in excess of ?27,000 Crore.  (c)        Government has made assessments on the performance of the National Science and technology Entrepreneurship Board (NSTEDB) which was setup in 1982 in the Department of Science and Technology. The chronological details of the assessments carried out on the performance of NSTEDB are given below: 1.	1988:   The report of the Evaluation Committee, chaired by Shri T.N. Seshan to study the working of NSTEDB in 1988. Major outcomes of the report are:i.	NSTEDB must continue to function in DSTii.	There is a need for an exclusive Board to promote entrepreneurship among science and technology persons.iii.	Adequate staff and funds must be provided to the NSTEDB in order that it may fulfill its objective in a much better fashion than heretofore. At the moment the activity is sub-critical.2.	1998:   Report of the Evaluation Study of NSTEDB performance and their impact on Entrepreneurship Technology Development, Employment, Technology Transfer by National Council of Applied Economic Research, 1998. Major recommendations of the report are given below.i.	Social cost benefit analysis reveals a high social yield (social IRR) while enhancing the role of private sector.ii.	Given the size of the problem for which NSTEDB has been set up to tackle, there appears a need for       NSTEDB to enhance and expand its catalytic role.iii.	Strategic planning and organization to access funds outside of government and enhance visibility and impact through improved delivery systems.iv.	Introduce project orientation and management for success of the programmes.v.	To fine tune the programs on knowledge and awareness spread, incubation and support facilities for entrepreneurs with S&T orientation and group employment schemes. vi.	To increase the coverage of NSTEDB schemes across the country and harness the power of information technology in spreading entrepreneurship awareness.3.	2013:   Evaluation of NSTEDB performance and achievement during XI plan by a committee chaired by Prof. S. K. Joshi, 2013. Major recommendations of the committee are given below.i.	NSTEDB to disengage from skill development activities especially in the wake of science development mission and a corporation to implement the mission.ii.	NSTEDB to continue all the other ongoing programmes on innovation. Entrepreneurship and incubation development.iii.	NSTEDB to expand the Technology Business Incubator (TBI) network substantially in the country through competitive support model, participation of the State Governments and appropriate Public-Public and Public-Private partnerships.iv.	A new program on innovation –Science & Technology Entrepreneurship Development (i-STED) to address the challenges associated with a specific region/industry/cluster by connecting interventions of S&T and innovative solutions with entrepreneurial opportunities to be initiated.4.	2020:   The assessment of National Science and technology Development Board (NSTEDB) efforts more specifically during last 5 years i.e. (2014-19) in promoting innovation and entrepreneurship was carried out by Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT Kanpur). The outcomes of the impact report for the assessment, published on 8thSeptember, 2020 are given below:i.	Board’s role has been critical in nurturing and sustaining the nation’s entrepreneurial ecosystem.ii.	The constant innovative approach and effort adopted by the DST team and other stakeholders in successfully navigating the pitfalls in this journey are noteworthy and deserves high appreciation.iii.	As on 31st March 2020 there are 153 Incubators, with a total of 3681 Incubatees across the country, while 113 Incubatees are acquired by third parties.iv.	The continuation of NSTEDB’s programs in this direction leveraging its strengths built over time is critical to position India on the global Economic map with economic, social and technology disruptions in both domestic and global market space, this is also evident given its accelerated pace of interventions in the last 5 years.v.	Learning from the insights derived from last five years analysis, coupled with pandemic''s learnings, the report concluded that NSTEDB has a greater potential to contribute and deliver to fulfill the national aspirations under Startup India, Atmanirbhar India with more empowered innovators, start-ups and incubators.
