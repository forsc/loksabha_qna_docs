                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) to (c): 	The Government is implementing the National Food Security Act, 2013 which is the principal mandate of Department of Food & Public Distribution. About 97-98% of the budgetary allocation of the Department is for release of food subsidy. The remaining budget of the Department (around 2-3%) is allocated towards schemes aimed at strengthening of the Public Distribution System, sugar sector etc. The Act provides for coverage of upto 75% of rural and upto 50% of urban population (67% of the total population of the country) for receiving highly subsidized foodgrains under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), thus covering about two-thirds of the total bottom population.  The coverage under the Act is substantially high to ensure that all the vulnerable and needy sections of the society get its benefit.  There are no specific provisions under the Act for tribals.  Further, coverage under the Act is only under two categories – households covered under Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) to the extent specified by the Central Government and the remaining households as priority households as per criteria evolved by State Governments. 2.5 Crore AAY households, who are poorest of the poor, are already covered under the Act. There is no food scheme specifically for tribal areas.****
