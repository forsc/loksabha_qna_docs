ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI PANKAJ CHAUDHARY)(a) & (b): The details of CGST, SGST and IGST collections (State-wise) during the last threeyears are as per Annexure I.(c) & (d): As per the provisions of the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, GSTcompensation for financial years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 has already been paid to allStates including Tamil Nadu. The economic impact of the pandemic has led to highercompensation requirement due to lower GST collection and at the same time lower collection ofGST compensation cess. GST compensation of Rs. 9845.4278 crore has been released to TamilNadu to partly meet the compensation payable for the period April’20 to March’21 as the amountin GST Compensation Fund was not adequate to meet the full compensation requirement.The issue of GST Compensation to States has been deliberated in the 41st and 42nd GSTCouncil meetings. Accordingly, in FY 20-21, Centre had borrowed Rs. 1.1 lakh crore under aspecial window and passed on to the States as back-to-back loan to help the States to meet theresource gap due to short-release of compensation on account of inadequate balance in theCompensation Fund. This arrangement has been finalized after detailed deliberations with theStates and all States have opted for this arrangement. Subsequent to deliberations in the 43rdGST Council meeting, Centre has borrowed Rs. 1.59 lakh crores from the market through specialwindow in current FY and passed it to the States/ UTs as a back-to-back loan as was done inlast year. The quantum of funds released to Tamil Nadu State as loan is Rs.6241 crore for FY2020-21 and Rs. 8095.25 crore for FY 2021-22. In addition, depending on the amount availablein the Compensation Fund, Centre has also been releasing the regular GST compensation toStates to make up for GST revenue shortfall. Taking into account, the GST Compensationreleased from Compensation Fund as well as back-to-back loan released in FY 2020-21 and FY2021-22, GST compensation of Rs. 2894 crore and Rs. 2049 crore is pending to Tamil Nadu forperiod April’20 to March’21 and April-September, 2021 respectively as per provisional figures.
