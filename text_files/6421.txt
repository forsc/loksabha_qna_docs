ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a)	to (c):  The quinquennial labour force surveys on employment and unemployment were conducted by National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The last such survey was conducted during 2011-12. Now, NSSO has switched to the annual Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) whichwas conducted during 2017-18. The estimated unemployment rate on usual status (principal status + subsidiary status) basis for persons of all ages in the country for different categories in rural and urban area is given below. Unemployment Rate (in %)Area	 Gender	Scheduled Tribes	Scheduled Castes	Other Backward Class	AllRural	Male	4.9	6.4	5.7	5.8	Female	2.2	3.2	3.8	3.8	Person	4.0	5.6	5.3	5.3Urban	Male	7.0	8.2	6.9	7.1	Female	7.6	10.5	10.9	10.8	Person	7.1	8.8	7.8	7.8Rural+Urban	Male	5.1	6.8	6.1	6.2	Female	2.6	4.9	5.7	5.7	Person	4.3	6.3	6.0	6.1Separate data for differently abled unemployed is not available. However, as per the information received from the States/UTs, the number of differently abled job seekers, all of whom may not necessarily be unemployed, registered on live register of employment exchanges in the country to the extent available were 6.85 lakh during 2016 (provisional).(d) to (f):   Government of India is not providing unemployment allowance to the unemployed persons. Further, under Skill India Mission, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) imparts employable skills to the youth through long term and short term training. The Ministry is implementing its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal VikasYojana (PMKVY) to provide employable skills to the youth of the nation. Ministries/ Departments/ States also run skill development schemes across various sectors to improve the employability of youth and facilitate placements. Schemes such as the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) wherein Government reimburses 25 percent of the stipend payable to apprentices enhances employability of the youth to access employment.	Government has launched three social security schemes pertaining to the Insurance and Pension sectors, namely Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY), Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) and the Atal Pension Yojana (APY) to move towards creating a universal social security system. The schemes provide essential and affordable social protection to all citizens in a convenient manner linked to auto-debit facility from bank accounts and is applicable to all. As on 01-10-2019, gross  number of enrolment by banks, subject to verification of eligibility criteria, is 16.56 crore in PMSBY and 6.29 crore in PMJJBY. As far as APY is concerned, a total number of  1.86 crore people have enrolled as on 30-09-2019 under this scheme.*****
