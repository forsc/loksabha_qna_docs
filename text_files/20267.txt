ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	to  (c) Representations including from Hon’ble Members of Parliament, for restoration of regular train services and provision of stoppage in the special trains, presently being operated, have been received, a compendium of which is not maintained. Duly considering the requests as also keeping in view the concerns and suggestions of State Governments, Indian Railways have increased the number of special services, with limited stoppages, in a phased manner and have operationalized 2024 Special Mail/Express trains (including Festival Specials) and approximately 5580 Passenger/ Electric Multiple Unit(EMU)/Mainline Electric Multiple Unit(MEMU).  Furthermore, Indian Railways is closely monitoring the prevailing situation as also the waitlist position of special trains and is operating clone trains on routes where unsatiated demand exists.*****
