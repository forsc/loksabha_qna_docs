ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER FOR CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D.V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a) & (b): Yes, Sir. The requirement, availability and sales of Urea and other fertilizers in the country/ State-wise during the Kharif’20 Season (upto 14.09.2020) is attached as Annexure- A. It can be seen from the annexure that the availability of Urea is more that the projected requirement and sales.(c) & (d): Sir, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) was entrusted to conduct study to determine the impact of Neem Coated Urea. DAC&FW has submitted the final report prepared by Agricultural Development and Rural Transformation Centre (ADRTC). As per the findings of the said report, ‘Diversion of Urea to other than crop production purposes is negligible among the farmers and in fact, it has completely stopped post introduction of Neem Coated Urea’. Consumption of fertilizers depends upon many factors. However, the use efficiency of neem coated urea in comparison to normal urea is very high.                                  *********
