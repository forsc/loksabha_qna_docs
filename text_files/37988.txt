ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION (DR. SUBHAS SARKAR)(a): National Education Policy 2020, like National Education Policy 1968 and 1986, reiterates that three language formula will continue to be implemented while keeping in view the Constitutional provisions, aspirations of the people, regions and the Union, and the need to promote multilingualism as well as promote national unity. However, there will be a greater flexibility in the three-language formula, and no language will be imposed on any State. The three languages learned by children will be the choices of States, regions, and of course the students themselves, so long as at least two of the three languages are native to India. (b): The National Education Policy 2020 has been finalised after a highly participative, inclusive and multi-pronged consultation process, through online, grassroots and thematic expert consultations, involving State/UT Governments, Government of India Ministries, Members of Parliament, public etc. Ministry of Education, other relevant Ministries/Departments, State/UT Governments and implementing agencies under their purview have started taking initiatives towards implementation of NEP 2020.(c): As per National Education Policy 2020, the curricular and pedagogical structure and the curricular framework for school education is to be guided by a 5+3+3+4 design and in higher education, the undergraduate degree will be of either 3 or 4-year duration, with multiple exit options within this period, with appropriate certifications.*****
