Uniform specifications (Procurement norms) of foodgrains are formulated by the department. Food Corporation of India (FCI) and State Governments and their agencies procure the foodgrains for Central Pool conforming to the Uniform Specifications on Minimum Support Price (MSP) from the farmers. Sometimes, due to natural calamities such as unseasonal rains, erratic rainfall, cyclone and adverse climatic conditions thereby affecting the quality of foodgrains, Government allows relaxation in the procurement norms on the request of the concerned State Government to avoid distress sale for the benefit of farmers. The State-wise/ Commodity-wise details of the relaxation allowed during the last year and current year are at Annexure-I.  (c): 	Foodgrains procured under relaxed specifications are not earmarked for any specific schemes/programmes. Moreover, paddy is not issued under Public Distribution System (PDS). Paddy is milled and resultant rice is issued under PDS.(d):  	No such complaints have been received in this regard, so far.(e): 	Commission of Agriculture Costs and Price (CACP) under Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer’s Welfare is mandated to recommend the Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for 22 agriculture commodities including foodgrains at all India Level and Fair & Remunerative Price for Sugarcane.    	Steps taken by the Government to ensure remunerative prices for foodgrains and its timely procurement from farmers are at Annexure-II.***ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) & (b) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. 201 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 09.03.2021 IN LOK SABHADetails on the State-wise and commodity wise relaxation allowed in procurement norms during last and current year.Year	State	Name of Refraction	Uniform Specifications limits	Relaxed Specifications limits1.

The Minimum Support Price (MSP) is announced by the Government of India at the beginning of the sowing season for crops and procures foodgrains at MSP.2.	MSP operations are given wide publicity through pamphlets, banners, sign boards, radio, TV and advertisements through print & electronic media.3.	Farmers are made aware of the quality specifications and purchase system etc. to facilitate the farmers to bring their produce conforming to the specifications. 4.	Procurement centres are opened taking into account the production, marketable surplus, convenience of farmers and availability of other logistics / infrastructure such as storage and transportation etc. Large number of temporary purchase centres in addition to the existing regulated mandis and depots/godowns are also established at key points for the convenience of the farmers for timely purchase of their produces. 5.	Farmers directly get the MSP announced by GOI and decided to do away with the levy system of procurement of rice with effect from KMS 2015-16, allowing the entire procurement of paddy to be done only by the State Agencies/FCI.6.	Payment to farmers is done through electronic mode by State Agencies/FCI. Efforts are being made to make the payments to the farmers within 48 hours of purchase.7.	 FCI and State Governments have developed their own Online Procurement Systems which ushers in transparency and convenience to the farmers through proper registration and monitoring of actual procurement. 8.	Through e-procuring module deployed by procuring Agencies, farmers get latest/updated information regarding MSP declared, nearest purchase centre, date on which the farmer has to bring their produce to the purchase centre etc. This not only reduces the waiting period for delivery of stock by the farmers but also enables the farmer to deliver stock as per his convenience to the nearest mandi.						******
