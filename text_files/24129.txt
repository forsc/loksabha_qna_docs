MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN )(a) & (b): National Curriculum Framework (NCF) recommended Yoga as an integral part of Health and Physical Education. Health and Physical Education is a compulsory subject from Class I to Class X and optional from Class XI to XII. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has already developed integrated syllabi on Health and Physical Education from Class I to Class X. In addition, Central Board of Secondary Examination (CBSE) has introduced a streamlined and well designed Health and Physical Education (HPE) Program to mainstream health and physical education in schools for students of class I - XII. CBSE has made Health and Physical Education compulsory in all classes from I-XII. The Board has directed schools to keep one period of HPE for classes I-XII each day. The University Grants Commission (UGC) has prepared guidelines for institutional fitness plan. These guidelines encourage higher educational institutions to adopt policies and practices towards fitness and well being of students and staff. The indicative guidelines inter-alia suggests denoting minimum one hour per day on fitness activities.The Government has included Yoga training in the “Study in India” programme to encourage Yoga seekers from abroad to obtain authentic Yoga training in India. UGC has approved the establishment of an Inter University Centre-Yogic Science at Bengaluru and introduced Yoga as a new National Eligibility Test (NET) subject from January 2017 UGC-NET onwards. Yoga Departments have been established in nine Central Universities.The recruitment, service conditions and deployment of teachers including yoga teachers are under the jurisdiction of the State/Union Territory Governments and it is for the respective State/Union Territory Government to take a decision in such matters for their schools. However, as per UDISE 2019-20 (provisional), the total number of Physical Education Teacher (PET) appointed are 72375.*****
