(b)	To make the train journey affordable by Air- conditioned (AC) class, Government has introduced AC-3 tier Economy coaches. The base fare for 3AC Economy coaches has been fixed lower than the existing fare of Mail/Express AC 3 tier coaches.

Further, at present, there is no immediate proposal to introduce Gatimaan Express on Indore-Delhi and Indore-Mumbai sector.  However, introduction of trains is an ongoing process over Indian Railways, subject to operational feasibility and commercial justification. (g)   It is a continual endeavour of Indian Railways (IR) to make rail journey safer and more comfortable for passengers. Some of the steps in this regard are listed below:-i.	State-of-the-art Train-set Vande Bharat services have been introduced between New Delhi – Varanasi and New Delhi- Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Katra. These trains have ultra modern features like quick acceleration, on board infotainment and Global Positioning System (GPS) based passenger information system, automatic sliding doors, retractable footsteps, Zero discharge vacuum bio toilets etc.ii.	Various premium train services like Humsafar, Tejas, Antyodaya, Utkrisht Double Decker Air-conditioned Yatri (UDAY), Mahamana and coaches like Deen Dayalu and Anubhuti, which have upgraded interiors / exteriors and improved passenger amenities, have been introduced in service in various train services over IR. iii.	IR has also introduced State-of-the-art Vistadome coaches on Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) platform in various trains over IR. These coaches have several modern features and amenities providing panoramic view, through wider body side windows as well as through transparent sections in the roof, thus enabling the passengers to enjoy the scenic beauty of the places through which they travel.iv.	IR has decided to proliferate LHB coaches, which are technologically superior and have better riding, aesthetics and safety features than conventional Integral Coach Factory (ICF) type coaches. Production Units of IR have stopped the manufacturing of ICF type coaches and are manufacturing only LHB coaches from the year 2018-19 onwards.v.	IR has also upgraded rakes of various Mail / Express trains running with ICF coaches under Project Utkrisht. Under Project Swarn, rakes of Rajdhani and Shatabdi trains have been upgraded across multiple dimensions, which include coach interiors, toilets, onboard cleanliness, staff behaviour, linen, etc.vi.	Smart coaches with ultra modern features like Smart Public address and passenger information system, Smart HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning system), Smart security and surveillance system etc. have also been manufactured.vii.	A new variant of LHB AC three-tier coach- AC Economy coach, has also been introduced in service with enhanced amenities and increased passenger carrying capacity.*****
