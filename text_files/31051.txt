ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND PENSIONS AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a) & (b): No, Sir. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in its Order dated 18.12.2014 in the case of State of Punjab and Others Vs Rafiq Masih (White Washer) etc. in CA. No. 11527 of 2014 (arising out of SLP(C) No. 11684 of 2012) observed that it is not possible to postulate all situations of hardship which would govern employees on the issue of recovery, where payments have been mistakenly made by the employer, in excess of their entitlements.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court, however, summarized the following few situations, wherein recoveries by the employers would be impermissible in law:(i)	Recovery from employees belonging to Class-III and Class-IV service (or Group ‘C’ and Group ‘D’ service).(ii)	Recovery from retired employees, or employees who are due to retire within one year, of the order of recovery.(iii)	Recovery from employees, when the excess payment has been made for a period in excess of five years, before the order of recovery is issued.(iv)	Recovery in cases where an employee has wrongfully been required to discharge duties of a higher post, and has been paid accordingly, even though he should have rightfully been required to work against an inferior post.(v)	In any other case, where the Court arrives at the conclusion, that recovery if made from the employee, would be iniquitous or harsh or arbitrary to such an extent, as would far outweigh the equitable balance of the employer’s right to recover.In the wake of the Orders of Hon’ble Supreme Court, instructions were issued in the matter vide Department of Personnel & Training’s OM No. 18/03/2015-Estt.(Pay-I) dated 02.03.2016 (Annexed).  *****
