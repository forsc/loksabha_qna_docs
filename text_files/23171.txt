Ministry of Tourism also grants financial assistance to States/Union Territories for Organizing Fairs/Festivals & Tourism related Events.             Proposals are received from State Governments/Union Territory Administrations from time to time for seeking financial assistance under the above schemes of the Ministry of Tourism. These proposals are examined in context of the scheme guidelines and financial assistance is extended for such projects subject to fulfilment of the stipulated provisions and availability of funds.             On the basis of the request received from the State Government, Deoghar and Parasnath sites have been identified for development in the State of Jharkhand under the PRASHAD Scheme. Ministry of Tourism has sanctioned the ‘Development of Baidyanathji Dham, Deoghar’ project in 2018-19 in Jharkhand under the said scheme.             The list of the projects sanctioned under the PRASHAD and Swadesh Darshan Schemes and financial assistance provided for Organizing Fairs/Festivals and Tourism related Events to the States of Jharkhand, Bihar and Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir during the last three years is annexed.             It may however be mentioned that the Swadesh Darshan Scheme is currently under review and therefore, no new project can presently be considered for sanctioning including that of Jammu & Kashmir, Bihar and Jharkhand.******
