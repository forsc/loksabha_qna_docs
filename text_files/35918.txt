                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES (SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL) (a) to (c): In order to reduce multiplicity and consolidate various laws related to food industry, as well as to establish the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), the Government has enacted the ‘Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006’ in the year 2006.  This Act lays down science-based standards for articles of food and for regulating their manufacture, storage, distribution, sale and import, for ensuring availability of safe and wholesome food for human consumption. This Act amalgamated Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 and various other food related orders regulated by different Ministries and Departments, into one integrated legislative framework.   Also, as part of Ease of Doing Business, the Government of India has launched an online portal “National Single Window System (NSWS)” in September 2021, for investors and businesses including food processing industry/businesses.  This online system is a one stop-shop for approvals & clearances from many Departments of Central and State Governments.    *****
