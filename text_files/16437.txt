Financial support is also provided by the Ministry to support setting up of Residential Ashram schools and Hostels under the scheme of SCA to TSS.                The objective of these interventions is to provide congenial environment and facilities to Scheduled Tribe (ST) students for their educational development. The setup of EMRS includes infrastructures like school building, hostels, staff quarters, playground, students’ computer lab, teacher resource room etc. As on date, under the scheme of EMRS, a total of 566 schools have been sanctioned in the tribal areas across the country out of which 285 schools are currently functional. Besides,1205 Ashram schools have been funded by the Ministry in different States to cater to the educational needs of tribal population.(d) Details of funds provided to the States for overall educational development, including infrastructure development, under the schemes of Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution of India, including EMRS, and SCA to TSS during the last three years is at Annexure.(e) to (g) No report regarding objections against the development/ setting up of schools in the forest areas has come to the notice of the Ministry till date.
