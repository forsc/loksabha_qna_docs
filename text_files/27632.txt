ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN) (a) During COVID-19 Pandemic, Ministry of Education has held several consultations with the states and UTs at various levels and taken many initiatives to ensure that the school going students don’t lag behind in their studies during COVID-19 pandemic. Further, National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has conducted a survey in the month of July, 2020 with the help of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS), Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) and Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to understand the scenario of Online Learning of school students in COVID-19 pandemic situation.(b) & (c) Education being in the concurrent list of the Constitution and majority of the schools are under the domain of respective State and UT Governments. The opening and closing of schools are within the purview of State Governments and UT Administrations. No such data is maintained centrally.(d) A multi-pronged approach has been adopted leveraging technology to reach the students in States/UTs including Uttar Pradesh. Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing (DIKSHA), study webs of active-learning for young aspiring minds (SWAYAM), PRAGYATA guidelines on digital education, e-textbooks and e-content on national repository of open educational resources (NROER), online virtual labs (OLABS) for practical’s related e-content, activity-based and highly engaging modules for special resources for teachers focusing upon experiential learning and competency-based education, NISHTHA (national initiative for school heads and teachers for their holistic advancement) online for capacity building programme for elementary school teachers and school heads etc. are used by schools, to provide learning facilities.Where the internet facility is not available, Ministry of Education has taken many initiatives like One Class One Channel of SWAYAM PRABHA is being used to impart education through TV and One DTH channel is being operated specifically for hearing impaired students in sign language. Community Radio Stations and a podcast called Shiksha Vani of CBSE, Textbooks, worksheet supplied to residence of learners, Handbook on 21st Century Skills Handbook on 21st Century Skills and community/mohalla classes are being organized. Innovation Funds of Department of School Education & Literacy used to set up mobile school, virtual studios, virtual class rooms in schools, Continuous Learning Plan (CLP) for States/UTs has been initiated in all States/UTs, pre-loaded tablets under Samagra Shiksha in various states and UTs are effectively used in remote/rural areas where online classes are difficult. In addition, the Ministry has also issued the guidelines dated 13th July, 2020 for continuing education of children of migrant labourers to prevent loss of learning or academic year.****
