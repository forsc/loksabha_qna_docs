ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (c)  Discharge of untreated & partially treated sewage from towns & cities along the river banks and industrial effluent are the major cause of pollution in rivers, including small rivers, in the country. Cleaning of river is a continuous process and Central Government is supplementing the efforts of the State Governments and Union Territories in addressing the challenges of pollution of rivers by providing financial and technical assistance through schemes like National River Conservation Plan (NRCP), Namami Gange. The NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches of 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country with a sanctioned cost of Rs.5870.54 crore. Under Namami Gange, the rejuvenation of Ganga and its tributaries have been taken up. So far, a total 310 projects have been sanctioned at an estimated cost of Rs.28,790.66 crore under Namami Gange. Of these, 116 projects have been completed and made operational.	In addition, sewage infrastructure are created under programs like Atal Mission For Rejuvenation & Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and Smart Cities Mission.	       Further, CPCB, SPCBs and PCCs regularly monitor industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under  provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.  To improve the monitoring of compliance, directions have been issued by CPCB to specific industries to install online 24x7 effluent monitoring systems. Steps have also been taken by CPCB to promote low waste concept in grossly water polluting industries and maintain zero liquid discharge wherever possible.*****
