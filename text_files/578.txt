ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE 	???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) to (c): 	In an agricultural year (July-June), the First Advance Estimate on production of major agricultural crops is normally released during September. Therefore, it is too early to arrive at an assessment of foodgrain production in the country during 2019-20. However, as per Third Advance Estimate for the year 2018-19 released by Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare on 03.06.2019, the foodgrain production in the country is estimated at 283.37 million tonnes. Crop-wise production of major foodgrains from 2015-16 to 2018-19 is given as under:Contd…2/--2-(in million tonnes)Crops	2015-16	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19*Rice	104.41	109.70	112.76	115.63Wheat	92.29	98.51	99.87	101.20Maize	22.57	25.90	28.75	27.82Tur	2.56	4.87	4.29	3.50Gram	7.06	9.38	11.38	10.09Total Foodgrains	251.54	275.11	285.01	283.37* As per 3rd Advance Estimate	(d): 	As per the Working Group Report (February, 2018) of NITI Aayog on Demand & Supply Projections Towards 2033 for Crops, Livestock, Fisheries and Agricultural Inputs, the aggregate demand of foodgrains for 2016-17 and 2020-21 had been projected at 255.41 and 271.53 million tonnes, respectively. Government has taken various measures to increase the production of pulses which were earlier less than domestic demand. Consequently, the estimated production of pulses during 2017-18 has increased significantly to a record level of 25.42 million tonnes.(e): 	To ensure remunerative prices, procurement is made of the crops for which Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) are announced through Central and State agencies. In so far as cereals / nutri cereals are concerned, they are procured through Food Corporation of India (FCI) and decentralized procurement system. Also, the Government implements Price Support Scheme (PSS) for procurement of oilseeds, pulses and cotton through Central Nodal Agencies at MSP declared by the Government at the request of the state government.	In addition, Government is implementing Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) for procurement of agricultural and horticultural commodities which are perishable in nature and are not covered under the Price Support Scheme (PSS). The objective of intervention is to protect the growers of these commodities from making distress sale in the event of a bumper crop when the prices tend to fall below economic levels and cost of production. Further, Umbrella Scheme “Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA)”  provides for a holistic arrangement for assurance of a remunerative and stable price environment for growers / farmers to increase agriculture production and productivity. This umbrella Scheme comprises Price Support Scheme (PSS) for pulses & oilseeds, Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) and Pilot of Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme (PPSS) for oilseeds to ensure MSP to the farmers.**********
