ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a):		 Government of India has received no formal communication from International Labour Organisation (ILO) in this regard. Although, ILO’s Research Note on Asia- Pacific Garment and Footwear   Sector  available   on  Internet  mentions    the   said trend. Contd..2/-:: 2 ::(b):		 Under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 (the Act) both the Central and the State Governments are “Appropriate Governments” for fixation/revision of minimum rates of wages for the scheduled employments at an interval not exceeding five years. There are 45 scheduled employments in the Central sphere while in the State sphere the number (cumulative) of such employments is 1709. Textile Sector establishment comes under the purview of State Government. In order to protect the minimum wages against inflation, the Central Government mooted the idea of Variable Dearness Allowance (VDA) in terms of recommendation of the Labour Ministers’ Conference held in 1988. So far, the Central Government and 27 State Governments/ Union Territory Administrations have adopted VDA as a component of minimum wage. In Central sphere, minimum wage is updated twice a year by adding the component of VDA.(c) & (d):	 Under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, Textile sector establishment comes under the purview of State Government. The minimum wages fixed by the Appropriate Government are equally payable both to male and female workers and the Act does not discriminate on the basis of gender.******
