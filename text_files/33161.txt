                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a)	to (e).In 2018, the Government of India launched the Anaemia Mukt Bharat (AMB) strategy with the target to reduce anaemia in the vulnerable age groups such as women, children and adolescents in life cycle approach providing preventive and curative mechanisms through a 6X6X6 strategy including six target beneficiaries, six interventions and six institutional mechanisms for all stakeholders to implement the strategy. Under AMB strategy, the interventions for tackling the problem of anaemia in all the States and UTs include:i.	Prophylactic Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation in all six target age groupsii.	Intensified year-round Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) Campaign for:(a) improving compliance to Iron Folic Acid supplementation and deworming, (b) enhancing appropriate infant and young child feeding practices, (c) encouraging increase in intake of iron-rich food through diet diversity/quantity/frequency and/or fortified foods with focus on harnessing locally available resources, and (d) ensuring delayed cord clamping after delivery (by 3 minutes) in health facilitiesiii.	Testing and treatment of anemia, using digital methods and point of care treatment, with special focus on pregnant women and school-going adolescentsiv.	Addressing non-nutritional causes of anaemia in endemic pockets with special focus on malaria, hemoglobinopathies and fluorosisv.	Management of severe anaemia in pregnant women undertaken by administration of IV Iron Sucrose/Blood transfusionvi.	Providing incentives to the ANM for identification and follow-up of pregnant women with severe anaemia in high priority districts (HPDs)vii.	Training and orientation of Medical Officers and front line-workers on newer Maternal Health and Anaemia Mukt Bharat guidelinesviii.	Field level awareness by ASHAs through community mobilization activities and IEC and BCC activities The prevalence of anaemia among six groups as per the National Family Health Survey 5 (2019-21), is 25.0 percent in men (15-49 years) and 57.0 percent in women (15-49 years). 31.1 percent in adolescent boys (15-19 yrs), 59.1 percent in adolescent girls,52.2 percent in pregnant women (15-49 years) and 67.1percent in children (6-59 months). FewStates/UTs have shown decline in anaemia prevalence, details on theState/UT-wiseprevalenceof anaemia among six identified population groupsare placed at annexure.The measures taken by the Government to make AMB programme more effective are: (i)	working with other line departments and ministries for strengthening implementation(ii)	engaging National Centre of Excellence and Advanced Research on Anemia Control (NCEAR-A) at AIIMS, Delhi in capacity building of health care providers(iii)	strengthening supply chain and logistics(iv)	development of AMB Training Toolkit for capacity building of health care providers in anaemia management and recent launch of Anemia Mukt Bharat e-Training Modules to facilitate training of the health care providers through virtual platform amid COVID 19 pandemic which has posed a challenge in capacity building through physical trainings.Health is a State subject and the primary responsibility for strengthening health care services including implementation of national programs lies with the respective State/UT government. However, Government is taking steps to improve the condition of anaemia among all identified groups in all States/UTs. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare provides financial and technical support to States/UTs under NHM as proposed during annual Programme Implementation Plan. Covid-19 pandemic has also hampered AMB programme implementation contributing to anemia prevalence among all the age groups********
