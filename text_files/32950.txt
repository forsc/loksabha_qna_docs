ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) & (b)     Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), a time-bound, mission mode water conservation campaign, was implemented in the July - November 2019 period, in only 1,592 blocks out of 2,836 blocks of 256 water-stressed districts of the country. These blocks fell under critical or over-exploited groundwater category, where groundwater was being exploited faster than it could be replenished. During JSA, five target interventions to promote water conservation and water resource management, viz. water conservation & rainwater harvesting, renovation of traditional & other water-bodies/tanks, reuse and recharge of bore-wells, watershed development and intensive afforestation etc were implemented. Huge public awareness in water conservation/harvesting was generated due to JSA and further, it has been observed that various stakeholders, viz. Government departments/agencies, NGOs, Panchayats, individuals etc. have started taking steps towards water conservation. The outcome of JSA is improved water conservation.             The “Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch The Rain” (JSA:CTR) campaign was launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister on 22 March 2021, the World Water Day, with the theme – “Catch The Rain, Where it falls, When it falls”. JSA:CTR was taken up in all districts (rural as well as urban areas) of the country during the pre-monsoon and monsoon period in the country i.e. from March 2021 to 30 November 2021. JSA:CTR has been implemented with five focused interventions- (1) intensive rainwater harvesting and water conservation (2) enumerating, geo-tagging & making inventory of all water bodies; preparation of scientific plans for water conservation based on it (3) Setting up of Jal Shakti Kendras in all districts (4) intensive afforestation and (5) awareness generation. Intervention wise progress during the campaign period is as per Annexure I.           Further, Central Ground Water Board is periodically monitoring the ground water levels throughout the Country on a regional scale, through a network of monitoring wells. A comparison of ground water level of the country during last three years viz. November, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is given below- SI. No.	Year	Wells analysed	0-2 mbgl (%)	2-5 mbgl (%)	5-10 mbgl (%)	10-20 mbgl (%)	20-40mbgl(%)	>40 mbgl (%)1.	Nov 2021	14470	29.00	39.80	20.20	7.00	2.70	1.402.	Nov 2020	16569	29.30	38.60	20.40	7.30	2.90	1.503.	Nov 2019	14827	27.50	38.52	21.25	7.70	3.45	1.60          The data indicates that there has been overall improvement in ground water level in the country during November 2021 and 2020 when compared to November 2019 which is the cumulative impact of natural and several interventions of both State and Central Government including Jal Shakti Abhiyan. The State-wise Ground water level data of country during November 2021, 2020 and 2019 are given as Annexures II, III and IV.  (c)     Does not arise. (d) & (e) No specific study has been commissioned by this Ministry for the water scarcity crisis in the country.  However, The Dynamic Ground Water Resources of the country are being periodically assessed jointly by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and State Governments. As per the 2020 assessment, Total Annual Ground Water Recharge is 436 Billion Cubic Meter (BCM) and the Annual Extractable Ground Water Resource is 398 BCM. The Annual Ground Water Extraction for all uses is 245 BCM. The Stage of Ground Water Extraction, which is a measure of Annual Ground Water Extraction for all uses (irrigation, industrial and domestic uses) over Annual Extractable Ground Water Resources is 62% for the country as a whole.
