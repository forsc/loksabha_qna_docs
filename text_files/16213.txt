ANSWER




 MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT (Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ''Nishank'')   (a)        The setting up of Universities is an ongoing process. Recently two Central Universities have been established in Andhra Pradesh and one Central Tribal University is proposed in Telangana under Andhra Pradesh Re-organisation Act 2014.  However, at present there is no proposal to set up a new Central University exclusively for Archaeology, Numismatics and other related disciplines. From 12th Plan (2012-17) as approved by National Development Council (NDC), the thrust was on consolidation of the higher education system. Expansion was to be done mainly by scaling up capacity of the existing institutions in place of setting up new institutions.  (b)        No such data is centrally maintained. ***** 
