                                                        MINISTER OF LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI BHUPENDER YADAV)(a) to (f):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.*                                                   ****** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) TO (f) THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NUMBER *79 FOR 07.02.2022 REGARDING BONDED LABOUR BY SHRIMATI MANEKA SANJAY GANDHI.(a) & (b):	Bonded Labour System has been abolished by law throughout the country with effect from 25th October, 1975 by promulgation of Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Ordinance on 25th October, 1975. This was later replaced by   the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976.  As and when existence of bonded labour is detected, such persons are identified for rehabilitation. Under the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 identification, release and rehabilitation of freed bonded labour is the direct responsibility of the concerned States/Union Territories.  However, in order to assist the State Governments in the task of rehabilitation of identified and released bonded labour, a Central Sector Scheme for Rehabilitation of Bonded Labourer-2016 is in operation since 17.05.2016.  From the reports available from the State Governments, no discernible change in the prevalence of bonded labour due to Covid-19 pandemic is observed.  However, keeping in view the challenges posed by the successive waves of the pandemic, all State/UT Governments have been directed to prepare a State Action Plan for preventing and rehabilitating victims of bonded labour and labour trafficking. (c) & (d):	The State-wise break-up of identified cases of bonded labour from  2015 to 2021 is as under:Year	State/UT	Bonded Labour identified and rehabilitated2015-16	Uttar Pradesh	22162016-17	Bihar	1792	Jharkhand	118	Odisha	258	Uttar Pradesh	258	Karnataka	1812017-18	Bihar	461	Karnataka	1500	Uttar Pradesh	3492	Rajasthan	159	Madhya Pradesh	02	Chhattisgarh	57	Odisha	7422018-19	Uttar Pradesh	741	Bihar	238	Assam	12	Puducherry	9	Chhattisgarh	12762019-20	       -	    -2020-21	Assam	1	Bihar	220	Madhya Pradesh	34	Rajasthan	49	West Bengal	162021-22	Bihar	154	Tamilnadu	876	Chhattisgarh	250	Rajasthan	50(e):		The amount spent for the rehabilitation of Bonded Labourers from 2015 to 2021 is given below:	(Rs. in lakh)Year	Amount spent for the rehabilitation of bonded labourers from 2015 to 20212015-16	221.602016-17	260.702017-18	664.502018-19	319.252019-20	34.752020-21	99.852021-22	296.00(f):		There exists  an institutional mechanism to address the issue of bonded labour. Standard operating procedure for identification and rescue of bonded labourers and prosecution of offender has been framed and issued to all the State Governments for strengthening the prosecution machinery.  Regular sensitization programmes and coordination with the field level functionaries such as District Magistrate/Superintendent of Police/Labour Department officials at the district and State level are held under the aegis of National Human Rights Commission and State Human Rights Commissions.*******
