                                                        ANSWER  THE MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a): The State-wise and gender-wise data of the total number of differently abled children in the age group of 0-19 as per Census 2011 and as provided by Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is Annexed.(b) to (d): The Government has enacted the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act, 2011) for empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) which came into force on 27.12.2016. The Act provides various rights and entitlements for PwDs and mandates the appropriate Govt. to take specific steps to ensure that PwDs including Children with Disabilities (CwDs) enjoy their rights equally with others. The Act mandates protection of CwDs from exploitation, violence, abuse and also confers their rights to live with home and family. It provides for free education upto the age of 18 yrs for CwDs in Special School or a neighborhood school of his choice.  Relief to the disabled is a State subject by virtue of entry 9 of State list of Constitution of India. However, the Central Govt. supplements the efforts of the State Govt. through various schemes & programmes for empowerment of PwDs. Some of the major schemes of Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment for empowerment/rehabilitation of PwDs, including CwDs, are as under:(i)    Assistance to Disabled Persons for Purchase/Fitting of Aids and Appliances (ADIP): the main objective of the scheme is to assist the poor persons with disabilities in procuring durable, sophisticated and scientifically manufactured, modern, standard aids and appliances that can promote their physical, social and psychological rehabilitation by reducing the effects of disabilities and enhance their economic potential. Under the scheme there is a provision to provide cochlear implant to eligible children upto 5 years of age at a cost up to Rs.6.00 lakh per child. (ii)   Scholarship schemes: The Ministry provides scholarship for students with disabilities (under 18) such as Pre-matric (for class IX & X), Post-matric (from XI class up to post graduate degree/diploma level). (iii)	Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS): Under DDRS, grant-in-aid is provided to Non-Governmental Organizations/ Voluntary Organizations for running Special Schools for children with disabilities (under 18) to provide education, vocational training, rehabilitation etc enabling them to reach and maintain their optimal, physical, sensory, intellectual, psychiatric or social functional levels.The Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing a centrally sponsored scheme i.e. “Child Protection Services” (CPS) (erstwhile Integrated Child Protection Scheme) for providing financial assistance to State Governments/UT Administrations, with the primary objective of care and protection of children in distress conditions through institutional and non-institutional care. The primary responsibility of implementation of the Scheme lies with the State/UTs. As per Section 2 (14) (iv) of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act), a child who is mentally ill or mentally or physically challenged or suffering from terminal or incurable disease, having no one to support or look after or having parents or guardians unfit to take care, if found so by the Juvenile Justice Board or the Child Welfare Committee is also included as a “child in need of care and protection” (CNCP). The scheme provides for purchase of specialised equipments and materials like Psychological test materials, training materials for speech and language, teaching materials wheel chairs, crutches, etc. Under the CPS scheme, the Ministry provides financial support for a special unit of 10 children for children with Special Needs @ Rs.10.48 lakhs (per annum). *** AnnexureAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.1121 for answer on 22.11.2019 regarding ‘Differently Abled Children’.State-wise and Gender-wise data of total number of differently abled children in age group of 0-9 years as per Census 2011S.
