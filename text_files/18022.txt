                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	The Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) in partnership with UNDP launched Youth Co:Lab,  to empower and invest in youth. This is done to accel¬erate the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through youth leadership, social innovation and entre¬preneurship.  Youth Co:Lab attempts to create a network of networks and engage the diverse stakeholders so that young people are empowered to become social entrepreneurs and thus contribute in meeting the SDGs. Youth Co:Lab via its challenge based approach offers capacity building workshops, design thinking workshops, mentoring support, networking opportunities, corporate connections and peer learning within India.The efforts of UNDP and AIM, NITI Aayog are directed at supporting young people with an emphasis on the following overarching priorities: catalysing youth innovation, empowering young people via technology, fostering youth inclusion, promoting youth leadership, and promoting social entrepreneurship.Youth Co:Lab leveraged the nation-wide network of Atal Incubator Centres (AICs) and Established Incubator Centres  (EICs) in 2019 to conduct a series of sub-nationals in states and the top 30 teams were identified via these sub-nationals who moved on to the National Youth Challenge.No sub-national was held in Haryana last year as we were conducting the National Youth Challenge in Delhi itself. (b)	Launched in India in 2019, Youth Co:Lab focussed on identifying and scaling solutions on select SDGs –•	SDG 5 (Gender Equality)•	SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation)•	SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)•	SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth)•	SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production)•	SDG 13 (Climate Action) This year, the theme is to focus on youth led innovation for COVID-19 recovery to #BuildBackBetter on issues that are important, now even more so as COVID-19 has deepened inequalities impacting India’s SDG progress.Youth Co: Lab India invites social enterprises and innovative non-profits that are 0-3 years old since registration. This year, the solutions shall be focussed on Youth Innovation for Education, Skills and Employment, Youth Innovation for Improving Access, Youth Innovation for Green Economy and Sustainable Cities, Youth Innovation for Mental Health and Youth Innovation for Gender Equality.As these are new ideas being supported the employment via these startups may happen in the next 3 years.(c)	AIM, NITI Aayog has not provided any loan/monetary support via Youth Co: Lab.The idea of Youth Co:Lab has been holistic in nature which includes nurturing the startups via the existing incubation ecosystem of India by conducting initiatives that help in building partnerships and bring international collaboration opportunities for the benefit of its direct beneficiaries and the entire ecosystem.Youth Co:Lab is an effort made in partnership with UNDP where open innovation challenges will be launched each year to focus and support India towards meeting the SDGs.*****
