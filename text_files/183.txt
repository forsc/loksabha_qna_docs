ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR) (a) & (b) As per the information available with Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), 301 dismantlers and recyclers have been granted authorization by 18 State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/Pollution Control Committees (PCCs). These authorized dismantlers and recyclers are having equipment and facilities for environmentally sound processing of e-waste, the quantity of e-waste dismantled and recycled during 2017-18 by these authorized units was 69,414 MT.   (c) The Ministry has notified E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016 on 23rd March 2016 which supersedes the E-waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2011. The Rules were further amended for its effective implementation in March, 2018.  In the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016, various provisions have been made for sound management of e-waste in the country including the provision of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), under which producers of listed electronic and electrical equipment are responsible for collection and channelization for recycling of their end of life products. A target-based approach has been adopted on the basis of existing international best practices which indicates that a target-based mechanism ensures better implementation of the e-waste management practices. Further, collection targets have also been introduced for new producers. The producers have been given the flexibility to adopt a mechanism for implementation of EPR among various options, such as setting up collection centers or adopting a buy-back mechanism or constitute deposit refund scheme etc. Producers can also set up Producer Responsibility Organizations (PRO) or e-waste exchange as additional channel for implementation of EPR for efficient channelization of e-waste. State Governments have been entrusted with the responsibility for earmarking industrial space for e-waste dismantling and recycling facilities to undertake industrial skill development and to establish measures for protection of health and safety of workers engaged in dismantling and recycling facilities of e-waste.****
