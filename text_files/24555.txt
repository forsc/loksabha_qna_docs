                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE & FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) and (b): 	Fertilizers and pesticides are the chemicals use by the farmers in agriculture. In order to ensure supply of good quality of fertilizers to farmers, Government has promulgated the Fertilizer (Control) Order, 1985 (FCO) under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 (ECA), under which standards of various fertilizers have been prescribed. Clause 19 of FCO strictly prohibits sale of fertilizers not of prescribed standards. Any violation of the provision of FCO invokes administrative action under the FCO and penal action under the ECA. The punishment prescribed under the Act is of 3 months to 7 years.The Insecticides Act, 1968 and the Insecticides Rules, 1971 made thereunder regulate the quality of pesticides. The Insecticide Inspectors appointed by the Central and State Governments under the Act are vested with powers to search premises, seize documents, stop distribution or sale of insecticides within the area of their jurisdiction. At present, 10,672 officers of various State Governments and 191 officers of Central Government are notified as Insecticide Inspectors to check the quality of pesticides and its management. Insecticides Inspectors conduct routine/surprise investigations of manufacturing units/sale points and and take insecticide samples for analysis to ascertain the quality of insecticides. Such analysis is carried out by Insecticide Analysts appointed by Central or State Governments.  Dispute over analytical test reports are resolved through confirmatory tests in the Central Insecticides Laboratory (CIL). If insecticides samples are reported by Insecticides Analyst  to be misbranded, legal action is initiated against  the manufacturers or dealers or retailers. Show-cause notices are issued against them and prosecution for violation of provisions of Insecticides Act , 1968. The legal instruments which regulate the seed quality are Seeds Act, 1966, Seed Rules, 1968 and Seed (Control) Order, 1983. Quality regulation is achieved through compulsory labeling and voluntary certification of seeds of notified kind/varieties. The State Governments appoint Seed Inspectors and Seed Analysts.   (c):	There are 83 fertilizer testing laboratories in the country, 79 laboratories notified by the State Governments and 4 laboratories by Central Government, with total annual analyzing capacity of 1.83 lakh samples. Under the FCO, minimum educational qualifications are prescribed for the Analyst. Training at Central Fertilizer Quality Control & Training Institute is mandatory for these analysts. In respect of pesticides, 71 State Pesticide Testing Laboratories (SPTL) have been established in 25 States and 2 Union Territories with a total annual testing capacity of 77,040 samples. To supplement the resources of State/UT Governments, Central Government has established two Regional Pesticides Testing Laboratories (RPTLs) at Chandigarh and Kanpur and one Central Insecticide Laboratory (CIL) as a referral laboratory, with an annual testing capacity of 4,700 samples. There are 132 Seed Testing laboratories across the country to ensure the seed quality.The state-wise details of fertilizer quality control laboratories, pesticide testing laboratories and seed testing laboratories is enclosed at Annexure-I. The details of national and central referral seed testing labs is given at Annexure-II******
