                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	The Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana (PMAGY) is being implemented by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. Since 2009-10 with the aim of integrated development of villages having Scheduled Castes population of more than 50%. The Scheme was launched on a pilot basis during 2009-10 and 1000 villages were taken up in five States. Thereafter, in 2014-15, the Scheme was further extended to cover another 1500 villages across 11 States. In 2018-19, 4094 new villages, along with 390 villages covered earlier in 2014-15, have been taken up.(b) to (d):	The Scheme is designed on the principle of convergence with other schemes of the Central and State Governments and an infrastructure gap filling fund of Rs. 21 lakh per village is provided in case of new villages selected under PMAGY. In case of those villages which have been already covered earlier, Rs. 10 lakh per village are provided. The States are expected to converge at least 3 to 4 times of the Gap filling funds, from other Centrally Sponsored Schemes and State Schemes, or even State share, so as to saturate the village with the basic infrastructure and services. (e) & (f):	As per the evaluation of the Scheme it has succeeded in the development of the PMAGY villages. Convergence approach has been utilized effectively to fulfil the needs of the village communities as identified in the Village Development Plan (VDP) prepared with the participation of the residents.*****
