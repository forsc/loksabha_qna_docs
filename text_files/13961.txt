                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (c) Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises(MSME) is implementing Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), which is a major credit-linked subsidy programme aimed at generating self-employment opportunities through establishment of micro-enterprises in the non-farm sector. Any individual above 18 years of age is eligible to avail benefits of the program. For setting up of projects costing above Rs.10 lakh in the manufacturing sector and above Rs. 5 lakh in the business /service sector, the beneficiaries should possess at least VIII standard pass educational qualification. General category beneficiaries can avail of margin money subsidy of 25 % of the project cost in rural areas and 15% in urban areas. For beneficiaries belonging to special categories such as women/ scheduled caste/scheduled tribe/OBC /minorities, ex-serviceman, physically handicapped, North Eastern Region(NER), Hill and Border areas etc. the margin money subsidy is 35% in rural areas and 25% in urban areas. The maximum cost of projects is Rs. 25 lakh in the manufacturing sector and Rs. 10 lakh in the service sector. Benefit can be availed under PMEGP for setting up of new units only.	Khadi Village Industries Commission (KVlC) is the Nodal implementing agency at national level. The scheme is being implemented across the country, including Jammu & Kashmir through all Public Sector Banks, selected private sector banks and co-operative banks. Under this scheme, banks provide loan and the margin money subsidy is being provided by Ministry of MSME through KVIC. Further, from the financial year 2018-19 Ministry of MSME has also introduced a new component under PMEGP providing second financial assistance for expansion/upgrading the existing PMEGP/MUDRA units. Under this component, for manufacturing unit loan uptoRs.1.00 Cr. and for service/ trading unit loan upto Rs.25.00 lakh with subsidy of 15% (20% for NER and hilly state) can be availed.	Any activity (barring a few indicated in the negative list of PMEGP guidelines) can be taken up under PMEGP, broadly in the areas as mentioned below: i. Agro Based & Food Processing Industry (ABFPI),ii. Forest Based Industry (FBI)iii. Mineral Based Industry (MBI),	iv. Polymer & Chemical Based industry (PCBI),v. Rural Engineering & Bio Technology Industry (REBTI),vi. Handmade Paper &Fibre Industry (HMPFI), and Services & Textiles.	Women are thus covered as special category under PMEGP and are entitled to higher rate of subsidy. As per the budgetary guidelines, Ministry of MSME is required to spend atleast 30% of the budget on women in its schemes. Under PMEGP, 35 to 40% of the total margin money subsidy is disbursed to women.
