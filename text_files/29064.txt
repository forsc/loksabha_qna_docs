ANSWER




(a) : The Hon''ble Prime Minister has announced PM CARES for Children scheme to support children who have lost both parents or surviving parent or legal guardian or adoptive parents due to COVID-19 pandemic. The scheme is accessible through an online portal i.e.  pmcaresforchildren.in. The applications of such children are uploaded on the portal by the State / UT Governments.  As on 02.12.2021, 5491 applications have been uploaded on the portal out of which, 3049 applications have been approved by District Magistrates after due process and 483 applications are pending for approval.    (b)  : Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) does not maintain information pertaining to the number of children adopted without the involvement of the CARA.  (c) to (e) : States and UTs have been requested to take immediate action for care and protection of children adversely impacted by COVID 19, in accordance with the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 and Rules thereunder, while leveraging the facilities funded under the Child Protection Services scheme.  The Ministry also issued advisories and guidelines for encouraging COVID appropriate behaviour, monitoring of Child Care Institutions and coping strategies during COVID times for mental health support to children and care givers.  A responsibility matrix defining role of primary duty holders at all levels from State to Panchayati Raj Institutions was also shared with States/UTs.  *****
