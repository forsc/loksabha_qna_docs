MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b) :	Yes, Sir.  17 Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) in Bihar namely Bela, Harnaut, Jhajha, Lakhisarai, Buxar, Motihari, Siwan, Banka, Chhapra, AFS (Purnia), CRPF (Jhaphan), Gopalganj, Hajipur, Darbhanga, Baruni, Aurangabad and Maharajganj are running in temporary buildings.  (c ) & (d) :	Construction of permanent buildings for KVs in a continuous process which depends upon various factors such as identification of suitable land, completion of lease formalities in favour of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) by the sponsoring authorities, submission of drawings/estimates by the construction agency, as well as availability of funds etc.  At 3 locations where land has been transferred in favour of KVS, the construction work has already commenced.  In the remaining 14 locations, including Gopalganj, the matter is regularly followed up with the concerned sponsoring authorities.  Despite persistent follow up through video conferences and through various communications sent to the State Government as well as the District Administration of Gopalganj and the remaining locations, the requisite extent of land has not been transferred in favour of KVS.*****
