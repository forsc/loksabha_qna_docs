                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (d): ‘Public Health’ and ‘Hospitals’ being State subjects, it is primarily the State Governments/Union Territories (UTs) that make efforts for increasing the bed strength of hospitals in their States/UTs. However, the Central Government provides assistance to the State Governments in order to provide better health care facilities to people through various schemes including under National Health Mission (NHM). The Central Government has set up 6 new All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) at Jodhpur, Bhopal, Bhubaneshwar, Rishikesh, Raipur and Patna under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY). This has augmented the bed capacity in these areas. The current bed strength of these 6 New AIIMS and other major functional Central Government Hospitals/ Autonomous Institutes under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is at Annexure-I.
