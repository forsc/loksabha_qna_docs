ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a): 	The ‘One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan’ under Public Distribution System (PDS) reforms allows all National Food Security Act (NFSA) beneficiaries, particularly migrant NFSA beneficiaries, to claim either full or part foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) in the country through existing ration card and biometric authentication in a seamless manner. The facility also allows their family members back home, if any, to also claim the balance foodgrains on same ration card. Thus, empowering all NFSA beneficiaries with seamless food-security, anywhere in the Country. Through this technology driven system, the ration card details and entitlements are available online on any electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) device in the country. ..........2/--2-(b): 	So far, a total of Rs. 88 Lakh are released to the State Government of Assam for the implementation of the One Nation One Ration Card plan in the State. (c): 	The main enablers of technology driven ONORC plan are the digitization of ration cards, Aadhaar seeding of beneficiaries, installation of ePoS devices at the FPSs and opertionalisation of biometrically authenticated FPS transactions. So far, in Assam all NFSA ration cards data is digitized. Aadhaar generation and seeding with ration cards is very low in the State, and the State Government has not yet started the installation of ePoS devices at the FPSs. Thus, rollout of ONORC in the State depends upon the technical readiness of the State to implement the same.(d) & (e): 	During the COVID-19 pandemic, migrant NFSA beneficiaries in most States/UTs availed foodgrains with flexibility from any location wherever they were during the lockdown and period of crisis. During the period, April 2020 to February 2021, a total of about 15.4 Crore portability transactions have been carried out across the States/UTs under ONORC plan. The freedom of choosing any FPS under ONORC is a tremendous value-added service to each NFSA beneficiary.(f): 	The facility of One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) as a flexible mechanism for delivery of subsidized foodgrains to beneficiaries anywhere in the country is equally beneficial to all beneficiaries covered under NFSA in the country (including Assam). Since the Act provides coverage for all eligible poor & needy persons, vulnerable sections of the society including destitute, disabled persons, etc. by the respective State/UT Government up to their ceiling limit of NFSA coverage, the ONORC benefit is also available to all such beneficiaries possessing NFSA ration cards. *****
