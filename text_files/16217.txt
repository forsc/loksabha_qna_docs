The G20 has agreed for considering defensive measures against those jurisdictions who do not comply with such standards. The G20 has also endorsed the Outline of the Architecture of a Unified Approach on Pillar One as the basis for negotiations and has welcomed the Progress Note on Pillar Two, both of which were agreed by the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS).The G20 has stressed the importance of the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework on BEPS agreeing on the key policy features of a global and consensus based solution for addressing the tax challenges arising from digitalization by July 2020. There was also a consensus on supporting tax capacity building in developing countries.(e) India is participating in the ongoing work being undertaken in the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) for addressing the tax challenges arising from digitalization.
