ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c): As informed by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), melamine is a chemical compound that has a number of non-food industrial uses, including the production of laminates, glues, dinnerware, adhesives, moulding compounds, coatings and flame retardants. Melamine has no known food uses. However, melamine and its structural analogues can contaminate foods due to widespread non-food use of melamine as mentioned.		FSSAI has specified maximum limits of melamine in foods, including infant foods and milk, to address the issue of incidental presence of melamine as a contaminant. These limits are set on the basis of a proper risk assessment and aligned with the Codex Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Food and Feed (CODEX STAN 193-1995) which are considered to be referral standards globally. (d) & (e): Indian Council of Medical Research has informed that it has not carried out any study on harmful effects of using melamine in protein rich dry milk in the country.
