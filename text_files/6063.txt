                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c):	The top five claims for Hospital admissions for medical procedures under Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) are given below :-1.	PTCA - single stent (medicated, inclusive of diagnostic angiogram)2. Hemodialysis per sitting3. High Risk Delivery4. Cataract with foldable hydrophobic acrylic IOL by Phaco emulsification tech5. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)The procedures mentioned at sl. no. (2), (3), and (4) above are covered in national programme. Treatment for most diseases/conditions is available free at public hospitals. Still, a large number of people including those from poor and vulnerable sections have to incur out of pocket expenditure to get treatment particularly for Secondary and Tertiary care hospitalization given India’s large population. In order to provide health protection to poor and vulnerable sections, 1393 treatment packages have been approved under AB-PMJAY.Since the launch of AB-PMJAY, feedback on certain aspects of benefit packages such as terminology, duplication and any anomalies like repetition of packages, different rates for same procedures in different specialities etc., have been received and National Health Authority is reviewing this feedback for possible rationalization, if required.
