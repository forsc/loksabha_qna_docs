ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): Airfare regulation was dispensed with the repeal of Air Corporation Act in March, 1994. Under the provision of Sub Rule (1) of Rule 135 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937, every air transport undertaking engaged in scheduled air services require to establish tariff having regard to all relevant factors, including cost of operation, characteristic of services, reasonable profit and the general prevailing tariff. The fare so established are required to be displayed by airlines on their respective websites. The airlines are compliant to the regulatory provision as long as fare charged by them is in line with fare displayed on their website. Due to suspension of operation of Jet Airways and grounding of Boeing B737 Max, there was a reduction  in capacity in few domestic sectors. With a view to maintain transparency, as advised by Ministry, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) started monitoring of airfares on certain routes selected on random basis to ensure that the airlines do not charge airfares outside the range declared by them. During monitoring, it was observed that though there was a marginal hike in airfares,  it remained within the fare brackets established. Subsequently, some of the domestic airlines started inducting more aircrafts in their fleets which resulted in an increase in the capacity on the domestic sectors as a result of which fares are observed to be fairly normalized at present.Sale of domestic air tickets is the commercial matter of the airlines.
