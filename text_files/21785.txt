To make the programme more effective, Government has taken steps to strengthen nutritional content, delivery, outreach and outcomes with focus on developing practices that nurture health, wellness and immunity to disease and malnutrition. Steps have also been taken to improve nutritional quality and testing in accredited labs, strengthen delivery and leverage technology to improve governance. States/UTs have been advised to ensure that the quality of supplementary nutrition conforms to prescribed standards laid down under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and regulations made there under. A programme to support development of Poshan Vatikas at Anganwadi centres to meet dietary diversity gap and leveraging of traditional knowledge and AYUSH practices has also been taken up.(d)       During COVID-19, all Anganwadi Centres across the country were closed to limit the impact of the pandemic. However, to ensure continuous nutritional support to Anganwadi beneficiaries, Anganwadi Workers and Helpers distributed Supplementary Nutrition at the doorsteps of beneficiaries once in 15 days. In addition, Anganwadi Workers and Anganwadi Helpers have assisted the local administration in community surveillance, creating awareness as well as other work assigned to them from time to time. *****
