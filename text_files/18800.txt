                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) & (e):	National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) is the Central Agency which compiles the data on crimes as reported by States and Union Territories  and  publishes  the  same  in  its  annual  publication  “Crime in -2-L.S.US.Q.NO.213 FOR 02.02.2021India”. The latest published report is of the year 2019.   The National Crime Record Bureau does not maintain any specific data on arrests and/or detention of civil right activists. Therefore, making any inference regarding trend of arrest and/or detention in this regard is not possible. (b) to (d):	The Government of India has taken note of the Press Release dated 20th October, 2020 issued by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the restrictions on human right NGOs and arrests of activists in India and has responded to it appropriately. Further, there are adequate safeguards available under the Constitution of India and various statutes including the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, for ensuring protection of human rights. ********
