The PLFS was launched with an objective of measuring quarterly changes of various labour market statistical indicators in urban areas as well as generating the annual estimates of these indicators for rural and urban areas. Rural Unemployment rate (in percent) according to usual status (ps+ss) from past Employment and Unemployment surveys conducted during 1972-73 to 2011-12 and Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) conducted during 2017-18 and 2018-19 are given in the Table below:                                  All IndiaRound	                   Rural(year)	                Male	Female(1)	                 (2)	(3) PLFS   (2018-19)	5.6	3.5PLFS   (2017-18)	5.8	3.868th   (2011-12)	1.7	1.766th   (2009-10)	1.6	1.661st   (2004-05)	1.6	1.855th   (1999-00)	1.7	1.050th   (1993 94)	1.4	0.943rd   (1987 88)	1.8	2.438th   (1983)	        1.4	0.732nd   (1977 78)	1.3	2.027th   (1972 73)	1.2	0.5 Source:1. Annual Report, PLFS: 2017-182.

These surveys are designed to collect information regarding expenditure on consumption of goods and services consumed by households. The Monthly Per Capita Consumer Expenditure     (MPCE) in rural areas from Household Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted during 2011-12 is  1429.96. (Source: NSS Report No. 555: Level and Pattern of Consumer  Expenditure, 2011-12) (b) & (c): The Government of India is undertaking a number of interventions for integrated and sustainable rural development through employment generation, strengthening of livelihood opportunities, promoting self-employment, skilling of rural youths, provision of social assistance, infrastructure development etc.  The schemes such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), DeenDayal Upadhyay – Gramin Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), Pradhan Mantri Gram SadakYojana (PMGSY), Shyama Prasad Mukherjee RuRBAN Mission, National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) and Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) among others are being implemented in the country.                                               *****
