                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)& (b) No proposal related to Venkatachalam-Kodur Ghat road project has been received in the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change so far for prior approval under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 orfor Environment Clearance.As and when a proposal complete in all respect is received in the Ministry, the same is considered expeditiously as per norms. To enhance transparency and speed, the Ministry has launched an online platform namely, ‘PARIVESH’ for submission of proposals seeking Environment Clearance or approval under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 for forest clearance etc.Moreover, to reduce delay in processing of all linear proposals including those for roads involving non-forestry use of forest land under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, the power to consider and approve such proposals has been delegated to the Regional Offices of the Ministry.***
