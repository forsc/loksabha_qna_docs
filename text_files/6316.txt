ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) & (b) A Group of Ministers (GoM) on Analysis of Revenue from GST has been constituted on the recommendation of GST Council to suggest suitable measures/policy intervention for course correction for revenue augmentation, particularly for the States suffering high revenue shortfall. It is further submitted that the Government has also constituted a Committee of Officers(CoO) in October, 2019 to suggest measures to augment GST revenue. The Committee will look into issues such as systemic changes in GST to prevent misuse, measures to expand tax base, improved compliance monitoring and anti-evasion measures using better data analytics and better administrative coordination. (c) & (d): No Sir.(e) Gross GST collection in September, 2019 was ?91,916 crores, showing a Month on Month decline of 2.67%. The GST collection in any particular month would depend upon the total taxable value of goods or services or both supplied in that month. However, it can be seen that the average GST collection in the FY 2019-20 (April to October) has been Rs. 1,00,239 cr which is higher than the average GST collection of Rs. 96,945 cr in FY 2018-19(April to October).
