ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES(SHRI NITIN GADKARI)(a) to (d):    Department of Financial Services has informed that :•	RBI has permitted a term-loan moratorium and working capital interest deferment w.e.f. 01.03.2020 to 31.8.2020 along with an asset classification standstill for this period and other measures to enhance liquidity. As such there would normally not be any occasion for MSMEs to slip into NPA during this period owing to default in repayment of their dues during this period unless they had chosen not to avail of the moratorium.•	With a view to facilitate meaningful restructuring of MSME accounts that have become stressed, on 1.1.2019, RBI had permitted a one-time restructuring of existing loans to GST-registered MSME as well as MSMEs units that are exempted from GST-registration, with an aggregate exposure of up to Rs. 25 crore classified as ‘standard’ without a downgrade in the asset classification, subject to certain conditions, with the implementation of the restructuring to be completed before 31.3.2020. On 11.2.2020, RBI extended the scheme till 31.12.2020 for entities that were in default but ‘standard’ as on 1.1.2020. Further on 6.8.2020, RBI has extended the scheme till 31.3.2021 for entities that were in default but ‘standard’ as on 1.3.2020, and the window for restructuring has been extended till 31.03.2021. •	Further on 6th August, 2020, RBI has also provided a window under the “Prudential Framework on Resolution of Stressed Assets dated June 7, 2019” to enable lenders to implement a resolution plan in respect of eligible corporate exposures exceeding Rs. 25 crore,  which were not more than 30 days past due as on 01.03.2020 and where the stress is on account of Covid-19 pandemic, to be invoked not later than 31st December, 2020 and implemented within 180 days thereafter.
