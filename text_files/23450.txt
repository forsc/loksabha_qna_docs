                                                                                                     ANSWER                    MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT                                   (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)&(b): The Department of Land Resources is implementing Digital India Land Records Modernization Programme (DILRMP) with the objective of developing an Integrated Land Information Management System (ILIMS) across the country. Although ILIMS includes integration of land records with Aadhaar, it is not an approved component under DILRMP. The Department has, therefore, issued advisories on 9.3.2017 and 23.8.2019 to all States/Union Territories to integrate Aadhaar with land records and use consent based Aadhaar authentication in the registration process using their own resources. So far, ILIMS has been developed in 139 districts and substantial progress on linkage of land records with Aadhaar has also been achieved in more than 10 States/UTs.(c)  Integration of Aadhaar with land records will help in bringing transparency in transaction of land, houses, other properties besides, facilitating benefits of Government Schemes that inter-alia includes fertilizer subsidy, credit subsidy to farmers, DBT for crop insurance, Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Yojana etc.                                             *****
