ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS[SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR](a) to (e) : In the pre GST era, the entertainment tax levied on Cinema Exhibition varied from State to State. The weighted average of entertainment tax on admission to cinema, based on Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) data, was more than 30%. Representations have been received from the Producers Guild of India and others inter alia requesting for reduction in the GST rate on cinema exhibition. On the recommendations of the GST Council, the GST rate on service by way of admission to cinema exhibition has been reduced w.e.f. 01.01.2019 to 12%, if the price of admission ticket is upto Rs. 100 and to 18%, if the price of admission ticket is above Rs. 100. The rationalisation of GST rates has been widely welcomed by the film industry.  *****
