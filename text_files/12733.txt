                                                        MINISTER FOR CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D.V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a): 	The details of fertilizers are being imported in the country through various ports of  the country during the last three years is as per Annexure-‘A’.(b) :	The import of Urea for direct agriculture use on Government account through State Trading Enterprises (STEs) namely MMTC Limited (MMTC) and State Trading Corporation Limited (STC) under the Foreign Trade Policy of the Government. Government is also importing approximately 20 Lakh Metric Tonnes urea from Oman India Fertiliser Company (OMIFCO) under a Long Term Urea Off Take Agreement (UOTA) between GOI & OMIFCO. The STEs wise import of Urea is as under:Year	  From OMIFCO	  Through STE   Total Urea Imported through STE	Total Urea imported	    (LMT)	IPL	MMTC	STC	NFL	RCF	        (LMT)	(LMT)2016-17	    20.02	4.37	16.35	14.07	-	-	         34.79	54.812017-18	    20.93	17.31	13.13	-	4.01	4.37	         38.82	59.752018-19	    19.51	11.21	44.09	-	-	-	          55.30	74.81 Import of fertilizers other than Urea is free, commonly known as Open General Licence (OGL). Various companies/agencies import these fertilizers as per their commercial judgment.  The agencies wise import of fertilizers other than Urea is as per Annexure- ‘B’. The country wise import of fertilizer other than Urea is as per Annexure – ‘C’.(c) & (d): The month-wise demand is assessed and projected by the Department of Agriculture & Co-operation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) in consultation with the State Governments before commencement of each cropping season. On the basis of month-wise & State-wise projection given by DAC&FW, Department of Fertilizers allocates sufficient/adequate quantities of fertilizers to States by issuing monthly agreed supply plan as per the Fertilizer (Movement Control) Order, 1973. The gap between demand (requirement) and production is met through import.	Import of Urea is done either through designated STEs on Government account as per the MoU signed between Department of Fertilizers and STEs or under the long term agreement of OMIFCO. The ports are decided based upon the various options given by the STE based on global tendering and the requirement of different regions.  In case of Urea imported from OMIFCO under UOTA, the ports are decided by Coo9rdination Committee (with representatives of DoF, IFFCO & KRIBHCO) keeping into consideration the requirement of different regions etc.   The import of other fertilizers is under OGL and the decision to import is taken by fertilizers companies on commercial consideration.  The supply of fertilizers in the country is done by the fertilizers companies as per the agreed supply plan so as to ensure adequate and timely availability of fertilizers to each nook and corner.. The State Governments are regularly advised to coordinate with manufacturers and importers of fertilizers for streamlining the supplies through timely placement of indents.*******
