Accordingly,  as against the allocated target of 2.63 crore houses till the Financial Year 2021-22, 1,99,78,958 houses have been sanctioned and 1,50,09,632 houses have been constructed.  (e)& (f) During the period of Covid-19 pandemic induced nation-wide lockdown, all construction activities including construction of houses under PMAY-G were also affected. It resulted in retarding the pace of construction of PMAY-G houses.

The States/UTs have been requested to expedite the completion of houses approved under PMAY-G. Other steps taken including timely allocation of targets to the States/UTs under PMAY-G, provision of adequate funds and promotion of eco-friendly &innovative technologies for house construction, follow up with the States to ensure provision of land to landless beneficiaries in rural areas, expeditious resolution of technical issues faced by the State, advisory to all States/UTs to resume activities under PMAY-G with due Covid-19 protocol and regular review of progress at the level of Ministry to ensure timely completion of targeted houses.
