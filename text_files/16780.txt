ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) :     	The list of thermal power plants older than 20 years which have not submitted plan to adhere to the prescribed emission control norms is enclosed. These plants would be shutdown or retired as per Phasing out plan and time lines given by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC).  The performance of Thermal Power Plants (TPPs) depend on its operation & maintenance, condition of equipment, technology of plant, technical parameters, station heat rate, quality of fuel etc. rather than the age of the plant. (b):      	No, Sir, in the old thermal power plants fixed cost is negligible due to depreciation (c) :      	No, Sir.(d) :   		In view of reply to (c) above, not applicable. However, in order to move towards sustainable, clean and efficient source of energy, Government has taken the following steps:i.	Government has set an ambitious target of 175 GW Renewable energy (100 GW of Solar, 60 GW of Wind, 10 GW of biomass and 5 GW of small hydel) target by 2022.ii.	India has submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. In its INDC, India has pledged to improve the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030 below 2005 levels. It has also pledged to increase the share of non-fossil fuels-based electricity to 40 per cent by 2030. iii.	The main focus of coal based generation has been the efficiency improvement with use of higher steam parameters and this has led to reduced fuel consumption and reduced Green House Gas (GHG) emissions.iv.	Adoption of Supercritical Plants in Thermal Power Plants to enhance the efficiency of coal fired power generation, decrease coal consumption and lesser CO2 emissions.v.	New Emission norms for coal based Thermal Power Plants (TPP) have been notified by MoEF&CC on 7th December, 2015 and directions have been issued by CPCB under section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to all TPP to comply with the new emission standards.****************
