                                                        THE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a)	to (e) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 93* FOR 3RD DECEMBER, 2021(a) to (e) The National Regulator i.e. Central Drugs Standard Organization, has approved, the shelf life of 9 months for Covishield vaccine, for Covaxin vaccine it is 12 months and for ZyCoV-D vaccine it is 6 months from the date of manufacture. The COVID-19 vaccines have been developed very recently, therefore, scientific evidence is still evolving globally regarding the duration of protection. Government of India closely monitors COVID-19 vaccine stocks in States/UTs so as to ensure their Optimal utilization. COVID-19 Vaccine stock which has not been utilised in private hospitals and nearing expiry has been taken up for redistribution by respective State Government, as advised by Government of India, for its timely utilization.Regarding administration of booster doses, the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) and the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) are deliberating and considering scientific evidences related to this aspect. Under ‘Mission COVID Suraksha- the Indian COVID-19 Vaccine Development Mission’, being implemented by Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) of Department of Biotechnology (DBT), efforts have been made to strengthen COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing capabilities of Indian industry, so as to ensure optimal vaccine production.In this regard, augmentation of manufacturing facilities was supported at Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL) and Indian Immunologicals Limited (IIL), Hyderabad. Indian Immunologicals Limited (IIL), supported under the Mission, has achieved a production capacity of ~20 lakh doses/month equivalent Drug Substance (DS) of COVAXIN®. The validation of the BBIL facility at Malur, Bengaluru is complete and production of Drug Substance (DS) started in August 2021. Further, support for facility augmentation at Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals Corporation Limited (BIBCOL), Bulandshahr; and Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation Ltd (HBPCL), Mumbai; for COVAXIN® production is under consideration. An amount of Rs. 260 Cr. has been allocated to support facility up-gradation for augmented COVAXIN® production, out of which, an amount of Rs. 27.25 Cr. has been disbursed so far. Additionally, DBT along with the PSU BIRAC, is facilitating expert advisory support for facility up-gradation at Gujarat COVID Vaccine Consortium (GCVC), for augmented production of COVAXIN®.In the current financial year i.e. 2021-22, INR 35,000 crore has been budgeted for implementation of COVID-19 Vaccination Programme. As on 27th November 2021, an expenditure of INR 19,675.46 crore has been incurred against this allocation which has been utilized for procurement of COVID-19 vaccine for free of cost supply to State/UTs.*******
