ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; AND MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR):(a) to (b):- Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Government of India, set up  Film Facilitation Office (FFO) with a view to promote and facilitate film shootings by foreign filmmakers in India in November 2015. It acts as a single-window facilitation and clearance mechanism that eases filming in India as well as endeavoring to create a film-friendly ecosystem and promoting the country as a filming destination.  A dedicated web portal, www.ffo.gov.in, has been set up with the objective to disseminate information on filming facilities available in the various States of India. 	This will help foreign filmmakers to have information about the geographical conditions, important tourist destinations, shooting locations and other information related to Media and Entertainment Sector in India. (c)	The numbers of foreign films that have been accorded permissions for shooting in India from 1.4.2016 to 31.3.2019 are as under:2016-17: 312017-18: 312018-19: 19Hon’ble Prime Minister has announced that facility of web portal which is available to foreign filmmakers should also be available for Indian filmmakers also.  (d) As far as Indian filmmakers are concerned, no application was received upto March, 2019 due to following reasons:-  (i) 	Majority of the State Governments are not having enabling environment to grant single window online clearances for shooting permissions for Indian filmmakers as there are many authorities dealing with the issues like Local Urban Body, RTO, Police and Archaeological Department, Forest Department to name few.  (ii) Film permissions in majority of the Indian states need permissions from multifarious Government Departments which need to be minimized and rationalised so that they all work to issue permission in time bound manner to facilitate filmmakers for doing business and filming in the States in shortest possible time. (iii) However, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has made best efforts to take all State Governments on board for creating and enabling environment and other support required for Media and Entertainment industry.  Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has taken proactive measures to request various Central Government Ministries to help to facilitate shooting permission within shortest possible time and Animal Welfare Board of India, Archaeological Survey of India, Directorate General of Civil Aviation, Airports Authority of India, Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change, Ministry of Railways, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs have agreed to provide support. FFO has already provided URL, Login ID and Password to all the State Nodal officers through which the Nodal Officers can access the application from a filmmaker seeking permission to film in their respective Department of States and upload the permission, after getting all the clearances.
