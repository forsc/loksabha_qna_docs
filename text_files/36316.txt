ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) & (b) :	As reported by the States, a total of 2.817 crore households have been electrified in the country including 41,317 households in Gujarat up to its closure as on 31.03.2021, since the launch of Saubhagya scheme.The power demand of Gujarat is manifested as part of the Energy Requirement and the Peak Demand of the State.  As per the information given by the State, the details of Power Supply Position of Gujarat, in terms of Energy and Peak, during the years 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 and the current year i.e. 2021-22 (period April, 2021 to February, 2022) are given at Annexure-I.(c) to (f) :	Adequate grid capacity is available in the country to meet the demand of power. The details of All India Power Supply position, in terms of Energy and Peak, during the years 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 and the current year i.e. 2021-22 (period April, 2021 to February, 2022) are given at Annexure-II.As on 28.02.2022, the installed generation capacity is around 395.6 GW which is sufficient to meet the demand of electricity in the country.  The peak demand experienced during the current year was only 203 GW. India has robust transmission grid capacity with five Regional Grids interconnected through synchronous links forming One Nation - One Grid - One Frequency system, thereby enabling smooth flow of power from surplus regions to deficit regions, as is reflected by the marginal gap between demand and supply of power. The expansion of grid capacity is planned commensurate with the requirement of meeting the growing demand of electricity. A total of 63,570 cKms of transmission lines, transformation capacity of 2,68,102 MVA have been added in the country since FY 2018-19 till 28.02.2022 for evacuation of power from generating stations to load centres. The Inter-regional transmission capacity has also been increased by 25,800 MW since FY 2018-19 to a total capacity of 1,12,250 MW as on 28.02.2022. The measures taken to increase the power generation are given at Annexure-III.************
