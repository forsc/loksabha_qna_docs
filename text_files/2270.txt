ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a)  to  (d): The  Government, in October 2014, issued  Policy Guidelines on setting up of Air Freight Stations (AFSs), which are off-airport common user facilities for handling international  air  cargo. The objectives are broadly two-fold: reaching out to hinterland regions of the country and de-congesting the congested air cargo terminals in gateway international airports that face high dwell time.   The Air Freight Station provides an option to exporters and importers to avail of either airport cargo terminal facilities or off-airport AFS facilities  for processing of air cargo based on various commercial and market-based considerations, including differences in applicable charges. Airports Authority of India Cargo Logistics & Allied Services (AAICLAS), Chennai airport is already extending 50% reduction in import handling charges to AFS clearance.
