BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (d):	Antimicrobial resistance is a multifaceted problem with significant consequences for individuals as well as Health Care Systems. To capture the trends and pattern of AMR in India, ICMR has established an AMR surveillance and research network (AMRSN) in 2013 to monitor data on the trends and patterns of antimicrobial resistance of clinically important bacteria and fungi limited to human health from 30 tertiary hospitals. ICMR publishes this data annually and the reports are available on ICMR website.https://main.icmr.nic.in/sites/default/files/guidelines/AMRSN_annual_report_2020.pdf Further, The National AMR Surveillance reports for 2019 and 2020 generated under the National programme on AMR Containment, show no significant difference in the AMR trends.MoH&FW has taken several steps to address the issue of AMR. Some of the steps are:•	National programme on AMR containment was launched during 12th FYP in 2012-17 and coordinated by National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). Under this programme National AMR surveillance network for capacity building of State medical college labs has been established.•	National action plan on containment of Antimicrobial Resistance (NAP-AMR) was launched in 19th April 2017 •	National Treatment Guidelines: Guidelines for antimicrobial use in infectious diseases have been developed.****
