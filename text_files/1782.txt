                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (e):	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT (a) to (e) REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *147 TO BE ANSWERED ON 02.07.2019.(a) & (b):	Yes, Sir. The Ministry  is implementing Aajeevika Grameen Express Yojana (AGEY), the sub-scheme under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) to facilitate transport facilities in the rural areas and also provide job opportunities to members of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) under DAY-NRLM. The scheme was launched in August, 2017. AGEY has the following two objectivesi.	To provide safe, affordable and community monitored rural transport services to connect remote villages with key services and amenities (including access to markets, education and health) for the overall economic development of the area by making use of the supports available within the framework of DAY-NRLM.ii.	To provide an alternative source of livelihoods to members of Self Help Groups (SHGs) and their families under DAY-NRLM by facilitating them to operate public transport services in backward rural areas, as identified by the States.The scheme has been approved for all 34 States/UTs and allocation of 250 blocks to the States/UTs is detailed in Annexure I.Project proposals have been approved for 22 States/UT. Presently 17 States are implementing the scheme and 730 Vehicles are operational. The details are in Annexure II.(c):	There is no separate budgetary allocation for AGEY. Under the programme, the Community Investment Fund (CIF) provided to Community Based Organisations (CBOs) under the existing provisions of DAY-NRLM are utilised for providing interest free loans to the SHG members. Till date, an amount of Rs 27.21 Cr has been spent from CIF till date for supporting the scheme. The guidelines do not specify any specific variety of vehicle but only a cost ceiling of Rs 6.50 lakhs under the scheme. The Cluster Level Federation (CLF) and Village Organization (VO’s) identify the vehicle based on the local need and commercial viability. However, based on the records available, 37% of the vehicles belong to the Light Commercial vehicle (LCV) category. 29% are E-rickshaws, 14% are Auto rickshaws, 10% are Medium Commercial Vehicle (MCV) and 10% belong to others categories.(d):	The beneficiaries are selected from among the SHG members of the DAY-NRLM network. (e):	Ministry is not implementing any scheme specially targeting development of transport facilities in rural areas. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana being implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development aims to provides all – weather road connectivity to remote locations in rural areas. *****
