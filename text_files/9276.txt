ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a) The World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) has suspended accreditation of National Dope Testing Laboratory (NDTL) w.e.f 20/08/2019 for a period of six months due to some shortcomings noted by the WADA Laboratory Expert Group during its visit in September, 2018. At the time of suspension NDTL had already complied with 38 of the 47 action points to the satisfaction of WADA. For the remaining a compliance letter to WADA had been sent in October, 2019. WADA has assured to send its Expert Group in January, 2020 to facilitate lifting of the suspension. This is not affected anti- doping and Tokyo Olympic preparations. Arrangements have been made with Anti Doping Laboratory, Qatar and samples are sent there.(b) The stage for dope testing of athletes for Tokyo Olympics has not yet come.(c) No Sir, this Ministry has not constituted any Committee to enquire into issues relating to prevalence of doping in the recent past. In July, 2011, a one member Committee of Justice Mukul Mudgal, Retired Chief Justice of High Court of Punjab and Haryana was constituted. Justice Mudgal submitted his report in May, 2012 and appropriate action was taken.(d) No doping scandal has come to the notice of the Government so far. As and when the result of dope testing is found positive for any athlete, appropriate action is taken by NADA.*****
