BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (d): Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) was established in 2008 under Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 primarily for laying down science based standards for articles of food and to regulate their manufacture, storage, distribution, sale and import to ensure availability of safe and wholesome food for human consumption.Food Safety and Standards Regulations Act 2006 and Rules and Regulations, lay down the quality and safety standards for various articles of food. Implementation and enforcement of these standards primarily lies with the State/UT Governments. Regular surveillance, monitoring, inspection and sampling of food products from all sources i.e. manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, transporters, retail markets etc. are carried out by Food Safety Officers of States/UTs and in cases of non-compliance, penal action is taken against the defaulting Food Business Operators (FBOs) as per the provisions of FSS Act, 2006, Rules and Regulations.In order to address the gaps in the food safety eco-system of States/UTs and to ensure safe and wholesome food through pooling of technical knowledge and best practices as a shared responsibility, FSSAI has signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with States/ UTs to extend both technical and financial support to the States/UT Governments. FSSAI has extended financial support to States/UTs under a Central Sector Scheme for strengthening of food testing infrastructure. FSSAI has regularly urged States/UTs to carry out targeted enforcement and surveillance drive to check adulteration in food products. As per reports received from States/UTs, details of food samples analysed, found adulterated/sub-standard/misbranded and action taken thereon during the last three years i.e. 2018-19, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 is as below: - Year	No. of Samples Analysed	No. of Samples found non-conforming	Action taken -Civil Cases 	Action taken-Criminal Cases			 No. of Cases Launched	No. of Cases decided 	No. of Convictions	 No. of Cases Launched	No. of Cases decided 	No. of Convictions2018-19	106459	30415	18550	12734	Not available	2813	NA	7012019-20	118775	29589	27412	18192	17345	4681	828	7802020-21	107829	28347	24195	15878	14817	3869	520	506 ………………
