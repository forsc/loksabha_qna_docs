ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b): Climate change is a global phenomenon and climate action is a global collective action problem that requires the cooperation of all nations based on the principles of ‘Equity’ and ‘Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities’. India is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), its Kyoto Protocol (KP) and the Paris Agreement (PA). For addressing the challenge of climate change, India adheres to the paramountcy of the UNFCCC processes. It has also proactively contributed to multilateral efforts to combat climate change and continues to do so while undertaking its own independent, enhanced initiatives in climate mitigation and adaptation besides meeting all its commitments under the UNFCCC, its KP and PA. Independent studies rate India’s efforts highly and compliant with the requirements under PA.India’s actions towards combating climate change and environmental protection arise from our traditional values and commitment to preserve the environment for the current and future generations.  The Government is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which comprises eight missions in specific areas of solar energy, energy efficiency, water, sustainable agriculture, Himalayan ecosystem, sustainable habitat, green India, and strategic knowledge on climate change. NAPCC provides an overarching framework for all climate actions.Thirty-three States/Union Territories (UTs) have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change in line with NAPCC taking into account State’s/UT’s specific issues relating to climate change. Under the PA, India has submitted its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) with the target of reducing the emissions intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 33 to 35% by 2030 from 2005 levels,  achieving about 40% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, and creating an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonne of CO2eq through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.India has taken a lead in bringing together international coalitions such as International Solar Alliance (ISA), Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), and The Leadership Group for Industry Transition (LeadIT) as well as helping other countries to address the challenge including through India-UN Development Partnership Fund. The Government seeks to address the problem of air pollution through various extant legal and promotional measures, which inter-alia, include the following:(i)	Notification of National Ambient Air Quality Standards.(ii)	Revision of emission standards for industrial sectors from time to time.(iii)	Setting up of monitoring network for assessment of ambient air quality.(iv)	Monitoring of ambient air quality at 793 locations covering 344 cities/towns in 28 States and 7 Union Territories across the country under the National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP).(v)	Launching of National Air Quality Index.(vi)	Notifications of 6 waste management rules covering solid waste, plastic waste, e-waste, bio-medical waste, construction & demolition waste and hazardous wastes issued in 2016.(vii)	Introduction of clear/alternate fuels like gaseous fuel (CNG, LPG, etc.).(viii)	Leapfrogging from BS-IV to BS-VI fuel standards.(ix)	Issuance of directions under Section 18(1)(b) of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and under Section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for controlling air pollution.(x)	Installation of on-line continuous (24x7) monitoring devices by major industries to achieve 20 to 30% reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations by 2024 The plan includes 102 non-attainment cities, across 23 States and Union Territories.(xi)	Comprehensive Action Plan (CAP) for air pollution control in Delhi and NCR(c) and (d): As per India’s third biennial update report to the UNFCCC (2021), India’s Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector was a net carbon sink in 2016 and neutralized 15% of total carbon dioxide emissions of the country in that year.Also, as per the India State of Forest Report 2019 of the Forest Survey of India, India’s forest carbon stock was 7124.6 million tonne. Carbon stock in India’s forests is increasing which is attributable to an increase in forest cover and the corresponding increase in the growing stock. ***
