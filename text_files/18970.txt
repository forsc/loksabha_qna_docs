ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS(SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN)(a) to (e)	 From April-May last year, there had been an enhanced deployment of troops and armaments by the Chinese side in the border areas and along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Western Sector. Since mid-May the Chinese side attempted to transgress the LAC in several areas of the Western Sector of the India-China border area. These attempts were invariably met with an appropriate response from us.To address the issues arising from such attempts, the two sides have been engaged in discussions through the established military and diplomatic channels. The Senior Commanders from both sides have held nine meetings on 6 June 2020, 22 June 2020, 30 June 2020, 14 July 2020, 2 August 2020, 21 September 2020, 12 October 2020, 6 November 2020 and 24 January 2021. In addition, six meetings of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China border affairs (WMCC) have also been held on 24 June, 10 July, 24 July, 20 August, 30 September and 18 December 2020.Raksha Mantri met the Chinese Defence Minister General Wei Fenghe on 4 September 2020 in Moscow. Raksha Mantri conveyed that the two sides should resolve the ongoing situation and outstanding issues in the border areas peacefully through dialogue. External Affairs Minister met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on 10 September 2020 in Moscow. Both Ministers had a frank and constructive discussion on the developments in the India-China border areas and reached a five point agreement to address the ongoing issues along the LAC. The two Foreign Ministers agreed that the current situation in the border areas is not in the interest of either side. They agreed therefore that the border troops of both sides should continue their dialogue, quickly disengage, maintain proper distance and ease tensions.***
