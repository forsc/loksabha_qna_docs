                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c):	Public health and hospitals being a State subject, the primary responsibility to provide ambulance services to their people lies with the respective State Governments/UTs. However, under the National Health Mission (NHM), technical and financial support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their healthcare systems including support for emergency medical transport of patients under Dial 108 based on the proposals made by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) within their overall resource envelope. Support is provided for both Advanced Life Support (ALS) ambulance and Basic Life Support (BLS) Ambulance. BLS is the basic model for emergency rescue services, which provides transport to patients who do not require ventilatory support or cardiac monitoring. Whereas ALS ambulances are equipped to provide advanced services including ventilatory support and cardiac monitoring.An ALS is supported for an average population of 5 Lakh and a Basic Life Support (BLS) Ambulance is supported for over one lakh population. However, if the average utilization per ambulance per day is higher than 4 (or >120 kms) for densely populated areas and 3 (or >80 kms) for Hilly areas, then the states can be provided with additional ambulances.(d):	A statement showing State/UT-wise details of ambulances operational under National Health Mission as on 30th September, 2019 is annexed.
