The broad objectives of the RKS are to serve as a consultative body to enable active citizen participation for the improvement of patient care and welfare in health facilities.  (b):   A statement showing numbers of Rogi Kalyan Samitis registered, State/UT-wise, under National Health Mission, up to   June, 2019  is given at Annexure-I.(c ):    The Rogi Kalyan Samiti (RKS) comprises of a Governing Body (GB), which is responsible for policy formulation and oversight, and an Executive Committee (EC), responsible for, implementing policy decisions and facilitating operation of patient centric services. The members of these two bodies of RKS are selected according to their ‘suggested composition’ in the RKS Guidelines, which is given at Annexure II.(d): Under National Health Mission every year  Common Review Mission (CRM) teams are directed to visit public health facilities to oversee the functioning of RKS along with implementation of various schemes and programmes in selected States.  The CRM teams’ observations indicate that RKS are receiving the untied funds every year and are making useful contributions towards improvements in provisions of healthcare services and patient amenities. However there is a need to further build the capacities of RKS members to improve the functioning of RKS. The findings of CRM are shared with States/UTs for corrective action.
