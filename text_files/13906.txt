ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)to (d): For redevelopment and restoration of forest areas in the country, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is implementing two major afforestation schemes namely National Afforestation Programme (NAP) for tree plantation in degraded forests and National Mission for a Green India (GIM) for plantation on landscape basis. The National Afforestation Programme is implemented through involvement of Joint Forest Management Committees/ Eco-Development Committees comprising of local villagers as members.  The GIM is implemented through Gram Panchayats, Gram Sabha and various Committees set up by it at village level and ward level committees/Resident Welfare Associations linked to municipal corporations and municipalities in urban areas. Tree Plantation/Afforestation is also taken up under various other schemes of Government of India such as National Bamboo Mission on non forest government and private lands, Sub-Mission on Agro forestry under National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture on farm lands, etc. In addition tree plantation is also taken up under State Plan/Non-plan schemes, and by various Departments, NGOs, Civil Societies, Corporate bodies etc.  Implementation of various afforestation measures and concerted efforts of various agencies have resulted in maintaining an increasing trend in forest and tree cover which is evident from the India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2019 released recently showing an increase of 5,188 square kilometres of forest and tree cover in the country compared to the ISFR 2017.*****
