                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):   There is no time limit specified for maximum  delay with regard to vaccination of small children. However, there is a requirement of a minimum gap of 4 weeks between two subsequent doses of a vaccine. (b)	& (c):  In case the vaccination  of pregnant women or  children gets delayed on account of any reason, earlier vaccination does not become ineffective. No revaccination is required in such a case. (d) & (e):  There is no such study proposed by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare.Government is conducting immunization intensification drives like Mission Indradhanush (MI) & Intensified Mission Indradhanush (IMI) from time to time, and the recent IMI 3.0, to improve immunization coverage and reach the missed out children. Under such drives focus is given on pockets of low immunization coverage and hard to reach areas where the proportion of unvaccinated and partially vaccinated children is reported to be higher. Besides this, regular reviews are conducted with the states/UTs to improve the immunization coverage.
