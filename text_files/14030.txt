ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b) 	Government attaches highest priority to the welfare, safety and security of Indian fishermen. Steps have been taken by Indian Coast Guard to guide Indian fishermen not to cross-over the perceived International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) through various community interaction programmes for the fishing community. The Indian Coast Guard ships also shepherd the Indian fishing boats clear from the perceived IMBL to prevent their apprehension by Maritime Security Agencies of neighbouring countries. In cases of apprehension of Indian fishermen and their fishing boats by foreign authorities, the matter is raised at the highest levels and strong protests are lodged in the countries concerned. It is reiterated to the countries concerned that the fishermen issue may be considered as a purely humanitarian and livelihood concern and there should not be any use of force under any circumstances. (c) to (e)	As soon as the cases of apprehension of Indian fishermen and their fishing boats by foreign authorities are reported, immediate steps are taken by Indian Missions/ Posts abroad towards seeking consular access from foreign governments, extending all possible assistance including legal assistance for their early release and repatriation, along with boats. Missions/ Posts abroad also approach the law enforcement agencies to complete the investigation and judicial proceedings at the earliest possible.Missions/ Posts abroad also provide logistical assistance to repair the boats, etc. if needed, with local Police.As per the information available with the Ministry, the number of Indian fishermen arrested and released during the last three years and presently detained as given below – <pre>Number of fishermen arrested during the last three yearsNumber of fishermen released during the last three yearsNumber of fishermen presently under detentionBangladesh64460638Iran17115912Pakistan13271057270Qatar1081080Sri Lanka8538494</pre>102 cases related to fishermen have been filed in foreign courts since 2017. As a result of sustained diplomatic efforts by the Government, 2779 Indian fishermen have been released by foreign Governments during the last three years. ***
