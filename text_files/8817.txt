ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(D. V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a):	Sir, the Government spent Rs. 24090.35 Cr (Rs 9260/-Cr. for imported P&K fertilizers and Rs.14820/-Cr. for indigenous P&K fertilizers) on Nutrient Based Subsidy Scheme (NBS) in the year  2018-19.(b):    Sir, at present there is no such proposal. (c):    All the claims of NBS in 2018-19 have been processed and paid, except claims amounting to Rs. 137.25 Cr. which have also been processed. The delay in payment of subsidies is attributed to non-receipt of requisite documents as per payment guidelines.(d):  The Government ensures timely delivery of subsidies; however, in case of shortage of funds if noticed, the government tries to liquidate the pending subsidy by arranging loans under a Special Banking Arrangement (SBA) with consortium of Public Sector Banks. *******
