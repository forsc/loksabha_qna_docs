ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI RAMVILAS PASWAN)(a) to (d):  	Against total stocks of 741.41 LMT (as on 01.06.2019), the total storage capacity available with Food Corporation of India (FCI), Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and the State Agencies (both owned and hired capacity), is 862.45 LMT (as on 31.05.2019) comprising 739.76 LMT in covered godowns and 122.69 LMT in Cover and Plinth (CAP) storage. As such, there is sufficient capacity for storage of central pool foodgrains at the national level. This storage capacity is primarily utilised for storage of wheat and rice.  Besides, in the case of pulses procuring States like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, the existing storage space is also utilized for storage of pulses.   ......2/--2-		In so far as sugar is concerned, sugar production in the country is carried out by more than 500 sugar mills which are also responsible for its storage. Government of India (GoI) neither procures sugar nor maintains its stocks. However, in view of surplus sugar production during sugar season 2017-18, GoI provides carrying cost to sugar mills for creation and maintenance of buffer stock of 30 LMT of sugar for one year i.e. from 01.07.2018 to 30.06.2019.		In case of edible oils, at present, no procurement is done by GoI and hence, the question of storage of edible oils by GoI does not arise.Further, Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) implements the Scheme for Integrated Cold Chain and Value Addition Infrastructure as one of the component of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana with the objective to arrest post-harvest losses of horticulture & non-horticulture produce and to provide remunerative price to farmers for their produce. Further, depending on requirement in specific areas and for modernization of the storage facilities, the Government has been implementing the following schemes for construction of godowns and silos for storage of Central Pool Stocks in the country:i.	Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) Scheme: Under this Scheme, which was formulated in 2008, storage capacity is created by private parties, Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and State Government Agencies for guaranteed hiring by Food Corporation of India (FCI). A capacity of 142.62 Lakh MT (LMT) has been created as on 31.05.2019.  Under this scheme, no funds are allocated by Government for construction of godowns and full investment is done by the private parties/CWC/State Agencies. After a godown is constructed and taken over by FCI, storage charges are paid to the investor for the guaranteed period of 9/10 years irrespective of the quantum of foodgrains stored. ii.	Central Sector Scheme (erstwhile Plan Scheme): This scheme is implemented in the North Eastern States along with a few other States. Funds are released by the Government to FCI and also directly to the State Governments for construction of godowns. A total capacity of 1,84,175 MT has been completed by FCI and State Governments during the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-17). This scheme has been extended for 3 years from 01.04.2017 to 31.03.2020. A capacity of 49,375 MT has been created by FCI & State Governments from 01.04.2017 to 31.05.2019.iii.	Construction of Steel Silos: In addition to conventional godowns, Government of India has also approved an action plan for construction of steel silos in the country for a capacity of 100 LMT in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode for modernizing storage infrastructure and improving shelf life of stored foodgrains. Against this, as on 31.05.2019, steel silos of 6.75 LMT capacity have been created.***
