ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c)	 Under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is implementing a flagship scheme known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) 2016-20 with an objective to provide skilling to one crore people under Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) across the country for four years i.e. 2016-2020. As on 12.06.2019, 52.12 lakh (appx.) candidates have been trained in the country.PMKVY 2016-20 has two components known as Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed (CSCM) being implemented by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and Centrally Sponsored State Managed (CSSM) being implemented by State Skill Development Missions (SSDMs) of the States / UTs popularly known as State- Engagement Component of PMKVY (2016-20).There is no provision of State/UT-wise allocation of fund under CSCM component while funds and corresponding physical targets have been allocated to the States/UTs under CSSM component of PMKVY 2016-20. Under CSCM component of PMKVY 2016-20, as on 12.06.2019, fund amounting to Rs. 3987.44 Cr. has been disbursed to implementing agency (i.e. NSDC). Under CSSM component, after evaluation of proposal received from of 36 States/UTs, Ministry has given in-principle approval of a total target of 20.18 lakh candidates and corresponding financial allocation of Rs. 3,050 Cr. for FY 2016-20. However, due to slow performance of States/UTs and keeping in the mind that the scheme is going to end by March’2020, the financial allocation was rationalised to Rs. 2,419 crore (approx.); out of which, as on 12.06.2019, fund amounting to Rs. 782.31 Cr. has been already disbursed to State Governments / SSDMs. The State-wise details are given at Annexure I.Under STT, the placement data is reported within 90 days of certification of trained candidate. As per data reported on SDMS (Skill Development Management System), as on 12.06.2019, 24.56 lakh candidates are certified under STT of PMKVY 2016-20. The number of candidates certified under STT of PMKVY 90 days prior i.e. upto 12.03.2019 is 21.97 lakh. Out of these candidates, as on 12.06.2019, 12.6 lakh candidates have been reported to be placed in various sectors across the country. The State/UT – wise number of candidates reported placed is given at Annexure II.(d)	PMKVY 2016-20 does not mandate the establishment of skill development centres, however, it enables large number of prospective youth for taking up Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) through accredited and affiliated training centers (TCs) throughout the country including State of Rajasthan. Under the scheme, for imparting the skill training, the accreditation and affiliation of TCs are being done under single window IT application known as SMART (Skill Management and Accreditation of Training Centres). As on 12.06.2019, there are 12,127 empanelled TCs across the country, out of which, 1,324 TCs are in State of Rajasthan. The State/UT – wise number of empanelled training centres under STT component of PMKVY 2016-20 is given at Annexure II.
