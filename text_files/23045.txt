In fact, the private health facilities that fulfil certain laid out criteria are already being used and providing vaccination as COVID-19 Vaccination Centres.The inclusion of private COVID-19 Vaccination Centres is a dynamic process, however, the number of private CVCs registered on Co-WIN till 15th March 2021 is at Annexure.
