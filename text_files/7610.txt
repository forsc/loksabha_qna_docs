MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI. RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (d): Yes Sir. An Expert Committee constituted by the University GrantsCommission (UGC) had identified 374 Educationally Backward Districts (EBDs)where Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education was less than the nationalaverage of 12.4% based on 2001 census data.Education being in the Concurrent List, creation of new institutions is theresponsibility of both Central and State Government. However, recognising the needfor central assistance, the Central Government has implemented various schemessupporting State Governments. In 2010, a Scheme for providing financial assistanceto New Model Degree Colleges in Educationally Backward Districts was launched toincrease access to higher education in EBDs. The scheme was later subsumedunder the subsequently launched Centrally Sponsored Scheme of RashtriyaUchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) which is aimed at inter-alia correcting regionalimbalances in access to higher education, especially in unserved and underservedareas by setting up quality higher educational institutions and upgrading existingones. Apart from setting up Model Degree Colleges, RUSA has also supported theEducationally Backward Districts under various other components of the schemesuch as Infrastructure Grants to Colleges and Universities, Equity Initiatives,Enhancing Excellence and Quality in select Universities etc.As on date, the Project Approval Board (PAB) of RUSA has approved anamount of Rs. 5614.256 crores, under various components of RUSA for the 374EBDs in the country.To review the progress of the scheme in States/UTs, review meetings with theState Government/UT officials and beneficiary institutions are being undertakenregularly.****
