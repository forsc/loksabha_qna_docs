The Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing a centrally sponsored scheme i.e. “Child Protection Services” (CPS) (erstwhile Integrated Child Protection Scheme) and providing financial assistance to State Governments/UT Administrations, with the primary objective of care and protection of children in distress conditions through institutional and non-institutional care. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules, 2016 framed under JJ Act, inter-alia specify standards for rehabilitation measures such as education, vocational training, counselling etc. Further CPS also provides for “After care” services after the age of 18 years to help sustain them during the transition from institutional to independent life. The Scheme provides for funds for managing the Aftercare Program by the State Child Protection Society at the State level, based on the number of districts in the State i.e.(i) 	Rs.15 lakhs to State with less than 15 districts.(ii) 	Rs.30 lakhs to State with more than 15 and less than 30 districts.(iii) 	Rs.45 lakhs to State with more than 30 districts.The Ministry does not maintain data of training given to children as the primary responsibility of implementation of the JJ Act and Scheme lies with the State/UTs.***
