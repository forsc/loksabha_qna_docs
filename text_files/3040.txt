JITENDRA SINGH)(a) & (b):  Vacant posts of reserved category candidates are not centrally maintained, as the recruitment process is carried out by the respective cadre controlling authorities through concerned recruitment agencies. However, Department of Personnel and Training monitors the progress in respect of filling up of backlog reserved vacancies for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) with ten Ministries/ Departments, having more than 90% of the employees in Central Government.As per information provided by the ten Ministries/Departments which includes their Public Sector Banks/Financial Institutions, Central Public Sector Undertakings etc., out of 92589 backlog reserved vacancies (29198 for SCs, 22829 for STs and 40562 for OBCs), 63876 backlog reserved vacancies (20975 for SCs, 15874 for STs and 27027 for OBCs) were filled up during the period from 01.04.2012 to 31.12.2016 and 28,713 backlog reserved vacancies (8223 for SCs, 6955 for STs and 13535 for OBCs) remained unfilled as on 01.01.2017. Out of these ten Ministries/Departments, five Ministries/Departments have further informed that out of 21499 backlog reserved vacancies (7532 for SCs, 6887 for STs and 7080 for OBCs), 12334 backlog reserved vacancies (4514 for SCs, 3595 for STs and 4225 for OBCs) were filled up as on 31.12.2017 and 9165 backlog reserved vacancies (3018 for SCs, 3292 for STs and 2855 for OBCs) remained unfilled as on 01.01.2018.Contd.P.-2/--2-Filling up of vacancies, including backlog reserved vacancies, is a continuous process.

While fixing the roster points, if the EWS roster point coincides with the roster points of SCs/STs/OBCs, the next available UR (Unreserved) roster point has been allotted to the EWS.*****
