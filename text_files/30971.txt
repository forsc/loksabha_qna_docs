                                                        (a)       Under Skill India Mission, Ministry is implementing its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) to impart skill development training to youth of the country, including the State of Bihar.

(b)       PMKVY has two training components, namely, Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). Under PMKVY, placement opportunities are being provided to STT certified candidates, while RPL does not mandate placements as it recognizes the existing skills of candidate.

Under State component of PMKVY, funds and corresponding physical targets have been allocated State-wise. For the State of Bihar, Rs. 128.65 crore was allocated under PMKVY. Out of which, Rs. 36.82 crore is released till now.  As per data received from State of Bihar, out of total released funds (Rs. 36.82 crore), Rs. 2.38 crore have been spent till date. (d)       Ministry promotes establishment of model and aspirational skill centres known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) in every district for imparting skill training in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode throughout the country, including districts of State of Bihar. As on 21.11.2021, 48 PMKKs have been established in 38 districts of State of Bihar, including West Champaran district.
