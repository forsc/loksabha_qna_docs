State/UT-wise list of PMBJKs is enclosed as Annexure-I.(c) Before considering continuation of the Scheme, it was evaluated by an NITI Aayog’s approved private appraisal agency. An internal review of the scheme was also made.

The Department has regularly written letters to States/UTs to provide rent free space in every Primary Health Centres (PHCs)/Community Health Centres (CHCs) and Government Hospitals for opening PMBJKs. Letters were also written to District Magistrates to expedite the opening of PMBJKs to make available quality generic medicines at affordable prices to the citizens of the country.
