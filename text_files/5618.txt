                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) & (b) 	Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) monitors the performance of telecom service providers including Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) against the benchmark for various Quality of Service (QoS) parameters laid down by TRAI by way of QoS regulations issued from time to time, through Quarterly Performance Monitoring Reports (PMRs).  As per PMR issued by TRAI for the quarter ending March 2019, BSNL is meeting all the benchmarks for Basic (Wireline) and Broadband Services throughout the country including Assam.  For Cellular Mobile Telephone Service, BSNL is meeting the benchmark for all the parameters in all of its Licensed Service Areas (LSAs) including Assam except for the parameter of call drops in West Bengal Service area only.(c) 	BSNL has reported that its mobile network is available in the area of Manas National Park where Government offices, hotels and resorts are situated.  However, the network is poor inside the forest area.  At present there is no basic wireline (landline) service available as it is not commercially viable.(d) 	Department of Telecommunications is working on Comprehensive Telecom Development Plan for the North-Eastern Region including Assam State for provision of mobile services and internet in uncovered villages. The details are at Annexure. BharatNet project is also being implemented in a phased manner to provide broadband connectivity to all 2648 Gram Panchayats of Assam State.  As on 04.07.2019, by laying 4815 km Optical Fibre Cable (OFC), a total of 1622 GPs in Assam have been connected and have been made Service Ready. As part of this project, the last mile connectivity, through Wi-Fi or any other suitable broadband technology, is being provided at all the GPs in the country including Assam. Further, the Digital Communications Commission (DCC) on 13.06.2019 has approved to award the work of provisioning of 2 Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) in each of the remaining GPs of BharatNet Phase-I in all the States including Assam. Further, 955 Fiber to the Home (FTTH) connections have also been provided in Assam.
