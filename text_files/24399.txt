                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a): Under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, Govt of India has made allocation of foodgrains @ 5 kg per person per month free of cost for around 80 crore beneficiaries of all the 36 States/UTs covered under NFSA (Antyodaya Anna Yojana(AAY) & Priority Households(PHH)) including those covered under Direct Benefit Transfer(DBT) for a period of 8 months i.e April-November, 2020 and again similarly during the period May -November, 2021. ..........2/--2-During the year, 2020, about 322 Lakh Metric Tons (LMT) of food-grains and during the year 2021, about 278 LMT foodgrains have been allocated free of cost under PMGKAY scheme to approximately 80 Crore NFSA beneficiaries.   In addition  to foodgrains, during the year 2020, about 14.47 LMT pulses/whole chana have also been allocated under PMGKAY for the period April-November, 2020 to about 19.4 crore NFSA households free of cost @ 1kg per household per month.  (b):  Expenditure under PMGKAY is further met from central food subsidy/assistance. An amount of Rs.293.81 crore has been released to State Government of Rajasthan for distribution of foodgrains under PMGKAY under the scheme of Assistance to State Agencies for intra-state movement of foodgrains and FPS dealers margin. There is no sharing of expenditure by the States/UTs under PMGKAY.(c):  Under the PMGKAY, the foodgrains and pulses/whole chana are allocated to State Government of Rajasthan for approx 440 lakh beneficiaries covered under the National Food Security Act, 2013, covering all the States district including Dausa. Responsibility for distribution of foodgrains within the States/UTs rests with concerned State/UT Govt.(d) and (e):  	Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and the State/UT Governments, wherein the operational responsibilities pertain with the State/UT.

An offence committed in violation of the provisions of PDS (Control) Order, 2015 is liable for penal action under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955.
