ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND PENSIONS AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR. JITENDRA SINGH) (a) to (c):   The Government of India has decided to dispense with interview for recruitment to all Group ‘C’, Group ‘D’ (which are now reclassified as Group ‘C’), Group ‘B’ (non-gazetted) and all equivalent posts w.e.f. 1st January, 2016 in its Ministries/ Departments/ Attached offices/ Subordinate Offices/ Autonomous Bodies/ Public Sector Undertakings. All the vacancies notified on or after 01.01.2016 are to be filled up without holding interview as a part of recruitment process for such posts. 	As the Skill Test or Physical Test is different from interview, it has been continued. However, these tests are only qualifying in nature. 	In case of specific posts for which any particular Ministry/ Department considers interview absolutely essential, clearance of Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT) is necessary.	State Governments and Union Territories have also come forward and initiated steps for discontinuation of interviews in junior level posts. So far, 24 States and all the Union Territories have adopted the policy of discontinuation of interview in lower level posts.*****
