ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a)and(b)	The Ministry has already initiated preventive measures to save wild animals from road accidents and secure crop damage by them.  The important  action in this regard includes:i.	Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in consultation with the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, National Tiger Conservation Authority, National Highway Authority and World Bank has published a document namely ‘Eco-friendly Measures to Mitigate Impacts of Linear Infrastructure’ to assist the project agencies of linear infrastructure in designing the linear infrastructure in a manner which will reduce  human-animal conflict in the  areas where these linear infrastructures are passing through Protected Areas and other wildlife areas. The Standing Committee of NBWL in its 47th Meeting held on 25th January, 2018  recommended that in future user agencies involved in linear infrastructure  development  should  take into  consideration the advisory made in the guidelines of  the Wildlife Institute of India  while  designing the  linear infrastructures  inside the Protected Areas, notified Eco Sensitive Zone area around PAs and in future  linear infrastructure  proposals  by project  proponents would be accompanied by an  animal passage plan prepared , if required, on the basis of these WII guidelines and in consultation with the State Chief Wildlife Warden.ii.	The application of this document is highlighted in mitigation measures which have been constructed on National Highway 7 (now NH 44) in Maharashtra in an 18 km forest patch between two important tiger source areas namely the Kanha and the Pench Tiger Reserves. These mitigation measures include nine structures which have six underpasses and three minor bridges of the following dimensions:Sl. No.	Structure	Length	Number1.	Underpass	750 meters	022.		300 meters	013.		100 meters	014.		50 meters	025.	Minor bridges	60 meters	016.		80 meters	017.		65 meters	01iii.	The efficacy of these structures is being monitored by the National Tiger Conservation Authority in a project titled “Ecological impact assessment of existing and proposed road infrastructure in important wildlife corridors for strategic planning of smart green infrastructure” through the Wildlife Institute of India. This project has shown that critically endangered wildlife like tigers, dholes and gaur are successfully traversing these structures indicating their usefulness in avoiding road hits involving wild animals.  iv.	The Ministry through its various Centrally Sponsored Schemes provides funds to States and UTs for carrying various activities for habitat improvement works namely restoration of natural water bodies, creation of artificial ponds, waterholes, augmenting food/fodder sources at various places within Protected Areas and outside Protected Areas to prevent wild animals venturing outside forest areas. Compensation to crop damage is also provided to the affected persons in the same scheme.(c),(d)and (e)	Subject to a health assessment, wild animals are rehabilitated back into the wild.****
