ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) & (b): The data regarding the number of mental health professionals in the country including psychologists, psychiatrists and psychiatric nurses is not maintained centrally. Mental Health in-patient services are provided at various secondary and tertiary level healthcare facilities, including District Hospitals, State Mental Hospitals, etc. The data regarding number of psychiatry beds is maintained by the Institutions/ Hospitals concerned, at their own level. However, there are 03 (three) Mental Health Institutions, namely, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, Lokopriya Gopinath Bordoloi Regional Institute of Mental Health (LGBRIMH), Tezpur, Assam, and Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP), Ranchi, under the administrative control of the Central Government. The details of total number of beds in these Institutions are as under:S.No.	Name of the Institute	Total number of beds1.	NIMHANS, Bengaluru	9442.	LGBRIMH, Tezpur, Assam	3363.	CIP, Ranchi	643 (c): As per the available information, there are 47 Government run mental hospitals in the country, including 3 Central Mental Health Institutions, State/ UT wise list of these Institutions is annexed.(d): Lack of sufficient mental health professionals is one of the challenges faced in the mental healthcare service delivery. With a view to augment the availability of qualified manpower in field of mental health, the Government, under NMHP, is implementing manpower development schemes for establishment of Centres of Excellence and strengthening/ establishment of Post Graduate (PG) Departments in mental health specialties. Till date, support has been provided for establishment of 25 Centres of Excellence and strengthening/ establishment of 47 Post Graduate (PG) Departments in mental health specialties in the country.The Government is also augmenting the availability of manpower to deliver mental healthcare services in the underserved areas of the country by providing online training courses to various categories of general healthcare medical and para medical professionals through the Digital Academies established at the three Central Mental Health Institutes namely National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bengaluru, Lokopriya Gopinath Bordoloi Regional Institute of Mental Health, Tezpur, Assam, and Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi.(e): Psychiatry now has been made a compulsory subject with a dedicated question paper in MBBS. The curriculum is now competency based. The numbers of hours of psychiatry teaching and clinical postings is increased, marks for psychiatry have been increased and the psychiatry internship is made mandatory. (f): The Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 provides for integration of mental health services into general healthcare services at all levels of healthcare including primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare and in all health programmes run by the appropriate Government. As such, the mental healthcare services are extended through various levels of healthcare delivery systems.Further, the Government is implementing National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) and District Mental Health Programme (DMHP) in this direction of community based care as the services are made available in the district headquarters and more peripheral health centres. Medical Officers and the field level workers of the PHCs and the other staff of the primary care settings are getting trained to identify and treat psychiatric disorders present in the community. Further, the Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centres are carrying out the ‘Comprehensive Primary Health Care’ initiatives of which ‘mental health’ is an indispensable part. *****
