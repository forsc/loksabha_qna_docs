Drinking water and sanitation are State subjects. The Central Government supplements the efforts of States and Union Territories (UTs) through various program interventions, in improving these facilities in the selected cities/towns.

Selection, appraisal, approval and implementation of individual projects under AMRUT is the responsibility of the State/UT. The Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs approves the State Annual Action Plans (SAAPs) submitted by the States/UTs and releases Central Assistance as per Mission guidelines. SAAPs of all the States/UTs amounting to ?77,640 crore, including committed Central Assistance of ?35,990 crore, have been approved for the entire Mission period under AMRUT, of which, projects costing ?39,011 crore have been approved in the water supply sector and projects costing ?32,456 crore have been approved in the sewerage and septage management sector.	Similarly, Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U) was launched by the Government of India on 02.10.2014.
