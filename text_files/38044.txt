ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL) (a) to (d)   Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) [SBM(G)] is a demand driven scheme.  Hence, no fixed targets for construction of individual household latrines (IHHLs) could be set under the programme.  As per the data reported by the States/UTs on the online Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) of SBM(G), about 11 crore IHHLs have been constructed under the programme from 2014-15 to 2021-22.  The State/UT and district-wise details of the IHHLs constructed under the programme are available in the public domain and the link is:https://sbm.gov.in/sbmReport/Report/Physical/SBM_TargetVsAchievementWithout1314.aspx*****
