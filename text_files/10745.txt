                                                        MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR) (a), (b) and (c) A statement is laid on the Table of the House. ***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a), (b) and (c) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 374 REGARDING “CONSERVATION OF ENVIRONMENT” BY SHRI JANARDAN MISHRA: SHRI RODMAL NAGAR DUE FOR REPLY ON 13.12.2019:(a)to (c) No, Sir. The Government has not formulated any scheme to carry out third party monitoring by fixing corporate responsibility towards the conservation of the environment. The Central Sector Schemes of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change are to be evaluated through Third Parties on the completion of the 3 year Finance Commission cycle period of the Fourteenth Finance Commission from 2017-18 to 2019-20, which includes the Schemes pertaining to the Conservation of Environment. The Centrally Sponsored Schemes implemented by the Ministry are being evaluated by a Third Party engaged by NITI Aayog, for all the Centrally Sponsored Schemes of the Government. Further, for improving the compliance status of the implementation of the environmental clearance conditions of the projects and activities for which Environment Clearance (EC) are being issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate change and the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), the Government had issued a draft Notification S.O. 4721(E) dated 10.09.2018 to introduce the concept of randomised third party compliance monitoring of the ECs conditions through national level reputed and competent government institutions.However, in light of Hon’ble NGT order dated 29.04.2019 in OA No. 837/2018, the notification dated 10.09.2018 has been kept in abeyance and a separate Monitoring Action Plan has been finalised for improving the compliance of environmental conditions by involving, strengthening and expansion of Regional Offices, SEIAAs, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), and State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs). The same has been submitted to the Hon’ble NGT.  *****
