                                                        THE MINISTER OF STEEL		        (SHRI RAM CHANDRA PRASAD SINGH)(a)	The details of State-wise number of steel plants in country are given at Annexure-I.(b)&(c):  Steel is a de-regulated sector.  However, the data on targets/achievements of steel production of Public Sector Steel plants during the last three years is as below:-(Unit: ‘MT)Financial Year	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21	MoU	Actual	MoU	Actual	MoU	ActualSteel Authority of India Ltd.(SAIL)	16.73	16.27	17.27	16.16	16.40	15.22Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. (RINL)	5.50	5.00	5.80	4.45	5.40	4.16Source: SAIL & RINLWith reference to SAIL, the shortfall in achievements against the set targets was due to sluggish market demand and COVID-19 lockdown restrictions and time taken in stabilization of production after expansion of capacity for RINL. (d)	According to data available the number of steel plants at present in the country is 887. Steel being a de-regulated sector, the data/information on profit/loss of private sector steel plants is not maintained by the Government. The details of profit/loss made by plants of Steel CPSEs during the last two years are as given below:-Year	Profit/Loss Before Tax in Rs. Crore	SAIL	RINL2019-20	-616	-42882020-21	5975	 -1036Source: SAIL & RINL(e)&(f): According to available data during the year 2021-22 (provisional), 65 plants which manufacture crude steel in the country having a cumulative capacity of 4.1 million tonnes have reported nil production*.  Steel being a deregulated sector, the role of the Government is that of a facilitator only. The decision regarding revival/closure of steel plants is taken by individual steel companies from time to time, based on commercial considerations and market dynamics {*Source: Joint Plant Committee (JPC)}.********
