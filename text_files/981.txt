                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (d) :	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.******* STATEMENTSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF STARRED QUESTION NO.98 TO BE ANSWERED IN THE LOK SABHA ON 27.06.2019 REGARDING NORMS FOR POWER TARIFF.*********(a) :  		As per the provisions given in Section 61 to Section 64 of the Electricity Act, 2003, the Appropriate Electricity Regulatory Commission determines the electricity tariff for supply of electricity by a generating company to a distribution licensee, transmission of electricity, wheeling of electricity and retail sale of electricity. Section 61 of the Electricity Act, 2003 and the tariff policy provide the guiding principles and the terms and conditions for determination of tariff by the Appropriate Commission. A copy of relevant extract is provided as Annexure.(b) to (d) : 	Power Distribution tariff is determined by the respective State Electricity Regulatory Commissions. The distribution tariff varies from State to State depending upon the actual cost of supply of electricity, tariff norms and the subsidy, if any, provided for any class of consumers. Similarly the electricity tariff in other developing /developed countries depends upon the energy mix, electricity market structure, rules & regulations thereof prevailing in that country. Government of India had taken note of the fact that there are different numbers of tariff slabs and categories of consumers exist in different States for retail supply of electricity.  A Committee constituted by the Government gave its recommendation for simplification of consumer categories. Based on the recommendations of the Committee and further consultations with stakeholders, suitable changes including reduction in tariff slabs and consumer categories have been proposed in the draft Tariff Policy.***********
