                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) to (c)  Prices of petrol and diesel have been market-determined with effect from 26.06.2010 and 19.10.2014 respectively. Since then, the Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) take appropriate decision on pricing of petrol and diesel in line with their international product prices, exchange rate, tax structure, inland freight and other cost elements.  Effective 16 June, 2017, daily pricing of petrol and diesel has been implemented in the entire country.  The prices of petroleum products in the country are linked to the price of respective products in the international market. However, for domestic LPG the Government continues to modulate the effective price to consumer to insulate the common man from rise in international prices. The details of Standalone Sales Turnover of the major public sector oil companies during the last two years and current year are given below: 	 	 	 	(Rs.Crore)Companies	2019-20	2020-21	H1-2021-22ONGC	95,701	67,891	47,218GAIL	71,730	56,529	38,829OIL	11,761	8,410	6,187IOCL	5,62,088	5,10,546	3,23,239BPCL	3,26,393	3,00,830	1,90,783HPCL	2,86,250	2,69,243	1,64,619MRPL	60,728	50,974	32,825CPCL	48,624	41,814	25,857NRL	14,072	18,542	10,587The details of revenue contribution to central and state exchequer from petroleum sector from all the activities for the last two years and current year, based on data provided to Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) by 16 major oil & gas companies are given below:Rs./CroresYear	Total Contribution to Central Exchequer	Total Contribution to State Exchequer	Total Contribution of Petroleum Sector to Exchequer2019-20	               3,34,315 	               2,21,056 	                5,55,370 2020-21	               4,55,069 	               2,17,650 	                6,72,719 H1-2021-22 (P)	               2,16,794 	               1,33,130 	                3,49,923 x-x-x-x-x
