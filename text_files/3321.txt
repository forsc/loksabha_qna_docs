ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): The total passenger traffic recorded at Nashik (HAL Ozar) and Shirdi airport during 2018-19 & current year and the average number of flights being operated in a day to and from Nashik (HAL Ozar) and Shirdi airport are at Annexure-1.; (c) & (d): Routes from Nashik (Ozar) to Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Bhopal, Delhi, Goa, Hindon and Hyderabad have been awarded under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik). As per Summer Schedule - 2019, scheduled air services connecting Nashik (Ozar) to Ahmedabad, Bengaluru and Hyderabad have been started. M/s Jet Airways (India) Limited was operating a flight from Nashik (Ozar) to Delhi, which has been discontinued due to suspension of operations by the airline.With repeal of the Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation was deregulated. Airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type, free to select whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate. In this regard, Government has laid down Route Dispersal Guidelines (RDG) with a view to achieve better air  transport services to different regions of the country. It is, however, up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability. As such, the airlines are free to operate anywhere in the country subject to compliance of RDG issued by Government.
