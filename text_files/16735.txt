                                                        ???????  ??? ?????? ?????? (???? ????? ????) THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI  PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c):    Make in India’ is not a scheme rather an initiative which was launched on September 25, 2014 with the objective of facilitating investment, fostering innovation, building best in class manufacturing infrastructure, making it easy to do business and enhancing skill development. Action Plans for 21 key sectors were identified for specific actions under (i) Policy Initiatives (ii) Fiscal Incentives (iii) Infrastructure Creation (iv) Ease of Doing Business (v) Innovation and R&D (vi) Skill Development areas. The ‘Make in India’ initiative is not a State/ district/ cities/ area specific initiative rather it is being implemented all over the country. The Government of India is making continuous efforts under Investment Facilitation including financial assistance to Invest India and for implementation of Make in India action plans to identify potential investors. Support is being provided to Indian Missions abroad and State Governments for organising events, summits, road-shows and other promotional activities to attract investment in the country under the Make in India banner. Investment Outreach activities are being carried out for enhancing International co-operation for promoting FDI and improve Ease of Doing Business in the country.The total Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflow was USD 357.36 billion between April 2014 and March 2020- representing nearly 52.5% of the cumulative FDI in India since April 2000. In 2019-20, FDI inflow stood at a record of USD 73.46 billion, highest ever recorded for a fiscal year.Steps have been taken to improve Ease of Doing Business include simplification and rationalisation of existing processes. As a result of the measures taken to improve the country’s investment climate, India jumped to 63rd place in World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business ranking as per World Bank’s Doing Business Report (DBR) 2020. This is driven by reforms in the areas of Starting a Business, Paying Taxes, Trading Across Borders, and Resolving Insolvency.Activities under the initiative are also undertaken, through schemes/ programmes, by several Central Government Ministries/ Departments and various State Governments from time to time. The details of these measures are not centrally maintained.   ******
