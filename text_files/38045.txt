ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) & (b) As informed by the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC), no grant has been approved for de-siltation / dredging of DVC dams.(c) Damodar Valley Reservoir Regulation Committee (DVRRC) has been constituted for efficient operation of DVC dams through a unified control of the dams in Damodar-Barakar River system. It also undertakes review of guidelines and also undertakes technical studies on reservoir operation, as and when considered necessary for efficient operation of reservoirs. As informed by the DVC, the matter of increasing water holding capacity does not come under the purview of DVRRC.(d)  DVC had initiated a proposal for de-siltation of Panchet Reservoir in the year 2012, which was later dropped due to non-viability and associated problems of disposal of excavated earth and high cost of repeated de-siltation. ********
