The Government on 23.10.2019 approved the revival plan of BSNL which inter-alia includes administrative allotment of spectrum for 4G services through capital infusion by the Government into BSNL/MTNL. BSNL is in the process of deployment of indigenous 4G technology through Proof of Concept route under Atma-nirbhar initiative of the Government of India.(d) 	The details of expenditure  by BSNL for upgradation of their mobile services for the past three years and the estimated amount for the current year are as follows:<pre>Financial Year	Expenditure / Estimate  (in Rs crore)2018-2019	8,0572019-2020	1,7862020-2021	6082021-2022	2,000</pre>(e) The Government earlier in its cabinet meeting dated 23.10.2019 approved in-principle approval for merger of BSNL and MTNL. However due to financial reasons including high debt of MTNL, the merger of MTNL with BSNL is deferred. However, close co-operation and service integration between BSNL and MTNL has been undertaken.
