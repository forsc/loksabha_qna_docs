                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING (DR. SANJEEV KUMAR BALYAN)(a) 	No.  Sir.(b)	Does not arise.(c) & (d) No separate laws has been formulated by the Government for the dairy industry. However, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 is equally applicable for all the animals including dairy animals to prevent unnecessary pain or sufferings. Under Section 12 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animal Act, 1960, there is provision for penalty of practising phooka or doom dev. Also the Government of India has framed Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Registration of Cattle Premises) Rules, 1978.(e) 	No Sir. However, there are some media report and reports from animal welfare organizations/activists regarding illegal administration of Oxytocin (hormone and scheduled drug) by the dairies for letting down of milk.  The Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Government of India issued advisories to all the States to create awareness amongst the dairy farmers for not using Oxytocin injection. The Central Drugs Standards Control Organizations (CDSCO) is also taking various measures to control manufacturing and marketing of Oxytocin. The State Governments are also taking measures to curb illegal sale and use of Oxytocin as per the Drugs and Cosmetic Act, 1940 and Rules Framed thereunder. (f)  	The Artificial insemination for conception of animals cannot be considered as unhealthy practice. The Artificial Insemination process involves production of frozen semen by following Minimum Standards Protocol laid down by Government of India, Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying. The animals are inseminated for pregnancy when the animals are in estrous period. The semen collected by the Semen Stations maintains hygienic conditions. The semen are kept in liquid nitrogen, checked for bacterial count batch by batch as per the Minimum Standards Protocol. The Artificial Insemination also prevent spread of sexually transmitted diseases like Brucellosis, Vibrosis, Trycomoniasis etc. which damages the productivity of dairy animals. There is no report of bad effect of artificial insemination.(g) 	No. Sir. However, there are no restrictions for manufacturing and sale plant based milk.*****
