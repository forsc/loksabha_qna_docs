                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		 	  (SHRI NARENDRA  SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (e):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 101  DUE FOR REPLY ON 27th JULY, 2021.(a):	The manufacture, import, storage, sale, distribution, use, etc of pesticides are regulated by the Insecticides Act, 1968 and the Insecticides Rules, 1971 made thereunder. The Central Government is responsible for registration of insecticides whereas the State Governments are responsible for licensing and enforcement of the conditions of licence and provisions relating to manufacture, sale, transport, distribution and use of insecticides. Substances bearing insecticidal properties are notified and included in the Schedule to the Act by the Central Government, which are then required to be registered for import or manufacture by the Registration Committee subject to fulfilment of detailed technical parameters. State Governments grant license for manufacture, sale, stock, exhibition for sale or distribution of any insecticide. They also promote biological pesticides. The quality of pesticides is further ensured through Central and States’ Insecticide Inspectors and the Central and States’ pesticide testing laboratories. Action against firms / individuals involved in manufacture / sale of substandard/spurious pesticides is taken. (b): 	In so far as checking the overuse of pesticides is concerned, Government promotes Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach as an ecologically desirable alternative. Judicious use of chemical pesticides is recommended as a measure of last resort. The States’ agriculture extension departments and 35 Central Integrated Pest Management Centres (CIPMCs) across the country train farmers, extension functionaries, etc. The training activities include programmes on non-chemical pest management strategies and use of bio-pesticides for farmers through Farmers’ Field Schools (FFSs), for master trainers, extension workers and short duration courses for pesticides dealers/NGOs/Graduates/Post-graduates/Private Entrepreneurs and progressive farmers. Contd…2/- -2-In this regard, Government has also been promoting organic farming through seminars and trainings. Financial support is provided to the states to organize seminars, trainings, awareness camps on organic production, post harvest management, marketing etc.  Experienced farmers, experts are invited as resource persons in the seminars for spreading awareness and sharing their experiences. The National Centre for Organic Farming (NCOF) also spreads awareness among farmers through Jaivik Kisan Sammelans, field demonstrations, farmers’ training and publicity through print and electronic media. (c): 	Organic farming is certified in India under two different systems of certifications, namely, under the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) notified by APEDA in 2000 and the online low cost Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) organic certification launched by Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare in 2015. (d): 	The Insecticides Act, 1968 already contains provision for a Central Insecticides Board (CIB) having 29 members to advise the Central and State Governments on technical matters relating to manufacture of insecticides, classification of insecticides on the basis of their toxicity, tolerance limit for insecticides, shelf life of insecticides and residues, colorization etc. The Director General Health Services, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare is the chairperson of the board. However, the Pesticide Management Bill, 2020 introduced in the Rajya Sabha on 23rd March, 2020, to repeal and replace the existing Act, contains further provisions for inter alia framing of model protocols to deal with occurrences of poisoning, including the specification of standard operating procedures for medical facilities by a refurbished Central Pesticide Board and creation of a fund for making ex-gratia payments on account of injury or death due to poisoning.  Contd…3/- -3-(e):  	 Pesticides are toxic substances but they do not pose any adverse effect on the environment if they are used as per the label and leaflet approved by the Registration Committee. Registered pesticides are periodically reviewed from time to time with regard to their safety and efficacy in consultation with experts on receipt of new studies / reports / references / information. So far, Government has banned or phased out 46 pesticides and 4 pesticide formulations for import, manufacture or sale in the country. In addition, 5 banned pesticides are allowed to be manufactured for export only, 8 pesticide registrations have been withdrawn and 9 pesticides have been placed under restricted use.However, to meet the multi-dimensional management and administration of pests and pesticides spectrum, which is continuously evolving with modern scientific & technical developments with passage of time, a dynamic legislation was felt necessary. Therefore, the Pesticide Management Bill, 2020 was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on 23rd March 2020 to repeal and replace the existing Insecticides Act, 1968.  The Bill aims to regulate all aspects of life cycle of a pesticide. The thrust of the Bill is to ensure the availability of safe and effective pesticides and to strive to minimize risk to human beings, animals, living organisms and the environment.*******
