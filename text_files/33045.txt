ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[DR. RAJKUMAR RANJAN SINGH](a)	Yes. (b)    	As per the OECD publication “International Migration Outlook 2021”, published on 28 October 2021, due to Covid-19 pandemic, “permanent migration flows to OECD countries declined by more than 30% in 2020, to about 3.7 million – the lowest level since 2003”. (c) to (e)	OECD has not published figures for migration of Indian workers to OECD countries for years 2020/2021.It was the Government’s priority to ensure during the pandemic that its impact on Indian professionals and workers abroad in terms of loss of employment was mitigated. To that end, the Ministry and all our Missions were continuously engaged with host Governments to support and ensure welfare of our nationals abroad. Many countries have responded favourably to our efforts and established air bubbles and eased visa, travel and health restrictions. Return of Indian professionals and workers, as well as new recruitment, is proceeding apace in line with economic recovery in various OECD countries. Government will continue to make this its priority.	 ***
