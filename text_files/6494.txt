                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		 	  (SHRI NARENDRA  SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (f):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (f) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 21  DUE FOR REPLY ON 19TH NOVEMBER, 2019.(a) & (b):      The Government is aware of the plight of the farmers and to address this issue the Government constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee in April, 2016 to examine issues relating to “Doubling of Farmers Income” and recommend strategies to achieve the same.  The Committee submitted its Report to the Government in September, 2018 and thereafter, an Empowered Body was set up on 23.01.2019 to monitor and review the progress against the recommendations. Due to the efforts made as part of schemes/ programmes of the Department of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare which also aligns with the strategy of doubling farmers’ income, there has been an  appreciable improvement in efficiency bringing about a positive impact in the agriculture sector. The details of   these new schemes and initiatives by the Department of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare are placed at Annexure-I. (c)  to  (e):	  The Government has launched a pension scheme, namely, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan-Dhan Yojana (PM-KMY), w.e.f. 12th September, 2019 for all Small and Marginal Farmers in the country holding cultivable land upto 2 hectare, subject to certain exclusion clauses, with a view to provide them social security net as they have minimal or no savings to provide for old age and to support them in the event of consequent loss of livelihood. The Scheme is expected to benefit about 3 crore farmer families. The scheme provides for payment of a minimum fixed pension of Rs.3,000/- per month to the eligible farmers on attaining the age of 60 years. It is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme, with entry age of 18 to 40 years. Landholding is the basic criteria for the PM-KMY and hence only farmers holding cultivable land are eligible for the benefit under this Scheme, irrespective of whether they actually reside in the villages or not. As on 13.11.2019, a total of 18,29,469 farmers have joined the Scheme. A statement containing State/UT-wise number of farmers enrolled into the Scheme is at Annexure-II.  Contd…2/--2-(f):	 As per the estimates released by Central Statistics Office (CSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation on 31st May, 2019, the share of Agriculture and Allied Sectors in Gross Value Added (GVA) of the country at current prices was 16.1 percent in the year 2018-19. The share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of agriculture and allied sector in total economy in 1951-52 (at current prices) was 50.7%.
