Promotion cases of all categories of employees including OBC category, were i)	put on hold in 2017 by the Directorate of Printing in the Government of India Presses due to Government of India decision for rationalisation/merger of 17 Government of India Presses (GIPs) into 5 GIPs. Subsequently, the promotions in the Government of India Presses have been commenced and done in GIP Nashik. Action is now being taken for conducting Departmental Promotion Committees (DPCs) in the other Presses where promotions are pending viz. GIP Minto Road (New Delhi), GIP Ring Road (New Delhi) and GIP Temple Street (Kolkata). The pending promotions are likely to be done within a period of six months.ii)	In so far as the post of Manager in the Directorate of Printing Headquarter (HQ) is concerned, Hon’ble Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), Principal Bench, New Delhi vide Order dated 29.1.2020 has granted an interim stay on the operation of inter-se seniority until further orders. Directorate of Printing have filed application for vacation of stay which is yet to come up for hearing. Hence, process for promotion in this post will be made upon vacation of stay by the Hon’ble Tribunal.                               *****
