ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA) (a) & (b)	Government of Kerala has requested for changing funding pattern under Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) for the flood-affected nine districts of Kerala i.e. Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Alappuzha, Idukki, Thrissur, Ernakulam, Malappuram, Wayanad and Palakkad at 90:10 cost sharing basis between Centre and State. The fund under JJM is allocated among the States/ UTs as per the approved criteria. (c) & (d) 	The State has been suitably replied in this regard. During 2019-20, under JJM, Kerala has been allocated Rs. 248.76 Crore, out of which Rs. 101.29 Crore has already been released in August 2019. As reported by the State, as on 29.01.2020, an amount of Rs. 78.44 Crore is still lying unspent with the State. Due to slow pace of implementation and resultant poor utilization of funds, this Department is yet to receive the proposal for release of 2nd instalment amounting Rs. 147.48 Crore. Government of Kerala has been requested to expedite expenditure and send proposal for release of 2nd instalment.
