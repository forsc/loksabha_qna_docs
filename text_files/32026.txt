ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) to (f): The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, mandates the appropriate Government to provide free and compulsory elementary education to every child of the age 6 to 14 years in a neighbourhood school.In pursuance of Section 6 of the Act, the States which are the appropriate Government for schools falling under their jurisdiction, have notified area or limits of their neighbourhood norms in their state RTE Rules, factoring in their State specific condition, for opening of schools.As reported by States/UTs in their respective Annual Work Plan and Budget, 2021-22, 97.49% of habitations in the country are covered by primary schools. Thehabitations that remain uncovered are mostly small or sparsely populated in difficult areas where opening of school is not feasible for which there is a provision of giving transport and escort facility and opening of residential schools and hostels.Education is in the Concurrent List of the Constitution and majority of the schools come under the jurisdiction of respective State/ UT Governments. As per the RTE Act, 2009, the respective State and UT Governments are the appropriate Government to carry out the provisions of the RTE Act including recruitment, service conditions and deployment of teachers. Also, they have the responsibility and mandate to provide school infrastructure including upgradation/ strengthening of schools, drinking water, toilets and other facilities in schools in accordance with the norms laid down in the Schedule to the RTE Act, 2009 and as per respective State RTE Rules.The recruitment of teachers in schools is a continuous process and the vacancies keep arising due to retirement, resignation and additional requirements on account of enhanced students’ strength/new schools. However, Ministry of Education requests the States and UT Governments for filling-up the vacant posts of teachers and their rational deployment, through Review meetings and advisories from time to time. Further, the Central Government through the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Samagra Shiksha, provides assistance to the States and UTs for deployment of additional teachers to maintain appropriate Pupil Teacher Ratio as per the prescribed norms for various levels of schooling.As per the Unified District Information System for Education+ 2019-20, the state-wise details of Government schools having access to electricity is at Annexure.*****
