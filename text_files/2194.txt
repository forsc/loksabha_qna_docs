                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW & JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a): 	The total number of Family Courts in the country, State/UT-wise is as per Annexure-I.(b)-(c): The role and functions of Family Courts are governed by the Family Courts Act, 1984. Family Courts are set up by the State Governments in consultation with the concerned High Courts from their own resources with a view to promote conciliation and to secure speedy settlement of family disputes. The number of cases disposed of by these courts during the last three years and the current year, State/Union Territory-wise as obtained from High Courts is as per Annexure-II.(d):	No time limit has been fixed for disposal of cases as per the Family Courts Act, 1984. However as per Section 12(5) of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, the Magistrate shall endeavor to dispose of every application made under Sub Section (1), within a period of sixty days from the date of its first hearing.	Disposal of cases is primarily the responsibility of the judiciary. In the Chief Ministers’ and Chief Justices’ Conference 2015, directions had been issued to all the High Courts to regularly monitor and take necessary steps for early disposal of such cases. The Government has adopted a coordinated approach to assist judiciary for phased liquidation of arrears and pendency in judicial systems, which, inter-alia, involves better infrastructure for courts including computerization, increase in strength of judicial officers/judges, policy and legislative measures in the areas prone to excessive litigation and emphasis on human resource development.    (e)-(f): Setting up of subordinate courts, which includes Family Courts, is in the domain of the State Governments who set up such courts as per their need and resources, in consultation with the concerned High Courts.
