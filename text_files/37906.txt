THE MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS (SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a): The Ministry of Minority Affairs implements Pre-Matric Scholarship Scheme for the educational empowerment of students belonging to the economically weaker section of the six notified minority communities i.e. Buddhist, Christian, Jain, Muslim, Sikh, Zoroastrian (Parsi) in all the States/UTs of the country including the State of Maharashtra. It is implemented as a Central Sector Scheme of the Union Government since 2014-15 and 100% scholarships are disbursed from Central funds directly to the beneficiary account under the DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) mode. So far, under Pre-Matric Scholarship Scheme, 83,33,875 scholarships have been disbursed to children belonging to minority communities in Maharashtra. (b) to (d) During the last 3 years (i.e. 2019-20 to 2021-22) Pre-Matric Scholarships amounting to Rs.256.00 crore was sanctioned. As the Scheme is implemented under the DBT mode and the scholarships are disbursed directly to the bank accounts of beneficiaries, no State-wise fund is allocated.(e)	The scholarship schemes are being implemented through the National Scholarship Portal (NSP) and are being disbursed under Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode to improve the efficiency and bring transparency by removing duplicity and stopping pilferages.To ensure maximum participation of students the scheme is given wide publicity through print media at national as well as the State levels.  SMSs are sent to students eligible for renewal scholarship immediately on opening of the portal followed by regular reminders. Schemes are publicized in the social media as well. The village Sarpanch/ Pradhans are intimated about the Schemes through SMS and the District Magistrates/ Collectors are also directed to give wide publicity to the Scheme in their respective Districts and ensure that all eligible students belonging to the economically weaker sections of the notified minority communities studying in the various Schools/Institutions in their Districts apply for Scholarship. They are also directed to include the subject in the agenda for the meeting of District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee and to create awareness among public representatives.*****
