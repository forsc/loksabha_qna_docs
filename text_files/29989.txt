ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a) & (b): Theft / pilferage of coal are carried out stealthily and clandestinely. So, it is difficult to assess and specify the exact quantum of coal stolen and losses incurred on account of theft / pilferage of coal.  However, as per raids conducted by security personnel as well as joint raids with the law and order authorities of the concerned State Government, the quantity of coal recovered, its approximate value and FIRs lodged during last three years and the current year is at Annexure. (c): Law & Order is a State subject, hence primarily, it is the responsibility of the State/ District administration to take necessary deterrent action to stop/ curb theft / pilferage of coal.  Steps taken to check Theft / pilferage of coal are under:•	RFID based Boom Barriers and CCTV camera at weighbridges, GPRS based vehicle tracking system with geofencing and CCTV camera at strategic locations installed in mines.•	Regular FIRs are lodged by the Colliery Management and CISF with local Thana. A close watch on the activities of criminals is being kept by CISF.•	Interaction and liaison with District officials at regular intervals and holding meeting with Officials of the State Administration.•	Challans for coal transportation by trucks outside the district are being issued after fixing hologram and putting signatures of authorized officials of CISF to check pilferage.•	Armed Guards have been deployed at Railway sidings.•	Escorting of coal rakes in coordination with RPF upto weighbridge, is arranged in pilferage prone areas.•	Surprise re-weighment of coal loaded trucks is done at weighbridges.•	Surprise checks / raids are conducted by flying squads of CISF/security department.•	Regular patrolling is conducted in and around the mine including OB dumps.•	Joint patrolling with local police is also being carried out in pilferage prone areas.•	Check posts have been established at entry / exit points where all coal laden vehicles are physically checked.•	Security at coal dumps has been strengthened by fencing, proper illumination and round the clock guarding.In addition to the above, the Government of India has launched one mobile app namely “Khanan Prahari” and one web app “Coal Mine Surveillance and Management System (CMSMS)” for reporting unauthorized coal mining activities so that monitoring and suitable action can be taken by Law & Order authority. ****
