ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c) Yes, Sir. On 01.07.2016, M/s Air India B777-200LR aircraft VT-ALG got damaged during taxi in at Mumbai due to collision with the aerobridge. The incident has been investigated by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and it has been revealed that the Visual Docking Guidance System was unserviceable. Manual marshaling was done to guide the aircraft for parking in the bay. The marshaller did not ascertain the type of aircraft before commencing marshaling of the aircraft. He guided the aircraft beyond the stop point. Due to this, the aircraft crossed its stop point and the engine came in contact with the Aerobridge resulting in damage to the engine. In pursuance of the findings of the investigation, corrective training was imparted to the involved marshaller and Ramp Supervisor. As a corrective action, M/s Air India has revised their Marshaling Procedure.
