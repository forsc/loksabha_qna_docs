(a)	 to (d) 318 arbitration cases are ongoing with a claim amount of about Rs. 78653.00 crore. There are few cases where the amount of claim raised by the Contractor/ Concessionaire is more than the total project cost. Main reasons of invocation of arbitration are compensation for delay in handing over of land, damages due to Change in Scope, loss incurred on account of extended stay in the project, delay in distribution of grant/annuity payment, change in law, additional interest paid to lenders, interest on delayed payments, non-achievement of project milestones etc. Award has been published in 694 nos. of arbitration cases, out of which 293 have been settled so far.(e)  Government has resolved that work will not be awarded where 80% of encumbrance free land is not made available for the project. Alternate dispute resolutions through Committee of Conciliation by Independent Experts are constituted to avoid Arbitration.*****
