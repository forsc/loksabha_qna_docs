Reasons of decline: (i)	High tariffs faced by Indian exporters in key markets such as EU as compared to zero duty access given to competing nations like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Turkey has affected export performance.(ii)	Textile industry has hugely affected due to outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic during last quarter of FY 2019-20 and I & II quarters of FY 2020-21.(c):	No sir.(d):	Ministry of Textiles has conducted a Symposium with Textile Export Promotion Councils and other industry stakeholders for finalizing a list of potential textile and apparel export products for which exports can be enhanced. The list of potential export products were shared with the Indian Missions abroad for identification of potential buyers in the respective countries. Further, to make the textile sector competitive in international market by rebating all taxes/levies, the Government has decided to continue the RoSCTL (Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies) scheme until such time the RoSCTL scheme is merged with Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Product (RoDTEP) Scheme. For this purpose, the Government has approved adhoc allocation of funds of Rs.7398 crore for FY 2020-21 for issuance of duty credit scrips under RoSCTL Scheme. Further, in order to boost exports in MMF sector, Government has removed anti-dumping duty on PTA, a key raw material for the manufacture of MMF fibre and yarn. Assistance is also provided to exporters under Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme. ****
