ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (c):  The UNESCO State of Education Report for India 2019 covers the effort undertaken to protect the right to education of children with special needs (CWSN) in the country. This report aims to provide comprehensive information on the current state of education for CWSN. The report documents children below the age of 18 years. However, there is reporting of information in regard to children of 19 years of age as a cohort of 10-19 years. The report states that over two percent of children between 10 and 19 years live with disabilities, and this age group forms the largest cohort. There are 22, 55,063 CWSN enrolled in schools as per Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE), 2017-18.  (d)  : The Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Samagra Shiksha aims to look at education of Children with Special Needs (CwSN) in a continuum from pre-school to class XII. The scheme covers all CwSN with one or more disabilities as mentioned in the Schedule of disabilities of the Rights of the Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016.Section 3(2) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 mandates that, every child with disability within the age group of 6 to 14 years has the right to pursue free and compulsory elementary education.  The Scheme of Samagra Shiksha lays impetus on inclusion or mainstreaming of CwSN into the fabric of formal schooling. Inclusive education for CwSN under the Scheme emphasises on developing full potentiality of each child with a disability through equitable and quality education. In keeping with the principle of inclusion, CwSN are provided support through specific student oriented interventions i.e. aids and appliances, teaching aids, assistive devices, identification and assessment camps, teaching and learning materials, braille books/kits, transportation allowances, escort allowances, uniforms (under RTE), stipend for girls, training of general teachers, financial assistance for special educators, etc. These interventions are provided to address their educational requirements in general schools.  *****
