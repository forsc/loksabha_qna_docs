                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (c):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.  ******** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2495 BY ¬ SHRI PRATHAP SIMHA AND SHRI L.S. TEJASVI SURYA TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 16.03.2022 REGARDING PARCEL SERVICE IN RAILWAYS(a ) to (c):	In order to modernise the parcel booking and delivery process, the computerization of Parcel Offices is under process and Parcel Management System (PMS) is presently implemented at 84 stations, 67 Division offices and 16 Zonal Headquarter offices.  The bar-coding of consignments is an integral part of PMS, and is being implemented regularly at all PMS locations.  With introduction of e-Parcel Way Bill (e-PWB), OTP based delivery has been enabled which obviates the need for physical generation of receipt at the time of booking and also physical verification of the receipt at the time of delivery.  Tracing of Parcel packages is also facilitated by sending SMS to the mobile number given by the consignor at various stages from booking to delivery.  In order to check the menace of touts and other such unscrupulous elements in parcel handling, CCTVs have been installed in parcel offices and in various places around stations.  Vigilance Helpline number and Grievance redressal numbers are displayed at different places on Railway premises for information to customers in case of any irregularity. Surprise checks are also being conducted by officers as well as vigilance teams. Further, facility of online generation of Forwarding Note is also available in PMS using which the customer can generate Forwarding Note within his premises, before bringing the consignment to Railway station.  *******
