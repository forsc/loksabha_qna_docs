ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (e): The Government has received requests for grant of Special Category Status from Andhra Pradesh. The latest request dated 26.05.2019 received from the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh has been referred to the Fifteenth Finance Commission. The Fourteenth Finance Commission has not made any distinction between General Category States and Special Category States and accordingly, the Special Category States cease to exist. However, keeping in view the recommendations contained in the report of the NITI Aayog tiled “Developmental Support  to the  Successor  State of  Andhra  Pradesh  Under A. P.  Reorganisation -2/…-2-LS.US.Q.NO.3738 FOR 16.07.2019Act, 2014”, the Government has approved special assistance measures to State of Andhra Pradesh which would make up for additional Central share that the State might have received during the period 2015-16 to 2019-20, if the funding of Centrally Sponsored Schemes would have been shared at the ratio of 90:10 between the Centre and the State as applicable to Special Category States. The Special Assistance Measure is to be provided by way of repayment of loan and interest for the Externally Aided Projects (EAPs) signed and disbursed during 2015-16 to 2019-20 by the State.*****
