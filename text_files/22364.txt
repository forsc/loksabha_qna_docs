ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a) to (b) : Like other crops, the plantation crops  namely, rubber, tea, coffee and spices are sensitive to fluctuation in the cost of various inputs like raw materials, wages and the demand-supply scenario. For better price realization for plantation crops, the Government has taken various initiatives through the respective commodity boards, by way of providing financial and technical   assistance to growers   and the industry for new planting, re-plantation,   rejuvenation, quality   up-gradation, value addition and market promotion   through the schemes   implemented by the these Boards.During the current year 2020-21, tea auction prices have shown an upward revision with an increase of Rs.59.92 per kg (43.17%) from April 2020 to February 2021. Similarly, during recent months, the monthly average International Coffee Organization composite indicator prices are showing an upward trend from 109.70 US cents/lb in November 2020 to 119.35 US cents/lb during February, 2021. The average price of RSS 4 grade rubber is also showing an upward trend from Rs.115.73 per kg in May 2020 to Rs.156.04 per kg during February 2021. Spices prices are ruling at comparatively higher levels for most of the major spices.(c) : There is no proposal with regard to re-classifying plantation crops as agriculture commodities from the ensuing census.(d) to (e) : Government of India has not announced any farm loan waiver during the last three years. Government/Reserve Bank of India (RBI), have taken various policy measures to ease the financial stress caused by COVID 19 disruptions, by providing relief on debt servicing and improving access to working capital. RBI vide its circulars dated 17th April 2020, have permitted all commercial banks to grant a moratorium till 31st August 2020, on payment of all instalments in respect of term loans (including agricultural term loans, retail and crop loans). The repayment schedule for such loans, as also the residual tenor, have been allowed to be shifted across the board. ********
