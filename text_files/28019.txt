                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b) The State/UT-wise details of the total number of houses sanctioned and completed under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin(PMAY-G) from the date of its commencement i.e. 01.04.2016 till 04.08.2021 is given in Annexure I.(c) The universe of eligible beneficiaries under PMAY-G, includes all the houseless and households living in zero, one or two room houses with kutcha wall and kutcha roof as per Socio Economic Caste Census data and new Awaas+ 2018 exercise conducted to identify left out eligible households. To ensure that assistance is targeted at those who are genuinely deprived, the data is subjected to the deprivation parameters in SECC and an exclusion process prescribed in PMAY-G guidelines. Thus a system generated/Auto generated priority lists were circulated to the States/UTs for conduct of Gram Sabha verification and preparation of GP/Village wise Permanent Wait List (PWL) of PMAY-G. There is a multilayered prioritization within the universe of eligible PMAY-G beneficiaries. Priority is first assigned on the basis of parameters reflecting housing deprivation in each category viz. SC/ST, Minorities and Others. The total number of houses sanctioned, including the total number of beneficiaries of Muslim community in each year since 2016 till date, State/UT-wise is given at Annexure II. (d) The total number of houses completed, including the total number of beneficiaries of Muslim community in each year since 2016 till date, State/UT-wise is given at Annexure III. *****
