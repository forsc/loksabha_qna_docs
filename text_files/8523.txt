NCERT had accordingly held internal discussion oncurriculum issues for the next curriculum reform. However, in the meanwhile, thedraft National Education Policy (NEP) 2019 has been received from the Committeeconstituted for this purpose.Further action to review the NCF would depend on thefinalization and approval of the New Education Policy.(c) The existing NCF has completed around fourteen years. During these years,there have been many changes at the social, economic and educational fronts,which need to be reflected in the school curriculum. The Government has, therefore,decided to review the NCF with a view to updating it to provide the relevanteducation to the children in the country.(d) The revision of curriculum would depend on the finalization and approval ofthe New Education Policy.Hence, no time-line for this purpose can be fixed at thisstage.****
