ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) & (b) :  Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), vide notification dated 07.12.2015, issued the emission standards for Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) for thermal power plants (TPPs).  Accordingly, all TPPs are required to control the emission levels of Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) within the prescribed standards. NTPC Power Plants were also covered under the said notification.(c) & (d) :	NTPC adopted the Lot system to minimize the tendering process time with a view to award and meet the timelines and accordingly, all units of NTPC were divided into various categories for implementation of Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) and new units were tendered first followed by old units. Further, the projects which could not be awarded mainly due to higher cost with respect to cost estimates were retendered in subsequent lots. The details of the Award and Erection progress is placed at Annexure.(e) & (f) :	The contracts have been awarded by NTPC to the contractors who have emerged as the lowest (L1) Bidder project wise through competitive bidding after extensive Reverse Auction process and are within NTPC’s cost estimate range.  The tendering in lots system had no impact on the price evaluation process as price bid evaluation has been carried out separately for each project.  ***********
