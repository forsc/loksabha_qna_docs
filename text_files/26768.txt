The Government has enacted the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016 which came into force on 19.04.2017. Section 34 of the said Act provides for not less than 4% reservation in Government vacancies for certain categories of persons with benchmark disabilities (disability of 40% or more). In order to implement the provision of reservation in Government employment envisaged under the RPwD Act, 2016, the Ministry notified the list of 3566 posts ( 1046 in Group A, 515 in Group B, 1724 in Group C and 281 in Group D) identified  suitable for various categories of persons with benchmark disabilities  on 04.01.2021.       The Government implements an umbrella scheme, namely, Scheme for Implementation of Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (SIPDA) which has a component for Skill Development of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs). Under this component, the Department launched the National Action Plan (NAP) for Skill Development of Persons with Disabilities (between the age group of 15 to 59 years) in March, 2015, with a view to enhancing their scope of employability in both public and private sectors besides promoting self-employment.        The Ministry also implements incentive scheme for providing employment to persons with disabilities (PwDs) in the private sector.       Further, to promote entrepreneurship among PwDs, financial assistance in terms of loan at subsidized rates is provided by the National Handicapped Finance and Development Corporation.*****
