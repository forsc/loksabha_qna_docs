MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a)& (b)No, Sir.(c)	In order to engage students meaningfully through educational activities during their stay at home in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has brought out a series of Alternative Academic Calendars (AAC) for all classes. Following these calendars, students of all classes can receive school education systematically at home with the help of their teachers through available technological and social media and other innovative tools till their schools get open. NCERT has also prepared ‘Students’ Learning Enhancement Guidelines’ with a focus on learning outcome. These guidelines suggest alternative measures to ensure learning outcomes during the school lockdown period.  Besides, Ministry of Education has taken several measures to provide continuous education through various online modes under the PM eVIDYA initiative, which unifies all efforts related to digital/online/on-air education to enable multi-mode access to education. States and Union Territories have been requested to undertake School-based planning for ensuring continuous learning for every learner enrolled in the school and to prepare a Continuous Learning Plan for every child.	The University Grants Commission has also issued guidelines on Examinations and Academic Calendar for the Universities in view of COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown on 29th April, 2020.  As per these guidelines, the Academic Calendar for the Academic Session 2019-2020 has been suggested.  The guidelines also suggest that after end of the lockdown the teaching learning process shall be continued in online mode. Therefore, the Government has taken sufficient actions to ensure that the COVID-19 does not affect learning in the  academic year 2019-2020.For the session 2020-2021, the classes for the 2nd year and 3rd year college students have already been started with effect from 1st August, 2020.	(d)& (e)	The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has already rationalized its syllabi of Classes X and XII to an extent of about 30% for the purpose of Board Examination 2021. The State Governments are to take their own decision in this regard.*****
