ANSWER




                                                        The MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN) (a) to (d) Education is in the concurrent list of the Constitution and majority of the schools are under the domain of respective State and UT Governments. During COVID-19 Pandemic, Ministry of Education has held continuous consultations with the states and UTs at various levels to assess the various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent lockdowns on students. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) was held on November 12, 2021 across India to assess the learning outcomes of students and schools across grades 3, 5, 8, and 10.In order to prevent dropouts, lower enrolments and loss of learning, the Ministry of Education has issued guidelines for identification, smooth admission process and continued education of migrant children on 13th July, 2020, inter-alia, requesting the States to identify and enroll all such children without any procedural formalities and maintain a database of children so admitted. Further, to ensure that children have access to education with quality and equity and to minimize the impact of the pandemic on school education in the country, Ministry of Education has shared guidelines dated 7th January, 2021 with all States which, among others, include identification of out of school children from age 6-18 years, enrolment drives and awareness generation, student support while schools are closed, continued Education for children with Special Needs (CWSN), student support on school reopening and Teacher capacity building. A comprehensive Covid action plan has been shared with the States and UTs on 4th May 2021, outlining the role of local bodies, formation of nodal group at village/town level, conducting door-to-door/helpdesk-based/app based survey to identify out of school children, their mainstreaming and resource sharing. Under Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Samagra Shiksha, which is an overarching scheme for school education covering all levels from pre-primary to senior secondary, financial assistance isprovided to the States and UTs for various activities to reduce dropouts at secondary level, which include opening/strengthening of new schools up to senior secondary level, strengthening school infrastructure, setting up, upgradation and running of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBV) upto class 12, setting up of residential schools/hostels named Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Avasiya Vidyalayas, transport allowance, undertaking enrolment drives, seasonal hostels/ residential camps, provision of vocational education and ICT facilities in schools, etc, financial assistance is also provided for aids and appliances for children with special needs.(e) After discussion with the States and UTs, a multi-pronged approach has been adopted leveraging technology to reach the students in States/UTs. Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing (DIKSHA), Study Webs of active-learning for young aspiring minds (SWAYAM), PRAGYATA guidelines on digital education, e-textbooks and e-content on National Repository of Open Educational Resources (NROER), online virtual labs (OLABS) for practicals related e-content, activity-based and highly engaging modules for special resources for teachers focusing upon experiential learning and competency-based education, NISHTHA (National Initiative for School Heads and Teachers for their Holistic Advancement) online for capacity building programme for Elementary school teachers and School Heads etc. are used by schools, to provide learning facilities.Ministry of Education has taken many initiatives like One Class One Channel of SWAYAM PRABHA to impart education through TV, One DTH channel for hearing impaired students in sign language, Community Radio Stations and a podcast called Shiksha Vani of CBSE. Textbooks and worksheets were supplied to residence of learners and community/mohalla classes are being organized. Innovation Funds of Department of School Education & Literacy were used to set up mobile school, virtual studios, virtual class rooms in schools. Continuous Learning Plan (CLP) for States/UTs has been initiated in all States/UTs, pre-loaded tablets provided under Samagra Shiksha in various States and UTs are effectively used in remote/rural areas where online classes are difficult. Taking cognizance of learning losses in students, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) took several steps which include:• adoption of guidelines on digital education, alternative academic calendar and student learning enhancement guidelines;• development of podcasts on difficult topics and a host of other resources for teachers;• Psychological counselling of students;• alternative scheme to declare results as examinations were interrupted;• introduced biannual Board examination from this year;• change of examination centers for students who have migrated to different places; and training of teachers.(f) CBSE has modified its examination scheme by introducing biannual examinations from the current academic session 2021-22 to implement the recommendations of NEP-2020. The examinations will be held at the end of two terms each on half of the syllabus prescribed for the year. For classes X and XII, the first term examinations of one and a half hour are currently being conducted using the question paper comprising only Multiple Type Questions developed by CBSE and in the presence of external supervisors appointed by CBSE. The second term examination will be held during March–April 2022 for a duration of 2-hours. This would have descriptive questions. The results will be declared either on the basis of both of these examinations or on the basis of first term only if the second term is not possible due to any exigency.*******
