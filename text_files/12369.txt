ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a)to (c) Para 3.1.1 of the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005 states thathome language(s) of children, as defined in para 3.1 should be medium of learning inschools. Para 3.1 of NCF, 2005 defines home language or mother tongue as languagessubsuming the languages of home, larger kinship groups, street and neighbourhoodthat a child acquires naturally from his/her home and societal /environment . If a schooldoes not have provisions for teaching in the child’s home language(s) at the higherlevels, primary schools education must still be covered through the home language(s).There is no State/Union Territory teaching only in English at primary level in the country.(d) A statement indicating State-wise number of primary schools using mothertongue as medium of instruction is placed at Annexure-I. No data about secondary andhigher secondary stage using mother tongue as a medium of instruction is captured andmaintained centrally.(e) & (f) A statement containing the requisite information is placed at Annexure-II.(g) Section 29 (2) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE)Act, 2009,inter-alia, provides that the medium of instruction shall, as far as practicable,be in child’s mother tongue. However, as education is a subject in the Concurrent List ofthe Constitution and majority of schools are under the purview of the StateGovernments, it is for the respective State Governments to take appropriate action inthis regard in their schools.******
