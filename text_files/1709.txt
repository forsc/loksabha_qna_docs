ANSWER




                                                        The Finance Minister(a): As per Reserve Bank of India (RBI) inputs, the Policy Repo rate has changed as under over the last five years: Effective date	Repo rate28.1.2014	8.00 %15.1.2015	7.75 %4.3.2015	7.50 %2.6.2015	7.25 %29.9.2015	6.75 %5.4.2016	6.50 %4.10.2016	6.25 %2.8.2017	6.00 %6.6.2018	6.25 %1.8.2018	6.50 %7.2.2019	6.25 %4.4.2019	6.00 %6.6.2019	5.75 %(b) and (c): As per inputs received from RBI, during the period January 2014 to April 2019, while the policy repo rates were reduced by 200 basis points on cumulative basis, the weighted average lending rate on fresh Rupee loans sanctioned by banks declined by 204 basis points. RBI has further informed that there are lags with which banks adjust their deposit and lending rate in response to change in the policy rate and the transmission is not always proportional or one to one. However, there are some factors like maturity mismatch and interest rate risk which arise due to fixed-rate deposits and loan profile with floating rates in banks, which impede full monetary transmission.  (d) Fiscal policy relates to use of government revenue collection and expenditure for economic objectives. It is primarily concerned with taxation policy and Government’s overall expenditure and expenditure priorities. Banks pay taxes as per law and take note of policy directions indicated by public expenditure.   ***
