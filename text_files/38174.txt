ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) and (b) The Government is seized of the matter.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is currently in its Sixth Assessment cycle and has releasedthe Working Group I contribution reporttitled “Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis”in August 2021 and report titled “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” in February 2022. India has always noted that while it is committed to being part of the solution, the developed countries bear the main responsibility, both historical and current, and should also take the lead urgently for drastic emission reduction in their countries.(c) to (e)India is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and its Kyoto Protocol (KP), and the Paris Agreement (PA).As a Party to the UNFCCC, India periodically submits its National Communications and Biennial Update Reports (BURs) to the UNFCCC which includes national Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory.  As per India’s second BUR, India’s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in 2014 including Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) were 2306.3 million tonne CO2e and as per third BUR, India’s net GHG emissions in 2016 were 2531.07 million tonne CO2e.Being a developing country, the emissions of India, according to the UNFCCC, will grow to meet its social and development needs. However, keeping with the effort to progressively delink growth from emissions, the emission intensity of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has reduced by 24% between 2005 and 2016.The government seeks to address the environmental issues and problems like air pollution, management of waste, degradation of forests, biodiversity loss, and land/soil degradation through promotional and legal measures. The promotional measures are undertaken by various ministries/departments through various programs, schemes and activities in close cooperation, with state governments and all other stakeholders. Further, the regulatory measures are implemented through Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, Environment (Protection) Act, 1986; Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980; the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972; the Indian Forest Act, 1927; the Biological Diversity Act, 2002; Compensatory Afforestation Fund Act, 2016; and rules and Notifications under these Acts, as amended from time to time. Furthermore, a number of actions have been taken by the Government to combat air pollution, waste, degradation of forests, biodiversity loss, and land/soil degradation, which inter alia, includes the following:• Ministry has launched National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) in January 2019 to tackle the problem of air pollution in a comprehensive manner with targets to achieve 20 to 30 per cent reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations by 2024. City Specific Clean Air Action Plans have been prepared and rolled out for implementation in132 non-attainment and million plus cities. • As per Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, local bodies and village panchayats shall facilitate construction, operation and maintenance of solid waste processing facilities and associated infrastructure on their own or with private sector participation or through any agency for optimum utilization of various components of solid waste adopting suitable technology including the technologies and guidelines issued by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs from time to time and standards prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board.• The Government has launched several schemes/programmes which include inter - alia the National Afforestation Program, Green India Mission, Watershed Development Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi SinchayeeYojna (PMKSY) which contribute to the target of restoration of 26 million hectares of degraded land and achievement of land degradation neutrality with focus on sustainable and optimum utilization of land resources. This will help in preserving forests and biodiversity, facilitating conservation of natural resources and improving carbon sinks. • The Biological Diversity Act, 2002 enacted in pursuance to the Convention on Biological Diversity to which India is a Party, is aimed at conservation of biodiversity, sustainable use of its components, and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of these resources, also known as access and benefit sharing (ABS). The Act is implemented through a three-tiered institutional mechanism, namely National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) at the national level, State Biodiversity Boards at the State level, and Biodiversity Management Committees at the local body level.*****
