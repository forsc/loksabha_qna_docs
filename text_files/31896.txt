ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE(DR BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (f): A total 81 cases with Omicron variant with no deaths have been reported in the country (data as on 16th December 2021). This includes Maharashtra (32 cases), Rajasthan (17 cases), Delhi (8 cases), Karnataka (8 cases), Gujarat (5 cases), Kerala (5 cases), Telangana (2 cases) and Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal (1 case each). According to World Health Organization, based on current limited evidence Omicron variant is spreading faster than the Delta variant, also, there are still limited data on the clinical severity of Omicron and more data are needed to understand the severity profile. There are limited available data, and no peer-reviewed evidence, on vaccine efficacy or effectiveness to date for Omicron. The currently available RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 as validated and approved by Indian Council of Medical Research continue to detect Omicron variants. Ministry of Health & FW on basis of risk assessment reviewed the existing travel guidelines and a revised ‘Guidelines for International Arrivals’ was issued on 28th November 2021 (revised on 30th November 2021). As per the guidelines, regions/countries have been re-classified as ‘at-risk’ based on epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in these regions/countries and/or reporting of Omicron variant from these countries. List of such ‘at-risk’ regions/countries is dynamic in nature and has been updated from time to time. All travelers coming from countries deemed ‘at-risk’ will also mandatorily undergo COVID-19 testing on arrival through RT-PCR, followed by mandatory home quarantine for 7 days. A repeat RT-PCR testing shall also be done on 8th day of arrival in India to be monitored by State Health Authorities. Two percent of travelers from ‘non-at-risk’ countries will be tested at random for COVID-19. Individuals tested positive shall be subjected to Whole Genomic Sequencing at identified INSACOG network laboratories to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2 variants (including Omicron).Union Ministry of Health & FW is coordinating and collaborating with other stakeholder Ministries/departments including Ministry of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, Ministry of Railways etc. Further Port/Airport Health Officers at International ports/ airports have been instructed to ensure strict health screening, testing of incoming international passengers and referrals of suspect/confirmed cases.Further, Union Ministry of Health & FW is in regular interaction with all States/UTs through formal communication as well as through video conferencing. States/UTs have been urged to undertake the following activities:•	Strict monitoring of International travelers in the community. •	Contact tracing of positive individuals & follow up for 14 days.•	Genome sequencing of positive samples through INSACOG Labs in a prompt manner.•	Continued monitoring of areas where cluster of positive cases emerge.•	Further strengthening of COVID-19 testing infrastructure and ensuring early identification of cases through adequate testing across the States.•	Ensure preparedness of health infrastructure (availability of ICU, Oxygen supported beds, ventilators, etc.) and upgrade health infrastructure under ECRP-II including in rural areas and for pediatric cases. •	Commissioning all PSA plants, ensuring sufficient logistics, drugs etc.•	Ensure rapid COVID-19 vaccine coverage.•	Ensuring adherence to COVID Appropriate Behaviour.****
