ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)  (a): Coal India Limited (CIL) has informed that there are no schools termed as “Colliery Schools” functioning in Eastern Coalfields Ltd. (ECL), Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. (BCCL), Central Coalfields Ltd. (CCL) and Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. (MCL). However, there are some privately managed schools located in the interior area of these subsidiaries.  (b) to (c): The teachers of these privately managed schools are not given pay by the subsidiary companies of CIL since there is no employer-employee relationship with them. However, aid on the basis of number and qualification of teachers is released to these schools. (d) to (e): Standing Committee on Coal & Steel in its report presented to the Lok Sabha on 12.08.2015 has suggested as under: -            “The committee also desire that the management of these privately managed schools which are getting grants-in-aids from CIL and its Subsidiaries are implementing the wage structure for different categories of teachers as approved by the respective State Government/State Education Board.” As is evident, the Committees'' observation is addressed to the management of these schools and not to CIL who only provide aid to these schools.                                                                        ******
