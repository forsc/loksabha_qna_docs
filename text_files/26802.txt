(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (e) :  This Department is regularly monitoring the implementation of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) including timely settlement of claims through weekly video conference of stakeholders; one to one meetings with insurance companies/States etc. However, settlement of claims in sometimes get delayed due to reasons like delayed transmission of yield data; late release of their share in premium subsidy by some States, yield related disputes between insurance companies and States, non-receipt of account details of some farmers for transfer of claims to the bank account of eligible farmers and National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) related issues, erroneous/incomplete entry of individual farmers data on National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP), delay in remittance of farmers share of premium/non-remittance of farmers share of premium to concerned insurance company etc.  Most of the claims due to localized calamities and mid-season adversity have already been settled in Maharashtra for Kharif 2020.  However, post harvest claims and yield base claims are under process.   Details of reported claims and paid claims in Nanded and Marathwada region under PMFBY for the season  are given below :District/Region	Admissible Claims	Paid Claims	(Rs. in Crore)Nanded	97.51	92.77Marathwada Region (8 Districts	537.61	436.03Non receipt of State share of premium subsidy is one of the major reason for delayed settlement of claims. However, some of the companies also raised issues regarding non-receipt of/ sub-standard yield data.Further, penalty provisions for late settlement of claims by insurance companies and late release of funds by State Governments have also been stipulated under the revised/revamped operational guidelines of the scheme.  Insurance companies have to pay penal interest @12% per annum to the farmers for the period beyond the stipulated period in the PMFBY Guidelines from the date of receipt of final yield data from the State Government and completion of crop damage survey.State Governments are also reminded from time to time regarding payment of State’s pending share in the premium subsidy and timely submission of yield data etc. to facilitate the settlement of pending/delayed claims to eligible farmers.    Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has not received any intimation regarding suicide by farmers due to delayed settlement of claims under PMFBY.*******
