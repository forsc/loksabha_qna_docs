ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) to (c): Share in Union Taxes and Duties is released to the State Governments on the basis of accepted recommendations made by the Finance Commission in terms of Article 280(3)(a) of the Constitution of India. Accordingly, during the period 2015-16 to 2019-20, tax devolution was released @42 per cent of the net proceeds of Union Taxes and Duties. Total direct tax collection during the Financial Year 2019-20 was Rs. 10,50,681 crore out of which Rs. 6,12,557 crore (58.30%) was collected from four States namely Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Tamilnadu. Even though the direct tax collection figure is shown in a particular state, the income generating activities like production, trade, distribution etc. take place in various parts of the country. For example, a major steel company pays direct tax in Mumbai though its major production takes place in Jharkhand. Similarly, SBI, LIC etc. pay direct tax in Mumbai, though their activities are spread across the country. While the data on collection of Non-GST indirect taxes is not maintained State/UT-wise, total CGST collection during the Financial Year 2019-20 was Rs. 2,27,442 crore, out of which Rs. 1,11,192 crore (48.89%) was collected from four States namely Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Tamilnadu. The Finance Commission also prescribes inter-se share of each State in the net proceed of taxes (i.e. divisible pool). The percentage of State’s share and the amount released to these four states during last three years is as under:Sl. No.	State	Share Percentage	State Share (Rs. In Crore)			2017-18	2018-19	2019-201	Maharashtra	5.521	37203.32	42050.43	36219.642	Gujarat	3.084	20782.34	23489.32	20232.093	Karnataka	4.713	31751.99	35894.83	30919.004	Tamilnadu	4.023	27099.72	30638.87	26392.40*****
