ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b) Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) periodically assess the ground water resources pan-India in collaboration with States/Uts. As per the 2017 assessment, out of the total 6881 assessment units (Block/ Taluks/ Mandals/ watersheds/ Firkas) in the country, 1186 units (17 percent of the units) in 17 States/UTs have been categorized as ‘Over-exploited’ where the Annual Ground Water Extraction is more than Annual Extractable Ground Water Resource. State-wise status of assessment units are given in Annexure I.As per the Central Water Commission (CWC) report entitled “Reassessment of Water Availability in India using Space Inputs”, the average annual water resources potential in the country is assessed as 1999.20 BCM. Details of basin-wise water availability is enclosed at Annexure-II.(c) to (e) Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management including conservation and water harvesting in the Country is primarily States’ responsibility.  However, the important measures taken by the Central Government for conservation, management of ground water and effective implementation of rain water harvesting in the country are at the following URL: http://jalshakti-dowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Feb2021.pdf. Contd…P/2//2//In addition, a number of States have done notable work in the field of water conservation/harvesting.  Of these, mention can be made of ‘Mukhyamantri Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan’ in Rajasthan, ‘Jalyukt Shibar’ in Maharashtra, ‘Sujalam Sufalam Abhiyan’ in Gujarat, ‘Mission Kakatiya’ in Telangana, Neeru Chettu’ in Andhra Pradesh, Jal Jeevan Hariyali in Bihar, ‘Jal Hi Jeevan’ in Haryana among others.Government of India launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) in 2019, a time bound campaign with a mission mode approach intended to improve water availability including ground water conditions in the water stressed blocks of 256 districts in India. The districts were selected based on the groundwater extraction level as per the information available with the CGWB. In this regard, teams of officers from Central Government along-with technical officers from Ministry of Jal Shakti were deputed to visit water stressed districts and to work in close collaboration with district level officials to undertake suitable interventions. Further, Ministry launched ‘JSA-II-Catch the Rain’ on 21 December 2020 for awareness generation among people. Government of India is implementing Atal Bhujal Yojana (Atal Jal), a Rs. 6000 Crore Central Sector Scheme, for sustainable management of ground water resources with community participation. Atal Jal is being implemented in 80 water stressed districts of Seven States viz. Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh as a pilot project. The districts have been identified based on the criticality of groundwater situations as proposed by the participating States.CGWB periodically assess the Dynamic Ground Water Resources of the country in collaboration with States/UTs. The next assessment for the year 2020 is under process.(f) Central Government supports construction of water harvesting and conservation works primarily through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana – Watershed Development Component (PMKSY-WDC). The expenditure on water related works under MGNREGA during the last three years is given at Annexure III. Further, State-wise details of water harvesting structures created under PMKSY-WDC is given at Annexure IV.Further other steps by the Central Government may be seen in the URL : http://jalshakti-dowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Feb2021.pdf.*****  ANNEXURE IAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) & (b) of Unstarred Question No. 3840 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 18.03.2021 regarding “Water Stressed Districts”.CATEGORIZATION OF BLOCKS/ MANDALS/ TALUKAS IN INDIA (2017)S.No.	States / Union Territories	Total No. of Assessed Units	Safe	Semi-Critical	Critical	Over-Exploited	Saline			Nos.	%	Nos.	%	Nos.	%	Nos.	%	Nos.	% 	States	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 1	Andhra Pradesh	670	501	75	60	9	24	4	45	7	40	62	Arunachal Pradesh	11	11	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	03	Assam	28	28	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	04	Bihar	534	432	81	72	13	18	3	12	2	0	05	Chattisgarh	146	122	84	22	15	2	1	0	0	0	06	Delhi	34	3	9	7	21	2	6	22	65	0	07	Goa	12	12	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	08	Gujarat	248	194	78	11	4	5	2	25	10	13	59	Haryana	128	26	20	21	16	3	2	78	61	0	010	Himachal Pradesh	8	3	38	1	13	0	0	4	50	0	011	Jammu & Kashmir	22	22	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	012	Jharkhand	260	245	94	10	4	2	1	3	1	0	013	Karnataka	176	97	55	26	15	8	5	45	26	0	014	Kerala	152	119	78	30	20	2	1	1	1	0	015	Madhya Pradesh	313	240	77	44	14	7	2	22	7	0	016	Maharashtra	353	271	77	61	17	9	3	11	3	1	017	Manipur	9	9	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	018	Meghalaya	11	11	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	019	Mizoram	26	26	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	020	Nagaland	11	11	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	021	Odisha	314	303	96	5	2	0	0	0	0	6	222	Punjab	138	22	16	5	4	2	1	109	79	0	023	Rajasthan	295	45	15	29	10	33	11	185	63	3	124	Sikkim	4	4	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	025	Tamil Nadu	1166	427	37	163	14	79	7	462	40	35	326	Telangana	584	278	48	169	29	67	11	70	12	0	027	Tripura	59	59	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	028	Uttar Pradesh*	830	540	65	151	18	48	6	91	11	0	029	Uttarakhand	18	13	72	5	28	0	0	0	0	0	030	West Bengal **	268	191	71	76	28	1	0	0	0	0	0 	Total States	6828	4265	62	968	14	312	5	1185	17	98	1 	Union Territories	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 1	Andaman & Nicobar	36	35	97	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	32	Chandigarh	1	0	0	1	100	0	0	0	0	0	03	Dadra & Nagar Haveli	1	1	100	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	04	Daman & Diu	2	1	50	0	0	1	50	0	0	0	05	Lakshdweep	9	6	67	3	33	0	0	0	0	0	06	Puducherry	4	2	50	0	0	0	0	1	25	1	25 	Total UTs	53	45	85	4	8	1	2	1	2	2	4 	Grand Total	6881	4310	63	972	14	313	5	1186	17	100	1Note	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 Blocks- Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Kerala, M.P., Manipur, Mizoram, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West BengalTaluks -Karnataka, Goa, Gujarat, MaharashtraMandals - Andhra Pradesh, TelanganaDistricts/Valley- Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Meghalaya, Mizoram, NagalandIslands - Lakshadweep, Andaman & Nicobar IslandsFirka-Tamil NaduRegion - PuducherryUT - Chandigarh, Dadar & Nagar Haveli, Daman & DiuTehsil-NCT Delhi*Uttar Pradesh: There are total 820 block and 10 Cities**The Ground Water resources assessment as on 2013 has been considered for the state of West Bengal  ANNEXURE-IIAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) & (b) of Unstarred Question No. 3840 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 18.03.2021 regarding “Water Stressed Districts”.
