ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a)	BharatNet project is being implemented in a phased manner to provide broadband connectivity at all the Gram Panchayats (approx. 2, 50,000) in the country. Bharat Broadband Network Limited (BBNL) is the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for execution of the project. As on 01.02.2021, under BharatNet project (Phase-I & II), by laying 4,94,879 km OFC, a total number of 1,49,026 Gram Panchayats (including BHQs) have been made Service Ready. Further, 3330 GPs have been made Service Ready on satellite media.  Thus a total 1,52,356 Gram Panchayats (including BHQs) have been made Service Ready in the country. (b) & (c)	As on 01.02.2021, under BharatNet project (Phase-I & II), by laying 48,316  km OFC, a total number of  13,398 Gram Panchayats (including BHQs) have been made Service Ready in Gujarat State. The District and Taluka/Block-wise details of Service Ready GPs and OFC network are attached as  Annexure-1. The allocation of funds for BharatNet project by BBNL is State-wise and not District or Taluka/Block-wise. Rs. 2134 Crore (approx.) has been allocated by BBNL for BharatNet project in Gujarat (including Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu). (d) & (e)	As part of the BharatNet project, the Last Mile Connectivity is being provided through Wi-Fi or any other suitable broadband technology, including Fiber to the Home (FTTH), to access broadband/internet services at public places & Government Institutions. As on 01.02.2021, Wi-Fi hotspots have been installed at 1,05,105 GPs and 4,85,723  FTTH connections have been provided. The internet/broadband services can be accessed through the connectivity provided by the BharatNet project, and the same can be used for providing two-way communication between farmers and experts through video conferencing which will help in solving the problems of farmers right in their villages while saving time and resources. Further, in Gujarat, Digital Seva Setu has been launched to make citizen centric services available in all the villages through e-Gram Centres and minimising the need of citizens (including farmers) to visit Taluka/District Centres.
