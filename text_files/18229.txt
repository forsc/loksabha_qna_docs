ANSWER




                                                        (a): ‘Land’ and ‘Colonisation’ are State subjects and therefore, it is the responsibility of the State/ Union Territory (UT) Governments to implement schemes for eradication of slums. However, the Government of India through various programmatic interventions has been assisting States/ UTs both technically and financially to address their housing shortages. In pursuance to Government of India’s vision of facilitating Housing for All by 2022, the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) Mission is being implemented since June, 2015 to provide Central Assistance to States/ UTs/ Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) for providing all weather pucca houses with basic civic infrastructures  like  water,  sanitation,     sewerage, road, electricity etc. to all eligible urban households including slum dwellers. The “In-situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR)” component under PMAY-U Mission mandates use of land as a resource for providing houses to slum dwellers across the country including the metro cities. This approach aims to leverage the locked potential of land under slums to provide houses to the eligible slum dwellers by bringing them into the formal urban settlement. (b) & (c): The States/ UTs are requested to ensure convergence with all relevant schemes including AMRUT in housing projects to be undertaken under PMAY-U Mission.                                          *****
