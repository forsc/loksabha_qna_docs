ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a)	The State-wise details of the ongoing projects and the funds allocated and utilised during the last three years and current year are given at Annexure I and II respectively.(b)	to(d) Construction work on Golden Quadrilateral has already been completed, however 566 projects are behind their completion schedule. These projects are delayed mainly due to land acquisition, utility shifting, non-availability of soil/aggregate, poorperformance of contractors, environment/forest/wildlife clearances, ROB & RUB issues with Railways, public agitation for additional facilities, arbitration/contractual disputes with contractors etc. Delay in completion leads to cost overrun in some projects. To fast-track these projects, various steps such as streamlining of land acquisition &environment clearances, premium re-scheduling, close coordination with other Ministries, revamping of dispute resolution mechanism, frequent review meetings with project developers, State Government and contractors at various levels etc. have been taken up. If delay in projects is attributed to contractor, action is taken against them as per the contract provisions.(e) Details for the length of NHs constructed in the country including Bihar during the last three years and current year are given at Annexure-III.  (f)  Details are given at the annexure-IV.(g)  Various steps are taken by the Government to monitor and check the construction quality of NHs.All National Highways are constructed as per quality standards specified in Ministry of Road Transport and Highways/ Indian Roads Congress (IRC) specifications. The contractor/ Concessionaire has to prepare a Quality Assurance Plan in consultation with Authority’s Engineer (AE)/ Independent Engineer (IE). The tests on various materials at the specified frequencies have to be conducted by the contractor. The AE/IE has also to conduct certain tests at their level to ensure the quality of the works. The Officers of the Authority also inspect the works and there are provision of engagement of external technical audit to conduct the quality check of works. The Maintenance of stretches of NHs, where either Development works have commenced or Operation, Maintenance and Transfer (OMT) Concessions/ Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Contracts have been awarded, are the responsibility of the concerned Concessioners/ Contractors till the Concession Period/ the Defect Liability Period (DLP).Maintenance of balance stretches of NHs, including restoration of damages due to floods, rainfalls, etc., on such stretches, are carried out annually as per available budgetary outlay, inter-se priority and traffic density to keep such NHs in traffic worthy conditions.
