Central Government supplements their efforts in this regard. There is no proposal under consideration in this Ministry to establish sports schools in every district in the country. However, this Ministry has adopted 09 schools and 28 Army Boys Sports Companies as State Level Khelo India Centres under the Khelo India Scheme and 10 schools are covered under the National Sports Talent Contest Scheme of the Sports Authority of India. Further, it may be informed that 247 sports academies have been accreditated under the Khelo India Scheme across the country, including 27 in the State of Karnataka, on the basis of proposals received through the State/UT Governments.****
