ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) &(b)  The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the civil aviation sector globally. The Indian aviation sector including airlines, airports, and related services have also come under financial stress on account of COVID-19 pandemic. At present, the biggest challenge before Indian aviation as also before other countries in aviation is to overcome the adverse impact created by Covid pandemic. Thus at present, broadly the challenges before the Indian aviation are more or less similar to the global challenges faced by global aviation companies. (c) ATF (Jet fuel) cost is a major component of Operating Expenses of the airline. Reduction in ATF price will help the airline industry.(d)  Goods and Service Tax (GST) for economy class flight ticket is already at 5% which is the lowest slab and for business class flight tickets GST is at the next higher slab of 12% only.  Ministry of Civil Aviation has proposed to bring Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) under GST regime which will help reduce the net financial burden on the airlines.(e) & (f) Yes Sir.  International Air Transport Association (IATA) has assessed that due to the COVID pandemic the aviation sector has lost US Dollar 118.5 billion for 2020 globally. Airports Authority of India (AAI) has forecasted that the total passenger traffic in India is likely to reach pre-Covid level by 2024-25. Opening up of the domestic scheduled operations and relaxation in fare capping is subject to prevailing COVID-19 situation, status of operations and passenger demand for air travel. At present domestic operations have reached about 50% of pre-Covid level.  (g) & (h) Yes Sir. A proposal was sent to Ministry of Finance inter alia, seeking exemption of GST on air cargo services for essential commodities, reduction of excise duty on ATF, credit support to airlines by Oil Marketing Companies, interest subvention and financial assistance to Air India.
