ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE(a) and (b): Yes Sir. As per the findings of RBI’s Working Group on digital lending, the number of illegal lending apps stood at approximately 600 from 1.1.2021 to 28.2.2021 and number of these apps are available on app stores in the country. (c) to (e): As per RBI, “Sachet”, a portal established by RBI under State Level Coordination Committee mechanism for registering complaints by public has received approximately 2,562 complaints against digital lending apps from 1.1.2020 to 31.3.2021. Details of these complaints year and state-wise are at Annex. Also, as per findings of the RBI’s Working Group on digital lending, majority of the complaints pertain to lending apps promoted by entities not regulated by the RBI such as companies other than Non-Banking Financial Companies, unincorporated bodies and individuals. Major concerns raised in such complaints were issues of exorbitant interest and charges levied by digital lending apps, and harassment of customers for loan repayments. On Sachet portal, complaints against lending apps promoted by entities not regulated by RBI are sent to concerned Registrar of companies for Ministry of Corporate Affairs registered entities, and to Economic Offences Wing of complainant’s state for unincorporated bodies and individuals. Further, vide press release dated 23.12.2020, RBI had cautioned the general public not to fall prey to unscrupulous activities of unauthorised digital lending platforms/Mobile Apps and verify the antecedents of the company/ firm offering such loans. RBI has also issued advisories to State Governments to keep a check on unauthorised digital lending platforms/Mobile Apps through their respective law enforcement agencies. Following the due process specified in Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information for Public) Rules, 2009 notified under section 69A of Information Technology Act, 2000, MeitY blocked 27 unlawful loan lending apps. ***  	AnnexLok Sabha Unstarred Question no. 2418 for 13.12.2021 regarding “Online Lending Apps”  State wise number of complaints received since January 2020 to March 2021	Maharashtra 	572		Karnataka 	394		Union Territory of Delhi 	352		Haryana 	314		Telangana 	185		Andhra Pradesh 	144		Uttar Pradesh 	142		West Bengal	138		Tamil Nadu 	57		Gujarat 	56		Other States and UTs	208		Total	2,562		Source: RBI		  	Year wise Total complaints		January 2020 to December 2020	1,259		January 2021 to March 2021	1,303		Total	2,562		Source: RBI		***
