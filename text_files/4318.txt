                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a)	The Government had notified 60 Agri Export Zones in 20 States till 2004-05. All the Agri Export Zones have since completed their intended span of 5 years. As such, as of now, there are no functional Agri Export Zones in the country.(b)	Promotion of agricultural exports is a continuous process. To promote the agricultural exports, The Government has introduced a comprehensive Agriculture Export Policy with the following vision:“Harness export potential of Indian agriculture, through suitable policy instruments, to make India a global power in agriculture, and raise farmers’ income.”The Government has also brought out a new Central Sector Scheme – ‘Transport and Marketing Assistance for Specified Agriculture Products’ - for providing assistance for the international component of freight, to mitigate the freight disadvantage for the export of agriculture products, and marketing of agricultural products.The Department of Commerce also has several schemes to promote exports, including exports of agricultural products, viz. Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES), Market Access Initiatives (MAI) Scheme, Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) etc. In addition, assistance to the exporters of agricultural products is also available under the Export Promotion Schemes of Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), Tobacco Board, Tea Board, Coffee Board, Rubber Board and Spices Board.(c)	The product-wise details of agricultural exports from the country, during the last three years, are at Annexure-I. State-wise data for exports is not published by the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence & Statistics (DGCI&S).*******Annexure-IEXPORT OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS Quantity: in thousand units; Value: USD MillionDescription	 	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19	UNIT	Quantity	Value	Quantity	Value	Quantity	ValueMarine Products	KGS	11,85,272.87	5,903.06	14,32,456.67	7,389.22	14,36,680.63	6,802.24Rice -Basmati	TON	3,985.21	3,208.60	4,056.85	4,169.56	4,414.61	4,712.44Buffalo Meat	TON	1,323.58	3,903.49	1,350.25	4,037.11	1,233.38	3,587.15Spices	KGS	10,14,453.31	2,851.95	10,96,322.85	3,115.37	10,91,789.68	3,322.56Rice(Other Than Basmati)	TON	6,770.83	2,525.19	8,818.53	3,636.60	7,599.75	3,040.22Cotton Raw Incld.
