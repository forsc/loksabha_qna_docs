                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (f): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. ****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (f) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 733 BY DR. AMOL RAMSING KOLHE, SHRI SUNIL DATTATRAY TATKARE, DR. HEENA GAVIT,               DR. SUBHASH RAMRAO BHAMRE AND SHRIMATI SUPRIYA SULE TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 26.06.2019 REGARDING UPGRADATION OF SECURITY SYSTEM(a) to (d): Security at Railway stations is not strictly comparable to Airports due to the nature of access to passengers. However, Railways accords high priority to security. It has been decided to provide ‘Integrity Security System (ISS)’ alongwith station specific ‘Station Security Plan’ at 202 Railway stations for controlled access at these identified stations. Total amount allocated for ISS is `406.63 crore out of which upto 31.03.2019 `197.82 crore has been utilized. (e)&(f): While law & order is a State subject, it has been felt that giving RPF more powers in the matters of offences of theft of passengers belongings, drugging and nuisance against women passengers is beneficial for the security system. The idea is at consultation stage at present. However, other measures have been initiated by Railways, through RPF, to strengthen security of passengers which include escorting of trains, access control at important railway stations, prosecution of offenders under the provisions of the Railways Act, coordination with Government Railway Police and concerned District police, etc. For regular monitoring and review of security arrangements for the Railways, State Level Security Committee for Railways (SLSCR) have been constituted for all State/Union Territories (UTs) under the Chairmanship of respective Director General of Police/ Commissioner of States/ Union Territories. ****
