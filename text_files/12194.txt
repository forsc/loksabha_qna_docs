ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b) As per the World Meteorological Organization, the global mean temperature for 2018 was estimated to be 0.99 ± 0.13 °C above the pre-industrial levels (1850–1900). According to the Annual Climate Summary 2018 published by India Meteorological Department (IMD), during 1901-2018 the annual mean temperature showed an increasing trend of 0.60°C/100 years with significant increasing trend in the maximum temperature (1.0°C /100 years) and relatively lower increasing trend (0.20°C/100 years) in the minimum temperature.(c) and (d) According to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions since the pre-industrial era have driven large increases in their atmospheric concentrations. According to the Special Report on ‘The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate’ released in September 2019 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) is rising, with acceleration in recent decades due to increasing rates of ice loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, as well as continued glacier mass loss and ocean thermal expansion. Total GMSL rise for 1902-2015 is 0.16 m (likely range 0.12-0.21 m). The rate of GMSL rise for 2006-2015 of 3.6 mm per year was about 2.5 times the rate for 1901-1990 of 1.4 mm per year. On an average, the sea level along the Indian coast is considered to be rising at about 1.70 mm/year meaning thereby that during the past 50 years, the sea level along the Indian coasts has risen by 8.5 cm. (e) India is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), its Kyoto Protocol (KP) and Paris Agreement (PA). For addressing the challenge of climate change, India adheres to the paramountcy of the UNFCCC processes. It has proactively contributed to multilateral efforts to combat climate change and continues to do so while undertaking its own independent, enhanced initiatives in climate mitigation and adaptation besides meeting all its commitments under the UNFCCC, its KP and PA. Independent studies rate India’s efforts highly and compliant with the requirements under these instruments.The Government is implementing National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which comprises eight missions in specific areas of solar energy, energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan ecosystem, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. NAPCC provides an overarching framework for all climate actions. Thirty-three States/Union Territories (UTs) have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change in line with NAPCC taking into account State’s/UT’s specific issues relating to climate change. Under the Paris Agreement, India has submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) with target to reduce the emissions intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 33 to 35 % by 2030 from 2005 level, to achieve about 40% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, and to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tones of CO2eq through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.***
