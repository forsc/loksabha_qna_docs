                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) & (b):	No, Sir. People from diverse backgrounds coming from all corners of the nation and all segments of the society are recognized and awarded Padma Awards.(c) & (d):	Government has undertaken systemic changes in the process of selection for Padma awards. The Padma Awards have been made highly selective, with only the truly deserving persons getting selected. Government has also emphasized on identifying and recognizing “unsung heroes”, who render selfless service to the nation at the grassroot levels without expecting any recognition or reward.There has been a paradigm change in the nomination process for Padma Awards. Nomination process has been made simple, accessible and online from the year 2016 encouraging citizens at large to participate. In the year 2014, when the nomination process was not online, only 1878 nominations/recommendations were -2/...-2-LS.US.Q.NO.4887 FOR 23.07.2019received for Padma Awards. After the nomination process was made online, the number of nominations/recommendations increased to 18,768 in the year 2016, 35,595 in the year 2017 and 49,992 in the year 2018. The details of the nominees and nominators for Padma Awards since the year 2016 are available on this Ministry’s website www.mha.gov.in.*****
