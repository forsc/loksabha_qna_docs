(b) To enable every rural household in the country to have potable water through Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC) by 2024, Government of India is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM)-Har Ghar Jal in partnership with States.Further, to complete the work in a time-bound manner, following action has been taken:i.)	Every State/ UT has been advised to prepare ‘State Action Plan’, including year-wise plan for providing tap water connections;ii.)	Govt. of India holds regular review meetings with all States & UTs for expediting the implementation including joint review by Union Minister with Chief Ministers of States;iii.)	Central financial assistance, to all eligible States/ UTs, is being provided as per the operational guidelines for the implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission;iv.)
