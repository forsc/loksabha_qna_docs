As per the International Coffee Organization, surplus production during the last five years is mainly responsible for the low prices.However, during the last four months, the monthly average ICO composite indicator price is showing upward trend from 109.70 US cents/lb in November 2020 to 119.35 US cents/lb during February 2021.(c):  The Coffee Board is implementing the Integrated Coffee Development Project under which various interventions such as research & development, technology transfer, capacity building, support to mechanization of estates, coffee area development, market development, support to value addition etc. are undertaken for the overall improvement of production, productivity and quality of coffee.Financial support is also provided to small growers/SHGs/Cooperatives for marketing of coffee on community basis.Coffee Board is also providing advisory service on production related aspects to the coffee growers through Field Force Mobile App and soil fertility through Kaapi Soil Health Monitoring and Management(KSHEMAM)web-portal.
