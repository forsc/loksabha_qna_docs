                                                        ???????  ??? ?????? ?????? (???? ????? ????) THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI  PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) & (b):   	No sir.(c):   (i)	The imports from ASEAN countries under FTAs have to follow the prescribed rules of origin under the FTAs and if these rules of origin are met, the imports are granted preferential tariff under the FTAs.(ii)	Additionally, there are two FTAs, one with Japan and one with Korea. The present data doesn’t substantiate any gross misuse of Indo-Japan and Indo-Korea CEPA for routing Chinese imports into India surreptitiously. (d): 	The details of import-export with Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries     during the last three years are enclosed at Annexure-1. The details of India export with North East Asian (NEA) countries during the last three years are enclosed at Annexure-2. The details of Export-Import with SAARC countries during the last three years are enclosed at Annexure-3.(e): 	India is pursuing with ASEAN countries for initiating the review of ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement to make it more balanced and trade facilitative for businesses. The matter was also recently taken up with ASEAN countries during 17th ASEAN-India Consultations held on 29th August 2020. To bridge the trade balance with NEA countries, through increase in exports, the Government of India has taken various measures to extend support to exporters by facilitating Buyer Seller Meets between potential importers of NEA countries including China and the Indian exporters. In addition, Indian exporters are encouraged to participate in major trade fairs in these countries including China to showcase Indian products.****
