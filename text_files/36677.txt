ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) was launched as an umbrella scheme during the year 2015-16, with an aim to enhance physical access of water on farm and expand cultivable area under assured irrigation, improve on-farm water use efficiency, introduce sustainable water conservation practices, etc. It consists of two major components being implemented by the Department of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, namely, Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP), and Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP). HKKP, in turn, consists of four sub-components, namely, Command Area Development & Water Management (CAD&WM), Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI), Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies, and Ground Water (GW) Development.  In addition, PMKSY also consists of two components being implemented by other Ministries. Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) component is being implemented by Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, while Watershed Development component (WDC) of PMKSY is being implemented by Department of Land Resources. Government of India has approved continuation of PMKSY during 2021-22 to 2025-26. However, extension of Ground Water component under PMKSY-HKKP is presently approved only for 2021-22, while approval of extension of PDMC has been processed separately by Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare for implementation as part of Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY). (b) to (e) The extension of PMKSY for 2021-22 to 2025-26 has been approved by Government of India with an overall outlay of Rs. 93,068.56 crore (central assistance of Rs. 37,454 crore, debt servicing to NABARD for Rs. 20,434.56 crore and State share to be borne by the State Governments being Rs. 35,180 crore). Component-wise details for the central assistance part is as below: Component	Total (Rs. in crore)AIBP and CAD&WM	23,918HKKP (SMI & RRR)	4,580HKKP (GW)	822WDC	8,134Grand Total	37,454 However, approval for PMKSY is for the comprehensive scheme, and does not incorporate State-wise details. State-wise irrigation potential and budgetary estimates under the scheme for implementation during 2021-22 to 2025-26 can be firmed up only after the inclusion of projects under the scheme.  Component-wise works approved for implementation under PMKSY during 2021-26 are as below: i. AIBP including CAD&WM: The scheme proposes completion of 60 ongoing AIBP, 85 ongoing CAD&WM major/ medium projects, and inclusion of more projects for funding under AIBP. In addition, funding of two National Projects, namely Lakhwar and Renuka projects, has also been approved. Creation of 13.88 lakh hectare irrigation potential under AIBP and 30.23 lakh CCA coverage under CAD&WM has been envisaged during 2021-22 to 2025-26. ii. PMKSY-HKKP: Completion of ongoing SMI & RRR of water bodies schemes with creation of 3.7 lakh hectare of irrigation potential, and taking up new projects to create 0.8 lakh hectare of irrigation potential, has been approved for the period 2021-22 to 2025-26. In addition, implementation of ground water component during 2021-22 is targeted to benefit 1.52 lakh hectare irrigation. iii. PMKSY-WD: Completion of sanctioned projects covering 49.5 lakh hectare rainfed/ degraded lands under WD component, along with 2.5 lakh hectare additional area to be brought under protective irrigation, has been approved for implementation during 2021-22 to 2025-26. *****
