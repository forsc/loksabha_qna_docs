STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) TO (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. †*433 ANSWERED ON 23RD JULY, 2019 REGARDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IN FPI (a)&(b): No complaint alleging corruption has been received in respect of assistance for setting up/expansion of food processing industries in the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI). The release of financial assistance under various schemes of the Ministry is contingent upon compliance of conditions and submission of documents by the eligible applicants. The funds under the schemes are released in more than one installments depending on the physical and financial progress of the projects. The time frame for release of first installment varies from scheme to scheme ranging from six months to eight months from the date of approval of the project. There is hardly any human interface in the submission of application and document uploading which are done online. The online system has provision of status tracking on real time basis. Moreover, a system of Committee of Independent Monitors (CIM) is working in MoFPI to redress grievances of the applicants whose proposals are rejected on various grounds on deficiencies. The Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) does not set up stand-alone cold storage projects nor assists for their expansion. However, under the scheme of ‘Integrated Cold Chain and Value Addition Infrastructure’ of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) there is component for cold storage facility. No complaints of delay has since been received under cold chain scheme. Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) and National Horticulture Board (NHB), DAC&FW, assist for the establishment of cold storages.  They have informed that they have not received any complaints of delay in sanctioning of cold storage projects.  (c) to (e): A statement indicating scheme-wise number of proposals received in the Ministry of Food Processing Industries for setting up / expansion of food processing industries, the number of proposals approved for assistance along with amount of assistance approved during the last 3 years is at Annexure. *****
