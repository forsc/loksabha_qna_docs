ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (d): Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21-10-2016 to stimulate regional air connectivity by making air travel affordable to the masses. However, RCS - UDAN is a market driven scheme. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN from time to time. The Implementing Agency has conducted three rounds of bidding under RCS-UDAN so far. Out of the 688 awarded routes, RCS operations have started on 232 routes. Details of the unserved and underserved RCS airports where RCS operations have started are attached as Annexure-1. ;;Promoting affordability of regional air connectivity is envisioned under RCS - UDAN by supporting airline operators through (i) concessions by Central Government, State Governments and airport operators to reduce the cost of airline operations on regional routes and (ii) financial support (Viability Gap Funding) to meet the gap,if any, between the cost of airline operations and expected revenues on regional routes.
