ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL)(a) & (b) The Ministry of Panchayati Raj, through the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA), has been extending financial assistance to supplement the efforts of State Governments for certain critical infrastructural facilities for Gram Panchayats (GPs) such as Gram Panchayat Bhawans, computers and peripherals and co-location of Common Service Centre for the smooth functioning of the Panchayati Raj Institutions. Towards digitalisation of Panchayats for transparent, accountable and efficient administration, the Ministry has developed a simplified task based accounting application e-GramSwaraj for planning, budgeting, implementation, accounting, monitoring, social audit and delivery of citizen services like issue of certificates, licenses, etc. with available resources with the Panchayats. (c)  & (d) Panchayat being “Local Government”, is a State Subject and accordingly, Panchayats are set up and operated through the respective State Panchayati Raj Acts, subject to the provisions of the Constitution, and all Panchayat related matters, including devolution of powers to Panchayats come under jurisdiction of State. Also, Article 243G of the Constitution envisages the panchayats as institutions of self-government and provides that the legislature of a State, may by law, endow the Panchayats with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as institutions of self-government and for the preparation of plans and implementation of schemes for economic development and social justice.***
