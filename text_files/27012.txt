ANSWER




                                                        (a)	and (b):	Government has enacted the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 to create accountability of intermediary platforms and enhanced user safety. On 26th May 2021, Twitter was non-compliant of these Rules because it did not appoint key functionaries including Chief Compliance Officer, Nodal Contact Person and the Resident Grievance Officer. The issue of labelling of user tweets as manipulated media does not come under the purview of above said Rules. Further, on the issue of manipulated media, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has pointed out to Twitter that they are violating the principle of natural justice and urged Twitter to be transparent and equitable in applying the criteria.  (c)	and (d):	As per Twitter, the labelling of certain messages as ‘Manipulated Media’ has been done as per their “Synthetic and Manipulated Media Policy”. However, no specific details of how this policy became applicable have been shared. Government has been engaged with Twitter on this issue.********
