                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (e): A draft National Policy for Rare Diseases has been finalized and placed on the website of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare with a view to elicit comments / views of the stakeholders, including the States/UTs and the general public by 15-02-2020. Contd.......-2-The draft policy provides for lowering the incidence of rare diseases based on an integrated preventive strategy encompassing awareness generation and screening programmes and, within the constraints on resources and competing health care priorities, enable access to affordable health care to patients of rare diseases which are amenable to one-time treatment.  The draft policy has noted that number of persons suffering from diseases considered rare globally, is lacking in India and accordingly provides that for the purpose of the policy the term rare diseases shall construe three goup of disorders (Annexure) identified and categorised by experts based on their clinical experience. Considering the limited data available on rare diseases, and in the light of competing health priorities, the focus of the dradt policy is on prevention of rare diseases as a priority for all the three groups of rare diseases identified by experts.  The draft policy further provides for: i.	Financial support upto Rs. 15 lakh under the Umbrella Scheme of Rashtriya Arogaya Nidhi by the Central Government for treatment  of those rare diseases that require one-time treatment (diseases listed under Group I of Annexure). Beneficiaries for such financial assistance would not be limited to BPL families, but extended to 40% of the population who are eligible as per norms of Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, for their treatment in Government tertiary hospitals only. ii.	State Governments can consider supporting patients of such rare diseases that can be managed with special diets or hormonal supplements or other relatively low cost interventions (Diseases listed under Group II of Annexure.iii.	Keeping in view the resource constraints, and a compelling need to prioritize the available resources to get maximum health gains for the community/population, policy also provides for endeavour by the Government to create alternate funding mechanism through   setting up a digital platform for voluntary individual and corporate donors to contribute to the treatment cost of patients of rare diseases. iv.	Creating a National Registry for rare diseases at ICMR with the objective of preparing a database of various rare diseases, for which action has already been initiated by ICMR.  In the meanwhile, under the Umbrella Scheme of Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi, a component of rare disease has been included w.e.f. 01.01.2019 for providing one-time financial assistance upto Rs.15 lakh to patients belonging to families living below threshold poverty line for treatment of identified Rare Diseases amenable to one-time treatment in Government hospitals.  An amount of Rs.100 crore has been allocated for Rare Disease component of Umbrella Scheme of Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi during 2019-20...................
