RAMAPATI RAM TRIPATHI, MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT REGARDING “STEEL BASED INDUSTRIES”(a)	The total number of steel industry in the country in 2018-19 stood at 1217.  State-wise details of existing steel industries is given at Annexure. Further, as per the newly launched ‘Steel Import Monitoring System’ (SIMS), for monitoring all steel imports in the country, its usage in all HS code tariff lines (industries) will be captured. (b)	Details of import & export of raw steel and steel products during last three years are given below:-Year	Raw Steel & Steel Products (in mt)	Import	Export2016-17	9.40	12.992017-18	9.89	15.412018-19	10.83	11.97Source: JPC & DGFT; mt=million tonnes (c)	The details of requirement of iron ore and coking coal in respect of three CPSE companies for each of the next three years are as under:-Financial Year	Requirement (in Million Tonnes)	Iron Ore	Coking CoalSteel Authority of India Limited (SAIL)	2020-21	33.825	18.45	2021-22	34.65	18.90	2022-23	35.475	19.35Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL)	2020-21	11.6	5.56	2021-22	12.1	6.03 	2022-23	12.1	5.68Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited (NINL)	2020-21	1.76	0.99	2021-22	1.92	1.08	2022-23	3.0	1.8 (d)	The production of iron ore in the country is sufficient to meet the current demand/consumption by domestic steel industry. However, the entire demand of coking coal is not met from the domestic production as the supply of coking coal in the country is limited and thus no option is left but to resort to import of coking coal.(e)	The supply of iron ore during last year i.e. 2018-19 was 207.7 MT against its demand of 189 MT. 	During 2018-19 the total demand of coking coal for steel industry was 58.37 MT. Out of this 54.80 MT were met through imports and 1.6 MT was provided by Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) and remaining 1.97 MT was catered by SAIL and TATA Steel.********
