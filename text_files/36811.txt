                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a)In order to achieve universal literacy, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched the Samagra Shiksha in school education system as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme with effect from Financial Year 2018-19. It envisages the ‘school’ as a continuum from pre-school, primary, upper primary, secondary to senior secondary levels. The States/UTs are assisted by the central government to implement the Samagra Shiksha as a programme for providing universal access and retention, bridging the gender and social category gaps in education and enhancement of learning level of children at all levels of school education. The Scheme is in accordance with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for Education and has now been aligned with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 that is to ensure inclusive and equitable, quality and holistic school education. The scheme was initially approved from 2018-19 to 2020-21 and has now been revised and extended upto 2025-26. 		In order to improve the literacy rate among adults in the country, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Adult Education namely Saakshar Bharat was implemented in the rural areas of 404 districts in 26 States and one UT, that had adult female literacy rate of 50 percent and below as per Census 2001, including left wing extremism affected districts, irrespective of their literacy rates, with special focus on women and other disadvantaged groups, till March 2018. The target was to raise the overall literacy rate of the country to 80 per cent and reduce gender gap to 10 percentage point by end of XII five year plan. During the implementation of Saakshar Bharat scheme, against the overall target of making 7 crore adult non-literate, around 7.64 crore learners, passed the biannual Basic Literacy Assessment Tests conducted by National Institute of Open Schooling, between August, 2010 to March, 2018, were certified as literates. Further, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Adult Education “Padhna Likhna Abhiyaan” is being implemented in the Country during the financial year 2020-22, with a target of making 48.16 lakh adult non-literates as literates. After that, the Union of India has approved a new Scheme, namely, “New India Literacy Programme (NILP)” to align with the NEP and support the States and Union Territories in promoting literacy among non-literates across the country covering 5 crore non-literates. The scheme has been approved with a financial outlay of Rs.1037.90 crore including Central share of Rs.700.00 crore and State share of Rs.337.90 crore during the implementation period from 2022-23 to 2026-27.(b)The literacy data in the country is collected through decennial census operation conducted by Registrar General of India. The last Census was held in 2011. A statement containing the details of state-wise and gender-wise details of adult illiterates across the country as per Census 2011 is at Annexure-I.(c)Aspirational Districts Programme was launched in 2018 to bring rapid transformationin the relatively underdeveloped Districts. There are 112 Aspirational Districts, across 26States and 1 Union Territory. These were selected through a transparent process on the basis of published data. A statement indicating the list of Aspirational Districts is at Annexure – II. The budget allocation for Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Adult Education “Padhna Likhna Abhiyaan” was Rs.95.25 Crore during 2020-21. The Union of India has approved a new Scheme, namely, “New India Literacy Programme (NILP)” to align with the NEP and support the States and Union Territories in promoting literacy among non-literates across the country covering 5 crore non-literates. The scheme has been approved with a financial outlay of Rs.1037.90 crore including Central share of Rs.700.00 crore and State share of Rs.337.90 crore during the implementation period from 2022-23 to 2026-27.***
