ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. *****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1412 BY ADV. A. M. ARIFF TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 27.11.2019 REGARDING COMPLETION OF ROBs(a): Works of Road Over Bridges (ROBs) in Kuthirapanthi and Malikamukku as part of Alappuzha bypass which fall on National Highway (NH) are being taken by NH wing of Kerala State Government on deposit terms and not in lieu of any existing level crossings (LCs).  Railway portion is under supervision of Railway.  Completion of ROBs in Kuthirapanthi and Malikamukku has to be done by NH wing of Kerala State Government.(b) & (c): Works for construction of ROBs at Thuravoor in lieu of LC No. 23, at Cherthala in lieu of Level crossing (LC) No. 33 on Ernakulam-Allappuzha-Kayankulam section and at Vavvakavu in lieu of Level crossing (LC) No. 48 on Kayankulam-Kollam section has been proposed by State Government on cost sharing basis.  Effort will be made for inclusion of these works in Budget 2020-21.The ROB at Chittumoola in lieu of LC No. 50 on Kayankulam-Kollam section has been sanctioned on cost sharing basis.  The General Arrangement Drawing of this ROB is under scrutiny by Railways.LC at Malikamukku (LC No. 55) between Mararikulam and Allappuzha stations on Ernakulam-Allappuzha-Kayankulam section does not qualify for its replacement by Road Over Bridge (ROB) on cost sharing basis as traffic density at this LC is less than one lakh Train Vehicle Unit (TVU).  Normally, Railway undertakes construction of ROBs in Railway portion whereas approaches are being constructed by State Government.  Generally, there is no problem of construction of ROBs in Railway portion.  However, it is difficult to construct ROBs on approaches because it depends upon many factors such as availability of land, removal of encroachments, fixing the alignment of approaches, allocation of requisite funds, etc.  Therefore, it is not possible to fix the time schedule for construction of ROB projects.*****
