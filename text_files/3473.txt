                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):    Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has informed that Carbonated beverages have unique properties that may potentially exacerbate gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), such as high acidity and carbonation. However, a systematic review carried out on effects of carbonated beverages on gastro-oesophageal reflux disease concluded that there is no direct evidence that carbonated beverages promote or exacerbate GERD.(b) to (c): ICMR has not carried out any study on whether majority of the fried packaging snacks has high cholesterol and can cause diabetes tendencies. However, ICMR has initiated a multi centre Task Force study entitled “Consumption pattern of food and food products/items high in fat, salt and sugar among selected cities/towns and rural population of India” in 2018 at 16 locations of the country with the primary objective to assess the consumption pattern of food and food products/items high in fat, salt and sugar, from organized and unorganized sectors. The study   covers 66000 households from selected metropolitan, urban, rural and tribal cities covering all zones of the country i.e, North, North East, Central, East, West and South to asses  various parameters such as anthropometric status, biochemical profile (random blood sugar, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol)   and  harmful effects of foods and food products/items rich in fat, salt and sugar and importance of physical activity.    (d):   Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has prescribed food standards for most of the food categories under Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards and Food Additives) Regulations, 2011. These Regulations also contain list of permitted food additives and limits of food additives permitted in food categories. FSSAI has also prescribed the limits of heavy metals, crop contaminants, pesticides and antibiotics residues in various commodities under Food Safety and Standards (Contaminants, Toxins and Residues) Regulations, 2011. The responsibility and liabilities of Food Business Operators (FBOs) including manufacturers, packers, wholesalers, distributors and sellers are prescribed under Section 26 and Section 27 respectively of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. Schedule 4 of the Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration) Regulations 2011 prescribes the sanitary and hygiene practices required to be observed by the FBOs.Further, every Food Business Operator manufacturing pre-packaged food items has to follow the provisions of Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labelling) Regulations, 2011 wherein it is mandatory for the pre-packaged food to display nutritional information, list of ingredients, ‘best before’   etc. as prescribed under sub-regulation 2.2.2 of these Regulations. FSSAI has also formulated a regulation on definition and front-of-packing labelling of High Fat Salt Sugar (HFSS) Foods, as a measure to enable consumer to be aware of such products and make an informed choice while purchasing these products. It has been draft notified for inviting public comments.  The implementation and enforcement of the provisions of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and Rules and Regulations made thereunder primarily rests with the State/UT Governments.……………..
