ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION (RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a) and (b): In the SDG India Index 2019-20, data pertaining to the percentage of people living below poverty line in India has been sourced from estimates of the Tendulkar Committee Report, 2011-12. As per the report, 21.92% of the people in India live below poverty line.  No new official estimate on poverty line in India is available other than the 2011 Tendulkar Estimates. However, as a result of consistent endeavours of the Government of India, extreme poverty, as measured by the World Bank''s International Poverty Line, has plummeted from 21.2 per cent to 13.4 per cent in 2015. Multidimensional Poverty also came down by half to 27.5 per cent between 2005-06 and 2015-16, leading to over 271 million people climbing out of poverty, as established by the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index 2018 developed by Oxford Poverty Human Index (OPHI)-UNDP.The SDG India Index 2019 is available via an online dashboard (http://sdgindiaindex.niti.gov.in/). The report is in the public domain and can be found in https://niti.gov.in/sites/default/files/2019-12/SDG-India-Index-2.0_27-Dec.pdf(c) and (d): The Government of India through the various Union Ministries/Departments has adopted a multi-pronged strategy to eliminate poverty, reduce inequalities and to promote social and financial inclusion of all communities. This strategy largely focusses on provision of basic services, social protection and employment and income generation. Further, the State Governments and Union Territories are key drivers for achieving the SDGs within the stipulated time frame and implement a host of programmes of their own apart from the Centrally Sponsored Schemes of various Union Ministries/Departments.*****
