ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FORMINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYAND EARTH SCIENCES(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a)	As on today, there is no proven scientific technique available, anywhere in the world, to predict/forecast in advance the occurrence of earthquakes with the reasonable degree of accuracy with regard to space, time and magnitude. No country has the capability of predicting the occurrence of earthquakes in advance. However, research efforts are made in India and elsewhere for developing an Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) System, to alert people once an Earthquake occurs based on the arrival time of P-wave of the Earthquake. The warning time however is much shorter and of the order of a few seconds. The fidelity, robustness and success rate of such warning system are to be assessed thoroughly before the system can be considered for real time operations. National Centre of Seismology (NCS) however uses a large network of seismological stations (115 stations) to monitor the occurrence of earthquakes and report the time, magnitude and depth within about 5 minutes of the occurrence of an earthquake. (b)	Does not arise(c)	Does not arise.(d)	Does not arise.
