                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (e) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.669 BY SHRI KURUVA GORANTLA MADHAV TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 05.02.2020 REGARDING RAILWAY PROJECTS IN ANDHRA PRADESH   (a) to (e):  Railway projects are sanctioned Zonal Railway wise, not State wise. However, presently, 31 projects (17 new lines and 14 doubling projects),  costing ?52,686 crore, for 4,677 km length, falling fully/partly in Andhra Pradesh, are under different stages of planning/approval/execution, out of which, commissioning of 265 km length has been achieved and an expenditure of ?7892 crore has been incurred upto March 2019. This includes:?	17 New Line Projects covering a length of 2027 km, at a cost of ?25,684 crore. Out of which commissioning of 186 Km length has been achieved and an expenditure of ?4,143 crore has been incurred upto March 2019. An outlay of ?1,105 crore has been provided for 2019-20. ?	14 Doubling Projects covering a length of 2,649 km at a cost of ?27,002 crore. Out of which commissioning of 79 Km length has been achieved and an expenditure of ?3,749 crore has been incurred upto March 2019. An outlay of  ?1,817 crore has been provided for 2019-20.The project-wise details of projects including cost, expenditure and outlay are made available in public domain on Indian Railways’ website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in >Ministry of Railways >Railway Board >About Indian Railways >Railway Board Directorates >Finance (Budget)>Railway-wise Works Machinery & Rolling Stock Programme>Regular Budget(year).                                       ?	Budget Allocation: •	Average Budget allocation for infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/partly in the State of Andhra Pradesh, during 2014-19 has been enhanced to ?2830 crore per year from ?886 crore per year during 2009-14, which is 319% of average annual budget outlay of 2009-14.•	Total allocation of Budget for infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/partly in the State of Andhra Pradesh in 2019-20 is ?3885 crore which is 438% of annual budget outlay of 2009-14.  ?	Commissioning of New Line, Gauge Conversion and Doubling Projects:•	During 2009-14, 363 km length (81 km New Line, 144 km Gauge Conversion and 138 km Doubling), falling fully/partly in Andhra Pradesh has been commissioned at an average rate of 72.6 km per year.•	During 2014-19, 377 km length (258 km New Line, 119 km Doubling), falling fully/partly in the State of Andhra Pradesh has been commissioned) at an average rate of 75.4 km per year, which is 104% of commissioning during 2009-2014.Many of these projects are getting delayed due to land acquisition, forestry clearance, wildlife clearance, shifting of utilities and non deposition of State Govt.’s share in cost sharing projects. Ministry of Railways has requested Govt. of Andhra Pradesh to take appropriate action for clearing bottlenecks and to deposit their due share in cost sharing projects so that the pace of execution of Railway Projects is expedited. The outstanding amount towards Government of Andhra Pradesh is of the order of ?1280 crore. The completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions, cooperation and zeal of State Government for early completion of project, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions  of working agencies/contractors etc. and all these factors vary from project to project and site to site and affect the completion time and cost of the project.To ensure that project is completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, Divisional level, Zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues obstructing the progress of projects. Besides to ensure that projects are completed even before time. Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects.       For important projects, capacity enhancement projects, last mile connectivity etc,  institutional financing has been arranged which has increased Railways’ capacity for committed fund provision for capacity enhancement projects.*****
