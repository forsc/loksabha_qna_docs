The GoS have held seven meetings upto end of February, 2020. The draft Request for Qualification and the draft Concession Agreement, indicating the tentative list of over 100 Origin-Destination pairs (clusterwise), have been uploaded on the websites of NITI Aayog and Indian Railways for seeking feedback from the stakeholders. The contours of the policy and the terms and conditions are yet to be finalised. The likely revenue to be generated can be estimated only after the completion of the bidding process. *****
