                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (c):	Under the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, both Central and State Governments are appropriate Governments to fix, review and revise the minimum wages of the workers employed in the scheduled employments under their respective jurisdictions. Rates fixed in the Central sphere are applicable to establishments under the authority of Central Government, railway administration, mines, oil-fields, major port or any corporation established by a Central Government. Employments other than the scheduled employments for central Sphere come under the purview of State Government and accordingly State Government wages are applicable in such employments.          	As a step towards a uniform wage structure, the concept of National Floor Level Minimum Wage (NFLMW) was introduced by the Government in 1996 as a non statutory measure. It is revised from time to time taking into account the increase in the Consumer Price Index Number. NFLMW has been revised from Rs.160/- to Rs.176/-per day w. e. f 01.06.2017. The State Governments are requested to fix and revise minimum wages in scheduled employments not below the NFLMW.*******
