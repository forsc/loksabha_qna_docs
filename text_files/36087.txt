STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. *314 TO BE ANSWERED ON 24.03.2022 IN LOK SABHA REGARDING “DECLINE IN GROUND WATER LEVELS” (a) & (b) Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) is periodically monitoring the ground water levels throughout the Country on a regional scale, through a network of monitoring wells. In order to assess the long term fluctuation in ground water level, the water level data collected by CGWB during November 2021 has been compared with the decadal mean of November (2011-2020). Analysis of water level data indicates decline in ground water level in about 34% wells in Madhya Pradesh, 18% wells in Bihar, 26% wells in Uttar Pradesh and 59% wells in Rajasthan whereas the remaining wells registered rise in ground water level.Further, in Madhya Pradesh, about 23% of the wells monitored in Dewas district have registered decline in ground water level, whereas about 52% in Sagar District showed declining trend. In Bihar, about 16% of the wells monitored in Patna/Patliputra district have registered decline in ground water level. In Uttar Pradesh, no decline has been observed in the district of Pratapgarah, however, Bahraich district under which Kaisergunj falls has shown 20 % of the wells have declining trend of groundwater level . In Rajasthan, about 50% of the wells monitored in Chittorgarh have registered decline in ground water level. Details are given at Annexure-I (A,B,C & D).(c) & (d) Though Water is a State subject, Central Government has taken a number of important measures for conservation, management of ground water including effective implementation of rain water harvesting in the country, which can be seen at URL:http://jalshakti-dowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Feb2021.pdf. Some of the important initiatives in this regard are also given at Annexure II.Central Government generally support construction of water conservation & rain water harvesting structures through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana – Watershed Development Component (PMKSY-WDC).  Details of funds released to States of Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan under these schemes in the last three years are given at Annexure III.***** ANNEXURE-IAANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) & (b) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. *314 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 24.03.2022 REGARDING “DECLINE IN GROUND WATER LEVELS”.District -wise Decadal Water Level Fluctuation with Mean [November (2011 to 2020] and November 2021 in MADHYA PRADESHS.

In this regard, teams of officers from Central Government along-with technical officers from Ministry of Jal Shakti were deputed to visit water stressed districts and to work in close collaboration with district level officials to undertake suitable interventions.  In addition, Ministry of Jal Shakti has taken up the “Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain” (JSA:CTR) with the theme “Catch the Rain - Where it Falls When it Falls” to cover all the blocks of all districts (rural as well as urban areas) across the country during 22nd March 2021 to 30th November 2021. The campaign was launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on 22 March 2021. Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater- 2020 has been prepared by CGWB in consultation with States/UTs which is a macro level plan indicating various structures for the different terrain conditions of the country. The Master Plan - 2020 envisages construction of about 1.42 crore rain water harvesting and artificial recharge structures in the country to harness 185 Billion Cubic Metre (BCM). The “Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Ground Water in India - 2020” is available at http://cgwb.gov.in/Master%20Plan%20to%20GW%20Recharge%202020.pdf.Further, in Madhya Pradesh, the Master Plan envisages construction of about 7.2 lakh Rain water harvesting and artificial recharge structures to harness 9188 Million Cubic Metre (MCM) of monsoon rainfall. Similarly  the Master Plan recommends 91 thousand structures for harvesting 66352 MCM of rainfall in Bihar, 23 thousand structures for harvesting 2743 MCM of rainfall in Uttar Pradesh, 7.7 lakh structures for harvesting 5305 MCM of rainfall in Rajasthan,. National Aquifer Mapping and Management program (NAQUIM) is being implemented by CGWB as part of Ground Water Management and Regulation (GWM & R) Scheme, a Central Sector scheme. NAQUIM envisages mapping of aquifers (water bearing formations), their characterization and development of Aquifer Management Plans to facilitate sustainable management of groundwater resources in the country. NAQUIM outputs are shared with States/UTs for suitable interventions. So far, in Madhya Pradesh, 162147 Sq.Km., in Bihar 50707 Sq.Km., in Uttara Pradesh, 190895 Sq. Km. and in Rajasthan, 287851 Sq.Km. areas have been covered.Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has formulated guidelines for the States to adopt measures suitable to local conditions, such as Unified Building Bye Laws (UBBL) of Delhi, 2016, Model Building Bye Laws (MBBL), 2016 and Urban and Regional Development Plan Formulation and Implementation (URDPFI) Guidelines, 2014, wherein adequate focus has been given on requirement of rainwater harvesting and water conservation measures. As per MBBL, all buildings having a plot size of 100 sq.m. or, more shall mandatorily include the complete proposal of rainwater harvesting. 33 States/ UTs have adopted the features of these Bye Laws.Ministry of Jal Shakti, Department of Water Resources, RD & GR (DoWR, RD & GR) is implementing Atal Bhujal Yojana (Atal Jal), a Rs. 6,000 crore Central Sector Scheme, for sustainable management of ground water resources with community participation. Atal Jal is being implemented in 80 water stressed districts and 8,565 Gram Panchayats of seven States viz. Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.
