ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) and (b): No. There is no proposal under consideration of the Union Government for granting Special Category Status and allowing sharing pattern for Centrally Sponsored Scheme in the ratio of 90:10 at par with North-Eastern and Himalayan States to the State of Odisha. Further, the Fourteenth Finance Commission did not make a distinction between Special and General Category States in determining their norms and recommendations.                                              ******
