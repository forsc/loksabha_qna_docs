ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) to (d): 	The Government alongwith  Food Corporation of India (FCI) and various States Governments formulate procurement plan to expedite the procurement of wheat and paddy  from farmers  at the purchase centres. The Government, FCI have taken various steps to improve services/ delivery of FCI and state procuring agencies. The steps taken in this regard are: i) 	Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) of MSP has been implemented across the country. This has brought in responsibility, transparency, real time monitoring and reduces pilferage in the system. DBT eliminates purchase from fictitious bogus farmers, reduces diversion and duplication of payment as payment is made directly to farmer’s bank account which in many States is linked with Aadhaar number of the farmers. .....2/--2-ii) 	FCI and most of the State Governments have developed their own online procurement system which ushers in transparency and convenience to the farmers through proper registration and monitoring of actual procurement. The online procurement system has largely eliminated the procurement from middlemen and has resulted in better targeting of the MSP to farmers. (iii) 	The State agencies are also using Expenditure Advance Transfer module (EAT) of Public Financial Module System (PFMS) while making payment, as mandated by the Ministry of Finance, GOI by integrating their online payment system with PFMS to maintain financial integrity.iv) 	Minimum Support Price (MSP) operations are given wide publicity through pamphlets, banners, sign boards, radio, TV and advertisements through print & electronic media. v) 	Farmers are made aware of the quality specifications and purchase system, etc. to facilitate bringing their produce conforming to the specifications. vi) 	Procurement centres are opened by respective State Government Agencies/  Food Corporation of India, taking into account the production, marketable surplus, convenience of farmers and availability of other logistics / infrastructure such as storage and transportation, etc. Large number of temporary purchase centres, in addition to the existing Mandis and depots/godowns are also established at key points for the convenience of farmers.vii) 	FCI is undertaking Third Party Assessment of procurement centres across the country. The level of services provided to farmers in procurement centres operated by FCI and State agencies shall be covered in this exercise. Additionally, warehouses owned by FCI are getting certified by WRDA along with conducting Third Party Assessment of all warehouses of FCI (Owned & Hired).****
