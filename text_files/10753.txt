                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a) to (e):  A statement is laid on the Table of the HouseSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 380* FOR 13TH DECEMBER, 2019(a) to (e) Section 10D of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 prescribes conducting of a uniform entrance examination namely National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) to all medical educational institutions at undergraduate and post-graduate level.  The NEET is followed by a common counselling conducted by the Directorate General of Health Services and the designated authorities of the State Governments for admission to the respective quota seats. However, no data with regard to admissions of the students made with or without taking private coaching classes is maintained centrally. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has received requests from State Government of Tamil Nadu and the Union Territory of Puducherry to exempt students from appearing in NEET for admission to undergraduate and postgraduate medical courses. The proposals were in direct contravention of Section 10D of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 and thus, the same were not supported by the Ministry. The provisions of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 for conducting NEET shall apply across the country without any exemption. Further, the Hon’ble High Court of Madras has made certain observations with regard to NEET in the orders passed in W.A No. 2931 of 2019. However, it has not recorded any observation for scrapping of NEET. The Hon’ble Supreme Court vide order dated 11.04.2016 in R.P. 2159-2268 of 2013 in T.C. (c) 98 of 2013 had allowed conducting of NEET and the apex court vide order dated 09.05.2016 also clarified that only NEET would enable students to get admission to MBBS or BDS studies.*****
