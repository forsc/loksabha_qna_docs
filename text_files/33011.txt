ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Sagarmala Programme was approved by the Union Cabinet in 2015 to promote port-led development in the country. Giving special emphasis to modernization of Indian ports, 241 projects at cost of Rs.2.61 lakh crore has been taken up for implementation under Sagarmala. This covers transforming existing ports by modernization of port infrastructure which involves mechanization of existing berths, creation of new capacity, developing deep drafts for future generation ships, etc. Out of 241 projects, total 78 projects worth Rs. 27,019 crore have been completed, adding capacity of more than 230 MTPA at Major Ports. Remaining 163 projects are currently under various stages of development and implementation.(b & c)  Connectivity is one of the critical enablers for ports as it is the end-to-end effectiveness of the logistics system that drives competitiveness for industry. In view of above, the Sagarmala Programme has a dedicated pillar of Port Connectivity projects for enhancing connectivity between ports and domestic production / consumption centers. There are 190 road and rail connectivity projects worth Rs. 1.22 lakh crore identified for implementation under Sagarmala focusing on connectivity of Major and Non-Major ports. Out of which, 51 projects have been completed and 139 projects are in various stages of development and implementation. These projects are being implemented by Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways, Ministry of Railways, Major Ports and State agencies.                                                    *****
