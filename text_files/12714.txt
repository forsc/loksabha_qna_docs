                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) to (d): No direction has been given to State Governments/UT Administrations for issue of new ration cards to eligible beneficiaries as per the standard format for implementation of ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ plan. However, for sake of uniformity, they have been suggested to adopt a standard format only when they decide to print/issue new ration cards in future under NFSA.............2/--2-	The Department in association with State/UT Governments is implementing a scheme on “Integrated Management of Public Distribution System (IM-PDS)” w.e.f. April 2018. This scheme, inter-alia, includes implementation of nation-wide portability of ration card holders covered under the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) to enable the migratory ration card holders/beneficiaries in the country to lift their entitled foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) of their choice anywhere in the country by using their existing/same ration card after biometric/Aadhaar authentication on electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices installed at the FPSs, through ''One Nation One Ration Card'' plan. 	Presently, the facility of national/inter-State portability under ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ plan is available for beneficiaries of 12 States, namely - Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Kerala, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Telangana and Tripura. Initially, the inter-State/national portability was started in pilot mode in two clusters of two adjoining States of Andhra Pradesh & Telangana and Gujarat & Maharashtra w.e.f. August 2019. Further, two more clusters of two adjoining States namely, Haryana & Rajasthan and Karnataka & Kerala were added w.e.f. October 2019.
