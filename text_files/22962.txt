India’s growth rate of scientific publication as per the NSF database was 10.7% as against the world average of 3.8% during 2008-18.The Department of Science and Technology (DST) including its statutory body, Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) has been implementing several schemes and programmes such as Fund for Improvement of S&T Infrastructure (FIST), Sophisticated Analytical Instrument Facilities (SAIF), Nano Mission, Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE), Women Scientist Scheme (WOS), Core Research Grant (CRG), Intensification of Research in High Priority Areas (IRHPA), Start-Up Research Grant, National Postdoctoral Fellowship, Research fellowships such as JC Bose and Swarnajayanti etc. to elevate the basic research in country to higher levels. Department of Biotechnology (DBT) has been promoting basic research in Modern Biology, as a separate programme to create a knowledge driven biotech sector and constantly supporting basic research projects in life sciences at various institutions/ organizations for understanding the fundamental biological processes/ mechanisms of cellular biology as well as their application for the benefits of the mankind. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) is also promoting fundamental research across all its constituent laboratories.

In elevating the quality of basic research, the Ministry has constantly been introducing new schemes and programmes to address and attend changing needs of S&T landscape. This includes institution of schemes like SERB-SUPRA (Scientific and Useful Profound Research Advancement) which looks for projects beyond normal core research and purposefully designed for high quality proposals consisting of new hypothesis or challenge existing ones, and provide ''out-of-box'' solutions.
