                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI FAGGAN SINGH KULASTE)(a)        The details of road length sanctioned and completed so far under PMGSY-I, II and III in Supaul district of Bihar and Purulia district of West Bengal are as under:District	Road length Sanctioned (km)	        Road length Completed (km)	                PMGSY-I	  PMGSY-II  PMGSY-III     PMGSY-I   PMGSY-II    PMGSY-IIISupaul (Bihar)	        672.92	   26.26	-	  657.76    26.26	   -Purulia (West Bengal) 2,264.68	  143.66	-	2,230.67   142.91	   - (b)        All the proposals of PMGSY-II have already been sanctioned by the Ministry to the state of Bihar & West Bengal including Supaul district of Bihar and Purulia district of West Bengal. As on date, no proposal of these states under PMGSY-II is pending in the Ministry. (c)        As per PMGSY guidelines, maintenance of roads constructed under the programme is the responsibility of the state governments.  However Ministry on its part have taken the following steps/measures   to ensure that  the roads constructed under PMGSY are maintained properly :(i)  All road works sanctioned under the scheme are covered by initial five year maintenance contracts to be entered into along with the construction contract, with the same contractor, as per the Standard Bidding Document. (ii)  Maintenance funds to service the contract are required to be budgeted by the State Governments and placed at the disposal of the State Rural Roads Development Agencies (SRRDAs) in a separate maintenance account. On expiry of this 5 year post construction maintenance, PMGSY roads are required to be placed under Zonal maintenance contracts consisting of 5 year maintenance including renewal as per maintenance cycle, from time to time, to be funded by the state governments. (iii)   Further in order to ensure that states provide required maintenance funds during the design life of the road being constructed under PMGSY-III, a provision has been added in the programme guidelines under which the states have to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India before launching of the scheme in the concerned state for providing adequate funds for the maintenance of roads constructed/ upgraded under PMGSY for initial five years routine maintenance, and for further five year routine maintenance including periodic renewal as per requirement. (iv) As per para 19.3 (vi) of the programme guidelines, a certificate from CEO of SRRDA is taken at the time of release of second installment of the Programme Fund to the effect that Maintenance funds required as per maintenance contracts in force had been spent during the previous financial year. For release after May of a year, the certificate should also include that 50% of such maintenance fund requirements for the current Financial Year has been released by the State, whereas for releases after November the certificate should be for 100% of such fund. (v)  As a measure of enhancing the focus on maintenance of roads during the defect liability period (five years from the date of completion of road) and streamlining the delivery of routine maintenance of PMGSY roads on the basis of performance based maintenance contract, Electronic Maintenance of PMGSY roads (eMARG) has been implemented in all the states. eMARG is an online platform, used by all the states, that monitors maintenance of PMGSY works for five years from the date of completion (i.e. under Defect Liability Period-DLP). (vi)     National Rural Infrastructure Development Agency (NRIDA), a technical arm of the Ministry of Rural Development has prepared a Policy Framework for the development of maintenance policy of rural roads. The Policy Framework along with a Guidance Note for the States was shared with the States. All the states have framed their own rural roads maintenance policies based on this policy framework. (vii)     The implementation of all sanctioned works including its maintenance is  regularly monitored through online programme Monitoring Information System named Online Management, Monitoring and Accounting System (OMMAS) on real time basis. In addition, the issue is also  regularly reviewed by the Ministry by way of Regional Review Meetings (RRMs), Performance Review Committee (PRC) Meetings, Pre-Empowered/ Empowered Committee Meetings with the States. Besides above, special review meetings/monthly review meetings are also held by Secretary/ Additional Secretary/Joint Secretary, Ministry of Rural Development with Chief Secretaries/Principal Secretaries of the States to take stock of the progress of the scheme including maintenance aspects. *******
