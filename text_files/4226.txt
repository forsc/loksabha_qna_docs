                                                        THE MINISTER OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[DR. SUBRAHMANYAM JAISHANKAR](a) to (e)	A statement is laid on the table of the House.***STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (A) to (E) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 359 REGARDING “DECLINE IN H-1B VISAS” FOR ANSWER ON 17.07.2019.  According to U.S. official data, the total number of H-1B visas issued by the U.S. in FY 2017 and FY 2018 was 179,049 and 179,660, respectively.The details of the H-1B visas issued to Indian nationals, including the share in total number of H-1B visas issued by the U.S. in recent years is given below:<pre> H-1B Visas	FY2012	FY 2013	FY 2014	FY 2015	FY 2016	FY 2017	FY 2018Issued to Indian nationals	80,630	99,705	108,817	119,952	126,692	129,097	125,528Total H-1B visas issued	135,530	153,223	161,369	172,748	180,057	179,049	179,660% share of visas  issued to Indian nationals	59.5%	65.1%	67.4%	69.4%	70.4%	72.1%	69.9%Source: U.S. Department of State</pre>The above statistics show that Indian nationals have received between 67% to 72% of the total H-1B visas issued by the U.S. in the last five fiscal years. H-1B visa has played an important role in facilitating the movement of talented Indian professionals.   	No comprehensive changes have been made to the U.S. H-1B visa programme so far. The U.S. Government has adopted certain administrative measures with respect to the H-1B visa programme that have introduced greater scrutiny of H-1B applications and increased documentation requirements. Government of India has closely consulted all stakeholders and engaged with the U.S. Administration and Congress on issues related to the movement of Indian professionals, including those pertaining to the H-1B programme. Most recently, issues of H-1B visa were raised during the visit of the U.S. Secretary of State, Michael R. Pompeo, to India on 26 June 2019. In our engagements, we have emphasized that this has been a mutually-beneficial partnership which should be nurtured. Indian skilled professionals have contributed to the growth and development of the U.S. economy and have helped the U.S. retain its competitive edge and innovation advantage. The U.S. side has valued the contribution made by Indian nationals in the U.S..***
