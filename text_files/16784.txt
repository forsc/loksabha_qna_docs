                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING (RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a)  No Sir. The Government decided not to operate the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) for two years, that is during FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22 and placed the funds allocated for the FY2020-21 at the disposal of the Ministry of Finance for strengthening its efforts in managing the challenges of COVID-19 which has been declared as a global pandemic and a notified disaster in the country. (b) and (c) Government has received references from Hon’ble Members of Parliament requesting for release of pending installments due to them as on 31.03.2020 to resume the ongoing works and clear the committed liabilities under MPLADS. (d) and (e) The Ministry has issued detailed circular on 08.04.2020 containing instructions wherein inter alia Hon’ble Members have been requested to re-prioritize their recommendations in consultation with District Authorities, wherever feasible, and District Authorities have also been advised to ensure that works are completed from among the available funds as no more funds would be released during FY 2020-21 and 2021-22.   The Ministry has issued another set of instructions dated 14.05.2020 to the Nodal district authorities for settlement and closure of savings bank accounts of former MPs of Lok Sabha and former Members of Rajya Sabha, which are not yet closed even after completion of  21 months from the date of demitting office  so that unspent balance in their account can be used by the respective constituencies/ states where funds are required as per MPLADS guidelines.                                              *****
