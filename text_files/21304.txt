                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)      No, Sir. The Government has not formulated any new scheme for Development of Rural Industries to benefit the people hit by calamities like drought and floods. However, the following schemes are being implemented in the rural areas related to Rural Industries.(i)	The Ministry of Rural Development is implementing the Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Programme (SVEP), as a sub-scheme under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana -National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM). The block is the unit of implementation of SVEP. The objective of the scheme is to help the rural poor (SHGs) to set-up enterprises at the village level in non-agricultural sectors. Besides providing start-up capital, a cadre of Community Resource Persons-Enterprise Promotion (CRP-EP) is set up to provide business support services to enterprises. SHG members are supported under the project. As per the SVEP guidelines, States have to submit supplementary Annual Action Plans (AAPs) for the identified blocks. Once approved, a Detailed Project Report (DPR) is prepared for the block which provides, among other things, the details regarding the potential number of enterprises to be formed over the 4-year project period.The scheme was approved on 6th May, 2015 and the proposals were invited from the State Governments during 2015-16. DPRs preparation, approvals and fund release started in 2016-17. The enterprise formation started during 2017-18. As on 31st January, 2021, 182 projects have been approved across 29 States/UTs in the country. The DPRs for SVEP have been approved in 147 blocks and 2.29 lakh enterprises are targeted for formation during the 4-year project period. The total fund approved is Rs.75,970 lakhs of which the central share is Rs.47,516 lakhs. Of this, an amount of Rs.31,035 lakhs have been released as central share to the States. Enterprise formation has started in 137 blocks and 1,34,229 enterprises have been formed so far.(ii)	The Ministry of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) is implementing a Scheme of Fund for Regeneration of Traditional Industries (SFURTI) across the country with the view to organize traditional industries and artisans into clusters to make them competitive and increase their income. SFURTI clusters are of two types i.e. Regular Cluster (500 artisans) with Government assistance of up to Rs. 2.5 crore and Major Cluster (more than 500 artisans) with Government assistance up to Rs.5 crore. The artisans are organized into Special Purpose Vechicles which can be (1) a Society registered under Societies (Registration) Act, 1860, (2) a Co-operative Society under an appropriate statute, (3) a Producer Company under Section 465 (1) of Companies Act, 2013 (18 of 2013), (4) a Section 8 Company under the Companies Act, 2013 (18 of 2013) or (5) a Trust.As on 28.2.2021, there are 371 numbers of Clusters which are being funded by the Ministry supporting 2.18 lakh artisans with a total Government assistance of Rs. 892 crore,  90 of these clusters have been implemented as per the timelines envisaged in the guidelines of the scheme.  More than Rs.708 crore has been the budgetary allocation under the scheme, of which more than Rs. 586 crore has been released for the implementation of the clusters. These clusters are spread all over the country covering 247 districts.(iii)	 The Ministry of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) is also implementing Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), which is a major credit-linked subsidy programme aimed at generating self-employment opportunities through establishment of micro-enterprises in the non-farm sector by helping traditional artisans and unemployed youth. Any individual above 18 years of age is eligible. For setting up of projects costing above Rs.10 lakh in the manufacturing sector and above Rs. 5 lakh in the business /service sector, the beneficiaries should possess at least VIII standard pass educational qualification. General category beneficiaries can avail of margin money subsidy of 25% of the project cost in rural areas and 15% in urban areas. For beneficiaries belonging to special categories such as women/ scheduled caste/scheduled tribe/OBC /minorities, ex-serviceman, physically handicapped, NER, Hill and Border areas etc. the margin money subsidy is 35% in rural areas and 25% in urban areas. The maximum cost of projects is Rs. 25 lakh in the manufacturing sector and Rs. 10 lakh in the service sector. Benefit can be availed under PMEGP for setting up of new units only.Since inception in 2008-09 till 28.02.2021, around 6.59 lakh micro units have been assisted with margin money subsidy of Rs.15,497.81 crore, generating sustainable employment for around 54 lakh persons.The number of micro-enterprises setup during the last six years and current year along with the margin money subsidy disbursed by the government is given in the below table:PMEGP performance during last six years and current year is as under:S.No.	       Year	 Margin Money          Micro-Units           Estimated employment                        subsidy disbursed      assisted              generated                          (Rs. in lakh)	          (No.)              (No.) 1	  2014-15	112253.87                 48168                 3575022	  2015-16	102006.33                443403                  233623	  2016-17	128093.86                 52912                 4078404	  2017-18	131240.07                 48398                 3871845	  2018-19	207000.54                 73427                 5874166	  2019-20	195082.15                 66653                 5332247	  2020-21*	150009.25	          48743	                389944         * As on 28.02.2021(b)  Does not arise.(c)  Does not arise.*****
