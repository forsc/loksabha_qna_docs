ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)to (c)No such report is received in the Ministry.However, Ministry along with CPCB and NEERI are delineating the air shed maps which defines the geographical boundaries for the dispersion of pollutants. Particles that are larger than 2.5 µm generally do not remain airborne for longer periods and their spatial impact is typically limited because they tend to deposit on the ground downwind of emissions sources.The Central Government has taken several initiatives to mitigate air pollution across the country. These inter alia includeincreasing the monitoring network for assessment of ambient air quality, Notification of National Ambient Air Quality Standards, Development of National Air Quality Index (NAQI) and disseminationof NAQI for effective communication of air quality status to public, Notifications regarding dust mitigation measures for construction and demolition activities, Leapfrogging from BS-IV to BS-VI fuel standards since 1st April, 2018 in NCT of Delhi and from by 1st April, 2020 in the rest of the country, Introduction of cleaner / alternate fuels like gaseous fuel (CNG, LPG etc.), ethanol blendingetc. ***
