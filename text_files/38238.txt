                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS &ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (c)	 A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT TO BE LAID ON THE TABLE OF LOK SABHA IN RESPECT OF PARTS (a) to (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 498 FOR 6TH APRIL, 2022 REGARDING “PROBLEM OF CALL DROP”.(a) & (b)	Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has been monitoring the performance of Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) for the License Service Area (LSA) as a whole, through Quarterly Performance Monitoring Reports (PMRs) submitted by them against the benchmarks for various Quality of Service parameters laid down by TRAI. TSPs in India are required to ensure that the call drop rate in their mobile networks remains within the benchmarks laid down by TRAI.		TRAI has issued “The Standards of Quality of Service of Basic Telephone Service (Wireline) and Cellular Mobile Telephone Service (Fifth Amendment) Regulations, 2017” effective from 1st October 2017. These Regulations have prescribed two revised stringent parameters for assessing call drop in mobile network, viz. Drop Call Rate (DCR) Spatial Distribution measure (benchmark = 2%) implies that at least 90% of cells in the network should perform better than specified 2% benchmark on at least 90% of days. Similarly, another new parameter, DCR Temporal Distribution measure (benchmark = 3%) will give confidence that on at least 90% of days, network performed better than specified 3% benchmark for at least 97% of the cells.		As per PMR for Cellular Mobile Telephone Services for the quarter ending December - 2021 of TRAI, all TSPs except M/s BSNL in one LSA (West Bengal) are complying to both the benchmarks related to Drop Call Rate (DCR).Wherever the benchmark is not met by service provider, the explanation of TSPs is called for. After considering the explanation submitted by TSPs, TRAI imposes financial disincentives for non-compliance with the benchmark. Effective from 1st October 2017, TRAI has introduced a revised graded Financial Disincentives (FD) structure for DCR parameters, based on the extent to which a TSP’s performance deviates from the specified DCR benchmark. Moreover, Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has taken several policy initiatives to facilitate infrastructure growth for delivery of quality services. These include permitting trading/sharing/ liberalisation of spectrum, permitting passive & active infrastructure sharing, making government land/buildings available for installations of towers, etc. Around 16.82 lakh additional Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) for 2G/3G/4G-LTE services have been added by TSPs during the period from March 2014 to March 2022 across the country.Further, in order to obtain direct feedback from subscribers on call drop, DoT has launched an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) wherein around 5.67 crore subscribers have been individually contacted since December 2016. Out of these, 73.61 lakh subscribers have participated in the survey. The feedback is shared with the TSPs for taking corrective actions in a time bound manner. As a result, about 1.73 lakh individual cases of call drops have been resolved so far and around 7,956 BTSs have been installed by the TSPs specifically to resolve the call drop issues received through IVRS.(c)	There is no such proposal.
