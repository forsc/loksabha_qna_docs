                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE (SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a) & (b): To provide access to justice to the citizens at their door steps, the Central Government has enacted the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008.  It provides for establishment of Gram Nyayalayas at intermediate panchayat level.  The State Governments are responsible for establishing Gram Nyayalayas in consultation with the respective High Courts, though as per the Act it is not mandatory to set up the Gram Nyayalayas.  The Central Government has been encouraging the States to set up Gram Nyayalayas by providing financial assistance. The Central Government has requested the Chief Ministers of States and Chief Justices of High Courts for setting up of Gram Nyayalayas in the respective States.  Further, Registrars General of High Courts and Law / Home / Finance Secretaries of State Governments have been requested through video conference meetings held periodically to set up Gram Nyayalayas and seek financial assistance as per the scheme guidelines.  	As per the scheme for assistance to State Governments for establishing and operating Gram Nyayalayas, the Central Government provides one-time assistance to States towards non-recurring expenses for setting up of Gram Nyayalayas subject to a ceiling of Rs. 18.00 lakhs per Gram Nyayalaya.  The Central Government also provides assistance towards recurring expenses for operating these Gram Nyayalayas subject to a ceiling of Rs. 3.20 lakhs per Gram Nyayalaya per year for the first three years.   While the State of Uttarakhand has not set up any Gram Nyayalaya, the number of Gram Nyayalayas set up and functional in the country during the last three years, including the State of  Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and  Rajathan, is attached at Annexure. (c):	The Gram Nyayalayas scheme has been evaluated from time to time. The third party evaluation of the Scheme was done through NITI Aayog recently, which recommended continuance of the scheme. The Government has extended the above scheme for a further period of five years from 01.04.2021 to 31.03.2026, with a budgetary outlay of Rs.50 crores.****** ANNEXURE STATEMENT REFERRED TO  IN REPLY TO PARTS (A) & (B) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. †2072 ANSWER ON 10TH DECEMBER 2021 REGARDING JUSTICE SYSTEM AT VILLAGE LEVEL.Sl.
