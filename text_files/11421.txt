ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (e):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.Statement referred to in reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No. *39 for answer on 04/02/2020 regarding Anti-diabetic and Cardiac Care Drugs.(a) & (b):	According to market research organization All Indian Origin Chemists & Distributors Limited (AIOCD) - Advanced Working, Action & Correction System (AWACS), Anti-diabetic medicine sales rose 12.6% year-on-year, with a new class of drugs called SGLT2 (sodium-glucose co-transporter 2) inhibitors driving growth, while cardiac care drugs rose 11.7%. Among cardiac medicines, it was the combination drug of sacubitril and valsartan that led sales growth.The growth in Anti-diabetic medicines was 13.4%, 12.9% & 12.6% for year 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively on year to year basis. Further, the growth in Cardiac Care medicines was 5.5%, 10.7% & 11.7% for year 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively on year to year basis. (c):	Yes, Sir. India is home to one of the largest number of diabetes patients in the world estimated to be over 70 million, while heart diseases are known to be one of the biggest causes of death in the country.(d):	National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) monitors the prices of both scheduled and non-scheduled formulations (including Anti-diabetic and Cardiac Care formulations) on regular basis to check overcharging by pharmaceutical companies. Whenever companies are found to be overcharging the consumer in sale of medicine, NPPA issues notices to the companies to deposit the overcharged amount along with applicable interest under section 7A of Essential Commodities Act, 1955. NPPA has detected and issued about 162 demand notices against the pharmaceutical companies for overcharging consumers on the sale of Anti-diabetic and Cardiac Care formulations whose prices were fixed under para 19 of the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO, 2013). Demand Notices have been issued for total amount of Rs. 808.16 crore and an amount of Rs. 245.96 crore has been recovered from the Pharma Companies for violation of price fixed under para 19. The company wise detailed list of overcharging cases for violation of ceiling price and price fixed under para 19 (Anti-diabetic and Cardiac Care formulations) where demand notices have been issued is available on NPPA’s website www.nppaindia.nic.in. (e):	NPPA has fixed the ceiling price of 860 formulations included in Schedule-I of DPCO, 2013 which also includes medicines relating to treatment of diabetes and cardiac problems as detailed below:S. No.	Particulars	Medicines in NLEM,15	No. of Formulations (Prices fixed by NPPA)1	Anti-diabetic Medicines	6	122	Cardiac Medicines	30	70NPPA has also capped the prices of 106 formulations related to treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases under para 19 of DPCO, 2013 vide order dated 10th July, 2014.	Also, NPPA has fixed the price of coronary stents vide order dated 13th February, 2017. By this, the price for coronary stents was reduced upto 85% for Bare Metal stents and  74% for Drug Eluting Stents. This has resulted in saving of Rs. 4547 crore annually to the consumers/patients.Further, NPPA monitors the prices of non-scheduled formulations as per para 20 of DPCO, 2013 so that their MRP does not increase by more than 10% of MRP during preceding 12 months.*****
