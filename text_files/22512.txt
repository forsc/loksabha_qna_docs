ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) to (c) Indian Railways does not operate train services on State wise basis as Railway network straddles across State boundaries.  However, for the Kumbh Mela (January – April, 2021), at Haridwar, Indian Railways has made adequate arrangements, keeping in view the concerns and suggestions of State Governments, in view of the prevailing COVID-19 situation.  12 pairs of Kumbh Mela Specials, which are in addition to the existing services bound for Haridwar, are being operated.  Besides, 15 pairs of trains bound for Haridwar, have also been augmented for generating additional accommodation for the pilgrims.  However, passengers may avail suitable change over enroute at stations like Delhi for travelling to Haridwar.*****
