                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	Under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G) beneficiaries are identified based on housing deprivation parameters as per Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) – 2011 data and not on the basis of Below Poverty Line. Accordingly, all rural households who are houseless and living in zero, one and two room kutcha house as per SECC 2011 including landless households are provided assistance under PMAY-G. The State/UT-wise number of households provided assistance under PMAY-G is given in Annexure -I.(b):	Under PMAY-G, the target set is construction of 2.95 crore houses to achieve the objective of “Housing for All” by 2022. As on 20th June, 2019, the States / UTs have identified 2.53 crore eligible beneficiaries after due verification of SECC 2011 data.  All these identified households are targeted for providing assistance under PMAY-G by 2021-22. However, requests have been received from various States/ UTs for providing assistance under PMAY-G to such households who though eligible for assistance under PMAY-G but could not be included in the Permanent Wait List prepared based on SECC 2011 data. Ministry of Rural Development has developed mobile application (Awaas+) for capturing details of such households for inclusion in the PWL after due analysis and verification.(c):	To achieve the target of construction of 2.95 crore houses under PMAY-G by 2021-22, Ministry has taken following steps:i.	All States / UTs have opened a separate bank account of PMAY-G at the State/UT level called State Nodal Account from where the assistance is transferred directly to beneficiaries bank account through Fund Transfer Order.ii.	Assistance is transferred directly to beneficiary''s bank account through AwaasSoft-PFMS Platform which ensured smooth and faster transfer of funds to the beneficiary.iii.	Comprehensive online monitoring of different aspects of implementation of PMAY-G viz., identification of beneficiaries, physical and financial progress etc., through MIS-AwaasSoft.iv.	Evidence based monitoring of construction of house through uploading of geo-tagged photographs at each stage of house construction through the mobile application- AwaasApp.v.	Increasing availability of trained rural mason through Training, Assessment and Certification under Rural Mason Training Programme.vi.	Engagement of local functionaries for tagging of each house sanctioned under PMAY-G to improve monitoring and facilitate timely construction of houses.vii.	Promotion of identified house design typologies for adoption of the same by the beneficiaries of PMAY-G enabling them to construct an affordable, durable and disaster resilient houses. viii.
