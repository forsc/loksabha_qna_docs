ANSWER




                                                        (a) and (b):   Payment gateways are entities which provide technology infrastructure to process online payment transactions, facilitate e-commerce and facilitate merchants to connect with acquirers. Many app based services which provide for electronic payment transactions, utilize the services of payment gateways to complete payment transactions. Presently such payment gateways are not directly regulated by the Reserve bank of India (RBI). In this regard the RBI has brought out a Discussion Paper on Guidelines for Payment Gateways and Payment Aggregators that brings out various issues relating to their operations including those related to security and this paper is available https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/PublicationReportDetails.aspx?UrlPage=&ID=943. With regard to frauds in financial transactions such as through cards, internet banking etc., the data on frauds reported is available at the website of the National Crime Records Bureau (www.ncrb.gov.in). Among other measures such as educating consumers and promoting awareness, the RBI has taken the following specific initiatives to limit the liability of the consumers who are victimized by frauds:(i))     Limiting Customer Liability on Unauthorized Electronic Banking Transactions: RBI has issued circular no. DBR.No. Leg.BC.78/09.07.005/2017-18 dated July 06, 2017 limiting the liability of customers on unauthorized electronic banking transactions. (ii))     Limiting Customer Liability in Unauthorized Electronic Banking Transactions in PPIs issued by Authorized Non-banks: RBI has issued circular no. DPSS.CO. PD. No.1417/02.14.006/2018-19 dated January 04, 2019 limiting the liability of customers in unauthorized electronic banking transactions in PPIs issued by Authorized Non-banks.(c) and (d):  Transportation by Road is a State Subject under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. Ministry of Road Transport & Highways had constituted a committee to look into the various permits and formulate a draft scheme. The Committee submitted the report proposing taxi policy guidelines to promote urban mobility in the month of December, 2016. The report has been accepted by the Government. Copy of the report is available on the website of the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (www.morth.nic.in ). It has been shared with the States.*******
