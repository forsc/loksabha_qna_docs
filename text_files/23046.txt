                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)  (a) to (c): Anganwadi Services under Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme envisages Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) & Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) as “honorary workers” from the local community who come forward to render their services, on part time basis, in the area of child care and development  and being honorary workers are not covered under the Minimum Wages Act.  The AWWs and AWHs are paid fixed honorarium per month as decided by the Government from time to time. Lastly, on 01.10.2018, the honorarium was enhanced to AWWs from ? 3,000/- to ? 4,500/- per month; AWWs at mini-AWCs from ? 2,250/- to ? 3,500/- per month; AWHs from ? 1,500/- to ? 2,250/- per month; and introduced performance linked incentive of ? 250/- per month to AWHs. In addition to the honorarium paid by the Government of India, the respective States/UTs are also giving monetary incentives to these workers out of their own resources for additional duties assigned to them under other Schemes.  The Ministry through various platforms such as review meetings, video conferences, communications etc has taken up the matter with the States/UTs for timely payment of honorarium to Anganwadi Workers/Anganwadi Helpers. The Ministry of Women & Child Development implements a centrally sponsored scheme, named Child Protection Services (CPS) scheme (erstwhile ICPS), for rehabilitation and reintegration of children in difficult circumstances in the country as envisaged under Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. The primary responsibility of execution of the Act and implementation of the Scheme rests with the States/UTs. Presently, the scheme is being implemented as per the Cabinet approved CPS guidelines and the Central Government is providing the central share of staff salary/honorarium as per scheme guidelines. The Scheme provides for the hiring of contractual staff at the State and District level. Under Mahila Shakti Kendra Scheme, which is Centrally Sponsored Scheme, there are provisions for engaging following contractual manpower in each State/ Union Territory with specified honorarium in State Resource Centre for Women (SRCW) and in District Level Centre for Women (DLCW) :- State Resource Centre for Women (SRCW)Name of Post	No. of Post	Pay per month (Rs.)State Project Coordinator	1	52,500Specialist Gender	1	36,750Research Officer	1	26,250Training and Research Officer	1	26,250Assistant	1	15,750 District Level Centre for Women (DLCW)Name of Post	No of Post	Pay per monthWomen Welfare Officer	1	35,000District Coordinator	2	20.000 *****
