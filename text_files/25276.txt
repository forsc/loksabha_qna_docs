                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TRIBAL AFFAIRS(SMT. RENUKA SINGH SARUTA)  (a) to (d): No such report has been received in this Ministry from the State. However, this Ministry has conducted a gap analysis based on Census 2011 data and Mission Antyodaya data (2018)  maintained by the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD). Analysis of the data has revealed that there are about 184 tribal villages in Bihar with at least 50% tribal population and 500 STs.   The  Annexure-I gives the position of Infrastructure available in various sectors of development including road connectivity, education, vocational training, livelihood, drinking water, electric supply etc in such villages. These figures are based on data of 2018.   The statement indicating release of funds by various central ministries to the State of Bihar in the relevant sectors is attached at Annexure-II.(e) There is no information available with the Ministry on smart village. The Ministry has shared the gap analysis data in respect of villages with substantial tribal population with the States and have asked them to validate and update the gap analysis data.  States have also been asked to prepare a comprehensive perspective plan to fill the gap in various sectors taking into account all available source of funding from Central and State STC and also the funding provided by the Ministry under its various schemes.  This Ministry is also providing financial assistance under various schemes as an additive to State efforts for tribal development to address the issue of plugging critical gaps. The schemes are Grants under Article 275 (1) of Constitution of India, Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub Scheme (SCA to TSS) and Scheme for Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). An amount of Rs. 994.00 lakh was released to the State of Bihar under SCA to TSS during the year 2020-21. No funds could be released under the schemes of Article 275(1) and Development of PVTGs for want of UC and PPR from the State. Besides, fund released under the scheme of Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for ST students of Bihar during the last 3 years is as under:(Rs. in lakh)Scheme	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21Pre-Matric Scholarship	0.00	7131.47	0.00Post-Matric Scholarship	0.00	1525.43	708.22 Annexure-IAnnexure-I as referred to in part (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.1105 asked by Dr. Sanjay Jaiswal for 26.07.2021 regarding “Tribals of Bihar”Position of Infrastructure available in 184 Village based on gap analysis - BiharS.
