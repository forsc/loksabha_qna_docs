ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER FOR MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND MINISTRY OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a)	No Sir.National Centre for Earth Sciences and Studies (NCESS), and National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR) have initiated a comprehensive study on shoreline mapping, nearshore measurements and design of environmental protection measures to protect against erosion ofVarkala Beach in Kerala.(b)	Does not arise.(c)	The bathymetry data pertaining to the coastal stretch provided by Kerala Govt. is used for setting up the Numerical Models. As part of hydrodynamic measurements, offshore wave data was collected through deployment of wave rider buoy. Shoreline survey and beach profile measurements were carried out along the 6 km coastal stretch adjoining the cliff. Automatic Weather Station was installed in March 2019 (at Varkala Cliff) and continuous data pertaining to coastal wind, atmospheric temperature, relative humidity and pressure is available since April 2019. Computation of changes in beach volume at selected locations for the period May-November have been completed. Numerical model studies were initiated in June, 2019. Models have been set up and preliminary simulations for calibration and testing of the models have been carried outfor simulating the wave characteristics and coastal hydrodynamics.  The time frame for completion of studies is one more year, which however depends upon the availability of fair weather season devoid of cyclones.
