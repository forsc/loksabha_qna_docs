(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (f): 	Government of India supplements the efforts of the State Governments through various schemes/ programmes.

A list of initiatives taken by the Government are at Annexure. All these steps of the Government of India are for the welfare of the farmers of the country.The Government constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee in April, 2016 to examine issues relating to “Doubling of Farmers Income” and recommend strategies to achieve the same.  The Committee submitted its Report to the Government in September, 2018 and thereafter, an Empowered Body was set up on 23.01.2019 to monitor and review the progress as per these recommendations. To achieve this, the Committee has identified seven sources of income growth viz., improvement in crop productivity; improvement in livestock productivity; resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; increase in the cropping intensity; diversification towards high value crops; improvement in real prices received by farmers; and shift from farm to non-farm occupations.
