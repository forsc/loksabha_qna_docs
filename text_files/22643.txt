ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                           (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a): 	No, Sir.  Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has informed that DDA Housing Scheme 2019 did not get expected response in which total 17,922 flats were offered and 8,438 were allotted. Out of these, 6,375 flats located in newly developed Narela sub-city of DDA were surrendered by the allottees.  But the last three consecutive schemes launched by DDA got good response. The last three consecutive housing schemes are as follows:(i)	DDA Housing Scheme for SC/ST 2019(ii)	Online Scheme on First Come First Serve Basis for EWS flats at Narela(iii)	DDA Housing Scheme 2021	DDA Housing Scheme 2021 got very good response and received 22,752 applications against 1,353 flats.  All 1,353 flats have been allotted by a draw held on 10.03.2021.  Similarly, all 916 flats were allotted which were offered under EWS Scheme 2020.  However, in SC/ST Scheme 2019 out of 257 flats 138 flats were surrendered out of which 18 flats are of Narela.	DDA conducted a survey to get feedback from those who were allotted flats in Narela but subsequently chose to surrender.  The main reasons stated by them are small size of the flats, remote location of the flats/sub city, under developed surrounding area and non-connectivity by Metro.(b): 	Yes Sir.  DDA looked into factors/ reasons for surrender of flats in Narela sub city and the corrective steps taken which are as under:(i)	DDA has reduced the price of EWS flats at Narela.  (ii)	Provision of bus facility.(iii)	Amalgamation of small size flats to make flat size bigger.(iv)	To ensure faster/better connectivity to Narela sub city construction of Urban Extension Road (UER)-II has been taken up.(v)	A rail over bridge (ROB)  has been constructed by DDA in Narela.(vi)	DDA has taken up issue of construction of metro rail to Narela  sub city with DMRC.(c) & (d):  Yes, Sir. DDA has informed that the cost of the flats is determined by its location, cost of land acquisition and construction cost.  The construction cost of the flats is based on fair and transparent tendering process. Details of the number of flats category wise is at Annexure A.(e): Yes, Sir. DDA has informed that online system has been put in place. Housing Scheme 2021 is completely executed through online system, which will enable the public to complete all formalities like application, payment of registration money, receipt of demand letter & possession letter, cancellation of allotment and refund of money etc. The applicant is expected to visit DDA office only for verification of documents and receipt of conveyance deed and taking over possession of the flats.   (f):   DDA has informed that the following steps taken/being taken to dissuade non-serious applicants and speculators for applying for the scheme:(i)	Applicants have to indicate his/her PAN for applying for the Online Scheme. Therefore, one person can submit only one application.(ii)	The applicants need to deposit registration money which is ? 2,00,000/- in case of MIG/HIG flats. The registration money is forfeited in case they cancel/ surrender the flat after a period of 90 days.(iii)	For EWS flats, applicants must possess an Income proof issued by the office of concerned SDM/Tehsildar.(iv)	It is mandatory that demanded amount should come from    Allottee’s account or from the account of family member of the allottee and that too through NEFT/RTGS/Net-banking only. No cash payment or payment made by person other than allottee himself/herself or his/her family member is accepted. In such cases allotment of the flat is cancelled.(v)	The allottee is not allowed to transfer or otherwise part with  the possession of the whole or any part of the flat before execution of Conveyance deed.                                                 *****
