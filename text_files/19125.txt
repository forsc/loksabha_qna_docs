ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)	& (b)  Yes, Sir. There is a structured Joint Group of Experts (JGE) between India and Bhutan to discuss all issues related to flood management. The JGE meets regularly and issues like landslides, river data, sharing for advance flood warning, etc. are discussed by it. The specific issue of regulation of release of Kurichhu Dam water was discussed with Bhutan during the meetings of JGE. The Bhutanese side informed during the JGE meetings that it being a run-of-river project, the inflow is always equal to the outflow from the power project, and therefore, there is no question of extra releases of water from the project.Apart from this, there exists a bilateral arrangement under international co-operation between Royal Government of Bhutan and Government of lndia for sharing of data of common rivers for flood monitoring and flood forecasting in India.Under the bilateral arrangement, Central Water Commission (CWC)  receives data of rivers flowing from Bhutan to India during monsoon season.The data so received is considered for formulation of flood forecast in these rivers and the same is shared with concerned Agencies of State & Central Government. Further, the discharge releases from the Kurichhu project is shared by the Druk Green Power Corporation who is Project Authority and the Technical Maintenance Officer (Hydromet Operations & Infrastructures Division), National Center for Hydrology and Meteorology, Royal Government of Bhutan with Central Water Commission offices in India at Barpeta and Guwahati in Assam. The same is further shared with the District Administrations of Chirang, Baksa and Barpeta districts as well as Water Resources and Irrigation Departments of Bodoland Territorial Council, Water Resources Department of Government of Assam and Assam State Disaster Management Authority for action at their end.*****
