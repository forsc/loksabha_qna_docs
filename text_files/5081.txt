Rates fixed in the Central sphere are applicable to establishments under the authority of Central Government, railway administration, mines, oil-Contd..2/-:: 2 ::fields, major port or any corporation established by a Central Government. Employment other than the scheduled employment for central Sphere come under the purview of State Government and accordingly State Government wages are applicable in such employments. A copy of current rate of minimum wages w.e.f. 01.04.2019 for Central Sphere is at Annexure.        		Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 provides for payment of equal remuneration to men and women workers for the same work or work of similar nature without any discrimination. The Act is effectively enforced by the Central and State Government by conducting regular inspections to detect the violation of provisions of the Act by establishments. The office of Chief Labour Commissioner (Central) in the Central Sphere and State Government in State Sphere are the appropriate authorities to conduct inspection to ensure implementation of the provisions of the Act. Officers of the appropriate Government notified as Inspectors make inspections and prosecute those found violating provision of the Act.           		The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare is not implementing any specific programmes for women farmers and as a part of its mainstreaming efforts, it ensures flow of funds to the tune of 30% for the benefit of women farmers under its various beneficiary oriented schemes. (d):		No Sir.(e):		Doesn’t arise in view of (d) above.*                                                        *****
