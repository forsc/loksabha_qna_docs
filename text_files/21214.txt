On the basis of month-wise & State-wise projection given by DAC&FW, Department of Fertilizers allocates sufficient/ adequate quantities of fertilizers to States by issuing monthly supply plan and continuously monitors the availability.iii.	The movement of all major subsidized fertilizers is being monitored throughout the country by an on-line web based monitoring system called integrated Fertilizer Monitoring System (iFMS);iv.	The State Governments are regularly advised to coordinate with manufacturers and importers of fertilizers for streamlining the supplies through timely placement of indents for railway rakes.v.	Regular Weekly Video Conference is conducted jointly by Department of Agriculture & Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) and Department of Fertilizers (DoF) with State Agriculture Officials and corrective actions are taken to dispatch fertilizer as indicated by the State Governments. vi.	The gap between demand (requirement) and production in case of urea, is met through timely imports.
