ANSWER




MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a)	 India adopted extensive use of Information Technology for ‘Ease of Doing Haj’ to make the Haj process digital for benefit of Haj applicants/ pilgrims and enhanced ease of Haj process/ operations, which includes complete online application process for Haj 2020 by Haj Committee of India (HCoI), maintenance of comprehensive data about pilgrims going through HCoI, their medical details, accommodation in Makkah and Madinah, issuance of bar code readable information on the identity card and tagging of baggages of the pilgrims, digital sharing of pre-arrival flight-wise information of pilgrims with Saudi authorities for travel arrangements, online system to maintain and update health data base of Indian Pilgrims along with doctors’ prescription, medical treatment, medicines disbursal and inpatient details. The process of registration and allocation of Haj quota to the private Haj Group Organisers (HGOs) has been made completely digital, which includes online processing and scrutiny of applications of HGOs, online disclosure of services and Haj packages offered, web portal for viewing and comparing Haj packages offered by registered HGOs, disclosure of complete details of pilgrims serviced, online generation of agreements to be signed between HGOs and the pilgrims, etc. The Consulate General of India, Jeddah has developed a Mobile Application "Indian Haji Information System" for the Indian pilgrims for accessing details of their accommodation in Makkah and Madinah; location of tents in Mashaer region; Khadimul Hajjaj details; practical information including Haj-guide video, advisories, latest news, etc. as well as for complaint registration and tracking. In Haj-2019, a trilingual (English, Hindi and Urdu) new feature “Haj-2019 Survey” was added for receiving feedback from pilgrims. India is among the few countries which has done 100% implementation of E-path system of Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah which it has eased the Haj-immigration process in the Kingdom. (b)	Making of application for the Haj pilgrimage completely online by the HCoI, complete online application process for registration and allocation of Haj quota to HGOs and online submission of buildings on offer for HCoI pilgrims in Makkah ensures that pilgrims/ stakeholders can apply directly by accessing the internet without the need to come through a middleman. This has simplified the Haj process, improved transparency and decision making process in Haj management. However, quantifying the cost savings resulting from digitisation of Haj process is not possible as this includes various tangible and intangible benefits accrued to the pilgrims in the form of ease of Haj process/ application from home, access of authentic and reliable information by the pilgrims and stakeholders, receiving timely and reliable medical attention by the pilgrims, ease of doing business, improvement in quality of buildings hired and amenities provided therein in Saudi Arabia, etc.(c)	Consulate General of India, Jeddah has developed online application e-MASIHA (electronic- Medical Assistance System for Indian Pilgrims Abroad) which was launched during Haj– 2018. In e-MASIHA, the health database of the Indian Pilgrims coming through HCoI is pre-fed.  This helps the medical attendant/ doctor available in the Indian medical centres in Makkah or Madinah or Jeddah Haj terminal awareness of the health issues of the pilgrims when they approach them. Based on the health database, doctors and paramedical staff make regular visits to the accommodation of pilgrims falling under High Risk Group (medically) to check their health. The laboratory test reports, medication prescribed by the doctor and those collected by the pilgrims are updated online.  This application also maintains the inventory of the medicines in each branch to ensure adequate availability of medicines. (d)	Haj Committee of India (HCoI) imparts training to the trainers. One trainer is selected for every 250 pilgrims and overall about 500 trainers are trained by HCoI for this purpose. The trainers impart Haj training to the selected pilgrims in the training camps organized at district level by the respective State Haj Committees under the overall guidance and instructions of HCoI. (e)	The total number of online applications received for Haj 2020 is 2,13,726. As per the quota allocated to HCoI in the annual bilateral agreement with Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for Haj 2020, the expected number of Indian Muslims to perform Haj State/ Union Territory-wise through the HCoI is given in Annexure. *****
