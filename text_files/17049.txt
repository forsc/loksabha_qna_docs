(c) There are several factors which lead to mortality of birdsincluding collision of some species of birds with transmission lines.(d) and (e) The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has not conducted any specific study to check the migratory patterns of Vultures, Flamingos and Waders in the recent past. However, National Action Plan for conservation of Migratory birds along the Central Asian Flyway (CAF) (2018-2023)” was launched in 2018 with a goal of conserving migratory species and the habitats which also includes research components.(f) The steps taken by Government to address the issues relating to protection of endangered birds and removal of power transmission lines in forests/national parks/ wildlife sanctuaries includes:  i.	Notification of Eco-Sensitive Zones (ESZs) around National Parks and Sanctuaries under provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to further strengthen conservation of wildlife including endangered birds.ii.	The project proposals for installation of power transmission lines, passing through Protected Areas or wildlife habitats are first scrutinized at State Board for Wildlife and later in Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife.iii.	The recommendations of the Task Force constituted by the Ministry for suggesting Eco-friendly measures to mitigate impacts of power transmission lines and other power transmission infrastructures on wildlife including the endangered birds were accepted by the Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife during its 54th meeting held on 18th July, 2019 and the same were circulated to all States/ Union Territory Administrations. iv.	The Ministry has requested the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy and Ministry of Power to direct the power supply agencies to implement the mitigation measures such as installation of bird diverters on power lines, undergrounding of power lines upto 33 KV, painting of vanes of wind turbines etc. for the protection of birds.v. The Ministry had also issued “Eco-friendly measures to mitigate impacts of linear infrastructure on wildlife” guidelines for mitigation of impacts of linear infrastructure including power transmission lines on birds such as collision and electrocution which include rerouting power-lines from key bird areas, modification to power-lines, installation of bird diverters to enhance visibility of power lines etc.vi. The ‘National Action Plan for conservation of Migratory birds along the Central Asian Flyway (CAF)’, which was launched by the Ministry addresses the issues of threats to birds due to powerlines.vii. Financial assistance is provided to the State/Union Territory Governments under the Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Development of Wildlife Habitats, Project Tiger and Project Elephant, for providing better protection to wildlife including rare species of birds and for improvement of their habitat.***
