ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS (SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) to (d)   Ministry of Road Transport and Highways vide Circular No RW-NH-11013/02/2019-S&R (P&B) dated 29th May 2019 issued “Principles to be adopted while considering the highway near or within Wildlife Sanctuaries / National Park / Animal Corridor”. All efforts are made to avoid any road alignment through National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries, even if it requires taking a longer route / bypass. However, where it becomes absolutely unavoidable and necessary to keep the alignment through such reserve forest / restricted areas, land would be acquired with RoW of not more than 30 mtrs. Ministry has also mandated the implementing agencies to follow the provisions of the manual titled “Eco-Friendly Measures to Mitigate Impacts of Linear Infrastructure on Wild Life”, prepared by the Wild life Institute of India, at the planning stage itself. NHAI has also taken care of all kinds of safeguards for the alignment passing through such type of ecological sensitive areas from planning to execution and its operation. Site-specific mitigation measures are being taken in consultation with Forest Authorities, incorporating one or more of several options as per site requirements like construction of culverts, underpass, overpass (eco-duct), viaduct, tunnel, guard wall, fencing, vegetative barrier, anti-light glare, sound barrier, etc. Further, funds are provided to the concerned Forest Authorities for taking measures as per their approved Wild Life Management Plan like creation of the waterholes, site specific plantation and landscaping, animal conservation units, rescue operation, anti-poaching unit, watch tower, monitoring, awareness, involvement of locals, construction of post guard, illumination and fencing around the boundary of Protected Area (PA) or its Eco Sensitive Zone (ESZ) etc., for conservation of wildlife habitat and reduction of human animal conflict. Cautionary signboards and rumble strips are also placed in coordination with Forest Authorities to alert the public and road users and protect animals.*****
