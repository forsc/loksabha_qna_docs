ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) to (d):	Indian Penal Code (IPC) does not define any crime as ‘hate crime’ and therefore, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) does not maintain data under the head ‘hate crime’. ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. State Governments are responsible for prevention, detention and investigation of crimes and for prosecuting the criminals through their law enforcement agencies. However, the Ministry of Home Affairs has issued advisories to States and Union Territories, from time to time, to maintain law and order and ensure that any person who takes law into his/ her own hands is punished promptly as per law, which are available on the Ministry’s website www.mha.gov.in. **********
