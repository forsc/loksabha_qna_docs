                                                    (a) whether it is a fact that the absence of pipelines to bring Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) to some States including Southern Region States from refineries elsewhere is turning out to be expensive for consumers as cooking gas prices in Southern States are among the highest in the country; and (b) if so, the details thereof, State-wise along with the corrective steps being taken in this regard?






ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS (SHRI RAMESWAR TELI) (a) & (b):	The prices of petroleum products in the country are linked to the price of respective products in the international market. However, for domestic LPG the Government continues to modulate the effective price to consumer to insulate the common man from rise in international prices.   Further, Government has brought LPG under Goods and Services Tax (GST), keeping it in lowest slab of 5% only.x-x-x-x-x
