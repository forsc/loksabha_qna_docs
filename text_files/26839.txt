ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (c): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.  ***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. 222 BY SHRI DULAL CHAND GOSWAMI TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 04.08.2021 REGARDING MAINTENANCE OF RAILWAY BRIDGES(a) & (b) No, Sir. There is no plan to review the existing system of bridge classification. Railway Bridges are classified as Important, Major & Minor bridges, based on the waterway requirements as under: Important Bridges: Bridges with their linear waterway of 300 metres or more or a total waterway of 1000 square meters or more and those Bridges classified as important bridges by the Principal Chief Engineer/Chief Bridge Engineer. Major Bridges:Bridges with total water way of 18 linear metres or more or which have a clear opening of 12 linear metres or more in any one span are classified as major bridges.Minor Bridges:  Bridges which do not fall in the above classification are classified as Minor Bridges.(c) No, Sir. Railways follow a well-established system of inspection/maintenance and monitoring protocol based on periodical assessment of physical condition of railway bridges.  All the bridges are inspected twice a year, once before onset of monsoon and detailed inspection after monsoon by the designated officials. Age of bridges does not have any direct relevance on Inspection/Maintenance protocol. In the existing system, Railways follow a Numerical Rating System for assessment of physical condition of the Bridge. Every bridge is assigned an Overall Rating Number (ORN). Based on ORN of a Bridge, the priority of Repair/Rehabilitation/Strengthening/Rebuilding of Bridge is decided. Lower ORN of a Bridge is assigned higher priority. Repair/Rehabilitation/Strengthening/Rebuilding of bridges is a continuous process and is undertaken whenever so warranted by their physical condition as ascertained during inspections. *****
