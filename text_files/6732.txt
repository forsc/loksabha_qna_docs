AVINASH REDDY AND SHRI MAGUNTA SREENIVASULU REDDY TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 20.11.2019 REGARDING NEW RAILWAY LINES(a) to (d):   Yes, Sir. Surveys for new railway lines is a continuous and ongoing process of Indian Railways and are done based on demands raised by State Governments, Central Ministries, Members of Parliament, other public representatives and Railways’ own operational requirements. Based on survey reports, projects are taken up on the basis of remunerativeness, last mile connectivity, missing links and alternate routes, augmentation of congested/saturated lines, socio-economic considerations, ongoing projects, overall availability of funds and competing demands. Since Railway projects generally spread over more than one State, new railway lines are neither surveyed nor sanctioned State-wise.Surveys for 4 New Lines falling fully/partly in the State of Andhra Pradesh have been sanctioned during the last three years i.e. 2017-18, 2018-19 & 2019-20.  Surveys for 8 New Lines falling fully/partly in the State of Andhra Pradesh have been completed during the last three years i.e. 2017-18, 2018-19 & 2019-20.  Surveys for 6 New Lines falling fully/partly in the State of Andhra Pradesh are in progress. The details are appended.  During the year 2019-20, no new survey for New Lines falling fully/partly in the State of Andhra Pradesh has been sanctioned.*****
