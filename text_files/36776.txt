                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a)   At present 1244 Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) are functioning in 562 districts across the country. (b) & (c) Niti Aayog has identified 112 districts in the country as Aspirational Districts out of which 16 districts do not have any KV. However, there are 160 KVs in 96 Aspirational Districts. (d) & (e) Opening of new KVs is a continuous process. KVs are opened primarily to cater to the educational needs of the wards of transferable Central Government Employees including Defence& Para-Military personnel, Central Autonomous Bodies, Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and Central Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) by providing a common programme of education throughout the country. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations and committing resources for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities found fulfilling the mandatory pre-requisites for opening of new KVs have to compete with other such proposals under the “Challenge Method” and subject to approval of the competent authority. KVs are not opened on the criteria of State/District/ Aspirational District-wise.(f) & (g) At present, 5 KVs namely KV Guntur, KV Surya Lanka (AFS), KV Tenali, KV Sattanpali and KV Irlapadu Village are functioning in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. Four proposals for setting up of new KVs at Anakapalli (Visakhapatnam), Macherla (Guntur), Nandigama (Krishna) and Rompicherla (Guntur) in the State of Andhra Pradesh have been found fulfilling the mandatory pre-requisite as per norms of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan.  These proposals have been considered by the “Challenge Method” Committee. *****
