The monitoring systems in-built in these schemes are as under:(i)	The Anganwadi Services Scheme has an in-built monitoring system since its inception to track the physical progress of the scheme in respect of various input process, output and impact indicators through a standardized Management Information System (MIS).Further, in order to strengthen the performance of Anganwadi Services, Government has introduced monitoring and review mechanism at different levels (National/ State/ District/ Block and Anganwadi level).
