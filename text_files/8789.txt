ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) to (c):	Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan Dhan Yojana (PM-KMY) is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme for small and marginal farmers. There is no provision for nomination or selection of farmers by the Government for the scheme. All small and marginal farmers across the country who are not otherwise covered under the exclusion criteria of the scheme are eligible to enroll themselves for the benefit under the scheme. So far (as on 29.11.2019), 18,80,249 farmers have registered for the Scheme in the entire country, including 52994 farmers from Madhya Pradesh. These include 612 farmers in Bhind District and 382 farmers in Datia District. These are dynamic figures which keep on changing continuously on further registrations by the farmers. It is estimated that about 3 crore small and marginal  farmers in the country may benefit from the scheme. Since the joining the scheme is voluntary for the farmers, it is not feasible to indicate the time by which all the farmers would avail benefit under the scheme.*******
