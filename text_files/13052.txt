ANSWER




(a) to (e):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.Statement referred to in reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No. *162 for answer on 03/03/2020 regarding Anti-Cancer Medicines.(a) & (b):	No, Sir. The cost of both patented and generic chemotherapeutics is significantly less in India than in most other countries, yet, these medicines are not easily affordable to a large section of society due to low population coverage with insurance programs and low average household income levels.  (c):	The treatment of cancer is multimodal, incorporating mainly radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery depending on the site and stage of disease. The intent to treat is curative where it is reasonable to expect complete response and sustained remission. The rest of cases receive treatment directed towards palliation of symptoms or supportive care. 70% of all cases who are treated with curative intent receive chemotherapy either primarily, or prior to or adjunct to radiation or surgery. Similarly 40% of palliative treatment comprise of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy forms a part of treatment for nearly 60% of cancer patients, often being administered as an adjunct to definitive surgery or radiotherapy.(d) & (e):	The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) has fixed the ceiling prices of 81 anti-cancer scheduled formulations under the National List of Essential Medicines, 2015 (NLEM, 2015).Further, the NPPA, vide order S.O. 1041(E) dated 27th February, 2019, put a cap on Trade Margin of 42 select non-scheduled anti-cancer medicines under ‘Trade Margin Rationalisation’ Approach. By this approach, the MRP of 526 brands of these medicines have been reduced by upto 90%. This move will result in an approx annual savings of around Rs. 984 crore to the patients. The details of prices fixed by the NPPA is available on the website of the NPPA i.e. nppaindia.nic.in.*******
