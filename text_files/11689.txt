                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 664 BY SHRI GOPAL JEE THAKUR TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 05.02.2020 REGARDING RAIL BRIDGE ON KOSI RIVER(a) and (b): Yes, Sir.  The Kosi Bridge New Line project falling in Mithila region of Bihar is a sanctioned project. Latest anticipated cost of the project is ?516 Cr., out of which an expenditure of ?382 Cr. has been incurred upto March 2019.  This Bridge will connect Sarayagarh on east side and Nirmali on west side. Main Bridge has already been constructed.  Track linking has been taken up.  Completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like shifting of infringing utilities (both underground & over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological & topographical conditions of area, law & order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions of working agencies/contractors etc. and all these factors affects the completion time and cost of the project, which is finally worked out at the completion stage. Therefore, no confirmed time frame can be fixed for completion of this project at this stage.  (c) and (d): Naming of a railway project/bridge is done on recommendation of the State Govt concerned. At present, no proposal with regard to naming of Kosi Bridge has been received from the State Govt of Bihar. ******
