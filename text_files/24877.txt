In view of the dynamic and evolving nature of COVID-19 pandemic, no fixed timeline at present can be indicated for the completion of vaccination drive, however, it is expected that all beneficiaries aged 18 years and above will be vaccinated by December 2021.(c)	As on 20th July 2021, a total of 32.64 crore persons have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine of which 8.55 crore persons have completed the two dose schedule. State/UT-wise details are at Annexure-1.(d)	In accordance with the ‘Revised Guidelines for implementation of National COVID Vaccination Program’, Government of India is procuring 75% of the vaccines being produced by the vaccine manufacturers in the country.  These vaccines are provided free of cost to States/UTs on the basis of their pro-rata target population, consumption pattern and vaccine wastage. As on 20th July 2021, a total of 34.83 crore doses have been supplied free of cost by Government of India to States/UTs (details at Annexure-2).(e)	Two vaccines, namely Covishield manufactured by M/s Serum Institute of India and Covaxin manufactured by M/s Bharat Biotech International Limited, that have been granted permission for restricted use in emergency situation by the National Regulator i.e. Drugs Controller General of India [DCG(I)] are being procured by Government of India for free supply to States and UTs. Apart from these two vaccines, Sputnik V marketed in India by M/s Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories and Moderna vaccine have also received permission for restricted use in emergency situation by the National Regulator and Sputnik V is being used in Private Hospitals for Covid vaccination.(f)	The pace of vaccination across the country is amongst the fastest in the world. While there have been instances of vaccine wastage in States/UTs but at the same time extra doses have also been extracted from a given vial as per information on Co-Win portal. Doses wasted and maximum possible doses extracted beyond the labelled quantity are taken into account to arrive at vaccine wastage figures for a State. Between 1st May 2021 to 13th July 2021, a total of 2.49 lakh doses have been wasted while 41.12 lakh extra doses have been extracted beyond the labelled quantity. The State/UT-wise details of vaccine doses wasted and extra doses extracted is at Annexure-3. Regular review meetings are held with State/UTs to review all aspects of vaccination drive including vaccine wastage. States/UTs are advised to keep vaccine wastage to the minimum. Regular advice in this regard is also communicated to States/UTs through regular letters from Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. ****
