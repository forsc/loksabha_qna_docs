ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):		The Cost of cultivation is calculated following an elaborate methodology laid down in the Scheme called “Comprehensive Scheme for Studying Cost of Cultivation for Principal Crops in India”. The data is collected through 16 Cost of Cultivation Centres located in 16 Agricultural Universities/General Universities and Institutes. Cost data is collected for 25 selected crops from 20 States. The crops covered are paddy, wheat, jowar, bajra, maize, ragi, barley, moong, urad, arhar, gram, masur, groundnut, rapeseed and mustard, nigerseed, safflower, soybean, sunflower, sesamum, cotton, jute, sugarcane, onion, potato and coconut. These crops are selected for a block period of three years. 			The sampling design of the scheme is a three-stage stratified random sampling design with tehsil as the first stage unit, village/cluster of villages as the second-stage unit and operational holdings as the third and ultimate stage unit. Contd….2/-- 2 -			The Scheme envisages collection of representative data on inputs and outputs in physical and monetary terms on a comparable and comprehensive basis following uniform methodology which is designed by an Expert Committee and is reviewed from time to time. The field data is collected based on the Cost Accounting Method by 16 Cost of Cultivation Centres covering 20 states. Under the scheme, daily entries of debit/credit for the expenditure/income are made in order to assess the total cost /benefit incurred/accrued to each farmer covered under the scheme. 	The input cost estimates generated under CS Scheme include all paid-out cost, i.e., cost incurred in cash and kind, like value of hired human labour, hired and owned bullock and machine labour, value of seeds, insecticides, pesticides, manure, fertilizer, irrigation charges, land revenue, cesses & other taxes, interest on working capital, miscellaneous expenses, rent paid for leased land; and imputed value of family labour.Based on the crop-wise and state-wise cost estimates generated under the CS Scheme, Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP) projects crop-wise all India weighted average cost of production for the ensuing season to arrive at the recommendations of Minimum Support Price (MSP) of major agriculture commodities.(b) & (c):	The Government of India declares the MSP of mandated agricultural crops, including kharif and rabi crops, based on the price policy recommendations of CACP, after ascertaining the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned and other relevant factors. 		While recommending MSPs for crops, CACP keeps in mind the cost of production and other important factors, such as demand and supply situation, trends in domestic and international prices, inter-crop price parity, terms of trade between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors and the likely impact of MSP on consumers and overall economy along with rational utilization of scarce natural resources like land and water. The methodology adopted by CACP is based on the recommendations of different expert committees on the ‘methodology of cost of production’. Based on the latest three years actual cost estimates provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, CACP undertakes crop-wise, state-wise cost projection exercise for the ensuing season under certain implicit assumptions by utilizing statistical techniques. These projected estimates of cost of production are factored into the formulation of price policy recommendations by the CACP. The detail of MSP of various agricultural crops during last year is given at Annexure I.(d):	The National Commission on Farmers (NCF), headed by Dr. M.S. Swaminathan, has recommended that the MSP should be at least 50 percent more than the weighted average cost of production. However, when the National Policy for Farmers, 2007 was finalized by the then Government, this recommendation of providing 50 per cent return over cost of production was not included. Contd….3/-- 3 -		The Union Budget for 2018-19 had announced the pre-determined principle to keep MSPs at level of one and half times of the cost of production. Accordingly, Government had increased the MSPs for all mandated kharif, rabi crops and other commercial crops with a return of atleast 50 percent over the all-India weighted average cost of production for the season 2018-19. Government has recently increased the MSPs for all mandated kharif and rabi crops for 2019-20 season in line with the principle of providing atleast 50 percent return over all India weighted average cost of production. Crop-wise details of MSP, Cost and return over cost fixed for year 2018-19 and 2019-20 is given at Annexure II. Cost of production varies in different States on account of difference in the yield of crops and owing to the levels of irrigation, resource endowment, farm mechanization, land holding size etc. As such, returns over cost of production may vary across States for MSP crops.
