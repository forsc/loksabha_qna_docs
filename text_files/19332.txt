                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a): For appropriate management of suspect/confirmed COVID-19 cases, a three tier arrangement of health facilities has been implemented in consultation with the State Governments:•	COVID Care Center (CCC) that shall offer care for mild cases.•	Dedicated COVID Health Centre (DCHC) that shall offer care for all cases that have been clinically assigned as moderate.•	Dedicated COVID Hospital (DCH) that shall offer comprehensive care primarily for those who have been clinically assigned as severe.Tertiary care hospitals under ESIC, Defence, Railways, paramilitary forces, Steel Ministry etc. are also being leveraged for case management.In addition, States have opted for public private partnership with many private hospitals to work as stand-alone COVID hospitals. DRDO has set up large field hospitals with capacities ranging from 1000 to 10,000 isolation beds.(b): Under the ‘India COVID19 Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness package’ of Rs 15,000 crores has been approved by the Cabinet on 22nd April 2020 with an objective to prevent, detect and respond to the threat posed by COVID-19. As up to 15th January 2021, Rs 11, 361.67 Crores have been utilized for the same. Of this, Rs.6309.90 crore has been released to the States/UTs through National Health Mission (NHM). The details are given at Annexure.(c): As per Guidance document on appropriate management of suspect/confirmed cases of COVID-19 (available on: https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/FinalGuidanceonMangaementofCovidcasesversion2.pdf), Dedicated COVID Hospitals that are required to have comprehensive care may either be a full hospital or a separate block in a hospital with preferably separate entry\exit (available at most hospitals attached to medical colleges) primarily for those COVID-19 cases who are clinically assigned as severe.(d): ‘Health’ being a State subject, the States have designated various medical colleges as different types of COVID Dedicated Facilities. While in some cases, in view of suspension of regular classes, the hostels facilities have been utilized as COVID care centers for managing mild cases, others States have designated a specific block of attached hospitals as either Dedicated COVID Health Center or Dedicated COVID hospital. The States/UTs have accordingly utilized medical college infrastructure as per local requirements and trajectory of cases in different points in time. No centralized data is being maintained by Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare in this regard.(e) & (f): Provisioning of COVID-19 dedicated facilities ensured that while non-COVID cases will continue to get treatment in non-COVID facilities, the risk of healthcare associated COVID-19 infections, could be restricted to dedicated COVID facilities alone.However, taking note of need to resume non-COVID specialty services, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare issued multiple advisories and guidelines to ensure safe resumption of services in areas like ophthalmology, ENT, Dental, renal dialysis, etc. In order to ensure delivery of non-COVID essential health services, MoHFW also issued a guidance note on enabling Delivery of Essential Health Services during the COVID-19 Outbreak on 14th April, 2020 that called for alternate models for outreach services like outreach activities for immunization, antenatal care, screening for  common  NCDs/communicable  diseases  etc. Additionally, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare on 27th May, 2020 issued a guidance note on Essential Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, Adolescent Health Plus Nutrition (RMNCAH+N) Services during and post-COVID.All guidelines made available at: https://www.mohfw.gov.in/
