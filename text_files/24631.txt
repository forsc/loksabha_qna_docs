                                                                    THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS				(SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)	(a) to (c)	Government of India launched the Smart Cities Mission (SCM) on 25 June 2015 for development of 100 cities as Smart Cities.The selection of 100 Smart Cities was completed through 4 rounds of selection from January, 2016 to June, 2018. As of June 30, 2021, the 100 Smart Cities have tendered out 5,956 projects worth ?1,79,413 crore, out of which work orders for 5,314 projects worth ? 1,48,029 crore have been issued and 2,734 projects worth ?46,769 crore have been completed.Central Government has released ? 23,925 crore to States/Union Territories for its Smart Cities, of which ?20,410.14 crore (85%) has been utilized by them. (d) 	The status of project in the 20 Smart Cities selected in Round-1 in January, 2016 is given below:-	                                                          (Amount in ?crores)	Tender Stage	Work Order Stage	Work Completed	Total Projects	Total AmountSmart City	No. of Projects	Amount	No. of Projects	Amount	No. of Projects	Amount		Round-1 Cities (20 cities)	127	11,750	548	26,966	1,119	18,408	1,794	57,124(Source: Geo-Spatial Management Information System)Out of 1,794 projects worth ?57,124 crore that were part of the Smart City Plans of Smart Cities selected in Round-1, 1,667 projects (93%) worth ?45,374 crore (79%) have either been completed or are under implementation. All efforts are being made for timely completion of projects undertaken in these cities.(e) 	COVID-19 pandemic related lockdowns and other unprecedented situations have led to temporary interruptions in execution of Smart City works across the country. However, most of the Smart Cities have commenced works after un-lockdown and are trying their best to make up for the time lost due to such unprecedented and unforeseen circumstances.(f)	 Under SCM, the focus is on sustainable and inclusive development. The Mission is implementing projects in diverse areas such as mobility, built environment, non-motorized and public transport, water and wastewater, renewable energy, solid waste management, affordable housing, safety and security of citizens, health and education. Comprehensive development through a combination of area-based and pan-city approaches impacts quality of life, creates employment and enhances income for all, especially the most marginalized and low-income groups in cities and urban areas.                           *****
