ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) & (b)The Central Government organised a week long intensive beach cleaning-cum-awareness drive named ‘Swachh-Nirmal Tat Abhiyan’ from 11th to 17th November 2019 at 50 beaches in 10 coastal States, namely Gujarat, Daman &Diu, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Andhra Pradesh, and Odisha. The drive witnessed huge stakeholders’ participation particularly the students of schools/colleges, volunteers, public representatives, officials of State Governments and civil society organisations. Mass awareness campaigns, quiz competitions, painting competitions, counselling sessions, pledge ceremonies, slogan writing, rallies etc. were also organised during the drive duly sensitizing all stakeholders about the importance of protection and conservation of the coastal ecosystems. Mechanized beach cleaning was also undertaken at the beach sites resulting in better standardsof cleanliness. (c) the details of the State/UTs wise funds sanctioned under the programme are as under:Sr. No	State/UT	Amount sanctioned(Rs.)1	Gujarat 	27,03,250.002	Daman &Diu 	10,81,300.003	Maharashtra 	21,62,600.004	Goa	32,43,900.005	Karnataka 	32,43,900.006	Kerala	37,84,550.007	Tamil Nadu 	21,62,600.008	Puducherry	21,62,600.009	Andhra Pradesh	37,84,550.0010	Odisha	27,03,250.00(d) & (e)An amount of approx. Rs.18,63,000/-was utilised under the scheme in Goa during the drive period. The entire amount could not be utilised for the said purpose as the beaches in Goa are narrow in width due to the inherent beach morphology and linearity in their topographic dispensation. Besides, the length of the identified beach stretches taken up for cleaning was also relatively shorter.***
