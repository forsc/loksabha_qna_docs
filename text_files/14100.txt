                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (e):   A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.****** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (e) OF STARRED QUESTION NO.253 BY SHRI¬ SUNIL DATTATRAY TATKARE AND SHRI VIJAY KUMAR DUBEY TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 11.03.2020 REGARDING SAFETY OF WOMEN PASSENGERS.(a)	& (b): Section 58 of the Railways Act, 1989 provides for earmarking of accommodation for female passengers in trains. Accordingly, in trains carrying passengers, Indian Railways have earmarked following accommodation for female passengers:I.	A reservation quota of six berths in sleeper class in long distance Mail/Express trains and a reservation quota of six berths in 3AC class of Garib Rath/Rajdhani/ Duronto/fully air-conditioned Express trains for female passengers irrespective of their age travelling alone or in a group of female passengers. II.	A combined quota of six to seven lower berths per coach in Sleeper class, four to five lower berths per coach each in Air Conditioned 3 tier (3AC) and three to four lower berths per coach in Air Conditioned 2 tier (2AC) classes (depending on the number of coaches of that class in the train) for senior citizens, female passengers 45 years of age and above and pregnant women.III.	Second class accommodation for women in the second Class-cum-Luggage-cum Guard’s Coach (SLR) in most of the long-distance trains.IV.	Unreserved coaches/compartments for female passengers in EMU (Electrical Multiple Unit)/DMU (Diesel Multiple Unit)/MMTS(Multi Modal Transport System) trains & local passenger trains depending upon demand pattern as well as availability of accommodation....2/--	2  - V.	Running of ladies special EMU/MEMU/MMTS services on the suburban sections of Mumbai, Kolkata, Secunderabad and Chennai as well as on the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) sections. 	Review of accommodation is a continuous and ongoing process subject to demand pattern, feasibility and availability of accommodation. There has been a continuous increase in accommodation earmarked for ladies in the past five years. During financial year 2018-19, the accommodation earmarked under various reservation quotas for ladies was 2.96 crore as compared to 1.18 crore in  2014-15 constituting an increase of approximately 152% over the last five years. In the current Financial year 2019-20 (upto December 2019) approximately 2.57 crore berths have been earmarked for ladies under various reservation quotas.  	Policing on Railways being a State subject, prevention of crime, registration of cases, their investigation and maintenance of law & order in Railway premises as well as on running trains are the statutory responsibility of the State Governments, which they discharge through Government Railway Police (GRP)/District Police. Railway Protection Force (RPF) supplements the efforts of GRP to provide better protection and security to passenger area and passengers and for matters connected therewith. Cases of Indian Penal Code (IPC) crimes in Railways are registered and investigated by the concerned Government Railway Police. Whenever any information about status of crime on Railways is sought, State GRP is requested to provide the information. Based on the data provided by Government Railway Police Stations, there is decrease in cases of rape and assault on women passengers in trains registered during the year 2019 as compared to the previous year i.e. 2018.   										...3/-- 3 -(c): Based on the vulnerability of section, threat perception, prevailing crime situation and availability of staff, RPF staff including women RPF personnel are deployed in trains.(d): In addition to earmarking of coaches in sub-urban EMU services, Indian Railways is also operating 62 full/partial Ladies Special trains on the sub-urban sectors of Mumbai, Kolkata, Secunderabad, Chennai.  Such services are also being operated in the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR).(e): Earmarking of accommodation for female passengers in trains, its review based on demand pattern and provision of other facilities for their safe and comfortable journey is a continuous and ongoing exercise. However, in addition to the accommodation earmarked for female passengers as mentioned in reply to part(a), following other major steps have been taken by Indian Railways (some in co-ordination with Government Railway Police) to ensure safe & comfortable journey of female passengers:-I.	On vulnerable and identified routes/sections, 2500 trains (on an average) are escorted by Railway Protection Force daily in addition to 2200 trains escorted by Government Railway Police of different States daily.II.	Security Help Line number 182 is made operational over Indian Railways for security related assistance to passengers in distress.III.	Through various social media platforms viz. twitter, facebook etc., Railways are in regular touch with passengers including women to enhance security of passengers and to address their security concern....4/--	4   - IV.	Drives are conducted against entry of male passengers into compartments reserved for women passengers and persons apprehended are prosecuted as per law.V.	Ladies Special trains running in Metropolitan cities are being escorted by lady RPF personnel. In other trains, where escorts are provided, the train escorting parties have been briefed to keep extra vigil on the lady passengers travelling alone, ladies coaches en-route and at halting stations.VI.	Surveillance is kept through Close Circuit Television(CCTV) cameras, provided at about 453 stations over Indian Railways, to ensure safety and security of passengers. VII.	An Integrated Security System (ISS) consisting of surveillance of vulnerable stations through CCTV, Access Control etc. has been sanctioned to improve surveillance mechanism over 202 railway stations. VIII.	All Railway Stations and passenger carrying trains are planned to be progressively provided with CCTV based surveillance system. IX.	Frequent announcements are made through Public Address System to educate passengers to take precautions against theft, snatching, drugging etc. X.	Regular coordination is made with the State Police/GRP authorities at all levels for prevention of crime, registration of cases, their investigation and maintenance of law & order in Railway premises as well as on running trains. XI.	CCTV have been provided in Humsafar and Tejas train services. These are being proliferated further in other coaches in a phased manner on Indian Railways (IR) to improve security of passengers, including women passengers*****
