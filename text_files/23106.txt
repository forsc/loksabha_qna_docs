(c) & (d):	The Ministry of Education has issued guidelines in October, 2014 which were reiterated in 2017,  to all State and UTs for ensuring safety and security of school children, including preventive mechanisms and procedures required to be put in place in the schooling system along with relief and redressal strategies in case of any incident.
