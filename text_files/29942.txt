                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(SHRI PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a): The State-wise and year-wise details of total fish production in the country during 2018-19 and 2019-20 are furnished at Annexure I. Fish production data for 2020-21 and current year have not been finalized. The State-wise and year-wise details of export of marine products in the country for the last three years and the current year i.e. from April to September, 2021 (provisional) as reported by the Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA) are furnished at Annexure II. (b)   and (c): No, Sir. The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) being implemented by the Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying with a plethora of beneficiary-oriented activities inter-alia, envisages generation of about 55 lakhs direct and indirect employment opportunities in fisheries and aquaculture sector over a period of five years. Implementation of the PMMSY has commenced during 2020-21 and the Department of Fisheries since inception of the Scheme has accorded approval of fisheries and aquaculture development proposals to the tune of Rs.5336.96 crores with a central share of Rs.1823.5 crores to States/Union Territories (UTs) and other implementing agencies. An amount of Rs.1223.96 crore has been released to various States/UTs and other implementing agencies during 2020-21 and in the current financial year under the PMMSY. The approved proposals are primarily beneficiary oriented aimed at employment generation. Further, the Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying is also implementing the Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) Scheme with a total fund size of Rs 7522.48 crore under which concessional finance in the form of interest subvention is provided for creation of fisheries and aquaculture infrastructure. Activities approved under FIDF also generate large scale employment opportunities. Average annual growth of Gross Value Addition due to the Fisheries sector from 2014-15 to 2019-20 at constant price (2011-12) is 8.81%, which is supported by investments catalyzed through governmental schemes and programmes. As output is growing and fisheries is labor intensive, question of decline of employment opportunities does not arise. *****
