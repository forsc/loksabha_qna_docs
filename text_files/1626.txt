                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (c):	Child Labour is an outcome of various socio-economic problems such as poverty, economic backwardness and illiteracy. The Central Government has taken cognizance of the practice of child labour still going on in various parts of the country in spite of a ban on it and is committed to eradicate the problem of child labour from all parts of the country. Contd..2/-::  2  ::           	For elimination of child labour, the Government has amended the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986 and enacted Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 which came into force w.e.f. 1.9.2016. The Amendment Act inter alia provides for complete prohibition of work or employment of children below 14 years in any occupation and process and prohibition of adolescents in the age group of 14 to 18 years in hazardous occupations and processes. The Amendment Act also provides strict punishment for employers for violation of the Act and has made the offence cognizable.               	The number of violations detected during the inspections conducted, the number of prosecutions launched and the number of convictions made in the last five years in respect of the Child & Adolescent Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986 is given hereunder:-Year 	Violations 	Prosecutions 	Convictions 2014	5595	2923	9982015	4319	2481	7482016	3993	1730	6772017	1691	1276	6952018	942	624	586Total 	165409034	3704          	The Government is also implementing the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme since 1988 for rehabilitation of child labour.Under the NCLP Scheme, children in the age group of 9-14 years are rescued/withdrawn from work and enrolled in the NCLP Special Training Centres, where they are provided with bridge education, vocational training, mid-day meal, stipend, health care, etc. before being mainstreamed into formal education system.  Children in the age group of 5-8 years are directly linked to the formal education system through a close coordination with the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA).  To ensure effective enforcement of the provisions of the Child Labour Act and smooth implementation of the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme, a separate online portal PENCIL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) has been launched w.e.f. 26.9.2017. Contd..3/-::  3  ::(d):		To make the law more effective for complete eradication of child labour the Government amended the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986 through the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 which came into force w.e.f. 1.9.2016 which inter alia provides for:-1)	Complete prohibition of employment of children below 14 years.2)	Prohibition of employment of adolescents (aged 15-18 years) in hazardous occupations3)	Enhancement of penalty for contravention of the provisions of the Act.4)	Employment of children in contravention of the Act, made a cognizable offence. ******
