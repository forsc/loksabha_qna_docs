                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW & JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a)	to (c) Lok Adalat is an important Alternative Disputes Resolution Mechanism available to common people. It is a forum where the disputes/cases pending in the court of law or at pre-litigation stage are settled/compromised amicably. Under the Legal Services Authorities (LSA) Act, 1987, an award made by a Lok Adalat is deemed to be a decree of a civil court and is final and binding on all parties and no appeal lies against thereto before any court. In order to reduce the pendency of cases in courts and also to settle the disputes at pre-litigation stage, Lok Adalats are organized by Legal Services Institutions at such intervals as it deems fit. Lok Adalat is not a permanent establishment. However, as per Section 19 of the LSA Act, Lok Adalats are organized by Legal Services Institutions as per requirement. National Lok Adalats are organized simultaneously in all Taluks, Districts and High Courts on a pre-fixed date.	In addition, Section 22B of the LSA Act also provides for establishment of Permanent Lok Adalat by every State Authority to deal with cases of public utility services at pre-litigation stage. 337 Permanent Lok Adalats are functioning in various States & UTs. State-wise Permanent Lok Adalats and cases settled is at Annexure-A. State-wise cases settled (both at pre-litigative stage and pending cases) by Regular Lok Adalats and National Lok Adalats during the last three years is at Annexure B and C respectively.(d)	During last three years, Regular Lok Adalats have settled 20,00,437 cases and National Lok Adalats have settled 81,55,052 cases pending in High Courts and Lower Courts. ********  				                      Annexure-AStatement as referred to in reply to the Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 3934 for 18.03.2020 raised by Dr. Shrikant Eknath Shinde & Ors. -Lok AdalatsA statement containing the number of cases settled in Permanent Lok Adalats (Public Utility Services) during the last three financial years  2017-18, 2018-19 and  2019-20 (upto December, 2019)S.
