ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a):	Government of Jammu & Kashmir implemented National Food Security Act, 2013 with effect from Feb-2016.  Consequent upon implementation of NFSA, an annual allocation of 477576.59 MT of foodgrain which comprises of 141123.88 MT of wheat and 336452.71 MT of rice is made to the State Government.  In addition, an annual tide over allocation of 80820.58 MT of wheat and 192683.90 MT of rice is also being made to the State of Jammu & Kashmir to protect average annual offtake of foodgrain of last three years before the NFSA came into effect.(b) & (c): 	Due to snow/rain, landslides, bandhs called by various organisations and imposition of curfew etc, the movement of foodgrain stocks to Kashmir valley was affected. Also, Govt. of J&K, Home department vide G.O. no Home (ISA) of 2019 dated 03.04.19 vide which dedicated movement of security forces convoy on two days every week viz Sunday and Wednesday with no civilian movement was ordered.  This had adversely affected the movement of essential commodities including movement of FCI foodgrains to Valley.  ........2/--2-            It is pertinent to mention that the monthly requirement of Jammu & Kashmir is 62590.090 MT and during Apr’19 to Jun’19, a quantity of 2.77 LMT has been dispatched to J& K region so that no hindrance in fulfilling the requirement of the region is faced. Also no lapse in meeting up the allocation has been reported to this office.            Continuous effort to step up the induction of foodgrains in Jammu & Kashmir has enabled Government of India to increase the stock position of Jammu & Kashmir from 1.53 LMT in May’19 to 1.79 LMT as on 15.07.19 which is 2.75 times the monthly requirement of J&K. This build up in stock position is in addition to release of sufficient stocks under various Govt. Schemes.   Thus, despite unfavourable circumstances, efforts have been made to ensure that maximum foodgrains are inducted to Jammu & Kashmir so as to fulfill the monthly requirement as well as to maintain sufficient buffer stock before the onset of winters.****
