ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) to (e): 	Paddy is procured  under both Non- Decentralized Procurement (Non-DCP) and  Decentralized Procurement (DCP) Scheme. Kerala and Maharashtra have adopted DCP scheme for procurement of paddy under which, the State Government itself undertakes direct purchase of paddy from farmers, stores and distributes the procured Custom Milled Rice (CMR) under National Food Security Act (NFSA) and Other Welfare Schemes (OWS). Only the surplus CMR, after meeting the State’s requirement, is delivered to Food Corporation of India (FCI) for Central Pool account for movement to other consuming States. Since both Kerala and Maharashtra are deficit rice procuring States (against their requirement under NFSA & OWS), the rice procured by these States and their agencies is consumed within the State and there is no surplus stock for handing over to FCI.****
