ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a):   The policy of the  Government is to promote all Indian Languages including  regional languages and classical languages.  Government releases funds to Language Institutions for promotion and protection of Indian Languages and funds are not released language wise. Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL) works for the promotion of all languages including four Classical Languages namely Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam and Odia.  Development and  promotion of Classical Tamil is done by Central Institute of Classical Tamil (CICT),  Chennai.      Sanskrit   is promoted  by     Central  Sanskrit  University, -2-New Delhi.   Hindi is promoted by Kendriya Hindi Sansthan (KHS)  Agra,  Central Hindi Directorate (CHD), New Delhi and  Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology (CSTT), New Delhi. (b): 	An amount of Rs.11.73 crores allocated to CICT, Chennai during 2020-21.(c) & (d): 	No Sir.  No such proposal to merge CICT with any other centre, at present.(e) & (f):   The CICT established with the view of promoting the cause of Classical Tamil, is focussing exclusively on the research relating to the classical phase of the Tamil language, i.e. from the early period to AD 600.  The role of the Institute is very vital and significant since it carries out research  on ancient Tamil society and also documents and preserves objects relating to or reflecting the antiquity of the Tamils. Short term projects, seminars, training programmes, publications are financially supported by CICT for promoting Classical Tamil.***
