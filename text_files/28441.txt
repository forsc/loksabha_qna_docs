(b)    Quantum of coal imports, its expenditure and annual increase in terms of percentage, during the last five years is as under:-  (Fig in Million Tonnes(MT) and value in Million Rs.(MR))Year	Import	Coal Import (MT)	Value(MR)	Growth % QTY	Growth % Value2016-17	190.953	1002314	-6.372	16.5022017-18	208.249	1384770	9.058	38.1572018-19	235.348	1709205	13.013	23.4292019-20	248.537	1527321	5.604	-10.6412020-21	214.995	1160372	-13.496	-24.026 (c)   Auction of commercial mining on Revenue Sharing Mechanism was launched on 18.06.2020. Under this scheme, two tranches have been successfully completed and third Tranche is currently under process. From these two tranches total of 28 coal mines have been successfully auctioned. The likely benefits accruing to the states from these 28 coal mines are provided below:  State	PRC (MTPA)	Royalty@ 14% of revenue (Rs. crore)	DMF @30% of royalty (Rs. crore)	Royalty and DMF (Rs. Cr.)

Additionally, GST and GST Compensation Cess is also payable to the Centre which will then be shared by Centre with the States.  Further, Revenue share and employment numbers for partially explored coal mines of 2nd Round of commercial auction have not been calculated since PRC of these mine is not available.  (d) Ministry of coal has proposed "Mission Coking Coal" to augment the coking coal production to 170 MT by FY 2029-30, considering coking coal demand projected in National Steel Policy 2017 and increasing the domestic coking coal blending percentage from 10% to 35 % using Stamp Charging Technology.  Coal India Limited (CIL) has envisaged to enhance its production to reach the level of 1BT coal by the year 2023-24 from its current production level of about 600 MT which includes enhancement of production of both non-coking and coking coal.  -----  Annexure-ITable-A: State-wise reserve (resource) of coking and non-coking coal during last 5 years 		(Quantity in Million Tonnes)STATE	As on 01.04.2017	As on 01.04.2018	As on 01.04.2019	As on 01.04.2020	As on 01.04.2021 (Prov.)
