                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a):	As per   Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Report – India: Health of Nation’s States - Cardio-vascular Diseases (CVDs)   contributed to 28.1% of total deaths and 14.1% of total Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in India in 2016. (b) & (c):	Public Health and Hospitals, being a state subject, the primary responsibility to ensure availability of specialist doctors in States/UTs, lies with the respective State/UT Governments. However, under National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their healthcare systems including support for recruitment of doctors on contractual basis, based on the requirements posed by them in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) within their overall resource envelope.  There is no provision for placing specialist doctors at the Primary Health Centres as per the India Public Health Standards norms.  The reason for shortage of specialist doctors in rural areas is mainly un-willingness by them to work in difficult area due to lack of occupational amenities
