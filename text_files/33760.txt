Coal supply is continuously monitored by the coal companies and also by the Sub-group which is chaired by Joint Secretary of Ministry of Coal and includes members from Ministry of Power, Central Electricity Authority, Niti Aayog, Ministry of Railways and coal companies. As per Central Electricity Authority (CEA) report the coal stock with coal based power plants as on 03.02.2022 was 25.2 Million Tonnes (MT). (c):  In terms of linkage rationalization policy issued from time to time, CIL has received request from the Central/State Gencos for shifting of Coal Linkages. CIL, based on the coal availability at its subsidiaries, has shifted these linkages quantities.  The details of  shifted linkage quantities is annexed as Annexure A.(d): As per Central Electricity Authority report dated 03.02.2022, coal stock available with power plants with respective states including Andhra Pradesh is annexed as Annexure B.(e): The following steps have been taken to improve coal supplies for meeting increased demand in the country: i. In order to address the issues of coal supplies to power sector, an Inter-Ministerial Sub-Group comprising of representatives from Ministry of Power, Ministry of Coal, Ministry of Railways, CEA, CIL and Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) meet regularly to take various operational decisions to enhance supply of coal to thermal power plants as well as for meeting any contingent situations relating to power sector including critical coal stock position in power plants. ii. CIL had offered additional coal of about 5.2 MT (in October''21) and 6.0 MT (in December''21) from its various subsidiaries to States, Central Gencos for lifting through Rail-cum-Road(RCR)/ Road Mode.iii. The Ministry of Coal has amended Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 with a view to encourage domestic coal production enhancement from captive mines by allowing sale of coal or lignite, on payment of additional amount, by the lessee of a captive mine up to 50 percent of the total coal or lignite produced in a financial year, after meeting the requirement of the end use plant linked with the mine. Earlier this year, the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act had been amended to this effect. This is applicable for both the private and public sector captive mines. With this amendment, the Government has paved the way for releasing of additional coal in the market by greater utilization of mining capacities of captive coal and lignite blocks,which were being only partly utilized owing to limited production of coal for meeting their captive needs. ****
