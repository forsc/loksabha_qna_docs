The implementation agency, the Airports Authority of India(AAI), under Regional Connectivity Scheme(RCS)-UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik), had conducted UDAN 4.0 round of bidding in December, 2019. A total of 92 routes were awarded to Selected Airlines Operators(SAOs) under this bidding round;(c) & (d): A total of 335 routes were awarded under UDAN 3.0 bidding round. Out of these routes, 151 routes have been operationalized. During review, the routes which are not found viable for operation due to various reasons on account of SAO and airport are cancelled and offered in future rounds of bidding under UDAN. UDAN is a market driven scheme. Interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN. Moreover, UDAN scheme is reviewed in consultation with stakeholders including SAO periodically and necessary course corrections, if required, are carried out.******
