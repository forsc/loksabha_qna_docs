The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Government of India  under Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) envisages substantial investments to the tune of Rs.3490 crore for development of fishing harbours and fish landing centres  during the period of five years from 2020-21 to 2024-25. Further, under the Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund(FIDF), concessional finance is provided to the State Governments/Union Territories to undertake development of fishing harbours and fish landing centres. Till date, 14 fishing harbour projects worth of Rs. 3451.32 crores have been approved under FIDF. (b) to (d) :	Yes Sir. The Government of India in its budget 2021-22 has announced development of 5 Major Fishing Harbours namely Kochi, Chennai, Visakhapatnam, Paradip, and Petuaghat as hubs of economic activities and also to develop inland fishing harbours and fish-landing centres along the banks of rivers and waterways. (e) and (f) :	Yes Sir.  Seaweed farming has immense potential to transform lives of  coastal communities. The Government of India in its budget 2021-22 has announced establishment of a Multipurpose Seaweed Park in Tamil Nadu to promote seaweed cultivation and value chain. Development and promotion of seaweed cultivation and value chain has been identified as one of the priority areas by the Government. The PMMSY inter alia provides for focused development and promotion of seaweed cultivation in the country with requisite financial allocations. (g):	The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Government of India under the CSS on Blue Revolution: Integrated Development and Management of Fisheries during the last three years 2017-18 to 2019-20 had sanctioned the projects worth of Rs. 316 lakh to various State Governments for construction of fish landing centre, berthing/auction platform, auction halls and net mending sheds on the shores of reservoir and rivers. The State-wise details of the projects approved under erstwhile CSS on Blue Revolution: Integrated Development and Management of Fisheries in this regard are  furnished at Annexure-I. However, development of Modern Inland Fishing Harbours and Fish Landing Centres along the banks of  rivers and waterways is an  initiative announced in the Budget 2021-22.
