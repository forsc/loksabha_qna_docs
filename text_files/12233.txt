The Ministry deals with Indian Forest Service Officers (IFS). As IFS is an All India Service, officers are placed with the different State Cadres except AGMUT for which this Ministry is the Controlling Authority. Under the AIS(D&A) Rules, 1969, the State Govt. is Competent Authority to initiate and take action against the IFS Officers for any violations of rules. It is only where the State Govts. decide to impose the penalty of Compulsory Retirement, Removal or Dismissal from service, that the case is forwarded to this Ministry for necessary action.  ******
