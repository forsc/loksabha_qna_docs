These include cases of misappropriation of funds by the promoters/ top management and cheating the money lenders. Statutory status to the SFIO has been granted under the Companies Act, 2013. The Government has taken a number of measures to curb and prevent corporate frauds: (i) ‘Fraud’ as a substantive offence has been introduced in the Companies Act, 2013; (ii) stricter norms of Corporate Governance have been provided in the Companies Act, 2013; (iii) it has been made mandatory for every existing or prospective directors to obtain a “Directors Identification Number” (DIN); (iv) in case of incorporation of a new company or change of address of an existing company, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has made it mandatory for professionals to verify details of the company and to personally visit their premises and certify that the premises are at the disposal of the company; (v) MCA has also undertaken pre-emptive measures aimed at sensitizing people through investors awareness programs which are organized regularly in association with the three professional institutes namely Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), Institute of Cost Accountants of India (ICoAI) and Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI) in various cities.Further, SEBI has informed that it has put in place systems and practices to promote a safe, transparent and efficient securities market and to protect market integrity.  SEBI maintains constant vigil in the securities market and in case where any entity/ listed company is found to have engaged in any fraudulent activity in the securities market, it takes appropriate action, wherever warranted. In order to prevent fraudulent and unfair trade practices, SEBI has put in place a regulatory framework viz. SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003.  SEBI conducts investigation to examine alleged or suspected violations of laws and Regulations relating to the securities market.  Post investigation, whenever violations are established, appropriate enforcement actions are taken under the provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992 and Regulations framed thereunder which culminate in the issuance of Orders.                                                      *******
