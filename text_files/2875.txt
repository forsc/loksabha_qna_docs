                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (e):	The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (MGNREGA) provides at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. State/UT-wise details of households having completed 100 days of employment under MGNREGS including Telangana during the last three years i.e. 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 are given at Annexure. MGNREGS provides livelihood security i.e., fall back option for livelihood for the rural households when no better employment opportunity is available. It is demand driven programme. The demand for work is influenced by various factors such as rain-fall, availability of alternative and remunerative employment opportunities outside MGNREGS.***** Annexure referred in reply to parts (a)to(e) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 2650 dated 09.07.2019Sl.
