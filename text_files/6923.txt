                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION  (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)  (a) to (c):  Though overall development of all regions of the State is primarily the responsibility of the State Government, however, the Central Government supplements in their efforts through implementing various Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  The Centrally Sponsored Scheme of “Backward Region Grant Fund (BRGF)-District Component” Scheme has been delinked from support of the Central Government since 2015-16. Following the acceptance of recommendations of Fourteenth Finance Commission for increased devolution to the States by way of enhancing the share of the States in the net proceeds of union taxes from 32% to 42% resulting in the increased fund transfer to the State.	Further, NITI Aayog has identified 117 districts in 28 States as Aspirational Districts with an aim to quickly and effectively transform these districts.  This programme focuses closely on improving people’s ability to participate fully in the burgeoning economy.  The core areas of focus are health & nutrition, education, agriculture & water resources, financial inclusion & skill development, and basic infrastructure.  In this programme, four districts of Maharashtra; Nandurbar, Gadchiroli, Osmanabad and Washim are included.  ***
