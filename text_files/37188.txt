The Manual was forwarded to all States and UTs in May, 2016, which, inter-alia, provides detailed guidance on varied aspects of prison and correctional administration. Prison reform is a continuous and ongoing process.The Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D), MHA has prepared two training Manuals namely ‘Training Manual of Basic Course for Prison Warders 2017’ and ‘Training Manual of Basic Course for Prison Officers 2017’ and has circulated it to all States and UTs. Various Conferences, workshops, seminars, etc. are also organised by BPR&D, MHA and the Institute of Correctional Administration, Chandigarh on correctional administration and for capacity building of prison staff.State/UT-wise number of prisons constructed and renovated/expanded, as reported to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), by the States and UTs during the year 2020 are given in Annexure.
