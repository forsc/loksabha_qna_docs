                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) FOR NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY,  POWER and MoS for  SKILL DEVELOPMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP(SHRI R. K. SINGH)(a) & (b) There is no “Clean Technology Scheme” being run by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). However, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy under its Human Resources Development (HRD) Programme supports educational and training institutions to impart training on various aspects of renewable energy including system design, installation, commissioning, servicing, repair and maintenance of renewable energy systems, devices and power projects being part of Clean Technology. These trainings are conducted by research/educational institutions, NGOs, solar companies having necessary training facilities. These trainings involve both theory and practical classes as per the National Occupational Standards and Qualification Packs, developed in collaboration with the Skill Council for Green Jobs (SCGJ), a Sector Skill Council set up as per the provisions of National Skill Development Mission, which also organises such training programmes through its affiliated training partners. In addition, as part of “Scale UP of Access to Clean Energy Scheme” of the Ministry, 17 training programmes have been organised in the states of Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Puducherry and Haryana besides holding four State/District Level Workshops and Other Capacity Building Events .(c) & (d) To analyse the impact of the HRD programmes, MNRE   awarded a study to Indian Institute of Development Management (IIDM), Bhopal. The IIDM in its Report, submitted in December 2017, mentioned that the short term training programs supported by MNRE have been able to generate considerable awareness about renewable energy systems amongst students, professionals, government functionaries. The Report further mentions that these programmes have resulted into development of skilled manpower to take care of erection, commissioning and maintenance of renewable energy systems in different parts of the country. In addition, each of the training programme supported by the Ministry is assessed by the SCGJ, and certificate to the successful trainees are awarded. Details of the SCGJ certified candidates on various renewable energy job roles are as follows:Sr No	Job Role	                 Total Certified candidates1	Solar PV Installer (Suryamitra)	          52952**2	Solar PV Installer Electrical	           90123	Solar Lighting Technician	           12444	Solar PV Installer - Civil	           10865	Rooftop Solar Grid Engineer	            7746	Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic Entrepreneur	     6747	Solar electric System Installer & Service Provider	2448	Solar PV O& M Engineer	709	Solar Domestic Water Heater Technician	      6310	Solar Proposal Evaluation Specialist	      6311	Solar Off Grid Entrepreneur	              4012	Solar PV Business Development Executive       4013	Improved Cookstove Installer (Fixed type)     99	Total  	                                    66361** This include 29,434 candidates supported by MNRE under its Suryamitra programme                                       *****
