ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a)	The Government has not launched Passport Seva Programme (PSP) V2.0, yet. (b) & (c)   Does not arise. (d)	e-passport services will be provided to Citizens of India. OCI card holders (erstwhile PIO card holders) are persons of Indian origin who hold foreign citizenship.  (e)	The Passport Seva Project, launched in May 2010, is one of the Mission-Mode projects under Digital India, a flagship programme of Government of India. It has brought benefits of huge digital transformation in delivery of passport services to citizens of India, including through our Missions abroad, in an efficient, citizen-friendly and transparent mode in a paperless environment. The entire police verification process, end-to-end, has also been made paperless under the programme. The major achievements/deliverables under PSP V1.0 include: establishment of Passport Facilitation Centre (PFC) now known as Passport Seva Kedra (PSK), Post Office Passport Seva Kendra (POPSK), Data Centre (DC), Disaster Recovery Centre (DRC), Central Passport Printing Facility (CPPF), Centralised Indian Passport Printing System (CIPPS); Upgradation of Passport Back Offices. The digital transformation of passport services has been duly recognized and conferred with triple ISO Certification (9001, 27001 and 20000); recently PSP platform has been integrated successfully with DigiLocker for direct validation of document at source, further advancing a paperless environment.***
