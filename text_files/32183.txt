ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) to (d): In the Public Sector Banks (PSBs), Government nominates the non-official Directors (NoDs) on the board of banks as per approved guidelines dated 25.3.2015. The selection of NoDs is done by a Search Committee. In accordance with the said guidelines, the Search Committee assesses the suitability of persons to be considered for nomination as NoDs in terms of qualification, expertise, track record, integrity etc. and after due diligence recommends the names of the candidates. Further, reports are also sought in respect of these candidates from Reserve Bank of India and other relevant agencies as deemed fit before nominating these candidates for the post of NoDs. Paragraph 10(d) of the Nationalised Banks (Management and Miscellaneous Provisions) Scheme, 1970 and 1980, provides that a persons shall be disqualified for being appointed as, and for being, a director if he holdsany office of profit under any nationalised bank or State Bank of India, except for holding the post of a whole-time director, workmen director and non-workmen director.*****
