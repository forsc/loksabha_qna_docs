ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	to (e) The government is aware that several private institution and universities, while adapting different methodologies, different data set and giving different weightages to the parameters are ranking the countries.  The data used for ranking is not validated by proper ground truthing. Further, the methodology for ranking needs to be peer reviewed. With the growing concerns on air pollution, the Government has introduced National Air Quality Index (NAQI), which is computed scientifically using PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, NH3, and Pb that would facilitate effective dissemination of Air Quality.The Central Government has taken several measures for prevention, control and abatement of air and water pollution across the country which inter alia includes issuing stringent plans like Comprehensive Action Plan, Graded Response Action Plan, National Clean Air Programme; increasing of monitoring network for assessment of ambient air quality; Leapfrogging from BS-IV to BS-VI fuel standards since 1st April, 2018 in NCT of Delhi and from by 1st April, 2020 in the rest of the country; Introduction of cleaner / alternate fuels like gaseous fuel (CNG, LPG etc.); ensuring the stricter norms for reducing industrial emissions; notifying  6 waste management rules covering solid waste, plastic waste, e-waste, bio-medical waste, C&D waste and hazardous wastes in 2016 etc. All these measures helped in the improvement of overall air quality in the country. On the analysis of last five-year ambient air quality data (2014-2018), across the country, it is observed that most of the cities were within the National Standards with respect to parameters of SO2 and NO2. With respect to PM10 and PM2.5, 18 and 12 cities respectively showed decreasing trend. In reference to Delhi, there has been an overall improvement in air quality of Delhi in 2019 as compared to that of 2016. The number of ‘Good to ‘Moderate’ days has increased to 175 in 2019 as compared to 108 in 2016.In reference to water pollution, the steps taken by the Government to check the pollution of water bodies, inter alia, include formulation and notification of standards for effluents from industries, operations or processes; enforcing of these standards by State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) through consent mechanism and regular monitoring; setting up of monitoring network for assessment of water quality; installation of Online Continuous Effluent Monitoring systems (OCEMS) to check the discharge of effluent directly into water bodies; promotion of cleaner production processes; installation of Common Effluent Treatment Plants for cluster of Small Scale Industrial units; issuance of directions for implementation of Zero Liquid Discharge in certain categories of highly polluting industries; issuance of directions under Section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and under Section 18(1)(b) of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, etc.***
