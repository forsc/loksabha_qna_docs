                                                    (a)	whether the Government had sanctioned setting up of Skill Training Centres under PMKVY in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg Districts of Maharashtra; and(b)	if so, the reasons for delay in setting up of Skill Training Centres in these two districts and by when Skill Centres are likely to be set up?






ANSWER




                                                        (a) and (b)	PMKVY does not mandate the setting up of skill training centres. Existing training centres are empanelled as per scheme guidelines for imparting short duration training.Also, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) proposes to establish multi –skilling model and aspirational skill centres known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) in every district of the country. The PMKKs allocated to Kohinoor Technical Institute Private Limited in 2016 in the Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts of Maharashtra were de-allocated due to non-compliance to the timeline laid down for establishing the centres as per PMKK Guidelines. However, they have now been reallocated and both the Training Partners (TPs) have identified the locations to set up the PMKKs. The process of establishment has been delayed due to the on-going COVID pandemic.
