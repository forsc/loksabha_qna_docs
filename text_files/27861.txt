                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????	    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) and (b):	     As per the Report on ‘Women and Men in India, 2020’ of Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation (MoSPI) , the share of workforce of men and women in agriculture has declined in both the rural and urban areas during the period 1987-88 to 2019-20. The country has witnessed relatively much faster rate of growth in sectors other than agriculture on account of structural changes due to a shift from a traditional agrarian economy to industry and service dominated one.  This phenomenon is generally expected in the normal development process of developing economies including India. The percentage distribution of workers in agriculture in usual status (ps+ss)  for the period 1987-88 to 2019-2020 are given below:  Contd.....2/--2-                                                                                                   (in percentage)Year	Rural	Urban	Male	Female	Male	Female1987-88 (43rd Round)	74.5	84.7	9.1	29.41993-94 (50th Round)	74.1	86.2	9.0	24.71999-00 (55th  Round)	71.4	85.4	6.6	17.72004-05 (61st Round)	66.5	83.3	6.1	18.12009-10 (66th Round)	62.8	79.4	6.0	13.92011-12 ( 68th Round)	59.4	74.9	5.6	10.92017-18  (PLFS)	55.0	73.2	5.4	9.12018-19 (PLFS)	53.2	71.1	4.9	7.82019-20 (PLFS)	55.4	75.7	5.0	8.2         Source : Social Statistics Division, MoSPI         Note: Period Labour Force Survey (PLFS), usual status worker (ps+ss): The workers in the usual status (ps+ss) are obtained by considering the usual principal status (ps) and the subsidiary status (ss) together. (c):      As per  NITI Aayog’s Working Group Report (February, 2018) on Demand & Supply Projections towards 2033 for Crops, Livestock, Fisheries and Agricultural Inputs, the aggregate demand of foodgrains for 2021-22,  2028-29 and 2029-30 is projected at 280.03 million tonnes, 314.37 million tonnes and 319.81 million tonnes  respectively.  The aggregate supply of foodgrains for 2021-22, 2028-29 and 2029-30 is projected at 303.97 million tonnes, 353.17 million tonnes and 361.06 million tonnes respectively. Planning for food security and management of grain supply in the immediate future depends on the empirical prediction of demand and supply of foodgrains. ******
