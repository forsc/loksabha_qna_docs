(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):    Government fixes Minimum Support Price (MSP) for 22 mandated agricultural crops on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned and other relevant factors.               The Government in its Union Budget for 2018-19 had announced the pre-determined Principle to keep MSP at levels of one and half times of the cost of production. Accordingly, Government has increased the MSP for all mandated Kharif, Rabi and other commercial crops with a return of atleast 50 per cent over all India weighted average cost of production from the agricultural year 2018-19 onwards.               MSP is one of the measures for remunerative prices to farmers. Moreover, Government has taken a “multi pronged approach” to increase the income of farmers and has been implementing/reorienting various schemes for the same which include Soil Health Card (SHC),  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), e-NAM, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan’(PM-AASHA), Agriculture Infrastructure Fund, Interest Subvention Scheme on Kisan Credit Card, Scheme for formation and promotion of 10,000 FPOs, to boost the farm mechanization in the country, a special dedicated scheme Sub Mission on Agriculture Mechanization (SMAM) has been introduced under which the subsidy is provided for purchase of various types of agricultural equipments and machinery among others.********
