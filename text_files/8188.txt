ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) FOR NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY,  POWER and MoS for  SKILL DEVELOPMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP(SHRI R. K. SINGH)(a) With respect to the tenders implemented by Solar Energy Corporation of India Limited (SECI), details of (i) tenders awarded, (ii) tenders that have received no bids and (iii) tenders issued and yet to be awarded, are enclosed at Annexure-I.(b) The participation of bidders in tenders for solar power projects has over the time been very encouraging with some tenders attracting bids of more than ten times the capacity to be allotted. However, in past few months, some solar tenders, have remained undersubscribed, which may be due to various reasons like delays in payments by distribution companies in some States, delays in adoption of tariffs by concerned State Electricity Regulatory Commissions, reopening of contracts by State Government of Andhra Pradesh, etc.(c) As per the current bidding practice, after the reverse auction, the Letters of Award are issued to the successful bidders. The issuance of Letters of Award to the successful bidders is itself construed as allocation to the successful bidders. Thus there is no delay in allocation after successful awarding of auctioned projects.(d) The Government is aware that the State Government of Andhra Pradesh had constituted a ‘High Level Negotiation Committee for PPAs’ (HLNC) to ‘review, negotiate and bring down the high wind and solar energy purchase prices’.Considering the fact that such steps can have adverse effect on investor confidence, the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) has advised the State Government of Andhra Pradesh that the contractual agreements are sacrosanct and should not be revisited unless there is specific provision to do so in the agreement or a case of malafide/ corruption has been established.(e) In order to address the issues in Renewable Energy sector, MNRE has taken following steps:(1)	The State DISCOMs have been requested to honour Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and ‘Must Run’ status accorded to wind and solar power projects, as per provisions of Indian Electricity Grid Code 2010.(2)	In order to address the issues of delayed payments by State distribution companies to Renewable Energy generators, the Government through Ministry of Power’s Order No. 23/22/2019-R&R dated 28.06.2019 has made it mandatory for the Distribution Licensees to open and maintain adequate Letters of Credit (LCs) as Payment Security Mechanism if provided for under Power Purchase Agreements with Distribution Licensees.(3)	Further, in order to strengthen the contractual provisions in the Contract (Power Purchase Agreements) between the solar power generators and the Procurers, and to facilitate setting up of Renewable Energy power projects, the Government, vide notification dated 22.10.2019 from Ministry of New & Renewable Energy, has made following major amendments to the ‘Guidelines for Tariff Based Competitive Bidding Process for Procurement of Power from Grid Connected Solar PV Power Projects’:(i)	Solar Power Generators have been allowed to submit documents/Lease Agreement to establish possession/right to use 100% (hundred per cent) of the required land in the name of the Solar Power Generator for a period not less than the complete term of the PPA, on or before the Scheduled Commissioning Date (SCD). (ii)	Clear and elaborate provisions for time extension and compensation to affected party in the event of natural and non-Natural Force Majeure events with specific provisions regarding termination due to natural and non-natural Force Majeure events have been included.(iii)	Quantum of compensation for back-down has been increased from 50% to 100% with provision for recognition of only written instructions of back-down.(iv)	Corresponding time extension in date for achievement of financial closure and scheduled commissioning date, in case there is a delay in adoption of tariff by the concerned State Electricity Regulatory Commission beyond a period of 60 days from the filing of such application.*****
