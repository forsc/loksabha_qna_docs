ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (c) : 	Electricity is a concurrent subject. Providing electricity to all the consumers is the primary responsibility of concerned State Governments/Power Distribution Companies (DISCOMs). Thus, power cuts and its impact on households/industry, if any, are to be monitored by the respective State Government/ Distribution Companies/ State Electricity Regulation Commission.As on 30.06.2019, the installed generation capacity is about 358 Giga Watt (GW) which is sufficient to meet the power demand of the country. The maximum peak demand occurred during the current year 2019-20 (upto June, 2019) was around 184 GW. During April-June, 2019 the  average power shortage in the country was only around 0.4% and the peak power shortage was only around 0.6%. This gap is not on account of shortage of availability of power but on account of factors like constraints in distribution network, financial constraints to purchase power by Distribution Company etc. The state-wise details of power supply position in the country during the current year 2019-20 (up to June, 2019) are at Annexure-I.(d) : 		Government of India supplement the efforts of the States through its schemes including Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana- Saubhagya, Ujjwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY). These schemes help them to strengthen distribution network/grid connectivity and achieve 24x7 Power for All and would facilitate uninterrupted power supply. The State-wise details of fund sanctioned under DDUGJY (including additional Infrastructure) and IPDS are at Annexure-II.   Government of India also assists the States/UTs by allocating power from Central Generating Stations (CGSs). State can also purchase power through various market mechanisms including power exchanges to meet any gap in demand and supply.********************
