                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) to (e)  A statement is laid on the Table of the House.  STATEMENT REFERRED TO, IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. *312 TO BE ANSWERED ON 24.03.2022 IN LOK SABHA REGARDING “ERCP AS NATIONAL PROJECT” ASKED BY SHRI HANUMAN BENIWAL. (a) to (e) For inclusion of a project for funding under National Projects scheme of this Ministry, it is required to be first appraised by Central Water Commission (CWC), and accepted by the Advisory Committee on Irrigation, Flood Control and Multipurpose Projects of this Ministry. Thereafter, investment clearance is required to be obtained by the State Government. Subsequently, if the project meets the laid down norms for the National Project scheme, it is required to be considered by the High Powered Steering Committee (HPSC) set up for the purpose. On being recommended by HPSC, and as per availability of funds etc., Government of India may approve inclusion of a project under the National Projects scheme.   Appraisal of ERCP has not been possible due to inter-State issues with the other co-basin State, namely Madhya Pradesh. Presently ERCP does not fulfill the criteria laid down for inclusion under National Projects scheme of this Ministry.  Though requests have been received, no proposal, as per the prescribed proforma, for inclusion of ERCP as a National Project has been submitted by Government of Rajasthan. *****
