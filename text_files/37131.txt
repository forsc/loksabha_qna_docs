ANSWER




 MINISTER OF  PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a): Coal India Ltd.(CIL) and NLC India Ltd. (NLCIL), Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs)  under the Ministry of Coal have allocated funds under Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR)  during each of the last three years as per the norms prescribed in section 135 of Companies Act 2013. The details of CSR funds allocated and spent during the last three  years and current year till February 2022 are  given below: CIL and its subsidiariesFinancial Year	CSR Fund as per Companies Act, 2013(Rs. crores)	Actual CSR Expenditure(Rs. crores)2018-19	353.98	416.472019-20	396.20	587.842020-21	434.51	553.852021-22(April,2021- February, 2022)	452.24	364.01 NLCIL and its subsidiariesFinancial year	CSR Fund as per Companies Act, 2013 (Rs crores)	Actual CSR Expenditure(Rs. crores)2018-19	45.73	51.242019-20	51.98	79.822020-21	52.55	49.872021-22(April,2021- February, 2022)	49.77	30.55 (b)&(c):  As per the CSR policy of CIL, 80% of the CSR fund of the subsidiaries for any year is spent in the areas falling within a radius of 25 km around the mines/projects and the rest 20% in the state(s) of operation. CIL through its CSR policy has ensured that the underprivileged people in project affected areas and in the states of operation are primary beneficiaries of CSR activities. All the 8 operational states of CIL i.e. West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh, Maharashtra, Assam and Odisha have sizeable backward population. Moreover, 13 of the 36 operational districts of CIL contain 5th schedule areas with preponderance of tribal population. Hence, the ST population of the operational districts of CIL gets benefitted from CSR projects. NLCIL allocates 2% of the average Net profit of preceding 3 years as CSR Fund every year and undertakes CSR activities under various items of Schedule VII of Companies Act 2013. NLCIL spends 75% of CSR funds in the local area (in the operating region). An estimated 50% to 55% of the total budget is spent for the welfare of backward and Scheduled Tribes population in surrounding villages/regions of NLCIL.The CSR projects are undertaken for socio.economic development of the whole society where the project is executed. Hence it is difficult to ascertain the exact number of people benefiting from the project. The details of quantum of funds spent in various activities during last three years till February 2022 is given in Annex attached. ****
