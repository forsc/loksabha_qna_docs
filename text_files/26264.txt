The objective of the scheme is to facilitate augmenting of investment, productivity, quality, employment, exports along with import substitution in textile industry and also to indirectly promote investment in textile machinery manufacturing. ATUFS is a demand driven scheme wherein funds are allocated pan-India basis instead of state-wise allocation of funds. Government has recently extended the Rebate on State and Central Taxes and Levies for exporters of garment and made-up products. This will help promotion of manufacturing of garment and made up and will create additional employment opportunities.Further, following projects have been implemented in the State of West Bengal and Orissa under scheme for Integrated Textile Park (SITP) and Scheme for Incubation Centre in Apparel Manufacturing (SIAM) for the development of textiles:(Rupees in crore)Sl No.	Scheme	Project	Project Cost	GOI Share	GOI released1	Scheme for Integrated Textile Park (SITP)	EIGMEF apparel Park Ltd., Sayed Amir Ali, kolkata	130.50	40	31.612		Hosiery park, Howrah, west Bengal	70.14	28.06	25.253	Scheme for Incubation Centre in Apparel Manufacturing (SIAM)	Incubation Centre in Apparel Manufacturing at Bhubaneshwar(SPINFED)	13.04	12.93	11(b):	Altogether, 23 e-commerce entities have been engaged for online marketing of handloom products.
