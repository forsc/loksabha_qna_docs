ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (f):	In order to provide social security benefits to the workers in the unorganised sector, including agricultural labourers, as per their eligibility, Government enacted the Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008. This Act stipulates formulation of suitable welfare schemes for unorganised workers on matters relating to: (i) life and disability cover, (ii) health and maternity benefits, (iii) old age protection and (iv) any other benefit as may be determined by the Central Government. Life and disability cover is provided through Pradhan  Mantri  Jeevan  Jyoti  Bima  Yojana  (PMJJBY)  and Pradhan Contd..2/-:: 2 ::Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) to the unorganised workers depending upon their eligibility. The health and maternity benefits are addressed through Ayushman Bharat scheme.  For old age protection in the form of monthly pension, Ministry of Labour & Employment has launched Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-Dhan Yojana launched on 05th March, 2019 which is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme for providing monthly minimum assured pension of Rs. 3,000/- on attaining the age of 60 years. The unorganised workers in the age group of 18-40 years whose monthly income is    Rs. 15,000/- or less and not a member of EPFO/ESIC/NPS can join the scheme. Under the scheme, 50% monthly contribution is payable by the beneficiary and equal matching contribution is paid by the Central Government. Further, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA), 2005 provide for the enhancement of livelihood security of the households in rural areas of the country by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is a demand driven wage employment programme. It provides livelihood security i.e., fall back option for livelihood for the rural households when no better employment opportunity is available. The demand for work is influenced by various factors such as rain-fall, availability of alternative and remunerative employment opportunities outside Mahatma Gandhi NREGS.******
