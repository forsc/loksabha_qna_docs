Out of balance habitations, 122 habitations have either been dropped or not feasible. Remaining 25 habitations are targeted to be connected by all weather roads at the earliest.Under 100-249 population size in LWE areas, against 188 eligible habitations, 90 habitations have already been provided road connectivity including 67 habitations under State scheme. Out of balance 98 habitations, 31 habitations are reportedly not feasible. The State Government has informed that the remaining 67 habitations are targeted to be connected at the earliest. *****
