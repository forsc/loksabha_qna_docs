                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		 	  (SHRI NARENDRA  SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (c):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 24   DUE FOR REPLY ON 20th JULY, 2021.(a):	PM-KISAN Scheme is a continuous and ongoing Scheme. Under the PM-KISAN Scheme benefits are transferred to eligible beneficiaries directly into their bank accounts as and when their correct and verified data is received from respective States/UTs Government on PM-KISAN web portal and its validation through Aadhaar/PFMS/Income Tax database. Thus, the data of eligible beneficiaries undergo various levels of verification and validation. Once the process of verification and validation is complete, the benefits of the Scheme are provided to the intended beneficiaries.   So far as, in the Satara district of Maharashtra, out of 5,47,512 registered farmers 5,29,800 beneficiaries have received  benefit of  PM-KISAN Scheme. (b): 	Various facilities through Farmers Corner of PM-KISAN portal and CSCs have been provided for the benefit of farmers through which they can get corrected their Aadhaar details and can also know about the status of benefit transferred. The State/UT Governments are continuously requested and vigorously pursued to organize publicity/awareness camps to ensure expeditious Aadhaar authentication of the data of the beneficiaries along with correction of already registered data. (c):	Many remedies are available to the farmers who have not been able to register themselves for benefit under PM-KISAN Scheme or who have been registered but not received the benefits so far. The State Governments have appointed nodal officers for the scheme at block, district and State level to whom the farmers can submit their grievances. Normally, District Agriculture Officers or the District Collectors are available to attend to their grievances. Contd…2/--2-The PM-KISAN portal is also utilized by farmers to lodge their grievances for their prompt redressal. An exclusive grievance mechanism “Help Desk” has been incorporated under the “farmers’ Corner” of the PM-KIsan Portal, through which the grievance of the farmer is directly transferred to the Nodal Officer concerned. Farmers can also register their grievances through Public Grievance portal along with sending their grievances directly to the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare. The Department ensures that the grievances of farmers are resolved in a time bound manner. To further help farmers in seeking redressal of their various grievances and replies to their various queries relating to the scheme a 24 x7 IVRS based help-line 155261/011-23381092 has also been set up. *******
