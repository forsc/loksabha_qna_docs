It helps in determining clear ownership of property by mapping of land parcels using drone technology with the collaborative efforts of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, State Revenue Department, State Panchayati Raj Department and Survey of India. Issue of Property Card leads to ease of securing bank loans, reducing property related disputes and comprehensive village level planning. It will also help in the determining of property tax by Gram Panchayats. The Scheme aims to cover all the villages across the country by 2025 with estimated cost of Rs. 566.23 crores. The State Governments can leverage the data/information generated through drone survey including the property cards in streamlining planning and collection of revenue in rural areas.
