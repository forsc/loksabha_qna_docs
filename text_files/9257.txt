ANSWER




                                                        (a)  to (b):	Disaster Management Act 2005, makes Disaster Risk Reduction a continuous and integrated process involving individuals, communities, government, non-government bodies, civil societies and other stakeholders in the entire cycle of Disaster Risk Management.National Policy for Disaster Management was framed in 2009. The objectives of the policy, inter alia, include mainstreaming disaster management into development planning.  A  National  Disaster  Management  Plan  has  also been drawn by National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in 2016, with the vision “Make India disaster resilient, achieve substantial disaster risk reduction, and significantly decrease the losses of life, livelihoods and assets – economic, physical, social, cultural, and environmental – by maximizing the ability to cope with disasters at all levels of administration as well as among communities”.Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) has brought out a series of Indian Standards for earthquake resistant design and construction of buildings. Further, the National Building Code of India 2016 (NBC), has necessary administrative and technical provisions for safety of structures against earthquakes and other hazards. Earthquake resistant codes and relevant provisions of NBC are required to be followed mandatorily for safety against earthquake hazards. Besides, the Vulnerability Atlas of India, brought out by Building Materials & Technology Promotion Council (BMTPC), gives State-wise hazard maps with respect to earthquakes, wind & cyclone and floods and district wise vulnerability of housing stocks, based on the materials used for walling and roofing of the building, as per the census data. The third edition of the Atlas based on latest available data and Census 2011 has also been brought out. A number of guidelines and manuals have been brought out on earthquake resistant design and construction of housing.                                         *****
