                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a) to (e):  A statement is laid on the Table of the HouseSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 373* FOR 13TH DECEMBER, 2019(a) to (e). Yes. As per the data of Registrar General of India (RGI), there is evidence of declining fertility, reduction in mortality and increasing survival at older ages. This has resulted in increase in the share of the population of elderly (more than 60 year of age) from 5.6 % (2.47 crore) in 1961 to 8.6% (10.38 crore) in 2011. Surveys of National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) indicate that burden of morbidity is high in old age and disabilities are frequent, affecting the functionality. In recognition of special health care needs of elderly and to provide dedicated health care facilities to the elderly population, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is implementing National Programme for Health Care of the Elderly (NPHCE) at various levels of primary, secondary and tertiary health care under which following facilities have been approved: -S. N	Institutions 	Sanctioned1 	National Centres of Ageing (NCAs)	22 	Regional Geriatric Centres (RGCs) 	193 	Dedicated services at District Hospital level. 	7134	Dedicated services at Community Health Centers. 	3430Other National Programmes such as programmes for control of Blindness, Deafness, Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), Mental health and Oral health also provide health care services to elderly. Health being a State subject, financial and technical support under the National Programmes is provided to States / UTs through the National Health Mission and tertiary care components, based on proposal received from them. However, responsibility for implementation lies with States/UTs, except in the case of NCA at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, which is a Central Government Institution. Further, elderly health care services are also covered in the expanded range of services under Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres.   Under the Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, which provides for health cover of Rs. 5 lakh per family per year to about 10.74 crore poor and vulnerable families as per Socio-Economic Caste Census data, there is no restriction on age or family size and all members of the entitled family, including elderly, are covered. ****
