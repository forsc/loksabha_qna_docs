ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE (SHRI PANKAJ CHAUDHARY)(a) to (d): India’s external debt, both in absolute terms as well as a ratio to GDP, has been modest over the years. The increase in India’s external debt between end-March 2017 and end-March 2021 was primarily due to an increase in commercial borrowings, non-resident deposits, short-term debt, multilateral debt and bilateral debt. The stock of external debt and its growth rate for last five years is given below at Table 1:Table 1: India’s External Debt At end-March 	External debt (US$ Billion)	Growth Rate (Per cent)	External Debt to GDP (Per cent)2017	471.0	-2.8	19.82018	529.3	12.4	20.12019 R	543.1	2.6	19.92020 PR	558.4	2.8	20.62021 P	570.0	2.1	21.1           Source: Reserve Bank of India and Department of Economic Affairs.           Note: R: Revised; PR: Partially Revised; P: Provisional.The deft and prudent external debt management policy of the Government of India has helped in containing rise in external debt and maintaining a comfortable external debt position. The policy focuses on monitoring long and short-term debt, raising sovereign loans on concessional terms with longer maturities, regulating external commercial borrowings and rationalizing interest rates on Non-Resident Indian deposits.*****
