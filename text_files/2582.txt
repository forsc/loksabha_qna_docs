ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (f): There are 23 Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and 31 National Institutes ofTechnology (NITs) functioning in the country. IITs follow flexible cadre system forappointment of faculty. Therefore, sanctioned strength of faculty at different grades, i.e.Professor, Associate Professor and Assistant Professor is not fixed and they are free to recruitany grade of faculty. For faculty posts in subjects other than Science & Technology, e.g.Humanities, Social Science and Management as well as non-faculty posts, reservation atstandard rate of 15%, 7½% and 27% for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) andOther Backward Classes (OBCs) respectively. At present, sanctioned strength of faculty in IITsis 8856, out of which 6043 are in position, while 2813 are vacant. Of the 6043 faculty inposition, 149 are from Scheduled Castes (SC) and 21 are from Scheduled Tribes (ST). The totalsanctioned strength of non-faculty in IITs is 9465, out of which 1125 posts are reserved for SCsand 520 for STs. Against this, 888 posts are filled by SCs and 275 by STs. All the IITsmaintain reservation roster.The NITs are following the reservation policy of Government of India according to which 15%seats are earmarked for SCs, 7.5% for STs, 27% for OBCs and 10% for Economically WeakerSections (EWSs) for recruitment to faculty (at the entry level posts) and non-faculty posts. Forfaculty recruitment, NITs also follow flexible cadre structure. At present, sanctioned strengthof faculty in NITs is 7413, out of which 721 are reserved for SCs and 380 are reserved for STs.Against this, 4202 faculty are in position, out of which, 404 are from SCs and 139 are from STs.The total sanctioned strength of non-faculty in NITs is 8163, out of which 1017 are reserved forSCs and 496 for STs. Against this, 3817 posts have been filled, out of which, 692 posts arefilled by SCs and 317 by STs. The post based roaster is maintained in all NITs.Occurring of vacancies and filling up is a continuous process. The onus of filling up the postslies on IITs/NITs, which are autonomous bodies, under Acts of Parliament. They have beenrequested to take steps to ensure that the vacancies are filled up at the earliest. IITs and NITsconduct special recruitment drives and advertisements for faculty and non-faculty posts onregular basis for filling up of vacant positions.There is no proposal to appoint students who have completed their Ph.D or M. Tech fromIITs/NITs/IIITs in these posts.*****
