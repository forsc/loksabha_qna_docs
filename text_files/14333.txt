ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (d): The Airports Authority of India (AAI), Implementing Agency under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) has awarded 688 valid routes to Selected Airline Operators (SAOs) after completion of three rounds of bidding. Till 5th March, 2020, 266 RCS routes have been operationalized. Out of these 688 valid routes, 47 valid routes (including Tourism RCS routes) have been awarded to SAOs in the State of Maharashtra. Out of them, 26 RCS routes have been operationalized in the State of Maharashtra. ;As per the Agreement, SAO is to start RCS operations within six months of signing the Agreement or within sixty days of readiness of airports, whichever is later. There is a delay in operationalizing some routes/discontinuation of the routes, for reasons which include: i)	Non-readiness of civil airports/heliports, which may be related to availability of land, creating regional infrastructure, compliances to the licensing requirements etc. ii)	 Delay in obtaining Scheduled Commuter Operators Permit by new entrant Airlines. iii)  Unsustainability of the operation on the awarded routes.
