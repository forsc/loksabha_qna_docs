Prices of LPG in the country are based on Saudi Contract Price (CP), the benchmark for international prices of LPG. Saudi CP has risen approximately 258% from April, 2020 to November, 2021 (236 USD/MT to 846 USD/MT). However, for domestic LPG the Government continues to modulate the effective price to consumer to insulate the common man from rise in international prices.Under the DBTL scheme, subsidy amount equal to the difference between Retail Selling Price (RSP) and subsidized price of the domestic cylinder is deposited in the account of eligible beneficiaries.The details of Retail Selling Price (RSP) of domestic LPG at Delhi since January 2020 are given as Annexure.	x-x-x-x-x
