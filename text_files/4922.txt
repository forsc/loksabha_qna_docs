                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (d):	Public health and hospitals being a State subject, the primary responsibility to ensure availability of doctors including in rural area, lies with the State Governments. Requirement of Doctors in public health sector in rural areas varies from state to state depending upon their policies and context. As per Rural Health Statistics (RHS) 2018, State/UT wise availability of doctors in rural areas of the country is given at Annexure-I.However, Under National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their healthcare systems including support for recruitment of doctors on contractual basis, based on the requirements posed by them in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) within their overall resource envelope. Under NHM, States are encouraged to adopt flexible norms for engaging specialist doctors   for public health facilities. These include various mechanisms for ‘contracting in’ and ‘contracting out’ of specialist services, methods of engaging specialists outside the government system for service delivery at public facilities, offering negotiable salaries to attract Specialists including flexibility in strategies such as ''You quote, we pay".  Financial support is also provided to States for providing performance-based incentives, hard area allowance, providing accommodation and transport facilities in rural and remote areas, sponsoring training programmes, etc for engaged human resources, to address the issue of shortage in the public health facilities.Also, States are advised to put in place transparent policies of posting and transfer, and ensure rational deployment of doctors. As the posts required for health facilities are filled up by respective State/UT Governments, they are impressed upon from time to time to fill up the vacant posts.   Also, as per NHM-MIS, State/UT wise status doctors recruited on contractual basis under NHM is given at Annexure-II.
