As informed by the Department of Agricultural Marketing and Agribusiness, Govt. of Tamil Nadu, the number of farmers in each mandi is not available. (b):	 No specific study has been conducted to assess whether e-NAM platform has helped farmers from Tamil Nadu.

This e-NAM concept further ensures various benefits like streamlining of procedures across the integrated markets, promotes real time price discovery based on actual demand and supply, removes information asymmetry between buyers and sellers, promotes transparency in auction process, promotes access to a nation-wide market for the farmer along with prices commensurate with quality of produce and online payment of sales proceeds.(c):	Various measures have been taken to register more number of farmers, some of which are as follows:-i.	Registration of farmers at mandi premisesii.	Online registration by farmers through e-NAM Portal. iii.

Toll-free number 1800-2700-224 to assist farmers including to help farmers in registration process.v.	Customer helpdesk support to resolve queries during and after registration process.vi.
