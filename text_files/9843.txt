ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM & NATURAL GAS(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a): The six sedimentary basins viz., Cambay, Godwana, Krishna-Godavari, Cauvery, Indo-Gangetic and Assam Arakan basins are considered prospective for Shale Gas.(b) & (c): Government issued Policy Guidelines for Exploration and Exploitation of Shale Gas and Oil by National Oil Companies under Nomination Regime on 14th October, 2013. Discovered Small Field (DSF) Policy of 2015 and Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) of 2016 also provide for exploration and exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbons including shale gas/oil in the acreages awarded under these Policies. Government has also notified the Policy Framework on 20th August, 2018 to permit exploration and exploitation of unconventional hydrocarbons such as shale oil/gas, Coal Bed Methane (CBM) etc. in the existing acreages of Production Sharing Contracts, CBM contracts as well as nomination fields to unlock the penitential of unconventional hydrocarbons. As unified licenses, allowing exploration and exploitation of all types of hydrocarbons are granted, separate auction of shale blocks is not felt necessary at this stage.*********
