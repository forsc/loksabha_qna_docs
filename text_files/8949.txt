Under PMAY-G, beneficiaries are identified from Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011 data, based on housing deprivation parameters, exclusion criteria prescribed and after due verification by Gram Sabha and following Appellate process. Accordingly, Gram Panchayat -wise Permanent Wait List (PWL) has been prepared.  As on 02.12.2019, the Permanent Wait List (PWL) contains 2.50 crores beneficiaries after the prescribed verification process.No applications from households are required under this scheme as beneficiaries are identified from the PWL.b) & c): Under PMAY-G, the target is construction of 2.95 crore pucca houses with basic amenities by the year 2022 in phases. The targets for Phase I (2016-17 to 2018-19) and Phase II (2019-20 to 2021-22) are construction of 1.00 crore and 1.95 crore houses respectively.
