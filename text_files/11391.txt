Ministry does not establish Mega Food Parks in the country on its own. The proposals under Mega Food Park Scheme for setting up of Mega Food Parks in the country are invited through Expression of Interest (EoI) from time to time. Selection of suitable proposals for these projects is done as per the Scheme guidelines, based on the merit, through a three tier stringent appraisal process as per the prefixed criteria. At present, Ministry has not invited any EoI for submission of proposals under the Scheme. As on date, there is no proposal under consideration to establish any new Mega Food Parks in Bihar, Gujarat and West Bengal under the Mega Food Park Scheme of the Ministry.*****
