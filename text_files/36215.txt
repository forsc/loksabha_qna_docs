                                                        THE MINISTER OF NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND POWER (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) to (c)  Street Light National program (SLNP) was launched by the Government in January 2015 to replace conventional street lights with smart and energy efficient LED street lights in the municipal sector across the country. Atal Jyoti Yojana (AJAY) Phase-II which provides for installation of solar street lights in remote, rural and semi-urban areas, was launched in December, 2018. Due to outbreak of COVID-19, the Government had decided not to operate Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) for two years i.e. for FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22. As AJAY Phase-II Scheme was partially funded through MPLADS, the Scheme was also closed w.e.f. 01.04.2020 for new sanctions.Till date, over Rs. 208 crore has been spent under the Scheme. State-wise details of funds spent is placed at Annexure. (d) to (g) As the Scheme was closed for new sanctions w.e.f. 01.04.2020, no new sanctions for installation of solar street lights be issued by EESL after this date. However, out of 1.5 lakh solar street lights sanctioned till 31.3.2020, 1.27 lakh lights have been reported installed till 28.2.2022.*****
