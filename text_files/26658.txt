ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a):	No exercise for identification of most backward blocks have been done by the Central Government as per information received from NITI Aayog, though it has advised and encouraged the States to use the template of the on-going Aspirational Districts Programme for identification and rapid development of backward blocks. NITI Aayog has also informed that as per information made available by the State Governments, Madhya Pradesh, UT of Jammu & Kashmir, Haryana, Tripura, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Nagaland have identified the backward blocks and indicators for monitoring them, based on the template of the Aspirational Districts Programme.  No such information is available with NITI Aayog about identification of most backward blocks in Odisha and monitoring of the progress in the State of Odisha.(b) & (c): No, Sir. Under the Aspirational Districts Programme of NITI Aayog, 10 districts of Odisha, namely Malkangiri, Kalahandi, Dhenkanal, Nuapada, Rayagada, Balangir, Gajapati, Kandhamal, Koraput and Nabrangpur are being regularly monitored on 49 Key Performance Indicators across 5 sectors, namely, Health & Nutrition, Education, Agriculture & Water Resources, Financial Inclusion & Skill Development and Basic Infrastructure. As of January 2021, all the 10 Aspirational Districts in Odisha have shown improvement in all sectors since the inception of the Programme. Since performance of a district is reflective of the performance of the blocks that constitute a district, development process in different blocks under Aspirational Districts have accelerated. 	Apart from this, Department of Rural Development is also implementing a number of schemes/ programmes viz. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM), Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDUGKY), Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETI) and Shyama Prasad Mukharjee Rurban Mission (SPMRM) for the development of Rural areas of the country including the backwards blocks of Odisha. *****
