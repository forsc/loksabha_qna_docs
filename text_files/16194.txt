ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT   (SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)    (a):   As per UDISE 2017-18 (Provisional), 72.80% of Government Primary Schools and 68.29% of  Government Upper Primary Schools comply with the norms of the provisions of Student Teacher Ratio mentioned in the Right to Education Act, 2009.  (b) to (f): The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 in its Schedule lays down Pupil-Teacher Ratio (PTR) for both primary and upper primary schools which are 30:1 and 35:1 respectively. Similarly, PTR at secondary level should be 30:1. As per UDISE 2017-18 (provisional), the PTR at national level for primary schools is 23:1, for upper primary schools is 25:1 and for Secondary level is 26:1 which is better than the prescribed norms. The recruitment of teachers is a continuous process and the vacancies keep arising due to retirement, enhanced students’ strength, setting up of new schools, etc.   The Central Government has launched an Integrated Centrally sponsored Scheme for School Education – Samagra Shiksha, from 2018-19 which subsumes the  erstwhile  centrally sponsored  schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). Under Samagra Shiksha, financial assistance is provided to States and UTs for various interventions such as universal access, quality of education, gender, equity, support for salary of teachers etc. as per prescribed norms. Central Government provides assistance to the State Governments and UTs for additional teachers to maintain appropriate Pupil Teacher Ratio as per the prescribed norms for various levels of schooling. The Central Government has been consistently pursuing the matter of expeditious recruitment and redeployment of teachers with the States and UTs at various fora.  *******
