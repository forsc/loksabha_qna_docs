                                                        (a) to (f)	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (f) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 120 TO BE ANSWERED ON 10.02.2020a.	Yes, the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing Skills Acquisition and Knowledge Awareness for Livelihood Promotion (SANKALP) Scheme throughout the country along with the loan granted by World Bank.b.	The governance structure of the SANKALP Scheme provides for a Project Governance Board (PGB) at the apex level to review the progress of the project periodically and issue directions.The meeting of the PGB was held in August 2019 wherein the Board expressed its satisfaction on the overall progress of the project. Further, the performance of the scheme is also assessed by the World Bank on a periodic basis. The overall implementation progress for SANKALP has been graded “Satisfactory” as per the World Bank’s latest assessment report.c.	Since inception till date, an amount of Rs 225.42 crore has been sanctioned to the State/ UTs under SANKALP. Out of these, Rs 213.72 crore have been released to 23 States as State Incentive Grants while Rs 11.70 crore have been released to strengthen the skill ecosystem of117 Aspirational Districts of 28 States. The details of the funds sanctioned State/ UT wise are at Annexure-1.d.	As per the project design, seven Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) have been agreed between Government of India and the World Bank. Further, as per requirement of the World Bank, an Independent Verification Agency (IVA) i.e. Indian Institute of Management, Indore (IIM-Indore) has been onboarded to verify the achievement against these DLIs. Till date, IVA has submitted the verification report for successful achievement of targets for 5 DLIs that have been further submitted to the World Bank.e.	SANKALP is not a training scheme therefore no trainings are provided under SANKALP.f.	The following major steps/ initiatives have been undertaken under SANKALP with a focus on strengthening the District level training eco-system:(i)	Mahatma Gandhi National Fellowship (MGNF): MGNF has been launched to support the District administration in improving skill development program delivery as well as developing a cadre of committed and competent development leaders. As a pilot, 75 fellows shall be deputed in 75 districts across Gujarat, Karnataka, Meghalaya, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand for a span of two years.(ii)	Award for Excellence in District Skill Development Planning (DSDP): To promote and recognize decentralised planning, District Skill Development Plan (DSDP) Awards have been constituted by the Ministry under SANKALP. The award was launched in FY 2018-19, wherein districts across all States/ UTs were invited to participate. 225 districts from across the country participated by submitting their DSDPs out of which seven districts were identified for Awards in the category of Awards for Excellence.(iii)	Capacity building Workshops: To build the capacity of the District Skill Committee (DSC) members and the district functionary, thematic workshops are being conducted under SANKALP.  Till date workshops have been held with DSC members of Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Nagaland, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh for development of District Skill Development Plans (DSDPs).
