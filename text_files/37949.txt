ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF CULTURE, TOURISM AND DEVELOPMENT OF NORTH EASTERN REGION (SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) & (b)	To protect and promote Indian cultural heritage and values among the youth, the Govt. of India has set up seven Zonal Cultural Centres (ZCCs). These ZCCs organize various cultural activities and programmes on regular basis throughout the country for which annual grant-in-aid is provided to all the seven ZCCs. Folk artists from different parts of the country are engaged by all the ZCCs to participate in these programmes for promotion of India’s cultural heritage. Details of annual grant-in-aid released to these ZCCs during the last years are as under:-                (Rs. in lakh)Sl. No. Year	Funds Released/ Spenti.	2018-19	5952.69ii.	2019-20	5732.95iii.	2020-21	4009.38	Besides, the Ministry of Culture also organizes Rashtriya Sanskriti Mahotsavs (RSMs) in various parts of the country to make the youth of the country aware about the cultural heritage and values of Indian culture. This Mahotsav plays a great role of representing each and every dimension of our cultural tradition and showcasing it to the country and its people including youth. (c) & (d)	Bihar (Darbhanga) is the member State of Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC), Kolkata and North Central Zone Cultural Centre (NCZCC), Prayagraj and these two ZCCs cater to the cultural needs of Bihar satisfactorily. Thus as of now no such proposal of starting a cultural centre at Darbhanga is under consideration.
