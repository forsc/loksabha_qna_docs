So far, against the validated demand of 112 lakh houses; 103 lakh houses have been sanctioned under various verticals of PMAY-U Mission. Out of 103 lakh houses sanctioned, 60.51 lakh houses are grounded, 32 lakh houses are completed/delivered. (b) & (c) MoHUA is facilitating the adoption of modern, innovative and green technologies and building materials for faster and quality construction of houses under Technology Sub-Mission component of PMAY-U Mission.Building Materials and Technology Promotion Council (BMTPC), an autonomous organization under the aegis of MoHUA is mandated to identify, evaluate and promote emerging construction systems suiting to different geo-climatic conditions of the country, which are safe, sustainable and environment-friendly and ensure cost effective and faster delivery of quality houses. BMTPC has evaluated and certified 36 new housing systems/technologies under Performance Appraisal Certification Scheme (PACS).  Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has issued Schedule of Rates (SoRs) for 29 innovative and alternate technologies.  In order to showcase the field application of new emerging technologies which are cost effective and speedy construction, MoHUA has taken an initiative to construct Demonstration Housing Projects under PMAY-U Mission through BMTPC in various States/UTs. MoHUA has launched Global Housing Technology Challenge - India (GHTC-India) to enable a paradigm shift in the construction sector for affordable housing in the country through a global challenge, which aims to identify and mainstream a basket of innovative construction technologies from across the globe for housing construction sector that are sustainable, eco-friendly, cost effective, speedier and disaster-resilient. As a part of GHTC-India, six Light House Projects have been taken up through open bidding process for construction of about 1000 houses along with associated services each at six locations in six States by using six distinct housing construction technologies out of 54 innovative construction technologies identified through GHTC-India.                                             *****
