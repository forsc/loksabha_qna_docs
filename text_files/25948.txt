ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) & (b)  Floods are natural calamity that the country faces almost every year, in varying degrees of magnitude. The occurrence of floods can be attributed to various factors, including wide variations in rainfall both in time and space with frequent departures from the normal pattern, inadequate carrying capacities of rivers, river bank erosion and silting of river beds, landslides, poor natural drainage in flood prone areas, snowmelt and glacial lake out-bursts. Flood management schemes are formulated and implemented by concerned State Governments as per their priority. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and also promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. The Government of India has been making continuous efforts to assist the State Governments in effective flood management. During XI Plan Government of India had launched Flood Management Programme (FMP) for providing Central Assistance to States for works related to flood management and erosion control which continued during XII Plan and thereafter, as a component of "Flood Management and Border Areas Programme" (FMBAP) for the period from 2017-18 to 2020-21. Central Assistance to the tune of Rs.924.41 Crores has been provided to State of Bihar up to March 2021 under FMP component of this Programme. Main reason for floods in the State of Bihar is on account of increased discharge in rivers of North Bihar like Gandak, Burhi Gandak, Bagmati, Kamla, Kosi and Mahananda due to heavy rainfall in the upper catchment areas which mainly lie in Nepal. The management of floods due to these rivers has been a concern. The related issues are discussed in the existing Indo-Nepal bilateral mechanisms comprising of (i) Joint  Ministerial  Level  Commission  on  Water  Resources  (JMCWR)  (ii)  Joint  Committee  on  Water Resources (JCWR) (iii) Joint Standing Technical Committee (JSTC), (iv) Joint Committee on Gandak & Kosi Projects (JCKGP) and  (v) Joint Committee on Inundation and Flood Management (JCIFM). Government of India is having regular dialogue with the Government of Nepal for construction of dams on these rivers for mutual benefit of the two countries which includes flood control.          As far as non structural measures of flood management are concerned, Central Water Commission (CWC) is the nodal Organisation entrusted with the task of flood forecasting & early flood warnings in the country. Presently, CWC issues flood forecasts for 328 forecasting stations (190 river level forecast stations & 138 dam/ barrage inflow forecast stations). These stations cover 20 major river basins in 23 States & 2 Union Territories. Out of these 328 stations, 43 stations (3-inflow & 40 level forecast) are located in Bihar. Performance of Flood Forecasting Stations in India during Flood Season 2020 is attached at Annexure-I.*****ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) & (b) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1808 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 29.07.2021 REGARDING “FLOODS IN BIHAR”Performance of Flood Forecasting Stations (State-wise) in India during Flood Season 2020 Sl.No	Name of the Major River basin	Total no.of FF sites	No.of FF sites where no forecast was issued	Level Forecasts	Inflow Forecasts	Overall Forecasts		Total no	Level FF sites	Inflow FF sites	Total no	Level FF sites	Inflow FF sites	Total No.	Within limits	Accuracy (%)	Total No.	Within limits	Accuracy (%)	Total No.	Within limits	Accuracy (%)1	Andhra Pradesh	20	10	10	3	1	2	97	81	83.51	659	608	92.26	756	689	91.142	Arunachal Pradesh	3	3	0	2	2	0	130	129	99.23	0	0	-	130	129	99.233	Assam	30	30	0	3	3	0	3094	3081	99.58	0	0	-	3094	3081	99.584	Bihar	43	40	3	6	5	1	3213	3192	99.35	10	0	0.00	3223	3192	99.045	Chattisgarh	3	1	2	0	0	0	6	5	83.33	11	9	81.82	17	14	82.356	Daman n Diu	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	-	0	0	-	0	0	-7	Gujarat	13	6	7	5	3	2	29	29	100.00	155	151	97.42	184	180	97.838	Haryana	2	1	1	2	1	1	0	0	-	0	0	-	0	0	-9	Himachal Pradesh	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	-	0	0	-	0	0	-10	Jammu & Kashmir	3	3	0	3	3	0	0	0	-	0	0	-	0	0	-11	Jharkhand	17	2	15	10	1	9	90	90	100.00	274	249	90.88	364	339	93.1312	Karnataka	15	1	14	1	0	1	13	10	76.92	870	783	90.00	883	793	89.8113	Kerala	5	3	2	1	1	0	15	15	100.00	19	11	57.89	34	26	76.4714	Madhya Pradesh	12	2	10	0	0	0	52	52	100.00	183	138	75.41	235	190	80.8515	Maharashtra	21	8	13	12	6	6	25	25	100.00	128	111	86.72	153	136	88.8916	NCT, DELHI	2	2	0	2	2	0	0	0	-	0	0	-	0	0	-17	Odisha	19	12	7	5	0	5	155	135	87.10	111	104	93.69	266	239	89.8518	Rajasthan	14	3	11	4	1	3	10	9	90.00	49	23	46.94	59	32	54.2419	Sikkim	8	3	5	8	3	5	0	0	-	0	0	-	0	0	-20	Tamilnadu	15	4	11	8	4	4	0	0	-	445	370	83.15	445	370	83.1521	Telangana	13	5	8	2	1	1	44	40	90.91	291	270	92.78	335	310	92.5422	Tripura	2	2	0	2	2	0	0	0	-	0	0	-	0	0	-23	Uttar Pradesh	44	39	5	22	22	0	803	800	99.63	108	80	74.07	911	880	96.6024	Uttarakhand	6	4	2	2	1	1	15	14	93.33	7	7	100.00	22	21	95.4525	West Bengal	16	12	4	6	5	1	452	426	94.25	158	151	95.57	610	577	94.59Total	328	198	130	111	69	42	8243	8133	98.67	3478	3065	88.13	11721	11198	95.54*****
