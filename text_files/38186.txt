                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE(SHRI PANKAJ CHAUDHARY) (a) and (b): Yes sir, Hon’ble Prime Minister had announced a special package of Rs. 1.25 lakh crore for all round development of the State of Bihar on 18th August, 2015. Prime Minister’s Package for Bihar-2015 focuses on sectoral development in the areas namely Roads, Rural Development, Petroleum and Natural Gas, Civil Aviation, Higher Education, Skill Development, Agriculture, Railways, Power, Communication, Tourism and Health. Accordingly, concerned Ministries/Departments have been designated to implement the package as per the sectoral components. Ministry of Finance has released an amount of Rs.11284.0685 crore towards residual liabilities of Special Plan for Bihar (BRGF-State component) now part of PM’s Package for Bihar-2015. (c): The Union Government has launched a Scheme of Special Assistance to States for Capital Expenditure under which 50 years’ interest free loan was provided to States. Under the Scheme, an amount of Rs. 843.00 crore in 2020-21 and Rs. 1246.50 crore in 2021-22 was released to the State of Bihar. (d): The National Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) for the States released by NITI Aayog is based on the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index published by the UNDP. In this index, three dimensions - health, education, standard of living have been taken. The main objective of the MPI is to provide an analytical tool to the States to promote competitive spirit for poverty alleviation. As per the National Multidimensional Poverty Index Baseline Report published by NITI Aayog, the percentage of population who are multi dimensionally poor in Bihar is 51.91%. (e): In respect of devolution of funds, the 15th Finance Commission had recommended horizontal tax devolution based on principles of need, equity and efficiency. The devolution of taxes and duties to the State of Bihar in 2020-21 was Rs. 59,861.41 crore, which has gone up to Rs. 86,570.97 crore (as on 24.03.2022) in 2021-22.                                                                                             ******
