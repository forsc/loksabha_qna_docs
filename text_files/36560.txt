                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS [SMT. MEENAKASHI LEKHI](a) & (e) 	The conflict in Ukraine placed the Indian community in Ukraine in direct danger. As a result of our advisories and Operation Ganga, around 22500 Indian citizens have returned to India safely since February 2022.Many countries have imposed sanctions on Russia due to the conflict. These are expected to have an impact on the global economy, including through disruption of supply chains. Its impact on energy and commodity prices is already visible. We are in the process of analysing its impact on India-Russia bilateral trade and economic cooperation, in consultation with all stakeholders. India’s relations with Russia stand on their own merit.The unfolding developments in Ukraine have simultaneously played out in the United Nations, in particular the Security Council, where India is presently serving as a non-permanent member. We have expressed deep concern at the worsening situation and called for immediate cessation of violence and end to all hostilities. Our statements at the Security Council and the General Assembly have urged an urgent ceasefire and ensuring safe passage for stranded civilians. We have also highlighted the humanitarian assistance extended by India to Ukraine and its neighbours at this hour of crisis.We have reiterated at the highest levels of our leadership to all parties concerned that there is no other choice but the path of diplomacy and dialogue. We have emphasized to all member States of the UN that the global order is anchored on international law, UN Charter and respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty of states.(b)	The details of trade between India and Russia/Ukraine during the last five years in US$ million are as below –<pre>YEARSRUSSIAUKRAINEEXPORTSIMPORTSTOTAL TRADEEXPORTSIMPORTSTOTAL TRADE2017-20182,113.408,573.4610,686.86330.102,355.972,686.072018-20192,389.625,840.448,230.06390.82,341.032,731.822019-20203,017.757,093.0110,110.76463.812,060.792,524.602020-20212,655.845,485.758,141.58450.972,139.862,590.83April-January 2022 (P)2,854.577,972.1210,826.69426.782,444.912,871.69</pre>(Source: DGCI&S)(c)  The details of FDI flow between Russia/ Ukraine and India during the last five years are as below:<pre>Sl NoYearRussia (FDIin US$ million)Ukraine (FDIin US$ million)12016-17Apr-Mar11.000.6222017-1836.001.6332018-193.810.0042019-2017.250.0052020-212.672.0962021-22 (Apr-Dec)5.100.63Grand Total75.834.96</pre>(Source: DPIIT)(d)	Around 22500 Indian nationals, mostly students, returned from Ukraine since 1 February 2022 (till date).
