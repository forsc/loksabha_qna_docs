ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c) There is no proposal for privatization of Indian Railways. It is estimated that Indian Railways would need Capital investment of around     ? 50 lakh crore upto 2030 for network expansion and capacity augmentation, rolling stock induction and other modernization works to enable better delivery of passenger and freight services and to improve its modal share in transport. To bridge the gap in capital funding and to induct modern technologies and improve efficiencies, it is being planned to use Public Private Partnership (PPP) model for few initiatives.One of the PPP initiatives is to invite partners to invest and induct modern rakes over select routes to provide world class services to the passengers. As part of this initiative, Ministry of Railways have issued 12 Requests for Qualification (RFQs) on 1st July, 2020 for operation of passenger trains over approximately 109 origin-destination pairs (divided into 12 clusters) through PPP on Design, Build, Finance and Operate (“DBFO”) basis. The routes identified for operation of services in PPP mode are spread across the entire Railway network. These routes are available in the public domain namely   http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/IndicativeRoutesfor12clusters.pdf. Under this PPP model the private operator will collect fare and specified non-fare revenues from passengers in consideration of the services, as per Concession Agreement. The likely revenue to be generated can be estimated upon completion of the bidding process.(d)  to (f) Both the recognized Federations, namely, All India Railway men’s Federation (AIRF) and National Federation of Indian Railway men’s (NFIR) have initially represented against the decision to permit operation of passenger trains by private train operators. Thereafter, several meetings have been held with the Federations to explain the rationale behind this PPP initiative.There is no proposal for privatization of railway routes. The existing passenger train services shall not be affected by the operation of passenger train services in PPP mode. These services to be operated in PPP mode shall be additional trains and aimed at increasing the availability of train services to the public. In order to protect the interest of the employees, it has been decided that the Crew (Drivers and Guards) required for operation of these trains shall be provided by Indian Railways.*****
