                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH  GOYAL) (a) and (b) Indian Railways, which carry approximately 23 million passengers to different parts of the country on a daily basis, neither operate trains nor maintain statistics of passenger traffic on State-wise basis as Railway network straddles across State boundaries.  However, to cater to the needs of the passengers, Indian Railways introduce new trains, subject to operational feasibility, traffic demand, availability of resources etc. This is an on-going and continuous process. Accordingly, 12 pairs of Mail/Express and passenger trains have been introduced during 2014-2019, serving the stations located in the State of  Kerala on originating/terminating basis.*****
