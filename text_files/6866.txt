                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.566 BY SHRI MALOOK NAGAR TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 20.11.2019 REGARDING ROB IN BIJNAUR(a) to (d): Level Crossing at Nagina (LC No. 471) falls on National Highway (NH). As per Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between Ministry of Railways and Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) on  10.11.2014, MoRTH/ National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) will replace all Level Crossings (LCs) on NH corridors by ROBs/ Road under Bridges (RUBs) at their own cost on single entity basis.    There are two LCs at town Chandpur i.e. LC No. 26 at Km 34/10-11 & LC No. 27 at Km 35/09-10. These LCs qualify for their replacement by Road over Bridge (ROB) on cost-sharing basis with State Government as traffic density is more than one lakh Traffic Vehicle Unit (TVU).   Accordingly, State Government has been approached to submit the formal proposal for construction of ROB at these locations alongwith necessary consents for sharing of cost and closure of LC. Despite regular chasing from Zonal Railway at Chief Secretary level, no response has been received from State Government. *****
