ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (d):	Detection and deportation of illegal immigrants is a continuous process. Central Government is vested with powers under Section 3(2)(c) of The Foreigners Act, 1946 to deport foreign nationals staying illegally in the country. These powers to detect, detain and deport illegally staying foreign nationals have been entrusted under Article 258 (1) of the Constitution of India to the State Governments. Further, under Article 239 (1) of the Constitution of India, the Administrators of the Union Territories have   also   been   directed   to   discharge   the   functions  of the Central -2-L.S.US.Q.NO.561 FOR 25.06.2019Government relating to detection, detention and deportation of illegally staying foreign nationals. These powers also stand delegated to the officials of Bureau of Immigration (BoI). Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has also held a number of meetings and Video Conferences at various levels and has impressed upon the State Governments and other stakeholders to identify illegal migrants including Rohingyas, watch their movements and cancel any Indian documents such as PAN Cards, Aadhar Cards, Driving Licenses, Ration Cards etc. fraudulently obtained by them. Consolidated instructions regarding deportation/ repatriation of foreign nationals have been issued, vide MHA letter No. 25022/19/2014-F.I dated 24.04.2014. Further advisories have been issued to the State Governments/ UT Administrations regarding identification of illegal migrants and monitoring thereof, vide MHA letter No. 24013/29/Misc./2017-CSR.III(i) dated 08.07.2017 and No. 25022/63/2017-F.IV dated 28.02.2018. Government has also taken up the issue of Rohingya migrants with the Government of Myanmar. It has emphasized the need for safe, speedy and sustainable return of these displaced persons.Since illegal immigrants enter into the country without valid travel documents in clandestine and surreptitious manner, there is no accurate data regarding number of such migrants living in the country.*******
