In addition 214 Day Care Centres for Chemotherapy have also been set up. Under the population based screening taken up under the programme, people over 30 years of age are being screened for common NCDs including three common cancers, namely breast, oral and cervical.(b) & (c):	As per National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP) of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the estimated number of incidence, mortality and prevalence of cancer cases reported in India during the last three years is as below:Year	2016	2017	2018Estimated Incidence of cancer cases	14,51,417	15,17,426	15,86,571Estimated Mortality of cancer cases	7,32,921	7,66,348	8,01,374Estimated Prevalence of cancer cases	39,91,405	41,72,923	43,63,083Highest number of incidence of cancer cases is in Uttar Pradesh followed by Bihar and Maharashtra.(d) & (e):	To enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer, the Central Government is implementing Strengthening of Tertiary Care for Cancer Scheme, under which setting up of 19 State Cancer Institutes (SCI) and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres (TCCC) have been approved.
