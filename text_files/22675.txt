ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS & SPORTS { SHRI KIREN RIJIJU }(a) The ‘Khelo India – National Programme for Development of Sports’ was launched in October, 2017 with the twin objectives of mass participation and promotion of excellence in sports across the country and twelve verticals, namely, Play Field Development; Utilization and Creation/ Upgradation of Sports Infrastructure; Sports for Peace and Development; State Level Khelo India Centres; Annual Sports Competitions; Talent Search and Development; Support to National/Regional/State Sports Academies; Sports for Women; Promotion of Sports among persons with disabilities; Promotion of rural and indigenous/tribal games; Physical Fitness of School going Children; and Community Coaching Development.(b) Khelo India Scheme is a demand driven scheme wherein funds are not allocated State/UT-wise. The details of funds sanctioned/released under the Khelo India Scheme for development of sports in Tamil Nadu during the last three years are as under:-(Amount in ? crore)<pre>S. No.	Year	Funds sanctioned/released1	2017-18	14.202	2018-19	10.053	2019-20	15.34  </pre>(c) and (d) Yes, Sir.  Under the ‘State Level Khelo India Centres’ vertical of Khelo India Scheme, this Ministry has decided to upgrade one existing centre in each state and designate it as Khelo India State Centre of Excellence (KISCE). The approved KISCE will be provided financial support for sports science, sports equipment, coaches and support staff etc. based on viability gap assessment. At present 24 KISCEs have been notified in 23 States/Union Territories, including Maharashtra, as detailed in Annexure. As of now, no KISCE has been notified in Tamil Nadu. (e) Due to involvement of various stakeholders it would not be possible to ascertain the time by which such centres are likely to be established in Tamil Nadu.(f) ‘Sports’ being a State subject, the responsibility of developing grass root level sports infrastructure as well as creating facilities for sporting excellence rests with the respective State/Union Territory Governments. The Union Government supplements their efforts by bridging the critical gaps. Under the ‘Utilisation and creation/upgradation of sports infrastructure’ vertical of the Khelo India Scheme, this Ministry has sanctioned ? 1714.00 crore to various State/UT governments and other eligible entities for creation/upgradation of basic sports infrastructure since 2016-17. Further, under the erstwhile Urban Sports Infrastructure Scheme also this Ministry has sanctioned ? 342.89 crore to various State/UT governments and other eligible entities for creation/upgradation of basic sports infrastructure during 2010-11 to 2015-16.****
