In June 2020, a representation was also received from an Hon’ble MP calling for banning/boycotting of all Chinese goods in light of developments at Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh.(d): 	The Government of India, from time to time, takes appropriate measures to regulate import of goods including those related to national interest.  India and China, are both members of the WTO, and any trade restriction imposed must be WTO compliant.  Government has from time to time reviewed and taken WTO compliant measures (both policy and trade remedies) to address the concerns raised by various stakeholders to have a holistic global trade strategy.  To support and expand domestic capacities, Government has implemented policies to promote domestic manufacturing like the production linked incentive (PLI) schemes in line with Atmanirbhar Bharat policy.****
