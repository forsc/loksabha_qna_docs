                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) 	Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in association with the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) monitors the water quality of rivers on a regular basis. As per a report published by CPCB in September 2018, out of total 351 polluted river stretches in the country, following 06 polluted river stretches have been identified in Tamil Nadu, based on the Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) level, a key indicator of organic pollution. Sl. No.	River	Identified  Polluted Stretches1.	Cauvery	Meetur to Mayiladuthurai2.	Sarabanga	Thathayampatti to T. Konagapadi3.	Thirumanimuthar	Salem to Papparapatti4.	Vasista	Manivilundhan to Thiyaganur5.	Bhavani	Sirumugai to Kalingarayan6.	Tambirapani	Pappankulam ToarumuganeriWith regard to wetlands & lakes, total 180 wetlands including lakes have been prioritized for conservation and management under National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-systems (NPCA). Out of these, 2 lakes (Ooty Lake & Kodaikanal lake) and 3 wetlands (Point Calimere, Kalivele & Pallai Karnai) have been prioritized for Tamil Nadu. (b) & (c) 	Project proposals are received from the State Governments from time to time for taking up pollution abatement works in towns along various rivers, and are considered for financial assistance under the National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) subject to their conformity with the scheme guidelines, pollution status, prioritization, appraisal by independent institutions and availability of Plan funds. NRCP (excluding Ganga and its tributaries which is handled by Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation from 01/08/2014 onwards) has covered polluted stretches of 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States at a sanctioned cost of Rs. 5870.55 crore including State of Tamil Nadu amounting to Rs. 908.13 crore. So far, Central Share of Rs. 2378.73 crore has been released to the State Governments for implementation of various pollution abatement schemes and sewage treatment capacity of 2522.03 million litres per day (mld) has been created of which 477.66 mld in Tamil Nadu. State-wise details of funds released to various State Governments during the last three years and current year (till 30.6.2018) under NRCP are at Annexure I.   	State Government, apart from their own budgetary allocation, are also accessing financial assistance for creation of sewerage infrastructure, including sewage treatment plants, in various cities/ towns under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) programme of Ministry of Urban Development and the Namami Gange programme (under NGRBA) of MoWR, RD&GR. To ensure  proper treatment of municipal sewage before discharge into the rivers, CPCB has issued directions under Section 18 1(b) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 in April, 2015 to all the SPCBs/Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) in the country, including Tamil Nadu, regarding setting up of sewage treatment plants in their respective States. CPCB has also issued directions in October, 2015 to municipal authorities of 184 towns (66 metropolitan cities and State capitals + towns along Ganga) under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for proper treatment and disposal of sewage generated to control pollution in rivers. Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC) is currently implementing a centrally sponsored scheme named NPCA for conservation and management of wetlands (including lakes) in the country on cost sharing basis between Central Government and respective State Governments. The scheme covers various activities such as interception, diversion and treatment of wastewater, shoreline protection, lake front development, in-situ cleaning i.e. desilting & deweeding, storm water management, bioremediation, catchment area treatment, lake beautification, survey & demarcation, biofencing, fisheries development, weed control, biodiversity conservation, education and awareness creation, community participation, etc.For more effective conservation and management of wetlands in the country, the Central Government in consultation with the States, Union Territories, Central line Ministries and other stakeholders, have notified the Wetlands (Conservation & Management) Rules, 2017 superseding the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2010. As per the Wetlands Rules-2017, certain activities are prohibited under the provision 4(2), which are applicable to wetlands notified by the Central Government, State Government and Union Territory Administration and to wetlands categorized as ''wetlands of international importance'' under the Ramsar Convention. The fund released during last three years and current year for conservation activities including pollution abatement in the lakes and wetlands is in Annexure II. (d) & (e) In Original Application (O.A) No. 673 / 2018 Hon’ble National Green Tribunal (NGT), Principal Bench has passed an order on 20.09.2018 directing all the States and Union Territories (UTs) to prepare action plans for bringing all the polluted river stretches up to the bathing standards. The ‘River Rejuvenation Committee’ (RRC) constituted by the concerned State Government and Union Territories have been tasked to prepare and finalize the action plans.
