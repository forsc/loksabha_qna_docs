This Act has now been subsumed in the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSH) Code, 2020.   The OSH Code alongwith the other three codes  provide for decent working conditions, minimum wages, grievances redressal mechanisms, protection from abuse and exploitation, enhancement of the skills and social security to all category of organised and unorganised workers including migrant workers.   (d):		A robust security and intelligence grid is in place to prevent any terrorist attacks on migrant labourers in Jammu & Kashmir. In addition, day & night area domination, patrolling and proactive operations against terrorists are being carried out in the areas where migrant labourers work/reside. Besides, round the clock checking at Nakas, Road opening Parties are being adequately augmented at strategic points to thwart any terrorist attack on migrant labourers in Kashmir.*******
