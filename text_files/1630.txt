ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b): Under Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution, the Government is required tomake special provisions for protecting the rights of Scheduled Castes (SCs), ScheduledTribes (STs), Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) for safeguarding theirinterests.Vide order dated 07.04.2017 in W.P. No.43260 of 2016, Hon’ble Allahabad HighCourt had directed that the reservation rosters should be prepared considering theDepartment/Subject as a unit instead of the University as a whole. Implementation of thisjudgement would have amounted to grave miscarriage of justice for the SCs/STs andOBCs. Hence, SLP Nos. 14318 dated 16.04.2018 and 14099 dated 12.4.2018 were filedby Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) and University GrantsCommission (UGC) respectively in the Hon’ble Supreme Court. These SLPs weredismissed on 22.01.2019. Subsequently both MHRD and UGC had filed review petitions,which were dismissed on 27.02.2019.(c): The details of the appointment made till 01.04.2019 in the Central Universities areavailable at https://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/4526671_LSPQ-No-1536-Annexure-1-TEACHING-POSITIONIN-CU-AS-ON-01-04-2019.pdf.(d) & (e): Directives were issued by the University Grants Commission on 19.7.2018, tothe Universities to postpone the recruitment process, if it is already underway, till furtherorders.Subsequently based upon the analysis of the result of preparing the roster byconsidering the Department/ College as a unit and dismissal of the review petition, toprotect the rights of the SCs, STs and SEBCs, the Central Educational Institutions(Reservation in Teachers’ Cadre) Ordinance, 2019 was promulgated on 7th March, 2019by the Hon’ble President to ensure preparation of the reservation roster considering theUniversity/ Department as a Unit. On 7th March, 2019, the Ministry of Human ResourceDevelopment has issued directives to the University Grants Commission to start therecruitment with immediate effect. The University Grants Commission has reiterated theinstructions to all the University on 8th March, 2019 to implement the reservation of postsin direct recruitment by considering the University/ Colleges/ Institution as one unit.The Notice for replacement of the Ordinance by the Bill has already been given inthe Lok Sabha.(f) & (g): An analysis was done of the impact of changing the roster from the university tothe department in 21 Central Universities. The study conducted by the UGC show thatthe implementation of the reservation policy by taking each department as a unit willimpede the chances of fair selection of SCs/STs as well as SEBCs and seats will reducedrastically in the cadre of Assistant Professors to even nil in some cadres. In order tosafeguard the interest of these categories, an Ordinance was promulgated on 7th March,2019 which is now placed for replacement as a Bill.*****
