ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS(DR. SUBRAHMANYAM JAISHANKAR)(a)  to (d)	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (A) TO (D) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *313 REGARDING “PSKS IN ASSAM” TO BE ANSWERED ON 17.03.2021(a)	One Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) and fifteen Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs) are functioning in Assam. The list of PSK and POPSKs in Assam is placed at Annexure-I. (b) to (d) 	The opening of Passport Seva Kendras in various States, including Assam is an on-going activity and depends on various factors, including distance from the existing Passport Seva Kendras and volume of applications from a particular region. The Ministry in association with the Department of Posts decided in January 2017 to open Passport Kendras at the Head Post Offices (HPO)/ Post Offices (PO) in the country called ‘POPSK’ in every Lok Sabha Constituency, where there is no PSK to ensure that there is at least one PSK or a POPSK available in every Lok Sabha Constituency. 	At present, Passport Office at Guwahati, a PSK at Guwahati and 15 POPSKs are functioning in Assam. Passport services are available in all the Lok Sabha Constituencies of the State of Assam. Currently, an average of 1050 appointments for passport services are being released every day for applicants in Assam, of which, only around 300 appointments are being availed of by applicants. As such, there is no additional demand for passport services, which necessitate the opening of new PSK in the State. However, the Ministry will consider adding new outlets, as and when demand increases. ***
