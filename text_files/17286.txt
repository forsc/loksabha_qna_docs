Besides, the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 recourse to ADR can be taken under Companies Act, 2013, Commercial Courts Act, 2015, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, to name a few. By recourse to ADR mechanism provided under law, the parties can resolve their dispute outside the Courts.As regards commercial disputes, where both parties are Government/Department or where one party is Government/Department and other is its instrumentalities (CPSEs/Boards/Authorities, etc.), the Department of Legal Affairs has issued a guideline namely, “Administrative Mechanism for Resolution of Disputes (AMRD)”.
