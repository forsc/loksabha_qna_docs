ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a)	At present, 35 Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) and 9 Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) functioning in the State of Telangana. District wise details are given in Annexure-I.(b) & (c) Opening of new KVs is a continuous process. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations, committing resources, including land, temporary accommodation etc. as per prescribed norms of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities for opening of new KVs complete in all respects have to compete with other proposals under the “Challenge Method”.   The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one JNV in each district of the country. Opening of new JNVs is a continuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government/UT administration to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of the permanent building and making available required temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV depends on the availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority. (d)	KVS and Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) have informed that 8174 teaching posts & 5460 non-teaching posts in KVs and 3174 teaching posts & 1880 non-teaching posts in JNVs are lying vacant. The State/UT wise details are given in Annexure-II.(e)	KVs and JNVs are affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and as per the CBSE bye-laws, optimum number of students in each section shall be 40 (forty). The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 also specifies that the student-teacher ratio should be 30:1 for classes I to V and 35:1 for the classes VI to VIII. KVS and NVS have informed that the students-teacher ratio in the KVs and JNVs presently functional in Telangana are 33:1 and 19:1 respectively. (f)	 Grant-in-aid is released to KVS and NVS under the three distinct heads viz., Salaries, General and Creation of Capital Assets. This allocation of funds is made on a consolidated basis and not State/Union Territory-wise. However, the details of expenditure incurred by KVS and NVS during the last ten years to run the KVs and JNVs in Telangana are as under:-                                                                  (Rs. in Crore)Year	KVs	JNVs2010-11	97.68*	21.872011-12	118.52*	23.942012-13	128.63*	25.922013-14	147.26*	30.002014-15	89.61	31.702015-16	111.37	33.952016-17	108.97	34.432017-18	157.09	45.972018-19	140.33	46.742019-20	220.82	48.80 *Expenditure on KVs which were functional in undivided State of Andhra Pradesh.****
