ANSWER




                                                                   THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS 				(SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)	(a) to (c) As per Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM), Homeless Persons include persons who do not have a house, either self-owned or rented, but instead live and sleep on pavements, at parks, railway stations, bus stations and places of worship, outside shops and factories, at constructions sites, under bridges, in hume pipes and other places under the open sky or places unfit for human habitation.The term ''homeless'' is neither used nor defined in Census. In Census, however, data are collected for the entire population including ‘houseless’ persons. The houseless population as per Census is defined as persons who live in the open like pavement dwellers, persons residing in hume-pipes, under flyovers, staircases, place of worship, railway platforms etc. The data on houseless population is covered during the 2nd phase of Census i.e. Population Enumeration.  (d) and (e)  Data on deaths are not collected in Census.  There is no mechanism to count homeless deaths in the country under Civil Registration System implemented under Registration of Births and Deaths (RBD) Act, 1969.                            *******
