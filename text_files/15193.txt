                                                         MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a):  	The National Food Security Mission (NFSM) is being implemented in the identified districts across the country with the objective of increasing foodgrains production through area expansion and productivity enhancement, restoring soil fertility and productivity at individual farm level and enhancing farm level economy. The various components of NFSM are NFSM-Rice/Wheat/Pulse/Coarse Cereals/ Nutri-Cereals and Commercial Crops. The NFSM programme is being implemented in all the 28 States and Union Territory (UT) of Jammu & Kashmir and UT of Ladakh. Assistance is being provided for various interventions like different types of demonstrations on latest crops production technologies, promotion of newly released High Yielding Varieties (HYVs)/Hybrids, climate resilient varieties/ stress tolerant/bio-fortified varieties, Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) & Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques, water conservation devices, improved farm implements/tools and capacity building of farmers etc., through state governments...........2/--2-(b) & (c):   		Under the Supplementary Nutrition under Anganwadi Services Scheme, State Governments/UT Administrations have been providing 300 days of supplementary food to the beneficiaries in a year which entails giving more than one meal per day to the children from 3-6 years who come to Anganwadi Centres (AWCs). This includes morning snacks in the form of milk/ banana/seasonal fruits etc. followed by a hot cooked meal (HCM). For children below 3 years of age and pregnant women and lactating mothers, age appropriate Take Home Rations (THRs) in the form of pre-mix/ ready-to-eat food are provided. Besides, for severely malnourished children in the age group of 6 months to 6 years, additional food items in the form of THR have been recommended. Provision of supplementary nutrition under the Anganwadi Services is primarily made to bridge the gap between the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) and the Average Daily Intake (ADI) of children and pregnant women and lactating mothers.Norms for different categories of beneficiaries for Supplementary Nutrition Norms under Anganwadi services are at Annexure.(d) & (e): 		The nutrition schemes envisaged under the National Food Security Act are operating smoothly and no proposal to reassess these programmes is under consideration of the Government.****ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN PART (b) & (c) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.3907 FOR ANSWER ON 17.03.2020 IN THE LOK SABHANorms for different categories of beneficiaries for Supplementary Nutrition Norms under Anganwadi services:S.
