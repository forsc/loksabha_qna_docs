ANSWER




                                                        (a)	 to (d): There have been media reports about appearance of obscene, misleading and undesired advertisements on various social media platforms. Further, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has also received several grievances in this regard. The Department of Consumer Affairs has launched an online portal called GAMA (Government Against Misleading Advertisements) where consumers can lodge complaints relating to misleading advertisements.  Upto 18.03.2021, 17923 complaints against misleading advertisements have been received on the GAMA portal.  Out of these, 11988 complaints have been resolved, and remaining complaints are either rejected or pending with Regulators or other Ministries/ Departments.Further, under the provisions of Consumer Protection Act, 2019, a Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has been established w.e.f. 24.07.2020 which, inter-alia looks into the complaints of misleading advertisements.  The Act also provides that where, after preliminary inquiry, the Central Authority is of the opinion that the matter is to be dealt with a Regulator established under any other law for the time being in force, it may refer such matter to the concerned Regulator along with its report.The platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp messenger etc., for third party content hosted on their platforms are intermediaries as defined in the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000. In order to provide enhanced user safety as also accountability of digital media platforms, Government has notified the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 under the Act. These Rules require that the intermediaries follow certain due diligence as prescribed. The intermediaries are required to publish privacy policy, Rules and regulations and terms and conditions.  They are also required to inform their users not to host, display, upload, modify, publish, transmit, update or share any information that is, inter alia, harmful, harassing, defamatory, libelous, invasive of another''s privacy, hateful, racially or ethnically objectionable, disparaging, or otherwise unlawful in any manner. They are also expected to remove any unlawful content as and when brought to their knowledge either through a court order or through a notice by appropriate government or its agency.*******
