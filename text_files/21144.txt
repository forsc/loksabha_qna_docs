                                                        MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE & FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????       (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):  Directorate of Economics & Statistics (DES), Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (MoA&FW), maintains nine fold classification of Land Use Statistics (LUS). As per report on Land Use Statistics for 2016-17 (latest available), total area of agricultural land in the country is 181.13 million hectares in 2016-17. As per the Seventh Schedule of Constitution of India, land comes under the purview of State Governments and, therefore, it is for them to take suitable steps to tackle the problems of conversion of agricultural land for other purposes. However, Government of India supplements the all efforts of States, through appropriate policy measures and budgetary support. Under the National Policy for Farmers – 2007 (NPF-2007), State Governments have been advised to earmark lands with low biological potential such as uncultivable land, land affected by salinity, acidity, etc., for non-agricultural development activities, including industrial and construction activities. National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy – 2007 (NRRP-2007) has also recommended that as far as possible, projects may be set up on waste land, degraded land or un-irrigated land and acquisition of irrigated, multi-cropped agricultural land for non-agricultural uses may be kept to the minimum and avoided, to the extent possible. (c) & (d):        Ministry of Agriculture, and Farmers Welfare maintains large pool of data such as nine fold classifications of Land Use statistics, Irrigation statistics and various aspects of land uses like Cropping Intensity, Gross Cropped Area & Agricultural Land, APY (Area Production & Yield) data of major crops, Horticulture Statistics, Agricultural wages, Agriculture prices, consumption of Nitrogen, Phosphorus  and Potassium (NPK) and many other statistics which are used for policy formulation for the development of agriculture and allied sector and achieving food security.Due to technological advances and various initiatives of the Government, the production of foodgrains and horticulture crops has been showing an increasing trend. As per the Second Advance Estimates for 2020-21, total Foodgrains production in the country is estimated at record 303.34 million tonnes which is higher by 5.84 million tonnes than the production of foodgrains of 297.50 million tonnes achieved during 2019-20.  As per the NITI Aayog’s Working Group Report (February, 2018) on Demand & Supply Projections Towards 2033 for Crops, Livestock, Fisheries and Agricultural Inputs, the aggregate demand of foodgrains for 2021-22 and 2028-29 is projected at 280.03  and 314.37 million tonnes respectively.  The aggregate supply of foodgrains for 2021-22 and 2028-29 is projected at 303.97 and 353.17 million tonnes respectively by the NITI Aayog.*******
