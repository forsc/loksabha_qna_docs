ANSWER




                                                        (a)	The National Building Code of India 2016 (NBC 2016) published by Bureau of Indian Standards, in its Part 6 ‘Structural Design’ Section 1: ‘Loads, Forces and Effects’ contains the provisions related to earthquake resistant design of buildings.(b)	The standards are not separate for each seismic zone, but there are specific provisions applicable to each of the four seismic zones in India namely Zone II, Zone III, Zone IV and Zone V. The criteria specified in the standards are in line with the best practices adopted in many other countries of the world.(c)	These codes are advisory in nature. The Building Materials and Technology Promotion Council (BMTPC), under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, has published the third edition of Vulnerability Atlas of India.  It is a collation of the existing hazard scenario for the entire country and presents the digitized State/UT-wise Hazard Maps with respect to Earthquakes, Winds & Floods for district-wise identification of vulnerable areas. This edition contains additional digitized maps for Thunderstorms, Cyclones and Landslides. The Atlas also presents the district-wise Housing Vulnerability Risk Tables based on wall types and roof types as per 2011 Census Housing data. (d)	Urban Development is a State subject. Presently,no such scheme is under consideration to promote demolition of fragile buildings in earthquake prone areas.                                  *****
