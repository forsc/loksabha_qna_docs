ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a): Yes, Sir. As per Government orders, 100% of food grains and 20% of sugar has to be compulsorily packed in jute bags for supply to Public Distribution System (PDS). Since the demand from the Government agencies outstrips the supply available in the domestic market, it is fulfilled through imports. (b)& (c):  No such report has been received from  the Jute Commissioner. (d):  As under Jute Packaging Material (Compulsory Use in Packing Commodities) Act, 1987, every year, government specifies the commodities and the extent to which they are mandatorily required to be packed in jute packaging materials. This has given tremendous support to the jute industry over the last three decades. The level of reservations recommended by the Government in the last three years is furnished below:-Order date	Year	Sugar	Food grains09.03.2018	2017-18	20%	90%30.11.2018	2018-19	20%	100%20.12.2019	2019-20	20%	100%26-11-2020	2020-21	20%	100%In order to address injury caused by dumping of certain jute products, Ministry of Finance has imposed anti-dumping duty under Notification dated 5th January, 2017, on their imports from Nepal and Bangladesh. ******
