The face to face training was conducted from August, 2019 to mid-March, 2020. However, in view of the COVID pandemic, online NISHTHA training for elementary teachers was launched on 06th October, 2020 and the remaining training was conducted online by the NCERT on the DIKSHA platform using high quality professionally made e-content.In 2021-22, NISHTHA has been extended to Secondary level and for Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN). NISHTHA 2.0 for secondary/senior secondary level teachers was launched on 29th July, 2021.

The State/UT-wise number of elementary teachers trained under NISHTHA is attached as Annexure.NCERT faculty has been involved in NISHTHA training programme.
