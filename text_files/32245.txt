STATEMENT REFEERED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (f) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 337 FOR REPLY ON 21.12.2021 ASKED BY SHRI BHOLA SINGH AND SHRI VINOD KUMAR SONKAR REGARDING ALLOCATION OF FUNDs TO NSFs(a)Yes Sir. Government allocates funds to the National Sports Federations (NSFs) under the Scheme of Assistance to NSFs for promotion of sport for which it is recognised.( b) & (c) Funds under the Scheme of Assistance to NSFs are disbursed by the Ministry through Sports Authority of India (SAI), which is an autonomous body under the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. SAI furnishes the Utilisation Certificates for the funds transferred to the NSFs, and for the expenditure incurred by SAI to organise coaching and training camps proposed by NSFs in SAI centres across the country. SAI also meets expenditure on international travelling, boarding and lodging, entry fee and other incidental expenses of Indian teams/players selected for international competitions and sporting events by the NSFs. In the case of funds transferred by SAI to NSFs, 75% of the admissible amount is disbursed as advance, while the remaining amount is provided on reimbursement basis. The details of funds allocated under the Scheme of Assistance to NSFs and expenditure since 2018 are given in Annexure-I and Annexure-II respectively.(c) to (f) No instances of misuse of funds by NSFs have come to the notice of the Government during the said period. NSFs receiving funds of Rs1 crore and above are subject to audit by the CAG of India. Audit of select NSFs is done by CAG and audit findings/observations are sent to the concerned NSFs for necessary action at their end. Settlement of observations and audit paras are taken up by the respective NSFs with the  Office of CAG. In order to ensure transparency and accountability in the functioning of NSFs, the Ministry has, since 2010, introduced the system of annual recognition, under which recognition is renewed every year on submission of relevant documents, including the audited annual accounts of NSFs.*****
