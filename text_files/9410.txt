ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) : 		As on 31.10.2019, the installed generation capacity in the country has been around 3,64,960 Mega Watt (MW), which is sufficient to meet the electricity demand in the country. The details of actual power supply position in terms of energy and peak of the country during the current year i.e. 2019-20 (upto October, 2019) is given at Annexure-I. It may be seen that the gap between demand and supply of power during the current year 2019-20 (upto October, 2019) both in terms of Energy and Peak is less than 1%. This gap is generally on account of factors, other than of power availability in the country e.g. constraints in sub-transmission and distribution network, financial constraints of State Power Utilities to purchase power etc. Apart from long term Power Purchase Agreements power can be purchased at any time from power exchanges. (b) :  		The details of power generation from various sources (Thermal, Hydro & Nuclear) of 25 MW and above capacity stations in the country during the last year & current year i.e. 2019-20 (upto October,2019) are given at Annexure-II. Further, the source-wise range of rate of sale of electricity in Rs/kWh as approved by the concerned Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC)/ State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) during the year 2017-18 are given at Annexure-III. (c) & (d): 	Generation of electricity is a delicensed activity as per the Electricity Act, 2003, except for the concurrence of Central Electricity Authority (CEA) for hydro generating stations with estimated scheme cost exceeding the sum fixed by the Central Government from time to time. Details of Central Sector Hydro Power Projects sanctioned during last two years is given at Annexure-IV.                                       ***********
