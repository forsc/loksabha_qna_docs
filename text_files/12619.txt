ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RAMDAS ATHAWALE)(a) and (b): Manual scavenging is prohibited under Section 5 of the “Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (MS Act 2013)” in all the States and Union Territories with effect from 06.12.2013. The persons who were engaged in manual scavenging on this date are identified for their rehabilitation. The Act provides for survey of manual scavengers by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Municipality in urban areas and CEO of Gram Panchayat in rural areas if they have reasons to believe existence of manual scavengers in the areas under their jurisdiction. 14,559 manual scavengers have been identified by 13 States from 2013-14 to 31.01.2020. In addition, a National Survey has also been carried out in 194 districts of 18 States identified on the basis of insanitary latrines, converted into sanitary latrines under Swachh Bharat Mission. 48,345 manual scavengers have been identified under the National survey upto 31.01.2020. Thus a total of 62,904 manual scavengers have been identified since 06.12.2013 upto 31.01.2020.   (a) and (d): There has been no reports regarding death of persons due to manual scavenging. However, the National Commission for Safai Karamcharis have received reports regarding the death of persons while cleaning of sewers and septic tanks. State-wise details of such deaths during the last five years are at Annexure.(e): The main reason for manual scavenging is the existence of insanitary latrines which require manual cleaning. Under Swachh Bharat Mission implemented by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs and the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation  the insanitary latrines have been identified and converted into sanitary latrines to eliminate the need for manual cleaning of toilets. In addition, the Act also provides stringent penalties of imprisonment upto 2 years or fine upto Rs. 1 lakh or both if any person or agency engages any person for manual scavenging.   						*****														AnnexureAnneuxre referred in reply to parts  (c) to (d) of Lok Sabha unstarred question No. 1607 for answer on 11.02.2020 regarding eradication of manual scavengingS No	Name of State/UT	2015	2016	2017	2018	2019		No. of Death	Compensation 	No. of Death	Compensation 	No. of Death	Compensation 	No. of Death	Compensation 	No. of Death	Compensation 			Full 	Partly  	 	Full 	Partly  	 	Full 	Partly  	 	Full 	Partly  	 	Full 	Partly  1	Andhra Pradesh	 	 	 	3	2	1	2	2	 	9	7	0	2	0	02	Bihar	0	0	0	0	0	0	6	0	6	6	0	0	0	0	03	Chhatisgarh	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	1	1	 	 	 	 4	Chandigarh	 	 	 	 	 	 	3	3	 	 	 	 	 	 	 5	Delhi	2	2	 	1	0	0	13	12	0	10	10	0	8	8	06	Goa	0	0	0	2	0	2	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	07	Gujarat	7	0	6	7	0	1	7	3	0	2	1	1	16	2	118	Haryana	4	4	 	 	 	 	11	11	 	6	3	2	14	6	09	Kerla	 	 	 	 	 	 	1	1	 	 	 	 	 	 	 10	Karnataka	14	13	 	9	9	 	4	4	 	1	1	 	7	7	 11	Maharashtra	0	0	0	2	0	0	4	0	0	7	2	0	17	0	012	Punjab	 	 	 	2	2	 	4	0	2	2	0	2	3	3	 13	Rajasthan	11	2	6	5	2	3	6	4	0	2	0	0	5	0	014	Tamil Nadu	8	7	1	10	10	 	7	7	 	9	8	0	15	10	015	Talengana	1	0	0	2	0	2	 	 	 	2	2	0	0	0	016	Tripura	 	 	 	2	0	2	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 17	Uttar Pradesh	10	0	8	3	2	0	18	7	5	11	5	4	21	8	1018	West Bengal	 	 	 	 	 	 	7	7	 	0	0	0	2	0	0 	Total	57	28	21	48	27	11	93	61	13	68	40	9	110	44	21	Note : "0"  means information not received												 Nil Report Received														S No	Name State/UT															1	Arunachal Pradesh															2	Assam															3	Odisha															4	Jharkhand															5	Mizoram															6	Manipur															7	Nagaland															8	Sikkim															9	Dadar and Nagar Haveli														10	Pondicherry															11	Lakshadweep															12	Meghalaya															13	A&N Islands
