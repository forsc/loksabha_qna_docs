ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) to (d)  In order to achieve “Housing for All” in rural areas, the Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) with effect from 1st April 2016 to provide assistance to eligible rural households with overall target to construct 2.95 crore pucca houses with basic amenities. The identification of beneficiaries under PMAY-G is based on the housing deprivation parameters and exclusion criteria prescribed under Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC)-2011 and due verification by the respective Gram Sabhas and completion of an Appellate Process. The Government conducted Awaas+ survey during Janaury 2018 to March, 2019 to identify those eligible beneficiaries which claimed to have been left out under the 2011 Socio Economic Caste Census(SECC) and prepared an additional list of potential beneficiaries. However, under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U), the houses under various verticals are sanctioned based on the validated demand assessed through a demand survey by the respective State/UT Governments, rather than through 2011 SECC. The number of eligible beneficiaries available through SECC, 2011 database currently stands at 2.15 crore (approx.). The data of beneficiaries captured through Awaas+ is being utilized in order to fill the gap between the overall target i.e. 2.95 crore houses under the PMAY-G and beneficiaries available basis SECC data i.e. 2.15 crore, Since, Awaas+ has more eligible beneficiaries claiming for a house against only 80 lakh houses (approx.) that can be sanctioned houses. Therefore, there was a need for filtration of genuinely deprived households for providing the benefit under the scheme. Accordingly, Expert Committees were constituted to recommend the manner of selection of beneficiaries from finalized Awaas+ list. On the basis of recommendations of the Expert Committee, a target of 51 lakh has been already been allocated to eligible States/UTs during financial year 2020-21 & 2021-22.*****
