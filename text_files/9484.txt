                                                        MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a)to (d):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.****STATEMENT REFFERED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 268 BY SHRI ANIL FIROJIYA REGARDING ‘CONSERVATION OF ENVIRONMENT’ DUE FOR REPLY ON 06-12-2019.(a) The Government is implementing various Centrally Sponsored Umbrella schemes namely National Mission for a Green India, Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats, Conservation of Natural Resources & Ecosystems, National River Conservation Programme and Compensatory Afforestation Programme of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC). A sum of Rs. 11,254.00 crores (including Rs. 8,562.73 crores under CAMPA) have been released by MoEF&CC during the last three years i.e. 2016-17 to 2018-19 to conserve environment. The State wise details of funds spent under various schemes/programmes is placed at Annexure-A.(b)	As per the India State of Forest Report (ISFR), 2017, there has been an increase of 1243 sq. km in the tree cover on the country as compared to ISFR, 2015. This is mainly attributed to large scale plantation by different Government and private agencies and farmers outside forest area. Tree cover of the country as per ISFR, 2013, 2015 and 2017 are 91,266 sq. km (2.78% of Geographical Area), 92.572 sq. km (2.82% of Geographical Area) and 93, 815 sq. km (2.85% of Geographical Area) respectively. This shows an increasing trend of tree cover in the country. Government’s policy is to ensure that more trees are planted than trees removed for any public or utility projects.(c)	National Forestry Policy, 1988 envisages a national goal to have a minimum of one-third of the total land area of the country under forest or tree cover. However, the actual number of trees planted is dependent on the Annual Plan of Operation finalized by the individual State Government based on their own planning for each financial year. To achieve this goal, afforestation programmes are being taken up under various Centrally Sponsored Schemes and States/UTs Schemes/Plan.(d)	Government of India has adequate policies/programmes and initiatives for conservation of environment in Cities like Nagar Van Yojana, National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojna (PMUY), National Solar Mission, Smart Cities Mission, Green Highway Policy, National Green Aviation Policy, National Water Mission, Jal Jeevan Mission, Jal Shakti Abhiyan, Swachh Bharat Mission and National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) with a vision for providing wholesome living environment, and contributing to smart, clean, green and sustainable cities for healthy and happy citizens.****
