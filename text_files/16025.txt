                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):	The data related to IVF is not maintained at Central level. However, as per the report of Sample Registration System (SRS) 2017 released by Registrar General of India (RGI), the percentage of fertility for women in the age range 40-49 years is 2%. The percentage of fertility for woman age 50-59 years, 60-69 years and 70-79 years are not provided by the SRS Report.(c) to (e):	Geriatric pregnancies can increase the risk of hypertension, diabetes, preterm labour, pre-eclampsia and other complications of pregnancy and childbirth. After menopause, the hormones that maintain the lining of the uterus for the growth of a foetus decreases to their minimum levels. Advanced age also weakens other organ systems, including the heart. Factors like these vastly increase the risk of pregnancy-related complications for women who conceive over the age of 55.In order to regulate the use of IVF, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) developed National Guidelines for Accreditation, Supervision and Regulation of ART (Assisted Reproductive Technology)  Clinics in India. These Guidelines have been circulated to all the States / UT’s by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Govt. of India with the request to follow them in their respective State/UT. The details of the National Guidelines for Accreditation, Supervision and Regulation of ART (Assisted Reproductive Technology) Clinics in the Country are available on the ICMR web site (http://icmr.nic.in/art/art_clinics.htm).Further to prevent such incidents, the Government has brought forward the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill 2020 which has set up the age limit up to 50 years for woman and 55 years for man for availing IVF treatment.
