ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES(SHRI NARAYAN RANE)(a):	Yes, Ministry conducts regular assessment of the functional SFURTI clusters in respect of their profitability and marketability through during various review meetings, visits to clusters and 3rd party evaluation, etc. Based on the same, it has been observed that marketability and profitability of the clusters require special support due to the COVID 19 pandemic. To ensure the same, the Ministry has taken various initiatives like training on design development and product diversification to cater to the market demand, encouraging linkages with e-commerce portals, etc. (b):	SFURTI scheme is applicable across the country. However, to expand the reach of the scheme across the country, special focus is given on proposals received from districts without an approved SFURTI cluster and Aspirational districts.  (c):	Yes, Ministry encourages the convergence of the SFURTI scheme with other welfare schemes of Ministries/Departments of Central and State Government. The Implementing Agencies of the clusters are already required to open bank accounts and provide General and Health Insurance to all artisans. (d):	 No, minimum wage for artisans has not been specified under SFURTI. However, Ministry takes necessary initiatives under the scheme to upskill the traditional artisans and provide them with infrastructural support to add value to their products, thereby increasing their income in a sustainable manner. (e):	 The timeframe for functionalization of a SFURTI cluster since its approval is 12 months for a Regular cluster (up to 500 artisans) and 18 months for a Major cluster (more than 500 artisans). Ministry takes regular review of the clusters under implementation to ensure the timeline for functionalization of clusters are adhered to.
