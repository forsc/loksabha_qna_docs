ANSWER




                                                         MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) to (e): 	Public Distribution System (PDS) is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and the State/UT Governments, wherein the operational responsibilities within the State/UT for identification of beneficiaries, issuance of ration cards and distribution of foodgrains, etc. rest with the respective State/UT Government. To ensure the quality of foodgrains for distribution through PDS, there is a set procedure for the issuance of foodgrains to State/UTs Government. Department has issued following instructions to all State/UT Governments and Food Corporation of India (FCI) to ensure supply of good quality foodgrains under PDS. ..........2/--2-i.	Only good quality foodgrains free from insect infestation and conforming to Food Safety Standards are to be issued under TPDS and other welfare schemes.ii.	Ample opportunities are to be provided to the officials of the State/UT Governments to inspect the stocks prior to lifting from FCI godowns.  States/UTs may ensure that officers not below the rank of Inspector are deputed for inspection of the foodgrains before their lifting from FCI godowns.iii.	Samples of foodgrains are to be collected and sealed from the stock of foodgrains, to be issued under the PDS, jointly by FCI and State/UT Governments.iv.	An officer not below the rank of Inspector is to be deputed from State/UT Government to take the delivery of foodgrains stock from the FCI godowns.v.	Regular inspection, to check the quality of foodgrains, is to be carried out by the officers of State/UT Government.vi.	It is the responsibility of the concerned State/UT Government to ensure that during the transportation and storage of foodgrains at different stages in the distribution chain, the foodgrains retain the required quality specifications.vii.	The State Government, where the decentralized procurement is in operation, should ensure that the quality of foodgrains issued under PDS and other welfare schemes should meet the desired standards prescribed by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).    	An offence, if committed, is in violation of the provisions of TPDS (Control) Order, 2015 and is liable for penal action under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Thus, the Order empowers State/UT Governments to take punitive action in case of contravention of relevant provisions of these Orders.  	Also, the institutional mechanism for the monitoring and grievance redressal under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) provides setting up of Vigilance Committees, District Grievance Redressal Officers and independent State Food Commission for making the system more efficient and transparent.Further, as and when matters related to quality of foodgrains are observed or complaints are received in this Department with regards to any irregularities in the functioning of the PDS, including quality of foodgrains, etc., they are forwarded to the concerned State/UT Government for inquiry and appropriate action at their end.***
