Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India/State Governments / Union Territories Administrations thereby committing resources for setting up a new KV as well as the availability of necessary sanction of the Government. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities for opening of new KVs also have to compete among other proposals under the “Challenge Method”.(b) & (c) The Government of India had sanctioned 13 new KVs in August, 2018 and another 50 new KVs in March, 2019. Out of these, 36 KVs have been opened and made functional so far. In the remaining 27 cases, the sponsoring authorities concerned have to transfer the identified / demarcated land in favour of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) and also handover possession of the temporary building before administrative orders for opening of KVs are issued. The State/UT-wise details are annexed.(d) & (e) KVS has informed that no proposal has been received from the State Government of Rajasthan to open a new KV at Sujangarh.******
