Offices of the Central Government are located in different places impacting the efficiency of functioning of Ministries. Many of these buildings have outlived their lives. Therefore, in order to meet the requirements of the Parliament, get all offices of Central Government Secretariat at one place and improve the Central vista as a world class public place, the proposal of development/ redevelopment of such buildings of the vista has been decided.(b) :  The cost of redevelopment of Central Vista area i.e. for Common Central Secretariat and new Parliament Building as well as improvement of Central Vista area shall be worked out after finalization of the proposals.                            *****
