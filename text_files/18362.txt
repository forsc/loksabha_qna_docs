ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b): Under the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, plastic carry bags (virgin or recycled) with thickness less than 50 micron and plastic sheet or like, which is not an integral part of multi-layered packaging and cover made of plastic sheet used for packaging, wrapping commodities, with thickness less than 50 micron are banned. Single use plastics such as plastics used for packaging, carrying or dispensing commodities and intended to be used only once, if uncollected and littered, have adverse environmental impacts.  (c) to (f): The plastic waste including single use plastics are managed in the country under Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, and its amendments. As per the Rules, the generators of waste have been mandated to take steps to minimize generation of plastic waste, not to litter the plastic waste, ensure segregated storage of waste at source and handover segregated waste to local bodies or agencies authorised by the local bodies. The rules also mandate the responsibilities of local bodies, gram panchayats, waste generators, retailers and street vendors to manage plastic waste.  Under the said Rules, producer, importer and brand owner need to work out modalities for waste collection system based on Extended Producers Responsibility. The Ministry has recently approved a draft Guideline Document on Uniform Framework for Extended Producers Responsibility under Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. The guideline provides for three different models for the Producers, Importers and Brand Owners for the implementation of the EPR mechanism.  The document is uploaded on the website of the Ministry. The Ministry had also issued “Standard Guidelines for Single-Use Plastic” on 21st January 2019 to all States/UTs and Ministries. The Standard guidelines lay down improvements in the waste management system, legal options for States/Union Territories to prohibit items of Single Use Plastic through regulatory measures, eco-friendly alternatives, social awareness and public education. Considering the high environmental cost associated with the use of Single-use plastic, particularly the adverse effect on soil, water bodies and on marine environment, Hon’ble Prime Minister has announced India’s pledge to phase out Single-use plastic by 2022. Many States/UTs through their own notifications have imposed partial or complete prohibition on the use of plastic carry bags/single use plastic. 32 States/UTs have issued notifications/orders introducing regulations pertaining to complete or partial ban on plastic carry bags and/or other single-use plastic items. Government has identified Compostable plastic as one of the alternatives. To promote the use of compostable plastic, the provision of minimum thickness of fifty microns has been made inapplicable to carry bags made up of compostable plastic, conforming to IS/ISO 17088. Some of the State Governments which have banned the use of plastic bags in their respective states are allowing only compostable plastic bags for plant nurseries, horticulture, agriculture and other use. Apart from the traditional material like jute bags, leaf plates, bamboo cutleries, the new material like bagasse based products, banana stem based products etc. are now widely available in the market. ********
