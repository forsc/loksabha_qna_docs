                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	The production scenario of maize in the country during past four years are as under :- (Qty. in Million Ton)Season	2015-16	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19 *Kharif	16.05	18.92	20.12	20.63Rabi	6.51	6.98	8.63	7.19Total	22.57	25.90	28.75	27.82* As per 3rd Advance Estimate and Final Estimate is still awaited.	As per the above Table, there is no major shortfall in maize in the country.  (b) & (c) :	Import of Maize (Corn), other than seed quality, is permissible annually under Tariff Rate Quota (TRQ) Scheme upto 5 lakh MT under ‘zero’ customs duty by the State Trading Enterprises (STEs).	 But this TRQ Scheme could not be operationalised due to the Order of Hon’ble High Court of Hyderabad.  Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), in consultation with the Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying and Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare, has allowed import of 1 lakh MT of feed grade maize (corn) under the TRQ Scheme @ 15% customs duty by two STEs viz. NAFED & MMTC and meant only for actual users.  Import for trading purpose has not been allowed.  Another 4 lakh MT of feed grade maize (corn) for import @ 15% customs duty only for actual users has been notified by DGFT.  With this, a total quantity of 5 lakh MT of maize (corn) under TRQ Scheme gets exhausted in 2019-20.(d) & (e):	No representation from poultry association has been received in the Ministry for allocation of wheat and broken rice for poultry industry. However, a reference is received in the Ministry from Hon’ble Member of Parliament requesting to provide subsidized  wheat as alternate to corn in the feed to poultry farmers in Tamil Nadu from Food Corporation of India.***
