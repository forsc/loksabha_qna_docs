                                                        (a) & (b) NITI Aayog from time to time issues guidelines for earmarking of funds by Central Ministries/Departments under Scheduled Tribe Component (STC). Besides, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, 40 Central Ministries / Departments have been mandated to earmark STC funds in the range of 4.3 to 17.5 percent of their total Scheme allocation every year for tribal development. Details of obligation for earmarking of funds under STC as prescribed by NITI Aayog and allocation made by Central Ministries/Departments in the year 2021-22for welfare of STs under STC is at Annexure I.State Governments are also supposed to earmark Tribal Sub Plan (TSP)/Scheduled Tribe Component and funds in proportion to ST population (Census 2011) in the State with respect to total State Plan.  The details of TSP Allocation by different State Governments under State Tribal Sub-Plan from 2020-21 is placed at Annexure II.(c) In the Union Budget 2021-22, an amount of Rs. 78256.31 crore has been allocated as STC funds out of the total scheme budgetary allocation of 41 obligated Ministries/Departments which is 50 % more than the STC budget of the current financial year. Out of 299 schemes for which allocations made under STC in 2021-22 by the Central Ministries /Departments, 28 schemes (having allocation Rs. 500 crore or more) have STC allocation to the tune of Rs 64512.59 crore. STC schemes provide direct benefit and also allied benefits for the welfare of tribal population.STC schemes of obligated Central Ministries/Departments aim for overall development of tribal people across the country which includes support for education, health, sanitation, water supply, skill development, livelihood, etc. Major part of infrastructure development and provision of basic amenities in tribal areas / regions in the country is carried out through various schemes / programmes of concerned Central Ministries and State Governments concerned, while the Ministry of Tribal Affairs provides additive to these initiatives by way of plugging critical gaps. Government is doing Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) under various schemes such as Atal Pension Yojna, Scholarship Schemes, PAHAL, PM AwasYojna,PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi etc.Further, Ministry of Tribal Affairs had given a research and evaluation project to the third party (M/s Price Waterhouse Cooper Private Limited (PWC)) for assessing the relevance and effectiveness of STC funds under various schemes of Central Ministries/Departments. Major findings of the study are listed below: i.	18 Ministries have allocated the funds as mandated by NITI Aayog.ii.	81% of the total allocated STC funds were utilized in the year 2019-20.iii.	About 74 % of the assessed schemes (195 out of 261 total schemes) fall under the category of notional reporting indicating need of robust and IT enabled monitoring for the STC schemes.Annexure IStatement referred to in reply to part (a) & (b) of the Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 2107 for 08.03.2021 by DR.
