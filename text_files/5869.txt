National Electricity Plan (Vol-II Transmission) has been notified in the Gazette of India on 7th February, 2019.(b) & (c) :	Transmission lines are planned and constructed for evacuation of power from generating stations and strengthening of existing transmission network. The transmission system associated with generation projects are executed matching with the completion schedule of the respective generation project for evacuation of power to load centers. The transmission lines of 12,089 ckm, associated with various generation projects, have been executed in last three years (i.e. FY 2016-17, 2017-18 & 2018-19) for evacuation of power from the respective generation projects.(d) & (e) :	Transmission systems establish the link between source of generation and distribution system. Therefore, the transmission systems are planned for evacuation of power from Generating stations and for meeting growth in load / demand as projected in the Electric Power Survey (EPS) Report. Accordingly, planning of transmission system (transmission lines and associated substations) for the period 2017-22, to meet the projected peak electricity demand of 226 GW (as per 19th EPS) during 2021-22 has been carried out. The transmission projects are implemented generally through Tariff Based Competitive Bidding and tariff is collected as per extant CERC Tariff Regulations.(f) :		Against a target of 23,086 ckm of transmission lines and 53,978 MVA of transformation capacity during 2017-18, 23119 ckm transmission lines and 86,193 MVA transformation capacity has been added.  Similarly, in 2018-19, against a target of 22,647 ckm of transmission lines and 62,600 MVA of transformation capacity, 22437 ckm transmission lines and 72,705 MVA transformation capacity has been added.****************
