ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b):	No such information is maintained by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).(c):	Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has not carried out any clinical trials or scientific studies of these chemically fortified beverages to prove that they are better than milk(d):	FSSAI has informed that plant based beverages are non-dairy products by nature, and the use of dairy terms in respect of such products are regulated by the extant Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards and Food Additives) Thirteenth Amendment Regulations, 2017. Implementation and enforcement of Food Safety and Standards (FSS) Act, 2006 and Rules and Regulations made there under primarily rests with State/UT Governments. Regular surveillance, monitoring, inspection and random sampling of food products are being carried out by the officials of Food Safety Departments of the respective States/UTs to check compliance of the prescribed standards under the FSS Act and Rules and Regulations made there under. In cases where the samples are found to be non-conforming, penal action is taken against the defaulting Food Business Operators as per  provisions of the said Act.
