                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) to (e) According to industry sources, the details of job losses are as under:(i) Total number of airline employees in India has declined from around 74,800 as on 31st March 2020 to around 65,600 as on 31st December 2021.(ii) Total number of employees in airport sector has declined from around 73,400 as on 31st March 2020 to around 65,700 as on 31st December 2021.;(iii) Total number of employees in ground handling sector has declined from around 30,800 as on 31st March 2020 to around 27,600 as on 31st December 2021.(iv) Total number of employees in air cargo sector has increased from around 9,600 as on 31st March 2020 to around 10,500 as on 31st December 2021.;;The total job loss in airlines, airports, ground handling and air cargo sector is around 19,200.  The job loss is around 10% of the total jobs (around 1.9 lakh) in these sectors. The Government has held discussions with industry participants and stakeholders to address the challenges facing the industry.;Air traffic during 2020-21 witnessed a massive fall of 66% over the previous year due to the Covid pandemic.During the last two years, the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the revenue streams of businesses including aviation sector. Under normal circumstances, airfares are neither established nor regulated by the Government. However, due to the unprecedented circumstances, fare bands with upper and lower limits were introduced by the Government as a special measure. The fare bands serve the dual purpose of protecting the interests of the travelers as well as of the airlines.Consequent to spread of COVID-19 pandemic, airline operations were suspended in March, 2020 in the country. Based on the improvement in COVID situation, a calibrated resumption of domestic operations was allowed in May 2020 with various protocols for safe air travel. After assessing the situation and passenger demand for air travel, from time to time the capacity restrictions on domestic operations have been lifted with effect from 18th October 2021.;With the massive nationwide Covid-vaccination drive undertaken by the Government, revival in air traffic in 2021-22, opening of international flight from 27th March 2022, establishment of new airports, expansion of existing airports and airlines etc, growth of  the Indian aviation sector is likely to result in increase of jobs opportunities in the sector.******
