                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) to (c) No, Sir.  No Train lost its route. Shramik Special trains were operated w.e.f. 01.05.2020 to enable movement of migrant labourers and stranded passengers in terms of the guidelines issued by the Government.  These were “trains on demand” and in all, 4621 Shramik Express trains were operated between 01.05.2020 to 31.08.2020 carrying 63.19 lakh passengers to their respective States. Train operations on Indian Railways is done strictly as per instructions contained in General & Subsidiary Rules and the Operating Manual. No train "lost" its route and trains reached the exact destinations to which they were planned. Owing to congestion, a few trains were run on diverted alternate route in a planned manner via alternative non-congested routes.  The trains were diverted to facilitate faster transit and create staggered arrival at congested destinations.In order to meet the basic needs of travelling passengers in Shramik Special trains, meals along with Packaged Drinking Water, depending upon the requirements based on journey time, were provided to the passengers.  Indian Railways provided approximately 1.96 crore meals and 2.19 crore packaged drinking water bottles to passengers of Shramik Special Trains free of cost. Policing on Railways being a State subject, prevention of crime, registration of cases, their investigation and maintenance of law & order in Railway premises as well as on running trains are the statutory responsibility of the State Governments, which they discharge through Government Railway Police (GRP)/District Police.  Railway Protection Force (RPF) supplements the efforts of GRP/District Police to provide better protection and security of passenger area & passengers and for related matters.  Based on the data provided by State Police, 97 persons have been reported dead while travelling on board Shramik Special Trains during Covid-19 situation/crisis.  The State Police registers case under Section 174 of Cr. PC in cases of unnatural deaths and follows further legal process.(d) to (f) Railways are liable for payment of compensation only in case of death or injury of railway passengers in train accidents and untoward incidents as laid down in Section 124 and 124A read with Section 123 of Railways Act, 1989.Compensation is paid by the Railways only if a decree is passed by Railway Claims Tribunal (RCT) in favour of the victims or their dependents on the compensation claims application filed by them in a RCT bench.  Presently, maximum amount of compensation is          ` 8 Lakhs in case of death and ` 64,000 to 8 lakhs in case of injury, depending on the nature and type of injuries sustained.*****
