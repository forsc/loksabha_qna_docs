Government takes action against the contractors in case of violation of Contract Agreement by the contactors as per the conditions of Contract including, but not limited to, imposition of penalties, termination of contract etc.(c)	No sir. However, to ensure timely completion of the ongoing projects various steps such as close coordination with other Ministries, revamping of dispute resolution mechanism, frequent review meetings with project developers, state government and contractors at various levels etc. have been taken up.*****
