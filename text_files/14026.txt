ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN] (a) 	India’s vision of Indo-Pacific acknowledges the inter-dependence and inter-connectedness of Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. In the Indian Ocean Region, Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) is the largest multilateral inter-governmental organisation. Formed in 1997, it currently has 22 countries as Member States and 10 countries as Dialogue Partners. India is one of the founding members of IORA. IORA is one of the primary platforms for promoting Dialogue based approaches to seek a safe, secure and stable region that delivers shared prosperity for all.(b) 	IORA does not have a regular summit mechanism. The first and only IORA Leaders’ Summit so far was held in 2017 in Jakarta, Indonesia on the occasion of the 20th  anniversary of formation of IORA. The theme of the Summit was “Strengthening Maritime Cooperation for a Peaceful, Stable and Prosperous Indian Ocean”. India was represented at the Summit by the then Vice President of India Shri M. Hamid Ansari.(c) & (d) 	At the 21st IORA Committee of Senior Officials held in Abu Dhabi, UAE on November 5 & 6, 2019, mid-term review of IORA Action Plan 2017-2021 was discussed, and it was decided to continue the review at the next IORA Committee of Senior Officials Meeting as well as consider the new IORA Action Plan 2021-2025.***
