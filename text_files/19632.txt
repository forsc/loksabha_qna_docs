MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) :	Para 26.2 of the National Education Policy, 2020 states that the Centre and the States will work together to increase the public investment in the field of education sector to reach 6 % of GDP at the earliest. To facilitate this, inter-state Governor Conference on NEP was organized under the chairmanship of Hon''ble President in September 2020 wherein this issue was also flagged. It is a joint effort by Centre and States. (b) :	In order to target Universalisation of Secondary Education, the Department of School Education & Literacy has launched the Integrated Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Samagra Shiksha from 2018-19, which subsumes the erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan and Teacher Education. (c) :	National Education Policy 2020 proposes to constitute a ‘Gender-Inclusion Fund’ to build the nation ’s capacity to provide equitable quality education for all girls as well as transgender students. The funds enables States to support and scale effective community-based interventions that address local context-specific barriers to female and transgender children’s access to and participation in education.(d) and (e) :	Education is a subject in the Concurrent List of the Constitution, the recruitment and service conditions of teachers are in the domain of respective State Government/UT Administrations.
