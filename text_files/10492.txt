ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND PENSIONS AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a) & (b):   The amendments of administrative and enabling nature were made to RTI Act, 2005 vide RTI (Amendment) Act, 2019 in order to provide for express provisions regarding salaries, allowances and other terms & conditions of service of Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners in Central & State Information Commissions without affecting the substantive aspects of the Act related to public interests i.e information sharing for transparency and accountability which are given in Chapter II/Section 7 of the RTI Act inter-alia.          The amendments do not involve any social or additional financial implications which may have necessitated pre-legislative consultations outside the Government. The powers and functions of the Information Commissions stay undiluted as the relevant provisions under Chapter V of the Act remain unaltered. Nor are the independence and autonomy of these institutions going to be affected. These Rules do not in any way affect the citizens’ Right to Information or obligations of Public Authorities and Public Information Officers given in Chapter II of the RTI Act inter-alia.(c):    Does not arise.*****
