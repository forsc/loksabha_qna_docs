ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a): Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) is a centrally sponsored programme and designed to be implemented in a Mission mode, with both the Central Government and the States sharing the cost. Central assistance to the States for DAY-NRLM is provided in the ratio of 60:40 in respect of all States except in the case of North-East (NE) and Himalayan States where it is in the ratio of 90:10. The inter-state distribution of central assistance is made on the basis of inter-state poverty ratio as formulated by the erstwhile Planning Commission. However, in case of the NE States excluding Assam, a special package has been approved which enables need-based provision of funds to cover all rural poor households, estimated  at two third  of the total rural household in these states.(b) and (c): The detail of funds allocated is enclosed in Annexure-I.(d) and (e): In order to reduce the effective cost of bank credit to women SHGs, DAY-NRLM provides interest subvention and additional interest subvention to SHGs from FY 2013-14. In category-II districts, women SHGs whose members are from the DAY-NRLM target group, are eligible for receiving interest subvention equal to the difference between the borrowing rate of interest from banks and 7% in loans up to Rs. 3 lakh. In addition, in respect of 250 backward districts (category-I districts), all women SHGs can avail loans up to Rs.3.0 lakh each at 7% rate of interest per annum, with an additional interest subvention of 3% on prompt repayment, reducing the effective interest rate to 4%. The details of the amount of Interest Subvention disbursed to SHGs and the number of poor rural household organized into SHGs between 2013-14 to 2019-20 is given in Annexures -II and III respectively.(f): Several steps have been taken for effective implementation of DAY-NRLM. These include submission of periodical reports by the State Rural Livelihoods Missions (SRLMs), review during the periodic meeting of the Performance Review Committee (PRC) of the Ministry, monitoring the timely submission of Utilization Certificates, submission of third party monitoring reports through National Level Monitors and Area Officers, monitoring through various MIS modules as well as bi-monthly financial management review of all States. Implementation Support Missions (ISMs) have been carried out in some States such as Assam, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, wherein, technical experts from the National Mission Management Unit supervise the work of the SRLMs and support them to resolve outstanding issues and plan for future implementation of the programme in the States in consultation with the SRLMs.
