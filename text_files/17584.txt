It covers various aspects related to the safety and security of school children including infrastructure which includes physical structures of school building, electrical and fire safety mechanism, safety audits in schools including fire safety and clearance by fire authority etc. Para 3.3.2 of Chapter 3 of NDMA Guidelines on School Safety Policy include guidelines regarding prevention of fire and fire safety measures to be undertaken by all schools.

(b) & (c) :	 1227 Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) and 645 Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) are adhering to the guidelines issued by NDMA. All functional KVs and JNVs have adequate fire safety measures in their buildings. (d) & (e):	The Department of School Education and Literacy, Ministry of Education has issued detailed guidelines to all States and UTs regarding safety and security of children in October, 2014 and the same had been reiterated in 2017 consequent upon formulation of school safety guidelines by the NDMA. Further, this Department has issued instructions to all States and UTs on 10.12.2018 and 21.01.2020 regarding measures to be undertaken for disaster preparedness, including mock drills and visit of fire fighters to schools for demonstration exercises and lectures.    The University Grants Commission has also framed guidelines on safety of students, on and off the campuses of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs). Under these guidelines, the HEIs should install a fire safety system under which mechanisms for the detection of a fire, the warning resulting from a fire and standard operating procedures for control of the fire are evolved. Students and staff should be trained in the effective operation of fire fighting devices. Mock drills for fire situation should also be undertaken at least once in a semester.*****
