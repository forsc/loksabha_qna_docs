Department of Health & Family is running National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme (NVBDCP), National TB Elimination Programme (NTEP), National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP) and National Viral Hepatitis Control Programme (NVHCP) under the aegis of National Health Mission (NHM) to prevent and control various communicable diseases, namely Vector Borne Diseases, Tuberculosis, Leprosy and Viral Hepatitis.Technical and financial support is provided to the States/UTs for implementation of these programmes, on the basis of their proposals in Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) subject to the resource envelope.For COVID-19 management, Government of India has supported the States/UTs and undertaken a series of actions including further strengthening of existing health infrastructure to ensure provisioning of sufficient hospital beds, drugs, medical oxygen and other consumables to aid proper clinical care of COVID-19 patients. Some of the ongoing initiatives to strengthen hospital infrastructure include:•	With the intent to reduce the risk of cross infection to non-COVID patients as well as to maintain continuity of non-COVID essential health services in the country, a three-tier arrangement of dedicated COVID-19 health facilities [(i) COVID Care Center (CCC); (ii) Dedicated COVID Health Centre (DCHC) and (iii) Dedicated COVID Hospital (DCH)] has been implemented in the country. •	Government of India, to supplement the hospital facilities has roped in tertiary care hospitals under ESIC, Defence, Railways, paramilitary forces, Steel Ministry etc. Further, many large temporary treatment facilities were established by DRDO to manage surge in COVID-19 cases in the country.•	The isolation bed capacity and ICU bed capacity which was only 10,180 and 2,168 before the first lockdown (as on 23rd March 2020) is being enhanced continuously and is currently at 18,03,266 isolation beds and 1,24,598 ICU beds (as on 2nd August 2021).•	The daily liquid medical oxygen (LMO) supply, which was about 1292 MTs per day in February 2021 increased to 8593 MTs in April 2021.

Restrictions were imposed on industrial use of oxygen.  •	A dynamic and transparent framework for allocation of medical oxygen in consultation with States/UTs and all the stakeholders such as relevant Ministries, manufacturers/suppliers of liquid oxygen etc. was prepared. •	Online digital solutions viz. Oxygen Demand Aggregation system (ODAS) and Oxygen Digital Tracking System (ODTS) have been developed to ascertain the demand for medical oxygen from all medical facilities and to track their transportation. •	To avoid wastage of medical oxygen, guidelines on rational use of oxygen were issued on 25th September 2020, and further revised and disseminated to States on 25th April 2021.•	1,02,400 oxygen cylinders were procured in April and May of 2020 and distributed to States.
