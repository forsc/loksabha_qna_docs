ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (c): The objectives of the JawaharNavodayaVidyalayas (JNVs) are mainly to providegood quality modern education including a strong component of culture, inculcation of values, awareness of the environment, adventure activities and physical education to the talented children predominantly from the rural areas without regard to their family''s socio-economic condition. These objectives have by and large been achieved as is evident from the demand for admission, the details of which are shown below:-<pre>Demand for admission	2016	2017	2018	2019	2020Registration for JNVST for Class VI	2163039	2211507	2777504	3110710	3164191Registration for JNVST for Class IX	171749	69309	128018	237124	232547Total	2334788	2280816	2905522	3347834	3396738</pre>As on date, there are 645 functional JNVs in the country. State/UT/ District-wise details including Chhattisgarh are annexed.(d) & (e): The NavodayaVidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one JawaharNavodayaVidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country. All the districts of the country (as on 31st May, 2014) including Mungeli in the State of Chhattisgarh (except the districts in the State of Tamil Nadu which has not yet accepted the Scheme) have been covered under the scheme.Opening of new JNVs is a continuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government/UT administration to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of the permanent building and making available required temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV depends on the availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority.*****
