ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (c):	Every citizen has a right to migrate to any part of the country. The Constitution of India guarantees the right to every citizen to move to and reside in any State/UT in search of Occupation/Job. Migration of workers from one place to another place is a continuous process and the migrant workers keep on moving from one place to another place in search of work and such workforce also keep on shifting from one sector to another sector depending upon the opportunities (such as more wages, duration and continuity of work) etc. hence, it is not feasible to keep record/data of migrant labour workforce.Contd..2/- ::  2  ::However, according to the Economic Survey 2016-17 the size of the workforce as per Census 2011 was 482 million (48.2 Crore) people and based on extrapolation, this figure would have exceeded 500 million (50 Crore) in 2016. If the share of migrants in the workforce is estimated to be even 20%, the size of the migrant workforce can be estimated to be over 100 million (10 Crore) in 2016 in absolute terms.(d):		There is no such proposal with the Government.(e):		Question does not arise in view of (d) above.*****
