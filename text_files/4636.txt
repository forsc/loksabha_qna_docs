ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                          (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) & (b): ‘Land’ and ‘Colonisation’ are State subjects. However, National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation conducts survey on particulars of slum periodically. The latest survey in this regard was conducted by NSSO during 69th round on Urban Slums, 2012. Based on the data collected by NSSO during the said survey, the estimated number of slums and slum households in the country is respectively 33,510 and 88,09,007. (c) & (d): The Government of India through various programmatic interventions has been assisting States/ UTs both technically and financially in order to address their housing shortage. In this regard the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has been implementing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) {PMAY(U)} Mission since June 2015 for providing of all weather pucca houses to all eligible urban households including slum dwellers by the year 2022. “In-situ” Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) component under PMAY(U) Mission mandates to use land as a resource for providing houses to slum dwellers. This approach aims to leverage the locked po¬tential of land under slums to provide houses to the eligible slum dwellers by bringing them into the formal urban settlement. State/UT-wise details of physical and financial progress for construction of houses for slum rehabilitation under PMAY(U) are at Annexure.(e): The MoHUA regularly monitors the progress of PMAY(U) Mission, including the ISSR component, to achieve the  target of providing pucca houses to all eligible households by 2022. The mechanism for monitoring the progress is as under: o	An Inter-Ministerial Committee viz. Central Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee (CSMC) constituted under the Chairpersonship of Secretary, MoHUA is an important decision making body responsible for overall review and monitoring of the Mission.o	A Committee of Secretary, MoHUA and Secretary, Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Finance has also been constituted for monitoring the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) component of the Mission.o	An inter-departmental State Level Sanctioning & Monitoring Committee (SLSMC) headed by the Chief Secretary of the concerned State is in-charge of overall implementation and monitoring of the Mission at State level.o	A city level Mission envisaged under the Chairpersonship of the Mayor or Chairman of the Urban Local Body (ULB) monitors the implementation of the scheme in the selected cities.(f): Pursuant to the issuance of PMAY(U) Mission guidelines, the MoHUA has written to all State/UT Governments and Central Government land owning Ministries/Departments to explore the possibilities of rehabilitation of slums on their land and seek Central Assistance from the MoHUA under PMAY(U) Mission.                           *****
