ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): No such proposal for naming of Rajamahendravaram airport as ''GMC Balayogi airport'' has been received so far from the State Government . However, the proposal of the State Government of Andhra Pradesh for renaming of Tirupathi Airport as ''Sri Venkateswara Airport, Tirupathi'' and Vijayawada Airport as ''Nandamuri Taraka Ramarao Airport, Amaravathi'' were received in the year 2017, but could not be considered due to finalisation of a policy relating to naming/renaming of airports. Since the above proposals were received before the formation of the present Government in the State of Andhra Pradesh, this Ministry has requested the State Government to convey the views of the newly elected Government on the above proposals.;
