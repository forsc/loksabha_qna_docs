(a) whether there are reports of mob lynching in many parts of the country including Assam;(b) whether there should be a separate Act to deal with cases of mob lynching and fast track courts should be established since in the present scenario the cases are heard and disposed off by referring to Section 302 CrPC and Section 149 CrPC and if so, the details thereof; and(c) whether the cases of mob lynching in different parts of the country would be reviewed in depth and remedial measures taken to prevent such occurrence; and (d) if so, the details thereof?






ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (d):	‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and State Governments are responsible for prevention, detection and investigation of crimes and for prosecuting the criminals through their law enforcement agencies. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) does not maintain specific data with  respect to lynching incidents in the country.   However, the Ministry -2-L.S.US.Q.NO.2693 FOR 09.07.2019of Home Affairs have issued advisories to States and UTs, from time to time, to maintain law and order and ensure that any person who takes law into his/her own hand is punished promptly as per law. An advisory dated 04.07.2018 was issued to the States and UTs to keep watch on circulation of fake news and rumours having potential of inciting violence, take all required measures to counter them effectively and to deal firmly with persons taking law into their own hands. Further, advisories dated 23.07.2018 and 25.09.2018 were issued to the State Governments/UT Administrations for taking measures to curb incidents of mob lynching in the country. The Government through audio-visual media has also generated public awareness to curb the menace of mob lynching. The Government has also sensitized the service providers to take steps to check the propagation of false news and rumours having potential to incite mob violence and lynching. ********
