ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d)	 Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship through National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) is supporting the University Grant Commission for three schemes namely Community College, Bachelor of Vocational course (BVOC) & Deen Dayal Upadhyaya (DDU) Kaushal Kendras which are being introduced in different colleges and universities. Currently there are 613 colleges/universities under these schemes (326 BVOC colleges, 219 Community Colleges and 68 DDU Kaushal Kendra Colleges). Further, NSDC has also collaborated with Ministry of Human Resource Development for the following:i.	Restructuring of BVOC by rolling out embedded apprenticeship under National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS). BVOC has multiple exits at Certificate, Diploma, Advance Diploma and Degree level. Through this, the employability of the general graduates is enhanced considerably as the student can have professional experience on the shop-floor, along with their graduation.ii.	Graduate students passing out in the academic year 2018-2019 would be directly channelled into industry apprenticeship for a period of 6 months to one year depending on the sector chosen.  Such apprenticeship would be assessed as per the National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) and a certificate at the appropriate NSQF level would be given to the successful students, apart from a monthly stipend depending on the location.
