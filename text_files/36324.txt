ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) & (b) : 	As per data provided by the power sector Generating companies, on the PRAAPTI Portal, at the end of February, 2022, a total amount of Rs.1,00,931 Crore was due from the DISCOMs. The details are placed at Annexure-I. 	    	The Government of India have made several interventions to improve financial and operational efficiencies of DISCOMs linked to reform measures including Liquidity Infusion Scheme (LIS); Additional Borrowing of 0.5% of GSDP to States linked to power sector reforms; introducing additional prudential norms for lending by Power Finance Corporation (PFC) Limited and REC Limited based on performance of utilities; and Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS).Government have also issued an order dated 28th June, 2019 enforcing opening and maintaining of adequate Letter of Credit (LC) as payment security mechanism under Power Purchase Agreement (PPAs) by Distribution Licensees. The order mandates NLDC & RLDC to dispatch power only after it has intimated to GENCO & DISCOM confirming opening of LC. These reform measures will improve the financial health of DISCOMs which will improve the liquidity situation leading to reduction in outstanding dues to Power Generating companies (GENCOS).(c) :		Details of Plant load factor (PLF) from thermal power plants of 25 MW and above capacity in the country during the last three years & current year i.e. from 2018-19 to 2021-22 (up to February, 2022) are given at Annexure-II.(d) :		The Plant Load Factor (PLF)/generation of thermal, (coal/lignite based) Stations depends on total electricity demand in the country and generation from various other sources like hydro, nuclear, gas etc. At all times, a balance between electricity generation and demand is required to be maintained for stable system operation. As per the Indian Electricity Grid Code notified by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), “Must Run Status” has been accorded to Renewable Energy projects (Solar, wind & Small Hydro) which therefore get dispatched on priority and are generally fully utilized. The generation from the hydro power plants is commensurate with availability of water and is generally fully utilized.               	Thus, the utilization of coal/lignite based plants depends on balance generation required from thermal Stations and the position of the particular plant in the merit order. Hence, the thermal Stations are generally operating on low PLF. The PLF of gas-based station are low due to prevailing gas shortages leading to non-availability of adequate gas.   Further, during pandemic season, electricity demand was less and hence the PLF was low in FY 2020-2021. In 2021-2022, the PLF increased over and above FY 2020-2021 due to revival of consumption.(e) :		Increasing the hours of Power Supply increase the power demand and PLF.  The Government has initiated several initiatives which include introduction of Real Time Markets and Green Term Ahead Markets. Further, the Government has recently launched a Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme, which allows financial assistance to States/DISCOMs to create Distribution Infrastructure linked to initiation of reforms and achievements of results.  The reforms include increasing the hours of power supply to urban and rural areas, for which mutually agreed upon annual trajectories till 2024-25 for improvement forms one of the parameters of evaluation. **************
