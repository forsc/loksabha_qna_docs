ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (c) :  	Yes, Sir.  Besides cost of power generation, the tariff of electricity supplied to  the  end consumers includes the transmission charges, transmission losses, distribution network charges, distribution  losses  and  commercial  losses, cross subsidy surcharge, finance cost  and other administrative expenses etc. Thus, there will be a gap between the cost of power generation and the retail tariff of electricity supplied to the consumers.		The Central Government  has been  urging the DISCOMs to take steps for reduction of losses in the distribution of electricity, increase efficiency in metering, billing and collection and strengthening the distribution system through schemes such as the  Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY), Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana ( DDUGJY)  and   Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) and give subsidies through Direct Benefit Transfer etc.**********
