Make in India and Skill India are playing complementary role to boost manufacturing sector. The Skill India initiatives of MSDE aims to prepare skilled workforce with an emphasis on 25 focus sectors of the economy.(b) and (c)	 Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) 2016-20 is being implemented with an objective to provide skilling to one crore prospective youth for four years i.e. 2016-2020. Under the scheme, short duration industry relevant skill development training is being imparted in around 350 job roles catering diverse sectors including manufacturing.

On the other hand, industries are encouraged to participate as training partners to run the high employment potential courses through appropriate accreditation and affiliation framework.
