The four codes will also facilitate ease of doing business/setting up of enterprises and catalyze creation of employment opportunities while ensuring the protection available to labourers, including unorganized workers, in terms of statutory minimum wage, social security protection and healthcare of workers. “Labour” is in the Concurrent List of the Constitution and under the four Labour Codes, rules are required to be framed by the Central Government as well as by the State Governments. The Central Government has pre-published rules under four Labour codes.*                                               *******
