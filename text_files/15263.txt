The scope of USO Fund covers all telecom services including mobile services, broadband connectivity and creation of infrastructure like Optical Fibre Cable (OFC), etc. in rural and remote areas.A number of schemes have been taken up with funding from USOF for expansion of telecom services in rural and remote areas of the country as given below:(i)	Under BharatNet project to provide broadband connectivity in all the Gram Panchayats (approx. 2.5 lakh) in the country, as of February 2020, a total of 1,36,693 Gram Panchayats (including Block Headquarters) have been made Service Ready.(ii)	Public Wi-Fi hotspots at the 25,000 rural telephone exchanges of BSNL are being provided. As of February 2020, a total of 24,289 Wi-Fi hotspots are installed and out of them, 23,787 are providing services. (iii)	For provision of mobile services in Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas, the Phase-I scheme has been completed by installing 2343 towers. (iv)	Under Comprehensive Telecom Development Plan (CTDP) for mobile connectivity in the North Eastern Region, as of February 2020, a total of 1269 towers have been installed, and out of them 1153 sites are already providing services.(v)	Laying of submarine optical fibre cable between Chennai and Andaman & Nicobar Islands for providing high bandwidth connectivity to Andaman & Nicobar Islands is in progress and is targeted to be completed by June 2020.
