ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d):	The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) introduced from Kharif 2016 season replacing the erstwhile scheme.  The scheme has further been improved and revamped w.e.f. Rabi 2018 and Kharif 2020 respectively.  New features included in the scheme are – to provide adequate risk coverage the sum insured has been equated to Scale of Finance/notional value of average yield at minimum uniform fixed premium rate payable by farmers i.e. maximum 2% for Kharif crops, 1.5% for Rabi Crop and 5% for commercial/horticultural crops, with balance of actuarial/bidded premium being shared by the Central and State Government on 50 : 50 basis;  lowering of unit area of insurance to village/village panchayat level for major crops and to individual farm level for localised risks of hailstorm, landslide, inundation, cloud burst & natural fire and post-harvest losses due to cyclonic/unseasonal rains and hailstorm thereby promoting more realistic assessment of losses.  Due to these improved features participation in the scheme has increased from about 23% of Gross Cropped Area (GCA)/farmer applications under erstwhile schemes to 30%.Contd…..2/-- 2 -As per provisions of the scheme, crops and areas are to be notified by the concerned State Government.  All food crops (cereals, millets and pulses), Oilseeds, commercial/horticultural crops can be notified under the PMFBY by the concerned State Government subject to availability of requisite past yield data and capacity of the State to conduct requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) to assess the claim.  For crops where past yield data is not available or State Government is not able to conduct requisite number of CCEs can be notified under Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS).   Since the schemes are voluntary for the farmers, the coverage of farmers under the schemes depends on number of notified crops and areas notified and the risk associated with these crops/areas and perception of risks by the concerned farmers. District-wise details of total number of farmers and farmer applications enrolled in Karnataka during 2020-21 under PMFBY are annexed.
