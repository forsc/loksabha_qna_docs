ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)to (d) The Central Government launched National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) as a long-term, time-bound, national level strategy to tackle the air pollution problem across the country in a comprehensive manner with targets to achieve 20 % to 30 % reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations by 2024 keeping 2017 as the base year for the comparison of concentration. 102 non-attainment cities have been identified based on ambient air quality data for the period 2011 – 2015 and WHO report 2014/2018. The city specific Action Plans have been approved for ground implementation for all 102 non-attainment cities. Out of 102 non-attainment cities identified under NCAP, Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change is funding ?10 Crores in the current year for 28 cities with million plus population and PM10>90µg/m³. For the remaining non-attainment cities, funds of ?10 lakhs per city for cities with population less than 5 lakhs and ? 20 lakhs per city, for cities with a population of 5 to10 lakhs are allocated.  Under National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP) there are 793 Manual stations covering 344 cities/towns across the country. Number of ambient air quality stations increased from 590 during 2014 to 793 stations in 2019.The Central Government has taken several measures for prevention, control and abatement of air pollution across the country whichinter alia includesincrease of monitoring network for assessment of ambient air quality, notification of National Ambient Air Quality Standards, Launch of National Air Quality Index, Implementation of Air Quality Early Warning System etc. All these measures helped in the improvement of overall air quality in the country.Further,On the analysis of last five-year ambient air quality data (2014-2018), across the country, it is observed that most of the cities were within the National Standards with respect to parameters of SO2 and NO2. With respect to PM10 and PM2.5, 18 and 12 cities respectively showed decreasing trend. In reference to Delhi, there has been an overall improvement in air quality of Delhi in 2019 as compared to that of 2016. The number of ‘Good to ‘Moderate’ days has increased to 175 in 2019 as compared to 108 in 2016. ***
