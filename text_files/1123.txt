In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes such as Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP),Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of water bodies etc. under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY).             At present, there is no ongoing project of Tamil Nadu under PMKSY-AIBP.  The Govt. of Tamil Nadu has requested for funding a scheme “Formation of Flood Carrier Canal from Kannadian Channel to drought prone area of Sathankulam, Thisayanvilai by interlinking Tamirabarani, Karumeniyar and Nambiyar rivers in Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi Districts of Tamil Nadu”under PMKSY-AIBP.  However, the Investment Clearance for the same was valid up to 18.4.2019.State has now requested for extension of the same.  Central Water Commission has sought certain information in this regard from the State Government.  The State Government has not sent the requisite information.            In respect of RRR of Water Bodies scheme, Central Assistance (CA) is released from time to time as per guidelines of the scheme and availability of budget on receipt of eligible proposals.  CA of Rs.7.0279 crore was released in respect of cluster of 49 water bodies in the State of Tamil Nadu during 2018-19 as per eligibility.*****
