ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????   (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	The State-wise and District-wise details of the beneficiaries under PM-KISAN Scheme  are given at Annexure I.(b)	The size of landholding is not a criterion for farmers families to get the benefit of PM-KISAN Scheme. The district-wise details of beneficiaries of PM-KISAN Scheme in the State of Maharashtra are given at Annexure-II.(c), (d) & (e) The PM-KISAN Scheme is an ongoing and continuous Scheme and, as and when the correct and verified data of registered farmers is received on the PM-KISAN portal from respective States/UTs and its subsequent validation through Aadhaar/PFMS, the benefits of the Scheme are transferred into the bank account of intended beneficiaries through DBT mode.  	The prevailing land-ownership system/record of land in different States/Union Territories is being used to identify the intended beneficiaries for transfer of benefits under PM-KISAN scheme. The responsibility of identifying the landholder farmer families eligible for benefit under the scheme is that of respective States/UTs Government. For enrollment, the farmer is required to approach the local patwari / revenue officer / Nodal Officer (PM-Kisan) nominated by the State Government. Farmers can also do their self-registration through the Farmers Corner in the portal. The Common Service Centres (CSCs) have also been authorized to do registration of the farmers for the Scheme upon payment of fees. The structure of the Scheme inherently comprises of mechanism for exclusion of errors on the basis of continuous verification and validation of data of beneficiaries by various authorities like Aadhaar/PFMS/Income Tax database. After successful verification and validation of data, the benefits are transferred to intended beneficiaries. To monitor the implementation of the Scheme, a central PMU, namely, the National Farmers Welfare Program Implementation Society, has been established as a registered agency under Societies Registration Act, 1860. This Society  also acts as the central PMU for Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan Dhan Yojana (PM-KMY), another Central Sector Scheme. The PMU is entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring uploading of required data by the States / UTs on PM-Kisan portal, timely fund transfer to the beneficiaries, continuous review and monitoring of the scheme, publicity (Information, Education and Communication-IEC) campaign, incentive to field functionaries, etc.Weekly Video Conferences are conducted with all states to encourage them for faster implementation, review the status of implementation of the Scheme and to address any and all the issues therein. The target of the Department is to achieve 100% saturation by enrolling every eligible farmer family of the country under the PM-KISAN Scheme. To achieve this the States/UTs have been directed to conduct various saturation drives based on the analysis of enrolments from all over the country done by the Department. Physical verification of the beneficiaries have also been undertaken. The State Governments have been continuously requested and vigorously pursued for completing the exercise of Aadhaar seeding of data of beneficiaries at the earliest, in mission mode and by organizing camps. Every Tuesday, a meeting is being held with State Governments and other concerned stakeholders through Video Conferencing to review the preparedness of the States and remove any handicaps coming in the way of smooth and seamless implementation of the schemeHowever, the Scheme can’t be monitored by DISHA Committee. (f)	The structure of the Scheme inherently comprises of mechanism for exclusion of errors on the basis of continuous verification and validation of data of beneficiaries by various authorities like Aadhaar/PFMS/Income Tax database. However, during the process of verification it was found that benefit of the Scheme was transferred to some ineligible beneficiaries including some income tax payee farmers. The State-wise list of such ineligible beneficiaries along with amount to be recovered from them  is enclosed at Annexure-III.(g)	 The following special measures have been taken by the Government to ensure that the funds are not being misused and the scheme is properly implemented in order to benefit genuine farmers:(i)	Standard Operation Guidelines have been issued for recovering money from ineligible beneficiaries.(ii)	Standard Operational Guidelines for identification of Income Tax Payees have been prepared and circulated to the States.(iii)	Caution Advisory to the States to adopt measures during the registration and verification of farmers under the PM-KISAN scheme.(iv)	Standard Operational Guidelines for Physical Verification of PM-KISAN beneficiaries have been circulated to the State Governments.
