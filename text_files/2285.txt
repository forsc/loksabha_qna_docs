ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a): The Government is committed to the strategic disinvestment of Air India. Based on recommendations of NITI Aayog in May, 2017, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on 28.06.2017 approved strategic disinvestment of Air India group. The Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM) in its earlier meetings held on 21.3.2018 and 26.3.2018, inter-alia, approved disinvestment of Air India (AI)  with transfer of management control and sale of 76% equity share capital of AI held by Gol. ;;(b):  Probable reasons as analyzed by the Transaction Advisor, i.e., M/s EY for non-receipt of bids, inter alia, are Government of India''s 24% stake and corresponding rights, high amount of allocated debt, changes in macro environment, individuals not being allowed to bid, profitability track record and bidders not being able to form a consortium within given time period. ;(c): An Air India Specific Alternate Mechanism (AISAM) was constituted to guide the process of strategic disinvestment from time to time and decide issues which include:- ;;i. treatment of unsustainable debt of Air India,;ii. hiving off of certain assets to a shell company,;iii. demerger and strategic disinvestment of three profit making subsidiaries,;iv. the quantum of disinvestment; and ;v. the universe of bidders.;;;Further, an AISAM with new members is likely to be re-constituted soon.(d):  Air India Limited had held consultations with its employees during the process of strategic disinvestment. No consultations were carried out with sections of passenger groups to allay their concerns about air traffic monopolization and fare monopoly by private airlines.
