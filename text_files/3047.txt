                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)   (a) to (e): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.2926 BY SHRI HANUMAN BENIWAL TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 10.07.2019 REGARDING RUBs/RUPs(a) to (e):  Yes, Sir. (i)	Level crossings with Train Vehicle Unit (TVU) more than 1 lakh qualify for replacement by ROB/RUB on cost sharing basis. (ii)	Level Crossings in the following areas with TVU less than 1 lakh can also be considered for replacement by ROB/RUB on cost sharing basis. •	Suburban sections having high frequency of train services; and•	Near stations where detentions to road traffic are very high on account of either shunting operations or multi directional receipt/despatch of trains or stabling of trains etc.However, Level Crossings (LCs) which do not qualify for sanction of Road under Bridge (RUB) on cost sharing basis can be planned for elimination by subways, if found, technically feasible. Vertical clearance of such subway should be kept below 5.0 M and sanctioned at Railway’s cost, i.e. Railways will bear the complete initial cost of construction of subway (bridge and approach portion within or outside Railway land) and future maintenance cost of such subway proper.	If land is required over and above the road passing through the LC for the purpose of construction of subway, the State Government will acquire and provide encumbrance free land free of cost outside the Railway area. Also, the responsibility for the maintenance of road passing through subway, lighting, drainage system, diversion road and any other allied works in Railway portion will be with Railways and beyond Railway portion the responsibility of maintenance rests with State Government. In addition, it has been decided that Railways must obtain consent for closure of LC prior to construction of subway from concerned Road Authority and the demarcation of maintenance responsibility should clearly indicated.One proposal for construction of RUB in lieu of LC No. 110 Chanderiya-Ratlam section in the State of Rajasthan is under consideration for sanction in the Budget 2019-20.*****
