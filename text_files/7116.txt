                                                        THE MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a) to (c)  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. *63 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 21.11.2019 REGARDING “WATER SCARCITY IN MAJOR CITIES” ASKED BY SHRI BALUBHAU ALIAS SURESH NARAYAN DHANORKAR & SHRI K. NAVASKANI, M.P.s(a)  NITI Aayog, in its report titled “Composite Water Management Index” published in June 2018, has mentioned that 21 major cities are expected to run out of groundwater by 2020. This is based on the estimates of annual groundwater replenishment and its extraction. However, it does not take into account the groundwater availability in the deeper aquifers. Names of such cities as intimated by NITI Aayog are given at Annexure - I.(b) & (c)  Practices for efficient and sustainable management of water resources such as conjunctive use of surface water and ground water resources, participatory ground water practices, increasing water use efficiency amongst others need to be promoted on a large scale by involving all the stake-holders to deal with future water demand challenges. Water being a State subject, efforts to initiate suitable demand side and supply side interventions including conservation and management of water resources is primarily States’ responsibility. However, steps taken by the Central Government in this regard are at the following URL: http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf.Government of India is actively considering the ‘Interlinking of Rivers’ (ILR) programme as one of the interventions for sustainable management of water resources in the country. Under the National Perspective Plan (NPP), for water transfer from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component and 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). The details of above river linking projects viz., rivers, States concerned, present status are given at Annexure-II.                The implementation of NPP is likely to raise the ultimate irrigation potential through surface and ground water resources from 140 million Ha to 175 million Ha, generation of 34 million KW of power, apart from the incidental benefits of water supply, flood control, drought mitigation, navigation, fisheries, salinity and pollution control etc.As per information received from Department of Science and Technology, use of seawater in coastal States could be a sustainable solution for availability of drinking water; however, the available technologies are relatively expensive.*****ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) of Starred Question No. *63 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 21.11.2019 regarding “Water Scarcity in Major Cities”Cities likely to face water scarcity as per NITI Aayog reportS.No	State	City1.
