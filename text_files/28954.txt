Government engaged itself actively and constantly with the agitating farmer unions to end the protests and 11 rounds of negotiating talks were held between the Government & agitating farmer unions to resolve the issues.

(c):	 Government of India announces Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for 22 major agricultural commodities of Fair Average Quality (FAQ) each year in both the crop seasons after taking into account the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). Government also extends remunerative price to farmers through its various interventions schemes. The procurement at MSP is done by Central and State Agencies under various schemes of Government. Besides, the overall market also responds to declaration of MSP and Government’s procurement operations, resulting in increase of selling price of the various notified crops.` Government is implementing Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan’ (PM-AASHA), an umbrella scheme to ensure Minimum Support Price (MSP) to farmers. It comprises the erstwhile Price Support Scheme (PSS) with certain modifications and rolling out of new schemes of Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) and pilot of Private Procurement and Stockist Scheme (PPSS). Under PM-AASHA, States/UTs are offered to choose either PSS and PDPS in a given procurement season with respect to particular oilseeds crop for the entire State. Pulses and Copra are procured under PSS. Only one scheme i.e. PSS or PDPS may be made operational in one State with respect to one commodity. Further, states have the option to roll out Private Procurement and Stockiest Scheme (PPSS) on pilot basis in district/selected APMCs of district involving the participation of private stockist for oilseeds. Further, wheat paddy and coarse grains are procured under the existing schemes of Department of Food and Public Distribution and Cotton is procured under the existing schemes of Ministry of Textiles. (d) to (f):	 The Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare has no record in the matter and hence the question does not arise. *****
