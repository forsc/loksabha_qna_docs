                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)  to (c):      As per the Population Census conducted by the Registrar General of India, the total number of cultivators in the country has been decreased from  (127.3 million in 2001 to 118.8 million cultivators) in 2011. State/UT-wise details of number of cultivators per Census 2001 and 2011 is given in the Annexure.            Since the Population Census is conducted after every 10 years, the details of farmers who have shifted from agriculture to other occupations since 2011 are not known.(d):	 The farmers themselves decide the acreage to put under cultivation for different cereal crops and/ or the cash crops, keeping in view the shift in consumption patterns and varying market conditions. Government is, however, promoting integrated farming with focus on horticulture, floriculture, bee-keeping, fisheries, agro-forestry, etc., to diversify the income base of agricultural households. Contd…2/--2-(e):	  With a view to make agriculture attractive and more remunerative, various schemes are being implemented by the Government. These include, inter alia, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY); Soil Health Card (SHC) Scheme; National Agriculture Market Scheme (e-NAM); Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY); National Food Security Mission (NFSM); Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA); Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH); and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY). Besides, Government has adopted the principle of fixing Minimum Support Price (MSP) at a level of 50 per cent over the all-India weighted average cost of production of crops. Moreover, with a view to provide income support to all farmers’ families across the country, the Central Government has started a new Central Sector Scheme, namely, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN). The Scheme aims to provide a payment of Rs. 6000/- per year, in three installments of Rs. 2000/- each to the farmer families, subject to certain exclusions relating to higher income groups.
