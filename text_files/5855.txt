ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b)  Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) is periodically monitoring the ground water levels throughout the country on a regional scale, through a network of monitoring wells including major cities. In order to assess the decline in water level on a long-term basis, pre-monsoon water level data collected by CGWB during pre-monsoon 2018 has been compared with the decadal average (2008-2017). Analysis of water level data indicates that about 56% of the wells monitored have registered decline in ground water levels, mostly in the range of 0 – 2 m. Decline of more than 4 m has also been observed in few pockets of some Urban areas in the country viz. Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Nasik, Pune, Kannur, Ranchi, Dhanbad, Indore, Gwalior, Faridabad, Chandigarh, Coimbatore, Madurai, Dehradun, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bhubaneswar, Allahabad and Lucknow. In Chennai, about 85% of the wells monitored have registered decline in ground water levels, mostly in the range of 0 – 2 m. Central Water Commission monitors live storage status of 91 reservoirs of the country on weekly basis and is issuing weekly bulletin. The total live storage capacity of these 91 reservoirs is 161.993 BCM which is about 63% of the total live storage capacity of 257.812 BCM estimated to have been created in the country. As per reservoir storage bulletin dated 18.07.2019, live storage available in these reservoirs is 39.319 BCM, which is 24% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 32% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 28% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. In Tamil Nadu, CWC monitors live storage status of 6 reservoirs which have total live storage capacity of 4.23 BCM. As per Reservoir Storage Bulletin dated 18.07.2019, the total live storage available in these reservoirs is 0.6 BCM which is 14% of total live storage capacity of these reservoirs. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 74% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 39% of live storage capacity of these reservoirs. Thus, the storage position in the country as well as in Tamil Nadu is less than the corresponding period of last year and is also less than the average storage of last ten years during the corresponding period.Contd…P/2//2//(c)	   Water being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation, artificial recharge to ground water and efficient management of water resources including tackling of water crisis are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments. In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Central Government provides technical and financial assistance to them through various schemes and programmes. Central Government has also taken various steps to tackle water crisis in the country.The Ministry of Jal Shakti has been created by the Government of India, integrating the erstwhile Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, and the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, with an aim to integrate water resources management under one umbrella so that the issues relating to water are dealt in a holistic manner.Central Government has formulated a National Perspective Plan (NPP) for Water Resources Development which envisages transfer of water from water surplus basins to water deficit basins to improve availability of water. For improving the coverage of safe drinking water to rural population, Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation under this Ministry supplements the efforts of the States by providing them with technical and financial assistance through the National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP).Government of India has launched the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) on 25th June, 2015 in 500 cities across the country including Chennai for a period of five years with focus on development of basic urban infrastructure in these cities. One of the priority sector under AMRUT Mission is water supply.Central Government has launched Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) which aims to enhance physical access of water on farm and expand cultivable area under assured irrigation, improve farm water use efficiency, introduce sustainable water conservation practices, etc. During 2016-17, 99 on-going Major/Medium irrigation projects under PMKSY-Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) having ultimate irrigation potential of 76.03 lakh hectares have been prioritized in consultation with States, for completion in phases up to December, 2019.Central Ground Water Board is implementing a nationwide programme of “National Aquifer Mapping and Management (NAQUIM)” for mapping of aquifers and development of aquifer management plans to facilitate sustainable development of ground water resources.  Government of India has launched the Jal Shakti Abhiyan which is a time bound campaign with a mission mode approach intended to improve water availability including ground water conditions in the water stressed blocks. Some of the initiatives/measures taken by Central Government to control ground water depletion and promote rain water harvesting/ conservation are available at the URL:http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf*****
