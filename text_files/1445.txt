                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (e):	The World Health Organization  (WHO) in its report on ‘Health Workforce in India’ has claimed that 57% of allopathic doctors in India do not have medical qualification. The report is erroneous since MBBS is the minimum qualification for enrolment as a registered medical practitioner in a State Medical Register to practice medicine, and all registered doctors have medical qualifications. Section 15 of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 prohibits a person other than medical practitioner enrolled on a State Medical Register to practice medicine in the State. Since health is a State subject, the primary responsibility to deal with such cases of quacks lies with the respective State Government. The Central Government, keeping view of the above, requested Chief Ministers of all the States to take appropriate action under the law against quacks and also to evolve suitable policies to ensure availability of quality health workforce in rural areas.
