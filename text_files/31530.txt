                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????  (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (f):     Agricultural mechanization is an important element of crop production system in the country which helps in increasing agriculture production and productivity, improving utilization efficiency of costlier inputs such as seeds, fertilizers and irrigation water, besides reducing human drudgery associated with various agricultural operations.             The level of agricultural mechanization is expressed as a ratio of available mechanical power to cultivable unit area as kilowatt/hectare (kW/ha). As per the impact and evaluation study of Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM), the availability of farm power in 2016-17 was 2.02 kW/ha, which has been increased to 2.49 kW/ha in 2018-19. The States such as Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra and all the North Eastern and Himalayan Sates have the farm power availability less than the National average of 2.49 kW/ha.             For promotion of agricultural mechanization in the country, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme ‘Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization’ (SMAM) is being implemented through the State Governments w.e.f. 2014-15, with major the objectives of increasing the reach of farm mechanization to small and marginal farmers and to the regions where availability of farm power is low. Under this scheme, besides performance testing of agricultural machinery and equipment, capacity building of farmers & end users and promoting farm mechanization through demonstrations, financial assistance @ 40% to 50% of the cost depending on the categories of farmers, is provided for purchase of agricultural machines.  Financial assistance @ 40% of the project cost is also provided to rural youth & farmer as an entrepreneur, Cooperative Societies of Farmers, Registered Farmers Societies, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) and Panchayats for establishment of Custom Hiring Centres and Hi-tech hubs of high value agricultural machines. Financial assistance @ 80% of the project cost for the projects costing upto Rs. 10 Lakhs is provided to the Cooperative Societies, Registered Farmer Societies, FPOs and Panchayats for setting up of village level Farm Machinery Banks (FMBs). The rate of financial assistance for the North Eastern States for establishment of FMBs is @95% of the project cost.*****
