                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OFMICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES(SHRI  PRATAP CHANDRA SARANGI)(a): 	Yes, Sir. Coir Geotextiles protect land surface from soil erosion and promote quick vegetation. Coir Woven Bhoovastra control soil erosion by acting as a ground cover. It also protects the earth and promotes vegetation retaining precious topsoil.  IIT Madras has also given its recommendations on the application of Coir Geo textiles in Infrastructure Projects. Some of them are as follows: i)	Coir geo-textiles have superior erosion control capability for protection of embankment slopes in roads, railways and natural hill slopes.ii)	The application of coir geo-textiles for construction of rural roads is found to be economical of the order of 20% to 30%. In addition, the service life of the rural roads is expected to increase by 70% to 80% by using coir geo-textiles.iii)	Combination of coir geo-textiles and coco-logs have high potential for protection of small canal banks.Specific targets have not been fixed for the production of coir geotextiles for the current financial year. However, the National Rural Infrastructural Development Agency (NRIDA) has issued order dated 23.04.2020 to use Coir Geotextiles (CGT) in the construction of 5% of total rural roads under the PMGSY-III in 7 States (Kerala, Tamilnadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Odisha) for a total length of 1674 kms. This will work out to 1,00,44,000 sq. mtrs. of coir geotextiles with an approximate cost of Rs. 80 crores. (b): 	Yes, Sir.   Coir Board under Ministry of MSME has signed an MoU with IIT Madras on 27.04.2020 for establishing a Centre of Excellence for “Application of coir exclusively or in combination with other natural fibres”.(c): 	The financial assistance provided by Coir Board for the establishment of the Centre of Excellence (CoE) is Rs. 2.00 crore towards the running costs of CoE initially for a period of 2 years.  (d): 	The major focus area of research and development of the CoE will be focusing on coir geotextiles, its application in infrastructure projects and standardisation and the design standardisation and development of energy efficient machinery for the coir industry. The following services will be provided by the CoE established at IIT Madras:(i)	Supporting the development of coir products & relevant technology and evolving standards for production and processing through specific projects.(ii)	Identifying, awarding, evaluating and monitoring research projects with approval of Coir Board.(iii)	Providing necessary assistance in selection of scientific and technical personnel for the Coir Board and their associated laboratories and such other requirements that may be required from time to time.(iv)	Mentoring of Coir Board’s research institutes/laboratories.(v)	Help in capacity building by way of organizing tailor made training programs and technical seminars/workshops.(vi)	Assisting in generating the Intellectual Property Rights and technology transfer(vii)	Such other services that may arise from time to time for the functioning of the Centre of Excellence, with mutual concurrence.(e): 	Coir Board has evolved a ‘Master Plan’ for the use of Coir Geotextiles (CGT) in the construction of rural roads in PMGSY III in seven states as per the orders of NRIDA vide letter dated 23.04.2020. A Coir Geotextile Consultancy Bureau (CGCB) is constituted to provide consultancy support to the industries as well as end users in different States. A Coir Geotextiles (PMGSY) cell has been constituted at the Coir Board’s Central Coir Research Institute for the effective implementation of ‘Master Plan’ for monitoring the PMGSY-III by assuring the quality supply of coir geotextiles and providing training and other necessary technical support on the use of coir geotextiles in the construction of rural roads.
