ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI FAGGAN SINGH KULASTE)(a)&(b)   No central team has been deputed for enquiry of any projects under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) scheme in Bargarh Parliamentary Constituency in the recent past. However, as per the guidelines of PMGSY, National Quality Monitors (NQMs) are deputed by the Ministry and State Quality Monitors (SQMs) by the State for inspection of PMGSY projects to ensure quality of the works implemented under PMGSY at various stages of construction. The details of NQM/SQM inspections of the works under Bargarh Parliamentary Constituency from April, 2020 to 3rd February, 2022 are as under: Type of Quality  Total No of          Works found        Works found Satisfactory  Works foundMonitor (QM)	 works inspected      Satisfactory (S)	 but Requiring             Unsatisfactory (U)                                                         Improvement (SRI)	  NQM	           76	                 66	             5	                       5SQM	          134	                119	             8	                       7 As per the programme guidelines, whenever, a work is reported as deficient by quality monitors, on account of either structural and non-structural defects, the Programme Implementation Unit (PIU) ensures that the contractor replaces the material or rectifies the workmanship, as the case may be. The Action Taken Report (ATR) for each such work, is verified on ground by the SQMs. Thereafter, the State Quality Coordinator (SQC) examines the ATR for each such work and furnishes the compliance report. Accordingly, out of 10 works graded as U/SRI by NQM, compliance in respect of 5 works have already been submitted after due verifications by SQMs. In case of inspection by SQMs, out of 15 works which were found SRI/U, action taken report in respect of 13 works have already been submitted.(c) & (d)    As per programme guidelines, the tendering and execution of projects sanctioned under PMGSY is the responsibility of the concerned state government. The State Governments/ Implementing Agencies have to follow the Standard Bidding Document (SBD) for all the tenders under PMGSY. In terms of the provisions of SBD, Additional Performance Security in case of Abnormally Low Bids (ALBs) is to be taken from the contractors.Instructions have been issued to the states that in case of imbalanced bids detailed price analysis will be submitted by the bidders for reasonability of rates. Works will be executed as per quality standards and additional number of inspections by SQMs should be done for these types of works. (e)      PMGSY has a very well structured three-tiered Quality Control mechanism for ensuring construction of quality road works and durability of road assets under PMGSY. Under the first tier, the Programme Implementation Units (PIUs) are required to ensure process control through mandatory tests on material and workmanship at field laboratory. The second tier is a structured independent quality monitoring at the State level through State Quality Monitors (SQMs) to ensure that every work is inspected at initial stage, middle stage and final stage of the construction. Under the third tier, independent National Quality Monitors (NQMs) are deployed for random inspection of road works to monitor quality and also to provide guidance of senior professionals to the field functionaries. Based on the periodic monitoring of quality of roads under the 3-tier mechanism, corrective measures, wherever necessary, are taken by the State Governments. During the last two years, 8 nos. of projects under Bargarh Parliamentary Constituency were awarded below 14.99% of the estimated value. Out of which, 3 nos. of works are in progress and other are reported to be at the agreement stage. Accordingly, the inspection has been conducted for 3 works by NQMs & SQMs at different times. The details of the same are given below: -District	Package No	Road Name	       NQM/SQM	   Date of inspection	      GradeBargarh	        OR03254	       MRL13-Kandhumunda          1.NQM       29/08/2021        Satisfactory                               Chhak to NathapaliChhak    2.SQM       13/12/2021        Satisfactory                              via Dangbahal, Lebidi	  3.SQM       17/08/2021        Satisfactory  Jharsuguda	OR1468	      MRL 11-Telimal to Madhupur  1.NQM       19/08/2021         Satisfactory                              via Baddhuriaam	          2.SQM       28/07/2021         Satisfactory                                                          3.SQM       20/12/2021         Satisfactory  Jharsuguda	OR1465	      MRL 10-Kukerama to          1.NQM       23/10/2021        Satisfactory                              Nandamunda	          2.SQM       26/08/2021        Satisfactory                                                          3.SQM        20/12/2021       Satisfactory   As per guidelines 100% works are to be inspected by SQMs. *******
