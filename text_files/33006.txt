ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b)  Shyama Prasad Mookerjee Port, Kolkata (SMPK), erstwhile Kolkata Port Trust undertakes regular maintenance dredging in its navigational channel for movement of large vessels to Haldia, Kolkata.   As a result, adequate draft is maintained for movement of small vessels in the shipping channel.   No report regarding RoRo barges and boating vessels sailing across the river getting stuck within the limits of SMPK has been received.          No incidence of Roll-on Roll-off barges or vessels getting stuck on the National Waterways in the State of West Bengal and other parts of the country in the jurisdiction of Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has been reported.  (c) & (d)  Most of the rivers/ National Waterways (NWs) are alluvial rivers with semi-permanent nature of earthen/ sandy banks vulnerable  to severe  erosion  due  to  annual  floods  and  have  a  heavy  silt  load.  Besides, inadequate discharges in the rivers during lean season results in inadequate fairway availability.  Further, meandering and braiding of alluvial rivers/ National Waterways (NWs) and the erosion of their banks causes excessive siltation which reduces the depth/ draft for the vessel movement.  To address these issues, alignment of navigation channel is identified by regular computerized hydrographic surveys along the NWs after floods/ monsoons.  IWAI conducts fortnightly/ monthly hydrographic surveys regularly along the navigation channel of NWs for identification of shallow portion due to siltation.  Based on the feedback, maintenance activities for sustained fairway are undertaken through dredging, River conservancy works like bandalling, river training works as per the field conditions.  To avoid siltation, SMPK has to undertake considerable maintenance dredging on regular basis in its navigational channels leading to Haldia Dock Complex (HDC) and Kolkata Dock System (KDS) so as to avert/ minimize dead freighting of vessels.  Details of dredging activity at SMPK is summarized in the table below:<pre>Year	Quantity Dredged in Million Cu. M	Cost incurred in Rs. Crore	Annual  Average Draft achieved in Mtrs.2009-10 	25.81	335.13	7.32010-11 	23.74	313.50	7.02011-12 	14.57	289.78	7.22012-13 	16.89	309.89	7.32013-14 	19.09	330.38	7.22014-15 	17.90	396.28	7.22015-16 	16.165	386.18	7.52016-17 	7.683	255.11	7.52017-18 	9.917	252.09	7.72018-19 	10.815	260.00	7.92019-20 	7.844	205.15	8.12020-21 	6.866	180.39	8.2                                           </pre>  SMPK has been able to tackle the problem of siltation in effective and efficient manner. The cost of dredging and quantity of dredged materials have reduced whereas the annual average draft has increased over the years.                                          *****
