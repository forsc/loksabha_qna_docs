                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING (SHRI GIRIRAJ SINGH)(a)  to  (c)  :      A Statement is placed on the Table of the House.Statement referred to in reply to the Lok Sabha Starred Question No *321 put in by Shri Anubhav Mohanty, Member of Parliament for answer on 17th March,2020 regarding Cold Storages for Fish(a) to (c)  :   The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Government of India assists the fish farmers through its ongoing schemes and programmes in establishing cold storage facilities for storage and preservation of varieties of fish and fish products. However, the Department of Fisheries on its own does not establish and operate cold storage. Cold storages enhance marketability of fish and fish products by prolonging their shelf life, reduce post-harvest losses due to spoilage and facilitate sale throughout the year. Since 2015-16, financial assistance has been provided under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) on Blue Revolution: Integrated Development and Management of Fisheries to fish farmers for development of cold storages, ice plants, ice plants-cum-cold storages, insulated and refrigerated fish transport facilities. Similarly, the Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) implemented by the Department of Fisheries also provides concessional finance for development of post harvest infrastructure like ice plants and cold storages for fish and fish products. Further, the Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying has formulated a new scheme - Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) for implementation over the next five years. The PMMSY inter-alia envisages to support fisheries infrastructure projects including cold storages.*****
