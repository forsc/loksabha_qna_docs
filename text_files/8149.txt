ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF JAL SHAKTI(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (e) 	Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) [SBM(G)] was launched with the aim to achieve Open Defecation Free (ODF) India by providing access to toilet facilities to all the rural households by 2nd October, 2019 and to improve overall cleanliness of villages through Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM).  	As Sanitation is a State subject, SBM(G) is implemented by the State Governments. Government of India only provides technical and financial support to the State Governments to supplement their efforts in achieving the goal of the programme. Under SBM(G), flexibility has been provided to the States to adopt appropriate technologies best suited to the local conditions.  However, use of safe and eco-friendly onsite toilet technologies are encouraged for construction of toilets. Twin leach pit toilet technology is promoted for most parts of the country under which human feces automatically becomes manure within the pit in 1-2 years and no drainage is required.  And, for safe disposal of grey water, primary focus is on construction of soak pits.  Besides, construction of Waste Stabilization Ponds in the bigger villages, reuse of grey water for agriculture purposes, etc. are also encouraged to be adopted for grey water management. ****
