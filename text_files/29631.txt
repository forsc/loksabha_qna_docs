ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (d) : The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country. Construction of permanent buildings for JNVs is a continuous process, which depends upon the willingness of the concerned State Government/UT administration to make available requisite suitable land, free of cost, in favour of Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) for construction of the permanent building. For opening of JNVs, the concerned State Government/District Administration has to provide 30 acres of land, free of cost, and free from all encumbrances along with sufficient temporary accommodation to run the Vidyalayas for 3-4 years or till own permanent buildings are constructed.JNV sanctioned in Palamu district during the year 2002 – 03 is functioning from temporary site provided by State Government. Construction of the JNV, Palamu building could not be started at permanent site as the land offered by the State Government of Jharkhand is a forest land. The construction work of an additional JNV (Palamu-II), sanctioned in 2008, has already been started at the permanent site.*****
