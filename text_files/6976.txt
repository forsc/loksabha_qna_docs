                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b) Airlines are free to select whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate within the ambit of bilateral agreements. It is, therefore, upon the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and their commercial viability and the Government has no role in this matter. Though Kathmandu is available as a point of call for Indian carriers and Indian carriers can operate from Bagdogra to Kathmandu within overall capacity entitlements, no proposal/information has been received from any airline regarding starting of flights between Kathmandu and Bagdogra. (c) There is no such proposal presently under consideration.
