ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND POWER (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) to (h) As per a study conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai in association with CRISIL Risk and Infrastructure Solutions Limited in December 2014, the tidal power potential of the country is estimated at around 12,455 MW. The potential areas with low/medium tidal wave strength are in the Gulf of Khambat & Gulf of Kutch in Gujarat, Palk Bay-Mannar Channel in Tamil Nadu, and Hoogly river, South Haldia & Sunderbans in West Bengal. The State-wise estimated theoretical potential of tidal energy is as follows:State	Estimated Theoretical Potential (MW)Gujarat	10,425 West Bengal	900Odisha	400Tamil Nadu	230Maharashtra 	200Andhra Pradesh	100Karnataka	100Kerala	100Total	12,455The earlier efforts for harnessing tidal power were not successful due to high capital cost ranging from Rs. 30 crore to Rs. 60 crore per MW. MNRE had sanctioned a demonstration project for setting up of 3.75 MW capacity tidal power plant in Sunderbans region in West Bengal in 2007. However, the project was not taken up by the Govt. of West Bengal due to high capital cost of Rs. 238 crore. Similarly, the Govt. of Gujarat had proposed 50 MW tidal power project in 2011. This project was also not taken up by Govt. of Gujarat due to high capital cost of Rs. 750 crore.At present, due to very high capital cost, the Government of India has not put in place any policy or programme for production of tidal energy.*****
