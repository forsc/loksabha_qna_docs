ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES & PUBLIC ENTERPRISES(SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a) to (d): The National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020 is a National Mission document providing the vision and roadmap for the faster adoption of electric vehicles and their manufacturing in the country.  This plan has been designed to enhance national fuel security, to provide affordable and environmentally friendly transportation and to enable the Indian automotive industry to achieve global manufacturing leadership. As part of the NEMMP 2020, Department of Heavy Industry formulated a Scheme namely Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles India (FAME-India) Scheme in March, 2015 to promote electric & hybrid vehicle (xEVs) in the country. The Phase-1 of the scheme was available up to 31st March, 2019. The Scheme had four focus areas, namely, Demand Creation, Pilot Project, Technology Development/ R&D and Charging Infrastructure. The Scheme has been amended from time to time, as per notification detailed below: -•	Vide Notification S.O. 2696(E) dated 30/08/2015, the scheme for Electric and Hybrid 2W and 3W of all types was made applicable for their sale anywhere in India.•	The Scheme for 3W (Category L5) was further extended for Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) variant vide Notification S.O. 4175(E) dated 23/12/2016.•	Electric 3W (with maximum speed not exceeding 25km/hr.) has also been included for availing incentive under the scheme Vide Notification S.O. 2199(E) dated 04/07/2017.•	L5 category has been included in the retro fitment category vide Notification S.O. 2198(E) dated 12/07/2017.•	Fully Electric Bus has also been included for demand incentive under the Scheme Vide Notification S.O. 3012(E) dated 12/09/2017.•	Vide Notification S.O. 4994(E) dated 27/09/2018, the benefits of incentive available to Conventional Battery Vehicles were discontinued w.e.f. 1st October, 2018 to promote Advanced Battery Vehicles.		Based on the outcome and experience gained during Phase-I of FAME India Scheme and after having consultations with all stakeholders, including Industry and Industry Associations, the Government notified Phase-II of FAME India Scheme on 8th March, 2019, which is for a period of three years commencing from 1st April, 2019, with a total budgetary support of Rs. 10,000 crore. This phase will mainly focus on supporting electrification of public & shared transportation and aims to support through demand incentive about 7000 e-Buses, 5 lakh e-3 Wheelers, 55000 e-4 Wheeler Passenger Cars and 10 lakh e-2 Wheelers.  In addition, creation of charging infrastructure will also be supported under the Scheme. 		The details of the budgetary allocation to implement the FAME-India Scheme and the fund utilization are summarized hereunder: -S.No.	Financial Year	Budget Allocation	Fund Utilization1.	2015-16	Rs. 75 Crore	Rs. 75 Crore (approx.)2.	2016-17	Rs. 144 Crore	Rs. 144 Crore (approx.)3.	2017-18	Rs. 165 Crore	Rs. 165 Crore (approx.)4.	2018-19	Rs. 145 Crore	Rs. 145 Crore (approx..)5.	2019-20	Rs. 500 Crore	Rs. 500 Crore (approx.)6.	2020-21	Rs. 692.94 Crore	Rs. 110.69 Crore (approx.) as on 31stAug, 2020Under Demand Creation, which is the focus area of the scheme, the purchaser of electric/hybrid vehicles is given an upfront reduction in purchase price by the dealer at the time of purchase of xEVs.In the First Phase of the Scheme about 2.8 lakh hybrid and electric vehicles were supported by way of demand incentive amounting to about Rs 359 crore. Further, DHI sanctioned 425 electric and hybrid buses to various cities in the country with total cost of about 280 Crores. The Department of Heavy Industry had sanctioned about 500 Charging Stations/ Infrastructure for Rs. 43 Crore (approx.) under Phase-I of FAME-India Scheme.  Under Phase-II of FAME India Scheme, 27,201 Electric Vehicles have been supported till 10.09.2020 by way of Demand Incentive amounting to about Rs. 95 Cr. Further, 5595 electrical buses have been sanctioned to various State/ City Transport Undertakings under Phase-II of the Scheme. This involves Government incentive of around Rs. 2800 Cr.Department of Heavy Industry has also sanctioned 2,636 Electric Vehicles (EVs) Charging Stations amounting to Rs 500 Crore (Approx.) in 62 cities across 24 States/UTs under FAME India (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric Vehicles in India) scheme phase II.(e):	The details of the cities selected and being funded for pilot project of Multi-Modal Electric Public Transport is at Annexure-I.(f): 	Yes, Madam. The list of pilot project of charging infrastructure and project of technology development sanctioned under Phase-I of FAME-India Scheme is at Annexure-II.****ANNEXURE-IDetails of the cities selected and being funded for pilot project of  Electric/ Hybrid Public TransportS.No.	City	Buses1	Mumbai	402	Navi Mumbai	303	MMRDA	254	Lucknow	405	Hyderabad	406	Indore	407	Kolkata	808	Jammu	409	Guwahati	1510	Himachal Pradesh	75Total	425ANNEXURE-IIProjects approved by DHI under FAME India Scheme (Pilot Projects, Charging infrastructure and Technology Development)S.No.	Name of the Project	Name of the Operating Agency1	Public Fast Charging Infrastructure Network for Electric Vehicles at Bangalore	M/s Mahindra Reva Electric Vehicles Pvt.
