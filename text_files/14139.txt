ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) to (d): The details of quantity and value of food products including sugar, rice and onion imported during last three years and the current year( April 2019 to January 2020) are given in Annexure.   Imports take place to meet the gap between domestic production and supply and consumer demand and preferences for some of the food items. (e):  In order to reduce imports of food products, augmentation of domestic production is required for which Government has taken several steps.  National Food Security Mission (NFSM) was launched to increase the production of rice, wheat and pulses through area expansion and productivity enhancement, restoring soil fertility and productivity, improvement in cropping system, distributing of seeds of high yielding varieties, optimising use of farm machineries/resources, water application tools, plant protection measures, nutrient management/soil ameliorants, cropping system based trainings to the farmers etc. In addition, special programmes like inter-cropping of pulses with sugarcane, targeting rice fallow area programme and special programme for increasing productivity of pulses in low productivity districts of the country are being implemented during 2019-20 in the States suitable for production of these crops. The Government is also implementing Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) under which the financial assistance is provided to set up food processing industries/projects/units in the country for enhancing the domestic production capacities of the processed food and reducing the dependency on import of food products.*** AnnexureStatement referred to in reply of part (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha Unstarred question no. 2810 for answer on 11th March 2020.Import of Food Items under Principal Commodity Groups for last three years and current year (April 2019 to January 2020)(Quantity in Ton and Value in Rs.
