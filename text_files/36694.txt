ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) In the approved Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP) Phase-II & III, State of Uttar Pradesh has proposed rehabilitation of 39 dams at an estimated cost of Rs. 787 crore. However, the State is presently in the process of joining the project by fulfilling the readiness criteria as stipulated by the World Bank and the Department of Economic Affairs, Government of India. Thus, no funds have been released so far to Uttar Pradesh under DRIP Phase –II & III. Further, Bihar is not a part of the scheme of DRIP Phase –II & III. (b) Though water is a State subject, Central Government has taken a number of important measures for conservation, management of ground water including effective implementation of rain water harvesting in the country. Some of the key initiatives in this regard are listed below. 1.	The details regarding ground water conservation and recharge are available at URL: http://jalshakti-dowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Feb2021.pdf  2. In 2019, Jal Shakti Abhiyan was launched by the Government. This was followed in 2021, by “Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch The Rain” (JSA:CTR) campaign. Focused interventions under these annual campaigns taken up by the Government of India and the State Governments, inter-alia, include water conservation and rainwater harvesting structures. State-wise details of the water conservation and rainwater harvesting works completed under this scheme till December, 2021 are placed at Annexure.3. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS) has provisions for public works relating to natural resource management, water conservation and water harvesting structures to augment and improve ground water like underground dykes, earthen dams, stop dams, check dams and roof top rain water harvesting structures in public buildings. 4. Under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme, which was launched on 25th June 2015 in 500 selected cities across States/UTs, 8 Rainwater Harvesting projects have been taken up by the States/UTs with estimated cost of ?9.64 crore. While 3 each out of the above mentioned 8 projects belong to Lakshadweep & Kerala respectively, one is from Himachal Pradesh and the balance one from NCT of Delhi. However, no rainwater harvesting project has been taken up by the Government of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar under AMRUT. Further, AMRUT 2.0 launched in October, 2021, with a total outlay of Rs. 2,77,000 crore targets to promote circular economy of water through development of city water balance plan for each city focusing on recycle/reuse of treated sewage, rejuvenation of water bodies and water conservation.(c)   Year-wise details of central assistance released by Government of India under Flood Management and Border Areas Programme (FMBAP), to the States of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, during the last three years, are given below:  Amount (Rs. in crore)Sl.
