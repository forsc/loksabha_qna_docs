State/UT-wise data is not maintained centrally.(b):  In tune with the dynamic nature of Information Technology and emerging cyber threats, continuous efforts are required to be made by owners to protect networks by way of hardening and deploying appropriate security controls.Government has taken following measures to enhance the cyber security posture and prevent cyber-attacks:(i)	The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) issues alerts and advisories regarding latest cyber threats/vulnerabilities and countermeasures to protect computers and networks on regular basis.(ii)	Government has issued guidelines for Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) regarding their key roles and responsibilities for securing applications / infrastructure and compliance.(iii)	All the government websites and applications are to be audited with respect to cyber security prior to their hosting.  The auditing of the websites and applications will be conducted on a regular basis after hosting also.

The centre is providing detection of malicious programs and free tools to remove the same.(ix)	Government has set up National Cyber Coordination Centre (NCCC) to generate necessary situational awareness of existing and potential cyber security threats and enable timely information sharing for proactive, preventive and protective actions by individual entities. Phase-I of NCCC has been made operational.(c) and (d):  As per mandate of CERT-In under Section 70B of Information Technology Act, 2000 and rules therein, Service providers, intermediaries, data centres and body corporate shall report the cyber security incidents to CERT-In within a reasonable time of occurrence or noticing the incident to have scope for timely action.
