ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) and (b): As a part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Programme, a comprehensive initiative for using Technology with Equity, called PM e-VIDYA has been initiated which unifies all efforts related to digital/ online/ on-air education to enable multi-mode access to education.• PM e-Vidya has following components:? DIKSHA– One nation, one digital education platform? One class, one TV channel–Swayam Prabha? E-content for Open School? Extensive use of Radio, Community radio and podcast? E-content for visually and hearing-impaired studentsThe 12 PM e-VIDYA DTH TV Channels are under bouquet of Swayam Prabha DTH channels,which are meant to support and reach out to those students who do not have access to the internet. In the Ministry of Education, a total of 32 channels are devoted to telecast high quality educational programmes. Of these, 12 TV channels are earmarked for the one class, one TV channel (Classes 1-12) under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Programme for the Department of School Education and Literacy. Further, the Ministry has tied up with private DTH operators like TATA Sky, Videocon, DISH TV, Sun Direct & Airtel to air educational video content to enhance the reach of these channels. The List of MoUs signed during COVID-19 to support education delivery during the pandemic is at Annexure.(c) and (d): Education is a subject in the Concurrent List of the Constitution and schools, other than those owned / funded by Central Government, are under the jurisdiction of the State Governments. Thus, the matter relating to fees and its components in schools are regulated in terms of Rules and Instructions of the State Government concerned. National Education Policy 2020 (para no. 8.7) provides for assessment and accreditation of Public and Private Schools (except the schools that are managed/ aided/ controlled by the Central Government) on the same criteria, benchmarks, and processes, emphasizing online and offline public disclosure and transparency, similar standards of audit and disclosure as a ‘not-for-profit'' entity, so as to ensure that public-spirited private schools are encouraged and not stifled in anyway.*****
