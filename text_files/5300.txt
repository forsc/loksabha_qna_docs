ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a)  & (b):	As per data maintained by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), there is no increasing trend of suicides of Police and CRPF personnel in the country.-2-L.S.US.Q.NO.5015 FOR 23.07.2019(c) to (f):	‘Public order’ and ‘Police’ are State subjects, falling in Entry 1 and 2 of List-II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. While the State Governments are expected to take appropriate steps for State Police personnel, improvement of working conditions of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) is a constant endeavor and instructions in this regard are issued by the Ministry regularly.  The issue is also reviewed by the Government from time to time in consultation with professional agencies. While Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) conducted a study in 2004 into the factors causing stress, the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad did a similar study in 2012 for BSF and CRPF.  Some of the reasons for committing suicide by police personnel are personal problems, illness and other family circumstances. As regards CAPFs, to check incidents of suicides, various measures are being taken up such as conducting courses on stress management and meditation, health check camps, yoga classes, undertaking regular indoor and outdoor sports and group activities, liberal grant of leave, maintaining healthy and hygienic barrack environment, ensuring availability of entertainment like TVs/News/Magazines, ensuring regular rest  to  each   personnel,   recreation/gym   facilities,  schools   for   their -3-L.S.US.Q.NO.5015 FOR 23.07.2019children etc.  Transparent policies pertaining to transfer and leave are followed and promotions and Modified Assured Career Progression (MACP) are regularly released to eligible personnel.  Hospitalization period due to injuries while on duty is treated as on duty. Posting of choice is considered to the extent possible. Adequate rest and relief by regulating the duty hours are ensured. Crèche facility is also provided at various establishments, where feasible.  Air courier service has been provided to CAPF personnel deployed in NE states, J&K and LWE affected areas as a welfare measures.*******
