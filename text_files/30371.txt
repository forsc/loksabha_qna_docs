ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) :		Government of India have launched the Reforms-based and Results-linked, Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme with the objective of improving the quality and reliability of power supply to consumers through a financially sustainable and operationally efficient Distribution Sector. The salient features of the Scheme are as under:(i)	The scheme has an outlay of Rs.3,03,758 crore and an estimated GBS from Central Government of Rs.97,631 crore.(ii)	The scheme aims to reduce the AT&C losses at pan-India levels to 12-15% and ACS-ARR gap to zero by 2024-25.(iii)	The scheme has a duration of 5 years (FY 2021-22 to FY 2025-26). The sunset date of scheme will be 31.03.2026.(iv)	The scheme has two major components: Part ‘A’ – Financial support for Prepaid Smart Metering & System Metering and upgradation of the Distribution Infrastructure and Part ‘B’ – Training & Capacity Building and other Enabling & Supporting Activities.(v)	State Governments/ Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) are free to undertake customized reform measures and works to meet the specific needs of the State.…….2.- 2 -(vi)	The release of funds under the scheme has been linked to Results and Reforms. The pre-qualifying criteria need to be mandatorily met with by the DISCOMs before they can be evaluated for release of funds under the scheme.(vii)	REC and PFC are the nodal agencies, responsible for implementing the scheme across the country.(b) :		The scheme aims to reduce the AT&C losses at pan-India levels to 12-15% and ACS-ARR gap to zero by 2024-25. Recognizing that various DISCOMs are at different performance levels – both operational and financial, instead of adopting a one size fits all approach, the scheme envisages customized action plans as per the needs of the individual DISCOMs. (c) :		The scheme envisages a Results Evaluation Framework incorporating performance against result parameters and trajectories for improvement. The Results Evaluation Framework has two components (i) Pre-qualifying criteria; and (ii) Result Evaluation Matrix, details of which are given as Annexures-I & II respectively.Utilities clearing the pre-qualifying criteria would be eligible for evaluation against the result evaluation matrix, which would determine their eligibility for release of funds for a particular year. The result evaluation framework would be different for each DISCOM and would be fixed for each year depending on the cumulative performance as well as the annual performance. There would be result parameters in the Result Evaluation Matrix, which will be assigned maximum marks on the basis of significance towards achieving the objectives of the Scheme. The maximum marks and targets for individual parameters may differ for each of the evaluation years. The funds for a particular year will be released only if the Utility clears the Pre-qualifying criteria (Annexure-I) and the total weighted score is more than 60 marks on the Result Evaluation Matrix (Annexure-II). (d) :		The last date for receipt of Action Plans and DPRs is 31.12.2021.************
