                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCEAND CORPORATE AFFAIRS			                                (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)????? ??? ????????? ????? ???????? ??? ????? ?????? 			                       (???? ?????? ???? ?????)(a) to (c): The Government has not recognised crypto currencies such as bitcoins as legal tender. The issue of permitting trading in crypto currencies is currently under examination by the Government which has constituted an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs with representatives from concerned Departments to study all aspects of crypto currencies and crypto-assets including Bitcoin. The Committee, with representation from MeitY, RBI, SEBI and CBDT is examining all issues, including the pros and cons of the introduction of an official digital currency in India and is working to develop a framework for regulating cryptocurrencies. However, in absence of a globally acceptable solution and the need to devise technically feasible solution, the Department is pursuing the matter with due caution. It is difficult to state a specific timeline to come up with clear recommendations. No decision on licensing and authorising any entity or company to operate such schemes or deal with Bitcoins or any virtual currency has been made as yet....2/--2-The Government and the RBI has been warning the users of crypto-currencies of the dangers posed by such virtual currencies. Government vide press release dated 29/12/2017 clarified that Virtual Currencies/Crypto Currencies are not legal tender and cautioned the members of public against the Risks involved in investing Crypto Currencies. RBI vide press releases dated 24th Dec, 2013, 01st Feb, 2017 and 05th Dec, 2017 cautioned the public about risks and dangers with Virtual currencies including potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks that they are exposing themselves to by investing in Bitcoin and/or other Virtual currencies. RBI has also clarified that it has not given any license/authorization to any entity/company to operate such schemes or deal with Bitcoins or any virtual currency. Further, Department of Financial Services, MOF, has informed that as per Reserve Bank of India’s Notification dated 06.04.2018 on “Prohibition on dealing in Virtual Currencies”, RBI has cautioned users, holders and traders of virtual currencies, including Bitcoins regarding various risks associated in dealing with such virtual currencies and RBI has directed that in view of the associated risks, with immediate effect, entities regulated by the Reserve Bank shall not deal in VCs or provide services for facilitating any person or entity in dealing with or setting VCs and that regulated entities which already provide such services shall exit the relationship.  Accordingly, this ban came into force w.e.f. 6th July, 2018. In the case of one company, namely M/s ZEB IT Services Private Limited, Inspection of books of accounts u/s 206(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 to examine inter alia the aspect of dealing in Bitcoin was conducted and during Inspection action has been taken for non-compliance of various provisions of Companies Act.	It is informed by Ministry of Home Affairs that ‘Police’ and ‘Public’ are State subjects as per the Constitution of India and States are primarily responsible for prevention, detection and investigation of crimes through their law enforcement machinery. The Law Enforcement Agencies take legal action as per provisions of law against the cyber fraud offenders. Steps have also been taken to spread awareness about such frauds, issue of alerts/advisories, training of law, enforcement agencies, etc. to prevent such frauds and to speed up investigation.                                                       *********
