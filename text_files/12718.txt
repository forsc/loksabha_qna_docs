ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI DANVE RAOSAHEB DADARAO)(a) :  No Sir. (b) : Government of India takes measures like incentivizing export of onions under Merchandise Export Incentive Scheme (MEIS); restricting export through Minimum Export Price (MEP); or, banning the export; depending on the exigencies so as to optimally address the concern of all stakeholders. (c)  : During 2019-20, due to late arrival of monsoon there was delay in sowing as well as decline in sown area of the Kharif onion. Further, untimely prolonged rains in the major growing States of Karnataka, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh during the harvesting period, i.e., September / October, caused damage to the standing crops in these regions adversely impacting their production and quality. The rains during September/October also affected plucking and transportation of the crop from these regions to consuming areas. This led to limited availability of Kharif onion in the market and put pressure on its prices. The prevailing prices were remunerative for farmers of onions.*****
