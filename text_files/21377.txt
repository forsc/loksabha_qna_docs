                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) 	Sir, the copy of latest notification regarding emission norms for Base Transceiver Station (BTS) is available at https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/26-06-2013.pdf. The notifications regarding emission norms for mobile handsets are available at https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/Specific_absorption.pdf. The copy of latest advisory guidelines for State Governments for issue of clearance for installation of mobile towers may be seen at https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/Advisor%20STC%20DTC.pdf. (b) 	Telecom Company wise number of BTSs which have not complied with these regulations is attached as Annexure-1. 	Government has taken action by imposing financial penalty on defaulting Telecom Service Providers(TSPs) as per the prescribed norms of Department of Telecommunications.  One (1) non-compliant BTS of M/s Airtel in Haryana was shut down due to non-compliance of radiation level and other non-compliant BTSs radiation level has been brought within the prescribed limits.(c) 	No illegal mobile tower is functioning in the country as per the records available with Department of Telecommunications (DoT).  	As per the existing policy for installation of towers, Wireless Planning & Coordination (WPC) wing of DoT issues “siting clearance” for installation of mobile towers for each and every site from the point of view of interference with other licensed wireless users, aviation hazards and obstruction to any other existing microwave links. DoT issues “siting clearances” without prejudice to other applicable bylaws, rule and regulations of local bodies such as Municipal Corporation, Gram Panchayat etc. Accordingly, before installation of tower, the telecom service providers have to obtain necessary clearances from concerned authorities of Local bodies/ State Government also. Various local bodies/State Government have formulated their own policy regarding grant of such permissions for installation of mobile towers.(d) 	Does not arise in view (c) above.(e) 	As per records available, no direction on radiation emission norms and installation of BTS have been issued by Hon’ble High Court of Delhi.
