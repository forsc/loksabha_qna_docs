ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) The Central Sector Scheme ‘National Means-cum-Merit Scholarship Scheme’ (NMMSS)is being implemented since 2008 with the objective to award scholarships to meritorious studentsof economically weaker sections to arrest their drop out at class VIII and encourage them tocontinue the study at secondary stage. Under the Scheme one lakh fresh scholarships @ ofRs.12000/- per annum per student are awarded to selected students of class IX every year andtheir continuation/renewal in classes X to XII for study in a State Government, Governmentaidedand Local body schools. There is a separate quota of scholarships for each State/UT. Theselection of students for award of scholarships under the scheme is made through an examinationconducted by the States/UTs Governments. As on date approx 18.75 lakh scholarships have beensanctioned to the Students across the country including 136239 Scholarships to the Students ofAndhra Pradesh.The scheme is boarded on National Scholarship Portal (NSP) since 2015-16. The NSPhas been developed by Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) forstreamlining and fast tracking the release of Scholarships across Ministries / Departments withefficiency, transparency and reliability. The eligible students from different States/UTs registerthemselves on NSP.(b) The Scheme was evaluated by the National Institute of Planning and Administration(NIEPA). As per the evaluation study report, the scheme helped poor families in sending theirmeritorious children for secondary and senior secondary education and has thereforerecommended for increasing the scholarship amount from Rs. 500/- to Rs. 1000/- per month forclass IX and class X students and Rs. 1500/- per month for Class XI and XII students to make thescheme more attractive and effective. Accordingly, with the approval of Expenditure FinanceCommittee the rate of scholarship has been enhanced from Rs. 6000/- to Rs. 12000/- per annumwith effect from 1st April, 2017.(c) The details regarding number of students who discontinued education after availing thescholarship is not maintained centrally, however an evaluation study of the NMMS schemeconducted by National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration (NIEPA) in 2017states that the scheme has a positive impact. The data reveals that about 70.1 % beneficiarystudents are unable to continue their studies without this scholarship and students are veryconscientious about their studies as well as the need to perform well after qualifying in NMMSScheme. They register better performance in Class IX, X, XI and XII in order to continue gettingthe scholarship for four consecutive years. Heads of all the institutions disclosed that the NMMSScheme has reduced the drop-out rate at the secondary and senior secondary classes, particularlyfrom Classes VIII to XII.*****
