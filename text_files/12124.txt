                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) & (b) Malnutrition is not the direct cause of death among children under five years of age. It can increase morbidity and mortality by reducing resistance to infections. Malnourished children are more vulnerable to any infection than normal children. However, the overall under five mortality rate has reduced from 74.3 (NFHS-3) to 49.7 (NFHS-4) deaths per thousand live births.     (c) & (d) Government has set up POSHAN Abhiyaan on 18.12.2017. The goals of POSHAN Abhiyaan are to achieve improvement in nutritional status of Children from 0-6 years, Adolescent Girls, Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers in a time bound manner with fixed targets as under:S.No.	Objective	Target1.	Prevent and reduce Stunting in children (0- 6 years)	@ 2% p.a.2.	Prevent and reduce under-nutrition (underweight prevalence) in children (0-6 years) 	@ 2% p.a. 3.	Reduce the prevalence of anaemia among young Children(6-59 months)	@ 3% p.a. 4.	Reduce the prevalence of anaemia among Women and Adolescent Girls in the age group of 15-49 years.	@ 3% p.a. 5.	Reduce Low Birth Weight (LBW).	@ 2% p.a.  The Abhiyaan aims to reduce malnutrition in the country in a phased manner, through a lifecycle approach, by adopting a synergised and result oriented approach. The Abhiyaan has mechanisms for timely service delivery and a robust monitoring as well as intervention infrastructure.As per the recent report of Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) (2016-18), the prevalence of stunting and anaemia among children is 34.7% and 40.5% respectively, which indicates a reduction when compared to the levels reported by NFHS-4, which reported 38.4% children as stunted and 58.5% having anaemia.Further, as per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), 18.2% children were born with low birth weight as compared to 21.5% reported under NFHS-3 and 53.1% women (*15-49 years) were anaemic as per NFHS-4, which is a reduction from the previous NFHS-3 (2005-06), which reported 55.3% being anaemic in this age group.*******
