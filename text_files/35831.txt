While  eligibility criteria for other habitations for getting connectivity under the scheme is a population of 500 persons (as per 2001 census) in plain areas, for Tribal (Schedule V) areas and Selected Tribal and Backward Districts (as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs and Planning Commission) and for special category states, mostly North-Eastern and Himalayan States (i.e. Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Uttarakhand),  unconnected habitations with a population of 250 persons and above (as per Census 2001) are eligible for providing all-weather road connectivity under the scheme. In the critical Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected blocks (as identified by MHA), additional relaxation has been given to connect eligible habitations with population 100 persons and above (as per Census 2001).   Further, with an aim to improve the road connectivity in 44 worst affected LWE districts and some adjoining districts in  9 States, viz. Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh, Road Connectivity Project for Left Wing Extremism Areas (RCPLWEA) was launched in the year 2016. The scheme has twin objectives of enabling smooth and seamless anti-LWE operations by the security forces and also ensuring socio-economic development of the area. So far, 10,231 km road length has been sanctioned and 4,817 km road length has been completed under RCPLWEA.  (c) & (d)     Since inception till 15.03.2022, the details of works sanctioned, completed and balance under various interventions/ verticals of PMGSY in Palamu & Garhwa districts of Jharkhand are as under:- PalamuVertical	Sanctioned	        Completed	                       Balance 	    Road length (km)	Bridges	Road length (km)  Bridges   Road length (km) @	BridgesPMGSY-I	      1580	         92	    1509	    87	           38	          5PMGSY-II	93	          0	      88	     0	            5	          0RCPLWEA	       111	         10	      31	     2	           79	          8PMGSY-III	 0	          0	       0	     0	            -	          -Total	      1784	        102	    1628	    89	          122	         13 GarhwaVertical	      Sanctioned	         Completed	                         Balance 	     Road length (km) Bridges	   Road length (km)  Bridges	Road length (km)@  BridgesPMGSY-I	        1165	        40	       1149	       40	     0	              0PMGSY-II	  75	         1	         66	        0	     9	              1RCPLWEA	          56	         3	         19	        3	    37	              0PMGSY-III	  22	         0	          0	        0	    22	              0Total	        1318	        44	       1234	       43	    68	              1 (e)     Since inception till 15.03.2022, the details of works sanctioned , completed and balance under various interventions/ verticals of PMGSY in the state of Jharkhand are as under:-Vertical	   Sanctioned	              Completed	                       Balance	  Road length(km)    Bridges	Road length(km)	 Bridges   Road length(km)@  BridgesPMGSY-I	       25,559	       499	    24,570	  436	        374	      63PMGSY-II	1,642	         6	     1,593	    2	         42	       4RCPLWEA	        1,977	       167	       811	   60	      1,164	     107PMGSY-III	  979	         0	         0	    0	        979	       0Total	      30,157	       672	    26,974	   498	      2,559	     174(f) & (g)      Currently 4 interventions/ verticals of PMGSY, namely, PMGSY-I, II, III & RCPLWEA are in operation. The timeline for completion of PMGSY-I & II is September, 2022, whereas it is March, 2023 for RCPLWEA and March, 2025 for PMGSY-III. Thus, as of now, there is substantial work to be completed under PMGSY. @ Balance road length is less than the difference of sanctioned and completed length due to reduction in road length, change in alignment, construction of part length by other agencies, etc.*****
