ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (b):   Yes.   Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has informed that Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) study released recently has alleged that quantity of salt and fat in the samples tested were  higher than the threshold limits proposed in the draft Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations.  Out of total 33 samples tested, 19 are ‘prepared food’ samples where Front–of-Pack labelling is not applicable. As far as pre-packaged food items are concerned, the sample size (14 samples) is too small and cannot be considered as representative of pre-packaged food industry in the country. Therefore, the data published by CSE is inadequate to draw any final conclusion.  (c):   FSSAI constituted an Expert Group on High Fat, Salt and Sugar (HFSS) products.  The Report of the Expert Group, with its gist, has been uploaded on FSSAI website i.e. www.fssai.gov.in for the information of general public. The HFSS report is guideline document for all the stakeholders and the consumer in rationalizing the consumption of Fat, sugar and salt through processed food products and thereby help reduce the burden of chronic diseases in the Indian population.Contd…….-2-(d) to (e):   FSSAI has notified draft Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations, 2019 on 25th June, 2019 for inviting public comments. Around 900 comments were received. In addition, industry associations also raised concerns on the specified thresholds of salt, sugar and fat and requested to contextualise thresholds based on Indian scenario. Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) has also requested FSSAI to constitute a Working Group to review the thresholds.The concerned Scientific Panel deliberated upon the comments and recommended to constitute a Working Group and to initiate a study to obtain market validated, category wise baseline data for reviewing the thresholds. Accordingly, as per Scientific Panel’s recommendation, FSSAI has initiated a nutrient threshold study to assess  the current Indian market scenario.………………….
