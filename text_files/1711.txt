                                                        FINANCE MINISTER(a) and (b): The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has informed that the unclaimed deposits reported by Scheduled Commercial Banks to RBI as per Section 26 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 are as under:Year	Total Unclaimed deposits of Scheduled Commercial Banks (Amount in billion rupees)2016	89.282017	114.942018	145.78The bank-wise details are given in the Annex.The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has informed that the details of the unclaimed amounts reported by the life and non-life insurance companies are as under:As on	Unclaimed Deposits	Life Insurers(In Rs. crores)	Non-Life Insurers(In Rs. crores)31.03.2016	10527.17	1249.1531.03.2017	10471.50	889.6231.03.2018	15229.53	847.5430.09.2018	16887.66	989.62The insurance company-wise details are given in the Annex.(c) and (d): As far as unclaimed deposits in banks are concerned, in pursuance of the amendment to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and insertion of Section 26A in the said Act, RBI has framed the Depositor Education and Awareness Fund (DEAF) Scheme, 2014. The Scheme was notified in the Official Gazette on 24.05.2014. In terms of the Scheme, banks calculate the cumulative balances in all accounts which are not operated upon for a period of 10 years or more (or any amount remaining unclaimed for 10 years or more) along with interest accrued and transfer such amounts to the DEAF. In case of demand from a customer whose unclaimed deposit had been transferred to the DEAF, banks are required to repay the customer, along with interest if any, and lodge a claim for refund from the DEAF. The rate of interest payable on interest bearing deposits transferred to the Fund was initially 4% p.a. which has been changed to 3.5% p.a. with effect from 01.07.2018. The DEAF is utilized for promotion of depositors’ interests and for such other purposes which may be necessary for promotion of depositors’ interest as may be specified by the RBI. As far as unclaimed amounts in insurance companies are concerned, as per the provisions brought in by the Finance Act, 2015, the Government of India notified the Senior Citizens’ Welfare Fund (SCWF) Rules, 2015, which were subsequently amended in the years 2016 and 2017 and made applicable to insurers. As per the Rules, entities having unclaimed amounts for more than 10 years are required to transfer the amounts to the SCWF on or before 1st March every year. The SCWF is utilized for schemes for promoting the welfare of senior citizens. If a claim is made, insurers are required to pay the identified unclaimed amount along with the investment income so credited to the policyholders or beneficiaries, as per the procedure. ***
