Government of India has been implementing Rashtriya Gokul Mission with focus on development and conservation of all indigenous bovine breeds including Sahiwal, Gir, Red Sindhi, Tharparkar and Rathi breed of cattle. With mechanisation of agriculture, utility of male bovines has been reduced and due to this farmers are mostly rearing female calves among all cattle and buffalo breeds in the country. However, in order to meet requirement of high genetic merit bulls of these breeds Government of India has been implementing: (i) progeny testing for Sahiwal and Gir breed of cattle; (ii) pedigree selection programme for Rathi and Tharparkar breed of cattle; (iii) IVF technology has been promoted for production of high genetic merit bulls of Sahiwal, Gir, Red Sindhi, Tharparkar and Rathi breed of cattle and (iv) Genomic selection has been initiated for selection of bulls of indigenous breeds of cattle including Gir, Red Sindhi, Tharparkar and Rathi breed of cattle. (b)	National level of information regarding livestock population is collected every 5 years. The last livestock census was conducted in 2019 and next census is due in 2024. As per 20th livestock census 2019, the population of indigenous breeds of cows and calves in the country is given at Annexure I. (c) and (d) Creating infrastructure for promotion of livestock such as cattle shelter poultry shelter, goat shelter, piggery shelter, and fodder trough for cattle is a permissible activity under the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA Scheme. The Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) is assisting Animal Welfare Organizations those are recognized by the AWBI for feeding and veterinary care as well as establishment of shelter houses as per their request and availability of funds. ****
