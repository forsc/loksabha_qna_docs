ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (c): Education is in the Concurrent List of the Constitution of India. The recruitment, service conditions and redeployment of teachers in respect of State Universities are primarily in the domain of the respective State Governments.The University-wise, State/UT-wise detailed statement indicating the number of teachers working on adhoc basis in various Central Universities as on 01.04.2019, 01.04.2020 and 01.04.2021 is at Annexure.Further, no proposal is under consideration in University Grants Commission (UGC) to absorb the adhoc teachers as permanent teacher. However, UGC from time to time has requested all the Central Universities to fill up the posts on regular basis to ensure that studies of students are not affected.*****ANNEXURE
