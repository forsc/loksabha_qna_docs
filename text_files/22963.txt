The ‘Science & Technology for Women’ Scheme is focused on empowering women in livelihood generation through suitable technologies and available natural resources in their native areas, which has led to income generation and creation of livelihood opportunities for them.The DST has started a new programme “Vigyan Jyoti” for meritorious girl students of Class 9 to 12 in order to increase participation of women in STEM (Science Technology Engineering and mathematics), especially in the fields where women are underrepresented. Another new initiative of DST ‘Gender Advancement for Transforming Institutions (GATI)’ has been started during 2019-20 which aims to transform institutions for more gender sensitive approach and inclusiveness with ultimate goal to improve the gender equity in S&T domain.(c)     The fund allocated for KIRAN Scheme in current financial year is Rs. 95.00 Crore (Revised Estimate).******
