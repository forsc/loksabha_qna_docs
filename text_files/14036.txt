MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (d)	Following the reports of vandalism and desecration of the holy Gurudwara at Sri Nankana Sahib in Pakistan on 3 January 2020, the Government strongly condemned the reprehensible action. Pakistan’s Charge d’Affaires in New Delhi was summoned and India’s strong protest was lodged against the wanton acts of vandalism and desecration of the holy Gurudwara Sri Janam Asthan at Nankana Sahib, Pakistan. India also shared strong concerns at the continued persecution of religious and ethnic minorities in Pakistan. Government of Pakistan was also called upon to ensure safety, security and welfare of the members of the minority communities in Pakistan, including their places of worship, and take immediate measures to expeditiously bring the perpetrators of such despicable and heinous acts to justice.****
