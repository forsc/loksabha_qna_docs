                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a)to (d): As on 31.03.2021, Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) hasauthorized approximately 33,764 Km Natural Gas Pipeline Network across the country with theaim to create a national gas grid and increase the availability of natural gas across the country.The authorized Natural Gas pipeline entity is allowed to lay spurlines as per the provision of theregulations. Accordingly, 19,998 km of Natural Gas pipeline (including sub-transmissionpipeline & tie in connectivity pipeline) are operational and 15,369 km are under various stages ofconstruction. The existing and upcoming pipelines will form a basic National Gas Grid in thecountry. However, expansion of pipeline infrastructure is a continuous effort based on gasdemand assessment of various regions.Government has taken a series of decisions to promote use of Clean Energy:(i) Development of City Gas Distribution (CGD) networks supports the availability andaccessibility of natural gas in form of Piped Natural Gas (PNG) to households,industrial uses and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) for transportation uses. PNGRBgrants authorization to the entities for developing of CGD network in GeographicalAreas (GAs) as per PNGRB Act, 2006. PNGRB identifies GAs for authorizing thedevelopment of CGD network in synchronization with the development of natural gaspipeline connectivity and natural gas availability. So far 232 GAs have beenauthorized for development of CGD network across country up to 10th CGD BiddingRound covering more than 400 districts in the country in 27 States/Union Territories(UTs), which covers around 71% of India’s population and 53% of its area. PNGRBwebhosted public notice dated 04.02.2020 wherein a tentative list of 44 identifiedGAs to be covered under upcoming 11th CGD bidding round has been prepared.(ii) With the aim to promote and sustain an efficient and robust gas market and to fostergas trading in the country, PNGRB has granted authorization to Indian Gas ExchangeLimited on 02.12.2020, to set up and operate Gas Exchange.(iii) Furthermore, in order to make natural gas affordable in far flung areas, PNGRB hasnotified Unified Tariff Regulations on 23.11.2020 by way of Petroleum and NaturalGas Regulatory Board (Determination of Natural Gas Pipeline Tariff) SecondAmendment Regulations, 2020.(iv) To reduce fuel emissions by increasing the share of LNG in India''s energy mix and topromote the usage of cleaner fuels in the future, PNGRB has allowed any entity toestablish and operate LNG Stations in any GA or anywhere else in the country fordispensing LNG in liquid state, only to the transport sector.(v) In order to increase competition in CGD areas, PNGRB has notified GuidingPrinciples for declaring City or Local Natural Gas Distribution Networks as commoncarrier or contact carrier Regulations to provide non- discriminatory open access tothird party entities.Further, an initiative, Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) waslaunched on 1st October 2018 aiming to establish an ecosystem for production of Compressed Bio Gas (CBG) from various waste/ biomass sources in the country. SATAT has envisageddeveloping 5000 CBG plants with total CBG production capacity of 15 Million Metric TonnePerAnnum (MMTPA). Under SATAT, Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Bharat PetroleumCorporation Limited, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, Gail (India) Limited andIndraprastha Gas Limited have invited Expression of interest (EoI) from potential entrepreneursto procure CBG at an assured price. In response of EoI invited, Oil PSUs have issued 479 Lettersof Intent (LoIs) till January 2020. At present, 2 CBG plants located at Pune and Kolhapur areoperational and their produced CBG is being sold in Auto sector since September 2019(e) Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has approved VGF for Jagdishpur-Haldia/Bokaro-Dhamra Natural Gas Pipeline (JHBDPL) Projects and North East Gas Grid(NEGG) project. CCEA in its meeting held on 21st September 2016 has approved 40% CapitalGrant i.eRs 5,176 crore of the estimated capital cost of Rs 12,940 crore(including inflation andinterest during construction) by GOI to GAIL(India) Limited for execution of Jagdishpur-Haldia/Bokaro-Dhamra Natural Gas Pipeline (JHBDPL) Projects. As on May, 2021,Government has released Rs. 4486.748 crore to GAIL under this scheme.
