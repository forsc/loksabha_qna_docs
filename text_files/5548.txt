THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI  PIYUSH GOYAL)(a):	The details of functional cement factories/units in the country as per information available with the Department are placed at Annexure ‘A’.(b):		The details of sick cement factories are not maintained by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade. (c):	As per the information provided by the State Government of Jharkhand, the closed Japla Cement factory in Palamu is a private sector unit. Since this company was ridden with debt of financial institutions, the process for its auction conducted by Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) through advertisement could not succeed twice due to non participation by any company/agency/institution.  State Government’s efforts to revive this plant in partnership with various private companies like ACC Ltd., Ultratech Cement, Dalmia Cement, Shree Cement, Star Cement etc. met with no success.  No industrialist agreed to purchase/operate this plant. In deference to the Orders dated 17.05.2018 passed by the Hon’ble High Court of Patna for its liquidation, the machinery of the unit has been auctioned. State Government vide letter dated  28.08.2018 requested to the Official Liquidator of the Hon’ble High Court of Patna regarding transfer of 137.99 Bigha lease hold property of the unit for development as an industrial area.                                               ********
