                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (d)	According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), global warming is a result of anthropogenic activities including aviation. However, CO2 emissions from global aviation account for approximately 2 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions.  Reports from various sources including Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change namely Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, Special Report on Climate Change and Land, and Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, highlight the challenges faced due to climate change arising mainly from historical emissions of greenhouse gases by developed countries. Combating climate change requires globally coordinated efforts and is addressed multilaterally through UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement based on the principles of ‘equity’ and ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’. Paris Agreement’s aim is to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. Countries are implementing climate actions through their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) submitted under the Paris Agreement. India is a Party to the UNFCCC, its Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement and submitted its NDC outlining eight targets for 2021-2030, including (i) to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030 from 2005 level, (ii) to achieve about 40 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030 with help of the transfer of technology and low-cost international finance, (iii) to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. In addition, Government is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which provides the overarching framework for climate actions, through  eight national missions in specific areas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan eco-system, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. ****
