                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) & (b):	The Ministry is developing a National Database for Unorganized Workers (NDUW) Portal seeded with Aadhaar for registration of unorganized workers which shall include migrant workers too. The registration under the portal shall commence from August, 2021. The portal once populated will give an idea of number of Migrant workers across states. The Ministry has also initiated the first ever survey of Migrant labour across the country.  Contd..2/- :: 2 :: (C) & (d):	Government had enacted the Inter-state Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979 to safeguard the interests of the inter-state migrant workers. This Act has now been subsumed in the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions  (OSH) Code, 2020.   The Code provides for decent working conditions, minimum wages, grievance redressal mechanism and  other  benefits to all category of workers including migrant workers. Special provisions such as widening the definition of Inter-state migrant workers, toll free helpline, journey allowance, etc for such workers have also been incorporated in the OSH Code, 2020. The Unorganized Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008, now subsumed in the Code on Social Security, 2020, provides for social security to all unorganized workers including migrant  workers. Government has launched Central Sector Schemes like Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Beema Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Beema Yojana (PMSBY) in 2015 for life and disability cover and Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Man Dhan Pension Yojana (PM-SYM) in 2019 for pension to the unorganised workers including migrant workers. Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), started in 2018 provides secondary and tertiary health benefits to all unorganized workers including migrant workers who are covered as eligible beneficiaries as per Socio Economic Caste Census Data, 2011. The Government has also started nation-wide portability of the food-security through One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) Plan which provides an option to all National Food Security Act (NFSA) beneficiaries, particularly migrant workers beneficiaries, to access their food-security entitlements from any fair price shop of their choice, anywhere in the country by using their same/existing NFSA Ration Card issued in the home State/UT.******
