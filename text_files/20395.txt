(c) The district-wise status of implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) across the country, including those of the State of Kerala, is available on the real time JJM dashboard athttps://ejalshakti.gov.in/jjmreport/JJMIndia.aspx.(d) Under JJM, the fund sharing pattern between Centre and States/ UTs is 100% for Union Territories, 90:10 for North Eastern & Himalayan States including UT of J&K and 50:50 for other States. In all states, JJM is implemented and they are committed to provide State share.  (e) Under JJM, power to plan, approve and implement water supply schemes is vested with States.
