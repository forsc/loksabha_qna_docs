ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d)	National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) under the aegis of Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing the Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed (CSCM) component of Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) 2016-20 and Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK).	Under CSCM component of PMKVY 2016-20, there is no provision of State-wise funds allocation. However, under Centrally Sponsored State Managed (CSSM) component of PMKVY, 25% of the funds and corresponding physical targets of PMKVY 2016-20 have been allocated to the States/UTs for the implementation of scheme through State Skill Development Missions. Under this component, after evaluation of proposal received from Gujarat Skill Development Mission (GSDM), Ministry have given in-principle approval of a total target of 77,824 candidates and corresponding financial allocation of Rs. 119.82 Cr. for FY 2017-20; out of which, Rs. 35.94 Cr. has been already disbursed to State of Gujarat for the implementation of this component in State of Gujarat covering all districts including Rajkot. However, due to slow performance and keeping in the mind that the scheme is going to end by March’2020, the financial allocation was rationalized to Rs. 98.85 crore.Under PMKK, the Ministry through NSDC promotes establishment of model and aspirational skill centres in every district throughout the country for imparting skill training through PMKVY 2016-20. The Ministry provides capital expenditure upto 75% of the project investment as well as operational support to each PMKK. As on 11.11.2019, for establishment of Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras (PMKKs) in the State of Gujarat, 38 proposals have been received during the last three years of allocation process. As on date, 34 PMKKs have been allocated, out of which 33 PMKKs have been already established in State of Gujarat. The funds amounting to Rs. 9.6 Cr. has been disbursed for establishment of PMKKs in State of Gujarat.
