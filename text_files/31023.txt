ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND EARTH SCIENCES(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)??????? ?? ???????????? ??? ?????? ??????? ???????? ??  ????? ?????? (???????? ??????)  (??. ???????? ????)(a)     Yes Sir, the Gross Expenditure on R&D (GERD) as a percentage of GDP is hovering around 0.7 for last 5 years. However, in absolute terms, GERD has been consistently increasing over the years and has increased by 3 times during the last 10 years. (b)     The government has been making concerted efforts to enhance the GERD as a percentage of GDP. Several steps have been taken to attract the private sector to invest in R&D such as incentivizing the private sector’s R&D participation by improving the ease of doing business in the STI activities; introducing flexible tools for public procurement; creating avenues for collaborative STI funding through portfolio-based funding mechanisms such as Public-Private-Partnerships and other innovative hybrid funding mechanisms. The Government has allowed corporate sector to make R&D investments under the provision of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Corporates can invest in technology business incubators or contribute in research efforts carried out by institutions and national research laboratories as a part of their CSR.
