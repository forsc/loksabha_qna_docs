                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a)	Mobile users may face connectivity problems which arise due to many reasons including characteristics of radio propagation for wireless communications, non-availability of sites due to acquisition problems, non-availability of free channel to serve a call attempt etc. (b)	At present Palakkad district is being served by 4 Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) namely M/s BSNL, M/s Bharti Airtel, M/s Reliance JIO and M/s Vodafone Idea. As on 31.08.2020, there are 1392 number of mobile towers and 7222 number of Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) covering the district. Moreover, TSPs have also planned for 58 mobile towers and 168 BTSs in the district during the year 2020-21. Further, new mobile towers/ BTSs are installed by Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) on continuous basis to improve coverage and/or capacity of their networks based on techno-commercial assessments. However, two references in respect of Manjambra ward of Tiruvegapura Panchayat and Karimba Panchayat of Mannarkkad Taluka in the district have been reported recently.(c)	In coordination with the various stakeholders viz. State Government, local authorities and TSPs etc., Kerala License Service Area (LSA), field unit of DoT, facilitate for the growth of telecom infrastructure in the LSA. State Government of Kerala has been requested to expedite the issue of Permits for installation of mobile towers. TSPs have also been requested to augment the existing capacity of their network in order to improve mobile connectivity, wherever feasible.	Moreover, the Government has also taken several policy initiatives to facilitate infrastructure growth in the country which include permitting trading/sharing/liberalization of spectrum, permitting passive & active infrastructure sharing, notification of Right of Way Rules 2016, carrying out Electro Magnetic Field (EMF) awareness campaign to dispel the misgivings to the public regarding EMF radiations emission from mobile towers through print and electronic media etc.************
