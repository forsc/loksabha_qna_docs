ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION  (RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a)	SDG India Index 2018 could not cover ‘Goal 12: Sustainable Consumption and Production’ and ‘Goal 13: Climate Action’ largely on account of unavailability of comparable official data across States and UTs. The ‘SDG 17: Partnership for the Goals’ could not be included because indicators for the Goal were not identified in the National Indicator Framework. These reasons were also explained in the SDG India Index Baseline Report 2018.(b)	& (c) Goals 12, 13 and 17 will not be assessed in the next Baseline Report.(c)	On account of the same reasons as given under the point (a) above, Goals 12, 13 and 17 will not be assessed in the next Baseline Report.  *****
