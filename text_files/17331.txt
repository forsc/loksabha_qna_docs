ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI  & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  Based on incidents of deficient rainfall, States declare drought affected districts. Ministry of Agriculture is the nodal Ministry in respect of monitoring and managing drought conditions. Droughts are classified into meteorological droughts, hydrological droughts and agricultural droughts. Meteorological drought is classified based on rainfall deficiency. Hydrological drought is defined as deficiencies in surface and sub-surface water supplies leading to a lack of water for normal and specific needs. Such conditions arise even in times of average (or above average) precipitation when increased usage of water diminishes the reserves. Agricultural drought is identified by 4 consecutive weeks of meteorological drought. Generally, rainfed agriculture area is more prone to this. (b) & (c) Ministry of Jal Shakti, Govt. of India, in partnership with States, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) with an estimated outlay of Rs.3.60 lakh Crore to enable every rural household in the country to have potable water by 2024. Contd…P/2//2// 		Further, Government of India has launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) with the objectives of promoting Water Conservation, Rain Water Harvesting and Renovation of traditional water bodies, Watershed development, Afforestation and creating Public Awareness in 2 phases, in around 1500 Blocks falling in 256 districts of the country, that are drought affected, water stressed or over-exploited. Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes namely, Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) and Repair, Renovation and Restoration of Water Bodies (RRR). Further Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI) schemes with irrigation potential of less than 200 ha were included under AIBP for providing Central Assistance (CA) since 1999-2000 for Special Category States. During 2015-16, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) was launched with an aim to enhance physical access of water on farm and expand cultivable area under assured irrigation, improve on-farm water use efficiency, introduce sustainable water conservation practices etc.  Major and medium irrigation/multipurpose irrigation projects are being funded under PMKSY-AIBP. Drought prone areas are given priority under PMKSY-AIBP. A total of 54 projects, benefiting drought prone areas in 10 States, are part of 99 prioritized PMKSY-AIBP Projects.(d)  Total 436.78 crores of central assistance was released till August, 2020 to Uttarakhand for 651 projects included in 2013-14 under Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI) scheme. *****
