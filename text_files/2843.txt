ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) to (c):	Union Government has no proposal under consideration to fix minimum support prices (MSPs) for State specific crops. However, Government presently fixes MSPs for 22 mandated agricultural crops viz. paddy, jowar, bajra, maize, ragi, arhar, moong, urad, groundnut-inshell, soyabean, sunflower, sesamum, nigerseed, cotton, wheat, barley, gram, masur (lentil), rapeseed/mustard, safflower, jute and copra and fair & remunerative price (FRP) for sugarcane on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP), after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned and other relevant factors. In addition, MSPs for toria and de-husked coconut are also fixed on the basis of MSPs of rapeseed/mustard and copra respectively. These MSP crops cover approximately 99 per cent of the total agricultural production (does not include horticulture) in the country.Region specific parameters are kept in view by the CACP while recommending MSP for agricultural crops.  Since cost of production varies in different States on account of differences in levels of irrigation, resource endowment, farm mechanization, land holding size etc., CACP uses all-India weighted average cost of production while making its recommendations and recommends uniform MSP which is applicable to all states and not region or state-specific. The MSP so fixed provides atleast 50 % return over all India weighted average cost of production. The objective is to promote regionally differentiated production strategy and encourage an efficient state of agricultural production in the country.********
