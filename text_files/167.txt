ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a) to (c)  	The Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), an intergovernmental body with 132 countries as members including India,  has undertaken a global and four regional assessments of biodiversity and ecosystem services, the reports of which are available at www.ipbes.net.  While the full report of the global assessment is yet to come out, findings of the four regional assessments (Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, and Europe and Central Asia) have been published.  As per the summary of the global assessment report, globally around one million plant and animal species of the nearly eight million species are now threatened with extinction.   The IPBES regional assessment report of the Asia and the Pacific does not give country specific status of species, but gives a few sub-regional trends.   Himalaya and Western Ghats are two of the four global biodiversity hotspots represented in India.  Hotspots are areas characterized by richness of biodiversity that are experiencing rapid rates of habitat modification.  According to the IPBES regional assessment report, the Asia-Pacific region exhibits varying trends in the status of biodiversity and ecosystem services. (d)	Some important actions taken by the Government to protect flora and fauna of the country include: Survey, inventorization, taxonomic validation and threat assessment of floral and faunal resources; assessment of the forest cover to develop an accurate database for planning and monitoring; Establishment of a biogeography based Protected Area Network of National Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries, Conservation and Community Reserves and enhancing their management effectiveness; Designating Biosphere Reserves for conservation of representative ecosystems; Undertaking of species oriented programmes at national scale, such as Project Tiger, Project Snow Leopard and Project Elephant; Species recovery programme for four highly threatened species viz., Great Indian bustard, Gangetic dolphin, Manipur brow-antlered deer or Thamin, and Dugong; Species recovery plans for additional 18 threatened species which are ready to be implemented; Formulation and implementation of new Forestry Working Plan Code (2014) which lays strong emphasis on mainstreaming biodiversity conservation in forestry working; Research and development in the area of biodiversity conservation and long term monitoring through a number of specialized agencies such as Botanical Survey of India, Zoological Survey of India, Central Marine and Fishery Research, Wildlife Institute of India, G.B. Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment and Sustainable Development, Indian Institute of Forest Management, Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History, Central Zoo Authority, etc.; and Capacity building and human resource development in the area of wildlife research and management at various levels through a large number of programmes including National Green Skills Development for the local stakeholders, Biodiversity Management Committees and Bare-foot Taxonomists (Parataxonomists) conservation efforts. In addition, Biological Diversity Act, 2002 has also been enacted with the aim to conserve biological resources of the country and regulation of access to these resources to ensure equitable sharing of benefits arising out of their use. Under the Act, a National Biodiversity Authority and State Biodiversity Boards in all States have been set up for implementing the provisions of the Act.******
