Details of cities participation in the Swachh Survekshans since its launch in 2016 is as under :Sl. No.	Year	Number of Cities participated1.	2016	732.	2017	4343.	2018	4,2034.	2019	4,2375.	2020	4,2426.	2021	4,320The seventh ‘Swachh Survekshan (SS)-2022’, titled ‘Azadi@75’, has been launched on September 27, 2021. (b): The details of the top ranking ULBs during the last two years are as under:All India       Top ranking Urban Local Bodies (ULBs)position	Swachh Survekshan, 2020	   Swachh Survekshan, 20211st rank	Indore, Madhya Pradesh	   Indore, Madhya Pradesh2nd rank	Surat, Gujarat	           Surat, Gujarat3rd rank	Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra   Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh(c):  Cities performance in Swachh Survekshan is recognised and rewarded in a national level felicitation ceremony. List of such award categories in SS-2021 is annexed.(d):  Various digital interventions have been introduced to digitize and accelerate the implementation of SBM-U. Key interventions are as under :(i). Swachhata App: On this App citizens can register their complaints about ‘Swachhata’ to ensure that ULB officials resolve these issues.  Till date more than 1.80 crore citizens have downloaded the Swachhata App, registering more than 2.40 crore complaints, out of which 2.24 crore complaints have been resolved.(ii). SBM Toilet Locator: To provide easy access to Community/ Public Toilets (CT/PT), more than 66,000 toilet blocks have been uploaded across 3,296 ULBs.  The users can also register their feedbacks on the maintenance of the toilets in the in-built feedback machine in the toilet premises, which help ULBs in monitoring cleanliness, maintenance and upkeep of the toilets.(iii) Swachhatam Portal : The single destination Swachhata Management Portal, launched on November 20, 2021 under SBM-U 2.0 serves as the single data source for the ULBs to upload their updated progress, prepare their action plans, submit the project proposals for funding, project tracking, Star Rating for Garbage free Cities and ODF (Open Defecation Free) Protocol etc., for the assessment agencies to validate the same from citizens and field verifications during annual assessments.(e): The assessment for evaluating Solid Waste Management (SWM) under the Swachh Survekshan is primarily made on the basis of certain Service Level Indicators (SLIs) which includes adoption of the practice of door-to-door collection of waste, segregation at source, transportation of waste, scientific processing of the waste through various methods which involve material recovery facilities (MRFs), waste to compost (WtC), Waste to Energy (WtE), Biomethanation and recycling of Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste and the final disposal through sanitary landfills and other methods. Sustainable Sanitation and SafaiMitra Suraksha have also a bearing during the assessment. The Survekshan also has a ‘people first’ approach and therefore citizens’ voice is captured during the assessment. (f) : To assess the ODF and sanitation status Standard Operating Protocols (SOPs) have been developed for certification of ULBs as Open Defecation Free (ODF), ODF+, ODF++ and Water+ status.A city can be declared ODF if at any point of the day, not even a single person is found defecating in the open.Parameter for declaring a city ODF+ is that at any point of the day, not even a single person is found defecating and / or urinating in the open, and all community and public toilets are functional, hygienic and well maintained.For ODF++ status, the parameter is that the city, in addition to ODF+, should also comply the condition that faecal sludge/ septage and sewerage is safely managed and treated, with no discharging and /or dumping of untreated faecal sludge/ septage and sewerage in drains, water bodies or open areas.Parameter of Water+ status is that a city should have met all the ODF++ standards and also the residual sewage from residential and commercial establishments is released into the environment only after treatment.                       *****
