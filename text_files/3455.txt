ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)	& (b)	Yes, Government is awate of soil erosion caused by heavy floods and consequent damages. Soil erosion by river is a dynamic and natural process resulting in changes in river course and causing loss of land, the intensity of which varies with time and space. The extent of maximum area affected in a year by floods as per XII Plan Working Group Report on “Flood Management and Region Specific Issues: is 49.815 million hectare. The details of damages caused by floods across the country State-wise as per the data available with Central Water Commission during the year 2015, 2016 and 2017 are at Axxexure-I(c)	&  (d)	In order to assess the extent of coastal erosion at national level, a Shoreline Change Atlas of the Indian coast, has been prepared by Space Application Centre, Ahmedabad in association with Central Water Commission (CWC), funded by then Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation. This Atlas comprises of shoreline change maps prepared using satellite data of different timeframe, on 1:25,000 scale for the entire country. The maps show eroding, stable and accreting coast along with the status of coastal protection measures taken up by maritime States/UTs.Ministry of Earth |Sciences through National Centre for Coastal Research, Chennai is monitoring the shoreline changes along Indian coast on annual basis, which provides information on coastal erosion at district level in 1:25,000 scale. So far, 26 years data from 1990 to 2016 has been analysed and found that ~33% of mainland coastline is subjected to erosion. Over all, during 1990 to 2016, about 231.50 sq. km of land is gained by accretion and 234.25 sq. km land was lost by erosion along the Indian mainland. The State-wise status of sea erosion (1990-2016) along the Indian Coast is as given in Annexure II(e) and (f)   The subject of flood management including erosion control being within the purview of the States, the flood management and anti-erosion schemes are planned, investigated and implemented by the State Governments with their own resources as per priority within the State. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by way of technical guidance and promotional financial assistance to the States for flood management in critical areas.A Centrally Sponsored Scheme “Critical anti-sea erosion works in coastal and other than Ganga basin States”  was implemented by Government of India during X plan period under which the anti-sea erosion works of the States of karnatka ,kerala, Maharastra, Odisha, Tamil nadu, and UT of Puducherry were included and provided central assistance. This centrally sponsored scheme along with three others were merged together and a restructured scheme namely “Flood Management Programme (FMP)” under State Sector in Central plan was launched in XI plan period for providing central assistance to the State Governments for taking up works related to river management, flood control, anti-erosion,, drainage development, flood proofing works , restoration of damaged flood management works and anti-sea erosion works which was continued during XII plan. A  scheme viz.”Flood Management and Border Areas Programme (FMBAP) for flood management works in entire country and River Management activities and works related to Border Areas with an outlay of Rs. 3342 crores is under implementation during 2017-18 to 2019-20.Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change (MoEF & CC) is implementing Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) project in the identified coastal stretches of three States namely Gujarat, Odisha and West Bengal. Under this Project, MoEF & CC has mapped shoreline changes through National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), Chennai in association with the Institute for Ocean Management (IOM), Anna University, Chennai and designated high erosion, medium erosion, low erosion/stable coast along Coast of India.Mapping and demarcation of Hazard line along the mainland of the Indian coast is one of the major initiatives to control and protect the coastal lives, infrastructures from natural hazards like storm, tsunami and cyclone which is carried out by survey of india as an activity of national component of ICZM  project. The hazard line is the composite lines of the erosion line and flood line. Hazard line will be most important management tool in the area of coastal management. The work of mapping and delineation of hazard line is completed.*****ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) to (b) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3119 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 11.07.2019 REGARDING “SOIL EROSION”STATEMENT SHOWING STATE-WISE FLOOD DAMAGE DURING 2017 Sl.No	Name of State	Area Affected (Mha)	Population Affected (Million)	Damages to Crops	Damage to Houses	Cattle Lost Nos.
