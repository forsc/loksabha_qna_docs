As per UNWTO World Tourism barometer for May 2020, UNWTO estimated a reduction of 58 per cent to 78 per cent in tourist traffic across the world. Three scenarios were assumed on the basis of possible dates of lifting of travel   restrictions and gradual re-opening of international borders.i.

Scenario 3 (-78% in 2020) based on the same in early DecemberAdditionally, according to UNWTO World Tourism barometer published in January 2021, UNWTO estimated a reduction of 73.9% in 2020 over the previous year International tourist arrivals (overnight visitors) across the world. Whereas, UNWTO estimated a reduction of 53.5% International tourist arrivals (overnight visitors) to India in 2020 over the previous year.
