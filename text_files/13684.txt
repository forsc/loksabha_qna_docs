ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS [SHRI KIREN RIJIJU]  (a) to (e) Performance of sportspersons in international events is dependent on the stage of development of sports in a country in terms of sports infrastructure, training / coaching methods, sports science, etc. Achievements of Indian sportspersons and teams in international sports events, including mega sports events, in recent past shows that there has been a perceptible improvement in performance of Indian sportspersons in international sports events.  While Sports is a State subject and the responsibility of development of Sports rests with the State Governments, the Central Government is playing a pivotal role for promoting high performance in sports. National Sports Federations (NSFs) are being encouraged and supported for attainment of their respective medium and long term plans. Annual targets for training of athletes for high performance and their participation in competition are approved for different NSFs by this Ministry in the annual exercise of preparing Annual Calendar for Training and Competitions (ACTCs). With the launch of Khelo India Scheme, there has been increased awareness and participation of people in sports and Indian athletes have earned accolades in sports such as archery, athletics, badminton, boxing, hockey, shooting, wrestling, weightlifting, etc. in international events. This Ministry (i) has set up expert training facilities in the Sports Authority of India (SAI) Centres across the country in various States including in Maharashtra; (ii) is supporting athletes for participation in international exposure and competitions through financial assistance to NSFs; and (iii) providing customized support and assistance to high performance medal prospect athletes under the Target Olympic Podium Scheme.****
