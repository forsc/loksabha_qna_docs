The Ministry has been taking measures on a continuing basis to improve the revenue receipts with a combination of initiatives such as targeting progressively higher traffic throughput, expansion/diversification of commodity basket, effective and innovative marketing strategies to capture more and more traffic, creation of additional capacity and optimum utilization of the existing rail infrastructure including rolling stock, enhancement in productivity and efficiency, improvement of passenger interface, periodic rationalization of fare and freight rates and focus on increasing the share of non-fare revenue sources in Railways’ total revenue. Alongside, there is a continuous upgradation in facilities provided to the railway passengers aimed at enhancing ease of travelling and passenger experience. (c)  Creation of employment opportunities by Railways is a continuous process in consonance with requirement of manpower. Recruitment process for two Centralized Employment Notification (CENs) for filling up of 36,944 Group-C vacancies released by Railway Recruitment Boards (RRBs) has been initiated. Further recruitment has also been notified for filling up of 1,03,769 vacancies for Level-1 (erstwhile Group ‘D’ post).(d) Activities in Railways help to create employment opportunities in private sector both directly and indirectly.  ****
