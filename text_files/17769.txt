ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) The draft National Land Reforms Policy prepared by a Task Force is under examination. Also, As per Entry 18 and Entry 45 in the State List, ‘Land’ is a State subject. Power to enact laws relating to ‘Land’ vests in Legislatures of States. Each State has its own State-specific Revenue Laws to deal with ''Land'' and matters related thereto.(b) In case of Landless beneficiary under PMAY-G, States have to ensure that the beneficiary is provided land from the Government land or any other land including public land (Panchayat common land, Community land or land belonging to other local authorities). Landless beneficiaries are accorded highest priority and are placed on the top of the priority list. The landless beneficiary cannot be skipped in the allotment of the house. As on 10/09/2020 the States/UTs have identified 4,48,053 landless beneficiaries and 1,81,319 beneficiaries have already been provided land.
