ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND PENSIONS AND PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR. JITENDRA SINGH):(a)	Yes, Sir. Government is aware of the news which was published in local newspapers and social media on 21.09.2020 regarding the alleged explosion and damage in the repository tanks at Nongbah Jynrin (Domiasiat), South-west Khasi Hills, Meghalaya. Subsequently, a team of Scientific Officers and technical staff of Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD), North Eastern Region, Shillong visited the site on 25.09.2020 to inspect the alleged damage of repository tanks in the presence of Deputy Superintendent of Police, South-West Khasi Hills, Shillong, Mawkyrwat.  The team observed the following :     •	There was no explosion in the repository tanks as alleged.     •	The team observed a few man made holes on the top slab covering the repository tanks.     •	After a thorough inspection with radiation detection instruments the team did not record any        harmful radiation leakage/seepage from these tanks. The team again visited the site on 07.10.2020 to inspect and supervise the repair work of the manmade damage to the repository tanks. The repository tanks were repaired and the radioactivity level over these tanks was again measured and it was recorded to be below the permissible limit. There was no leakage of radioactive material. Five (05) no. water samples were collected from the water bodies near the site, which analysed <1.0ppb uranium. This confirms that there was no leakage or contamination of uranium in the water bodies and surrounding area.(b)	Yes, Sir. Government/Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) adopts the best safety practices of international standard in uranium mining presently in operation in various locations at Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh.  Further, all the operations of UCIL are being frequently monitored by various statutory and regulatory bodies viz. Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB), Health Physics Unit (HPU), Director General of Mines Safety (DGMS), Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and Pollution Control Board (PCB) etc. from time to time.******
