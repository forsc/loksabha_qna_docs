The demand for energy from mining of the digital currencies including cryptocurrencies may be met within the overall demand projection under EPS.  It may be noted that the actual demand is less than the projected demand in EPS.  Therefore, any additional demand due to such new commercial/industrial activities shall get served within the overall energy projection given in EPS.***********
