STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (e)OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *89REGARDING WEATHER INSTRUMENT SYSTEMS FOR AIRPORTSTO BE ANSWERED ON FRIDAY, 22ND NOVEMBER, 2019.(a)	No Sir. Due to operational exigencies, IMD plans to install Integrated Automatic Weather observing System (AWOS) at 18 airports (where the weekly flights are more than 500) on turnkey basis. The Request for Proposal (RFP) for the same is under preparation. Indian companies will be able to participate in the tendering process for AWOS at these 18 airports and the procurement process will be as per the Government of India guidelines to encourage “Make in India” products. The integrated AWOS comprises of many components including Meteorological Sensors, Data Acquisition system (DAS), Central Data Processing & Integration system (CDPI), Communication System, Workstations & Displays, Data and Product Archival System (DAPS) & Auto generation of reports etc as per the guidelines and protocol prescribed by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).The instrument named “Drishti”, developed by National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) for measuring Runway Visual Range (RVR) is only one of the many components of the integrated AWOS.(b)	Yes Sir. Government of India has issued directive to give preference on Make in India products vide Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) OM P-4502/2/2017-B.E.-II dated 15 June 2017.(c)	No Sir.(d)	A partnership agreement between IMD and NAL, Bangalore was signed on 20thMay, 2014 for supply, maintenance and upkeep of ‘Drishti’ at a cost of Rs 18 lakh +taxes per unit. IMD has installed 45 Drishti systems at 28 airports so far. IMD will be soon placing order for additional 20 ‘Drishti’ instruments. (e)	In recent years, no such systems are imported. Hence it is difficult to estimate the current cost of such systems.
