(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	Bhartiya Prakritik Krishi Padhati (BPKP) has been introduced as a sub scheme of Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) since 2020-21 for the promotion of traditional indigenous practices including Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF). The scheme mainly emphasises on exclusion of all synthetic chemical inputs and promotes on-farm biomass recycling with major stress on biomass mulching; use of cow dung-urine formulations; plant based preparations and time to time working of soil for aeration. Under BPKP, financial assistance of Rs 12200/ha for 3 years is provided for cluster formation, capacity building and continuous handholding by trained personnel, certification and residue analysis. 	Until now, under natural farming an area of 4.09 lakh ha area has been covered and a total fund of Rs. 4980.99 lakh has been released in 8 States across the country including the State of Tamil Nadu. The State –wise details of funds released under BPKP is given at Annexure – I.(b) to (d):	ICAR (Indian Council of Agriculture Research) through ICAR- Indian Institute of Farming System Research, Modipuram, Uttar Pradesh and All India Network Project on Organic Farming (AI-NPOF) initiated studies on “Evaluation of Concoctions of ZBNF farming practices in different agro-ecologies in Basmati Rice-Wheat System” in four States from rabi 2017 and also initiated studies on “Evaluation and validation of Natural Farming Practices in different agro-ecologies” in 16 States from Kharif 2020 to evaluate the effect of zero budget farming practices on productivity, economics and soil health including soil organic carbon and soil fertility.
