                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI KRISHANPAL GURJAR)(a)	& (b) This Ministry has not conducted any survey regarding requirement of trained teachers for teaching children with disabilities. The Department of School Education & Literacy, Ministry of Human Resource & Development, in the year 2018-19, has launched Samagra Shiksha - an integrated scheme for School Education covering children from classes I to XII. There is a dedicated component for Inclusive Education for Children with Special Needs (CWSN) wherein various provisions are available for the educational needs of CWSN. The focus of Samagra Shiksha is on providing inclusive education to children with special needs wherein, children regardless of their abilities/disabilities participate and learn together in the same class, thus creating an enabling educational environment for all students. The Special educators under Samagra Shiksha work in itinerant mode and also build capacities of general teachers to address the needs of CWSN. (c) & (d) As per the Rehabilitation Council of India (RCI), the ratio of trained teachers and the children with disabilities varies from 1:4 to 1:15 depending on the nature of disabilities.(e)  Ministry of Human Resource & Development has informed that the centrally sponsored scheme of the Samagra Shiksha has provisions for support of salary for general teachers and special educators at both elementary & secondary levels of schooling. Additionally, the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) & Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) recognize Special Education courses for appointment of teachers. Under Samagra Shiksha, same norms are applicable and sanctioned for financial support for salary of teachers as well as special educators under Samagra Shiksha. *****
