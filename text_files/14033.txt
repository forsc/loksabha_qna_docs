ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b)	At the UN Summit on Sustainable Development held on 25 September 2015 in New York, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development ‘Transforming the World’ was adopted. The 2030 Agenda has 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets with poverty eradication as its overarching focus.  The 17 SDGs replaced the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and are applicable till 2030.	The 2030 Agenda and its actionable core of 17 SDGs resemble India''s own vision of development.  Government of India’s initiatives such as Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, Swachh Bharat, Jan Dhan Yojana, Digital India, Skill India etc., closely relate to several targets under the SDGs .  ***
