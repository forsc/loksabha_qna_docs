The Government had sought the recommendations of TRAI on the auction of spectrum in various bands. The recommendations of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) and the subsequent reply from TRAI to DoT’s back reference were considered by a Standing Committee in DoT. The recommendations of the Standing Committee were later considered by the Digital Communications Commission (DCC). Subsequently a Draft Cabinet Note (DCN) has been prepared for the auction of the spectrum. The DCN is presently under consideration in the Department. The successful bidders of the spectrum auction can deploy mobile services using any technology including 5G.(c) to (d) 	Government has received a request from Broadband India Forum (BIF) stating that 5G prices recommended by TRAI are too high. Concerns on high reserve price were conveyed by the Government to TRAI. However TRAI did not review the prices.(e) 	M/s Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) has requested DoT to assign spectrum for 5G services on Pan India basis (except for Delhi and Mumbai LSAs).(f)	Government has approved the Revival Package for BSNL to make it competitive.************
