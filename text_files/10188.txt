ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):   As per available estimates of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) reported in 2010, out of total geographical area of 328.73 million hectare, about 120.40 million hectare is affected by various kinds of land degradation in the country including Karnataka. This includes water and wind erosion (94.87 million hectare), water logging (0.91 million hectare), soil alkalinity/ sodicity (3.71 million hectare), soil acidity (17.93 million hectare), soil salinity (2.73 million hectare) and mining and industrial waste (0.26 million hectare). However, no data is available in respect of degradation due to flooding.(c):  	     There may be some loss of productivity in the severely affected pockets of degraded land of the country. However, food grain production in the country has been increased from 252.02 m.tonne in the year 2014-15 to 284.95 m.tonne in year 2018-19 (4th Advanced Estimate) due to various efforts of Government. Hence, there is no significant impact on economy. (d) & (e):  ICAR through Indian Institute of Soil and Water Conservation (IISWC), Dehradun has developed several location specific bio-engineering measures of soil and water conservation to reduce soil loss due to water erosion. Besides, ICAR provides technical backstopping and organise regular training courses for field functionaries and farmers on participatory watershed management.*******
