THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI SOM PARKASH)(a) to (c): 	Geographical Indications (GI) products are those products which are distinguished by the uniqueness, reputation and link to the definite geographical area and are registered in relation to agricultural, natural or manufactured goods, including food stuff, handicrafts & handlooms originating from a definite geographical territory. While the legislative framework for registration and protection of GIs is provided by the Geographical Indication (Registration & Protection) Act, 1999, there is a need to create awareness to promote, protect and enhance the marketability of these GI goods. As GIs represent our rich culture and collective intellectual heritage and most of these GI products are created by rural communities/tribes living in remote areas, therefore, promoting these products supplements the incomes of our rural artisans, weavers, craftsmen and farmers.A total of 48 GI Applications have been received from the State of Karnataka as on 09.03.2021, of these 46 applications have been granted GI registration. The details of all the GI applications received from the State of Karnataka are given at Annexure-A1.Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) has been taking various initiatives and steps in consultation with other ministries/ departments/ organisation for promoting as well as increasing the export potential of Geographical Indications (GI) products, with a focus to improve the livelihood of the artisans and producers: 1.	Launch of GI logo and tagline for branding and promotion of all Indian GIs irrespective of their categories. Opening of exclusive GI store at the Goa airport in January 2019.2.	Launch of GI web portal http://wahgi.ncog.gov.in, to promote and disseminate information about various GIs of India. 3.	APEDA has organized Virtual Buyer Seller Meets on GI products with USA in October 2020. A GI promotion programme and exhibition was also organized by APEDA in Varanasi to promote GI products of the state of Uttar Pradesh in December, 2020.4.	 Social Media Initiatives post laying interesting stories and factoids on GIs are being shared on CIPAM’s social media handles (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook) using #LetsTalkIP and people are encouraged to buy and use GI as gifts, souvenirs at conferences, corporate gifting and government events and on special occasions, etc. via “Gift a GI” campaign.5.	Participation in various events for promotion of GIs, such as WTO@20 Conference, New Delhi 2017, Thaifex Trade Fair, 2017, Annapoorna – World of Food India, 2017, World of Food India, 2017, Annapoorna: World of Food India, 2018, India International Trade Fair (IITF), 2018, Hyderabad Design Week, 2019, Global Exhibition on Services (GES), 2019 and Virtual Exhibition in Geographical Indication Festival of India (GIFI), 2021.*****
