Providing better services to its beneficiaries by ESI Corporation (ESIC) is a continuous process. To strengthen service delivery, ESIC has made tie-up arrangements with 2,104 private hospitals and empaneled 1,003 Insured Medical Practitioners (IMPs) to supplement the ESIC run medical care.  Further, at places where ESI hospitals are not available, integration has been done with Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) and the entire expenditure for treatment of such ESI beneficiaries is borne by ESIC.  Furthermore, to provide specialized services, referral services are also made available to eligible beneficiaries.ESIC has also digitized various services provided by it including registration of employers and establishments, demographic registration of employees/ insured persons and their family members, seeding of bank account details, health records, revenue income/ expenditure etc. to give efficient services.(b) & (c):	Taking into account existing facilities in ESIC and with objective to further improve the services, Niti Aayog, in consultation with ESIC has identified four broad areas of reforms which inter-alia include network expansion, changes in Governance & Management, upgradation of IT Management and Increased Beneficiary Engagement.
