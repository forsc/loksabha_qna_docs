ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) & (b) : The Star Rating technique fulfils the objective of energy savings in high energy consuming equipment and appliances by optimizing the energy performance of these appliances and equipments. The Standards & Labeling Programme of Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), a statutory body under the Ministry of Power, provides a rating from 1 to 5 star (5 star being the most efficient) for each registered appliance from the respective category, based on the energy performance criteria. The scheme has reported energy savings of 55.7 billion units (BU) of electricity in the year 2018-19. (c) & (d) : 26 appliances have been covered under the Standards & Labelling Programme, out of which 10 are under the mandatory regime while the remaining 16 are under voluntary regime. Details of appliances and equipment covered under this Programme are furnished at Annexure. (e) & (f) :  	BEE’s Star Labelling Programme is technology agnostic.  The programme rates an appliance based on its energy performance on a scale of 1 to 5, irrespective of technology used in the appliance. Keeping in view the   advancements in technology, BEE periodically upgrades the energy performance of appliances, in order to enhance availability of more energy efficient appliances  in the market. Based on the market transformation, appliances are also shifted from voluntary regime to the mandatory regime.************
