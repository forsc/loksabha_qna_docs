ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a): As on 01.04.2021, there were 3660 Road Over Bridges (ROBs), 10935 Road Under Bridges (RUBs) and 19532 Manned Level Crossings (MLCs) in the country.        All Unmanned level crossing (UMLCs) on Broad Gauge (BG) have been eliminated before 31.01.2019. Only 863 UMLCs on Meter Gauge (MG) and Narrow Gauge (NG) sections are existing  which are planned for elimination during Gauge conversion.         There are 26 Nos. of MLCs in Bengaluru and 8 Nos. of MLCs in Mysuru.(b):  06 Nos. of  ROBs/RUBs in Bengaluru and 02  Nos. in Mysuru are being constructed to ease traffic.(c): 06 Nos. of railway crossings have been converted in Road Under Bridges/Road Over Bridges (RUBs/ROBs) in the cities of Bengaluru and Mysuru since 2014 at an estimated cost of ` 32 crore.  06 Nos. of ROBs/RUBs in Mysuru and 15 Nos. of ROBs/RUBs in Bengaluru are sanctioned at an estimated cost of ` 30 crore and 250 crore respectively.(d): Generally, there is no problem of construction of ROBs/ RUBs in Railway portion.  However, the problem is faced in construction of approaches because of many factors such as fixing the alignment of approaches, land acquisition, encroachments, finalization of General Arrangement Drawing (GAD), acceptance of estimate, allocation of requisite funds by State Government etc. Therefore, it is not feasible to fix timelines for completion of these ROB/RUBs.*****
