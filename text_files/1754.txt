                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	 Government is already implementing various missions and schemes aimed at improvement in agriculture productivity as well as to fulfil the needs of the farmers. Recently, the Government started the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme, effective from 1.12.2018, to provide income support to all Small and Marginal landholder farmer families across the country, subject to certain exclusions, to enable them to take care of expenses related to agriculture and allied activities as well as domestic needs. The Scheme provide a payment of Rs.6000/- per year, in three 4-monthly installments of Rs.2000/-, to the farmers’ families with cultivable land holding upto 2 hectare, subject to certain exclusions relating to higher income groups. The ambit of the Scheme has now been expanded to cover all farmers in the country irrespective of the size of their land holdings, subject to all other exclusions.           Further, the Government has recently approved a pension scheme for all Small and Marginal Farmers (SMF) in the country, subject to certain exclusion clauses, with a view to provide them social security net as they have minimal or no savings to provide for old age and to support  them  in  the event of  consequent  loss  of  livelihood. The  scheme  provides for  payment  of a minimum fixed pension of Rs.3,000/- per month to the eligible farmers on attaining the age of 60 years. It is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme, with entry age of 18 to 40 years. The beneficiary can opt to become member of the Scheme by subscribing to a Pension Fund, managed by the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC).  The beneficiary is required to contribute Rs 100/ - per month in the pension fund at median entry age of 29 years, with matching contribution of Rs.100 by the Central Government.Contd..2/--2-(c):       The Government supplements the efforts of the State Governments by coordinating seed requirement and availability through the mechanism of Zonal Seeds Review Meetings prior to each sowing season and developing Seed Rolling Plan of the State Governments. The Government already provides financial assistance for production and distribution of High Yielding Varieties (HYVs) seeds to the States and implementing agencies through various ongoing crop development programmes / schemes viz. National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Bringing Green Revolution in Eastern India (BGREI), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Sub-Mission on Seeds and Planting Materials (SMSP) under National Mission on Agricultural Extension & Technology (NMAET), etc. which help in enhancing productivity of various crops and also improving profitability of Agriculture sector in the country.  For irrigation, various Water Resources Projects are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priority. In order to supplement their efforts, the Ministry of Jal Shakti provides technical and financial assistance  to State Governments to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes, such as, Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP), the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY). Besides, the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare implements ‘Per Drop More Crop (PDMC)’ component of the PMKSY which focuses on enhancing water use efficiency at farm level through Micro Irrigation technologies viz. Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation.       The Government has implemented the price policy to ensure remunerative prices to farmers by offering to procure their produce at Minimum Support Price (MSP) through the Price Support Scheme (PPS) and ensure MSP through Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS). Procurement of pulses and oilseeds has been stepped up in recent years to assure remunerative prices to farmers. Government has also taken several steps to provide remunerative prices to farmers for their produce which include undertaking procurement through designated procurement agencies, implementing e-National Agriculture Market (e-NAM), enacting the Model Agricultural Procuce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion & Facilitation) Act,2017 and promoting Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs). ********
