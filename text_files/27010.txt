Government, on 25th February 2021, has notified the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Codes) Rules,  to ensure accountability of intermediaries including social media platforms to users and enhanced user safety. Further, the rules define the additional due diligence for the Significant Social Media Intermediaries (SSMIs) which have come into effect from 26th May, 2021. These Rules also cover due diligence to be followed by publishers of online news platforms. There is no further plan to introduce any new scheme.(d):  The Rules requiring due diligence to be followed by all intermediaries have already become effective with its notification and the additional due diligence to be followed by the SSMI have also become effective from 26th May, 2021. The Rules have created a robust grievance redressal mechanism empowering users to seek time bound response. The intermediaries are also required to remove any unlawful material on receipt of a court order or on being notified by an Appropriate Government or its authorised agency.*******
