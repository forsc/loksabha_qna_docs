Though, there is no official estimation of logistics cost for India, some private institutions have estimated the logistics cost to the 13 to 14 percent of the GDP. The proposed Policy aims to reduce this to 9-10 percent of the GDP. (b):		With a view to create robust human resources for the textiles sector, particularly the need for trained and skilled workforce in all segment of the textile sector, Ministry of Textiles has been implementing various skill development schemes and programmes since the financial year 2010-11.Under the Comprehensive Integrated Skill Development Scheme (ISDS), a total of 11.14 lakh persons have been trained during FY 2010-11 to 2017-18, in various diverse segments of textile sector covering textiles and apparel, jute, spinning, weaving, technical textiles, sericulture, handloom and handicrafts. The training in ISDS also covered 33 States and Union Territories of the country, widely covering all sections of the society such as women(71.27%), Scheduled Caste(20.82%), Schedule Tribes (6.9%) and Divyang Jan(0.28%). Out of the 11.14 lakh persons trained, 8.43 lakh persons have been employed.In further continuation, Ministry of Textiles has expanded the skill development programme, called Samarth- Scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector, for the entire value chain of the textiles sector (except spinning and weaving in organized sector which are being trained under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana) with a target of 10 lakh persons at a total outlay of Rs.1300 crore. Overall framework for implementation including costing for the capacity building programmes is in alignment with the broad policy framework for skill development viz. Common Norms, National Skills Qualifications Framwork (NSQF) etc. adopted by Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE). The training programme and course curriculum have been rationalized keeping in view the technological and market demand status of the domestic and international economies.
