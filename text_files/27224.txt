                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a)  The Feasibility Report (FR) of Mekedatu Balancing Reservoir cum Drinking Water Project was submitted to Central Water Commission (CWC) by Government of Karnataka for according "in-principle" clearance for preparation of Detailed Project Report (DPR) of the project.  The Screening Committee of Central Water Commission in its meeting held on 24.10.2018 accorded “in-principle” clearance for preparation of DPR by project authority (Government of Karnataka) subject to certain conditions including that: “As the main objective of this scheme as stated in the FR is to implement the Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunal(CWDT) Award as modified by the Hon''ble Supreme Court, acceptance of Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) would be a pre-requisite for consideration of the DPR by the Advisory Committee of MoWR, RD & GR”. Subsequently, DPR of Mekedatu Balancing Reservoir cum Drinking Water Project was submitted to CWC by Government of Karnataka in January 2019 and copies of DPR were forwarded to Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA). Discussion on the DPR of the above project was included as an agenda item during various meetings of CWMA, however, as per the minutes of various meetings of CWMA, discussion on the same could not be held due to lack of consensus from party States on this agenda item. (b) & (c) The Government of Tamil Nadu submitted a complaint dated 30.11.2019 under Section 3 of Inter State River Water Dispute Act, 1956 requesting Union Government to constitute a Tribunal under Section 4 of the Inter-State River Water Disputes Act, 1956 for adjudication of water disputes of the Inter-state River Pennaiyar also known as Thenpennai. In their complaint, Tamil Nadu has also objected to construction of a dam by Karnataka across Markandeya river, a tributary of Pennaiyar river. Subsequent to the complaint of Government of Tamil Nadu dated 30.11.2019, a Negotiation Committee under the Chairmanship of Chairman, Central Water Commission (CWC) was constituted on 20.1.2020 under Section 4 of the ISRWD Act, 1956. Two meetings of the negotiation committee were held. The Negotiation Committee was of the considered view that any further negotiations by this Committee would not be useful and as such, no further meeting of the Committee was proposed. To proceed further on the issue, CWC vide  letters dated 16.03.2021 and 08.07.2021 requested party States i.e. Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and UT of Puducherry to furnish some additional information. The concerned States /UT are required to respond in the matter.*****
