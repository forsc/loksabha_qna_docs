ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E RMINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a):    The Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) is operated under the provisions of the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), which is implemented in all States/UTs and provides for a maximum of 81.35 Crore beneficiaries in the country to receive the monthly benefit of subsidized foodgrains through TPDS. Under NFSA inter-alia all operational aspects of TPDS, including the identification of eligible beneficiaries up to respective ceiling limits of NFSA, issuance of either Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) or Priority Household (PHH) category ration cards to them, and distribution of subsidized foodgrains to them through Fair Price Shops (FPSs) are the responsibilities of the respective State/UT Governments. Accordingly, the Department allocates foodgrains to States/UTs for distribution to their identified beneficiaries under NFSA at the scale of 35 Kg. per AAY household per month and 5 Kg. per PHH beneficiary per month at highly subsidized Central Issue Prices (CIP) of Rs. 3, 2, and 1 per Kg for Rice, Wheat and Coarse grains respectively......2/--2-(b):   	Under NFSA, the Department allocates only foodgrains (Rice, Wheat and Coarse grains) to all States/UTs including Rajasthan for distribution to NFSA beneficiaries through TPDS. As per the current coverage of State under NFSA, the State is entitled to 27.92 LMT of foodgrains per year, and as per the requirement of the State, the Department has allocated Wheat to the Government of Rajasthan during the last three years. Item-wise details of foodgrains allocated to Rajasthan during each of the last three years and the current year is as under :Year	Quantity of wheat allocated (in LMT) under NFSA2018-19	27.922019-20	27.922020-21	27.882021-22	27.71(c) & (d): 	Section 9 of the Act provides that the total number of persons to be covered in rural and urban areas of the State shall be calculated on the basis of the population estimates as per the Census of which the relevant figures have been published. The allocation is made on the basis of beneficiaries identified by the States/UTs, up to their respective ceiling of beneficiaries determined under NFSA for each State/UT. Therefore, at present, there is no provision under the Act for enhancement of allocation of foodgrains in accordance with the increase in population.*****
