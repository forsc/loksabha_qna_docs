However, both these rail line projects are not amongst the identified strategic railway lines.So far, land acquisition for both the Supaul – Araria new rail line and Araria- Galgalaia new rail line projects has been taken up. Earthwork and Bridgeworks have been taken up on section where land has been acquired.Completion of a Railway project depends on various factors like forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions, priority of projects, etc. and all these factors affect the completion time of the project.To ensure that projects are completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, Zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues obstructing the progress of projects. *****
