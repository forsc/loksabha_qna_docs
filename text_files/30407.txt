ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) carried out water quality assessment with respect to uranium in groundwater for the entire country including Bihar for the first time during 2019. As per this assessment, the occurrence of uranium in ground water beyond the BIS permissible limits (0.03 mg/l) of drinking water observed in parts of certain districts in Bihar viz. Saran, Bhabhua, Khagaria, Madhepura, Nawada, Sheikhpura, Purnea, Kisanganj and Begusarai.(b) This Department has not conducted any specific study on impact of use of groundwater with excess uranium concentration on human health.  However, health studies carried out elsewhere in the world suggest that elevated uranium level in drinking water may be associated with kidney toxicity. (c) As per information available with CGWB, the occurrence of arsenic in ground water beyond the BIS permissible limits (0.01 mg/l) of drinking water have been observed in parts of certain districts in Bihar viz. Begusarai, Bhagalpur, Bhojpur, Buxar, Darbhanga, East Champaran, Gopalganj, Katihar, Khagaria, Lakhisarai, Lohardaga, Madhepura, Muzaffarpur, Purnea, Saharsa, Samastipur, Siwan, Vaishali and West Champaran.    Further, Department of Drinking Water & Sanitation had launched a National Water Quality Sub-Mission (NWQSM) on 22nd March, 2017 as a part of National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), which has now been subsumed under Jal Jeevan Mission, to provide, on priority, safe drinking water to 27,544 Arsenic/ Fluoride affected rural habitations in the country. *****
