ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) 	From time to time, Indian fishermen along with their boats are apprehended by authorities of neighboring countries for allegedly fishing in their waters. There have been few reports of Indian fishing boats being attacked by Pakistan authorities. Most recently, in January 2019, an Indian fishing boat was reportedly fired upon and sunk by Pakistan Marine Security Agency (PMSA). Similarly, there have been few instances when some Indian fishermen who were arrested on grounds of fishing in Sri Lankan waters have complained of assault by Sri Lankan Navy.(b)	Government attaches highest priority to the safety, security and welfare of Indian fishermen. The matter of apprehension of Indian fishermen and their fishing boats is raised at the highest levels and strong protests are lodged in the countries concerned. It is reiterated to the countries concerned that the fishermen issue may be considered as a purely humanitarian and livelihood concern and there should not be any use of force under any circumstances. As a result of sustained diplomatic efforts by the Government, 2004 Indian fishermen and 380 boats have been released by Sri Lanka Government since May 2014. Similarly, persistent diplomatic efforts of the Government of India have led to release and repatriation of 2080 Indian fishermen and 57 Indian fishing boats from Pakistan’s custody since 2014.***
