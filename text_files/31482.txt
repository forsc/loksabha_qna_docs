                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) to (b) In terms of the advisory issued by the Department of Rural Development, Ministry of Rural Development on foundation laying/inauguration of projects of Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), all elected representatives associated with the programme should be duly invited to the foundation laying and inauguration ceremonies. The foundation stone for a PMGSY road should be laid and on completion of the work, the road should be inaugurated by the Hon’ble Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha) with the function presided over by the local Hon’ble Minister or other dignitary as per State protocol. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) is a demand driven scheme with bottom to top approach. Under the scheme, the Gram Panchayat is responsible for identifying the project in the Gram Panchayat area to be taken up as per the recommendation of Gram Sabha/Ward Sabha. The Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) is an individual beneficiary oriented scheme. A total of 8 complaints have been received from Hon’ble Members of Parliament during the last three years and current year complaining about non-invitation in foundation laying and inauguration ceremonies of projects under PMGSY. The complaints were examined in consultation with the concerned States/UTs and the Hon’ble Members of Parliament were apprised of the factual reports submitted by the State Government concerned on the complaints. In order to ensure that the advisory issued by the Ministry with regard to role of Hon’ble MP in foundation laying/inauguration of PMGSY project are complied with in letter and spirit, the Ministry has time and again advised all the State Governments/Union Territories to strictly comply with the provisions of the advisory. (c) to (f)      The PMGSY has inbuilt mechanism for consultation with public representatives at planning, selection of roads and monitoring stages.  As per the programme guidelines, the proposals received from the Members of Parliament with regard to selection of roads are given full consideration and such proposals that cannot be included are communicated in writing to the Members of Parliament with reasons for non-inclusion of such proposal in each case. In order to ensure that the State Government give due attention towards provisions of the programme guidelines while submitting the proposals to the Ministry of Rural Development for sanction, the Ministry has issued an advisory to the States on 2nd June, 2020. The State Governments have been advised, inter-alia, to communicate the final list of proposals in the order of priority to the Member of Parliament with the reasons for non-inclusion of certain roads in the proposals and obtain their consent on the proposals sent for approval.At monitoring stage, as per the guidelines, the Superintending Engineer concerned of the zone/region will request the Hon’ble MP and Zilla Pramukh representing that zone/region once in six months to select any PMGSY projects for joint inspection. The schedule of joint inspection will be fixed as per the convenience of MP/Zila Pramukh. The Executive Engineer in-charge of a division will request the Hon’ble Member of Legislative Assembly and Chairperson of the Intermediate Panchayat concerned once in three months for joint inspection of any PMGSY project as per their choice and according to their convenience. Similarly, the Assistant Engineer in-charge of sub-division will make similar request to Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat once in two months.The District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee (DISHA) headed by Hon’ble Member of Parliament (LS) monitors all  non-statutory schemes of Government of India, including rural development schemes.  *****
