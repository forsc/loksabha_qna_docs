ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	The Central Pollution Control Board assigned a study to Indian Institute of Toxicological Research (IITR), Lucknow to study “Impact of Plastic Waste Disposal on Soil and Water Quality at Lucknow Dumpsites”. The soil and water quality data revealed that the heavy metals, chloride, phthalates migrate from plastic waste into the surrounding medium. The leachate can cause considerable pollution problem by contaminating the surrounding soil, ground or surface water. As per Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, carry bags made of recycled plastic or products made of recycled plastic are prohibited to be used for storing, carrying, dispensing or packaging ready to eat ordrink food stuff. As per the Rules, the generators of waste have been mandated to take steps to minimize generation of plastic waste, not to litter the plastic waste, ensure segregated storage of waste at source and handover segregated waste to local bodies or agencies authorised by the local bodies.(b) to (e)     On the call of Hon''ble Prime Minister, a three-phase campaign “Swachhta Hi Sewa” (SHS) was launched from 11th Sep, 2019, which ended on Diwali i.e. 27th October 2019. This campaign inter-alia focused on awareness, advocacy, collection and safe disposal of littered plastic. Under the campaign,all stakeholdersi.e. general public, students, industry, governments and local bodies came together and collectedwasteplastic from houses, streets, public places like parks, beaches, markets, religious and tourist places etc. Urban Local Bodies, Gram Panchayats, Government organisations and others made arrangements to deposit the collected plastic waste at designated locations for recycling.Start-ups, technical bodies and corporates came forward with their plans to recycle the collected waste. Eventual goal of the campaign was that the waste is not dumped on land or into water but is recycled in environmentally sound manner. The campaign has achieved its near-term goal of creating awareness on clean environment and the menace of pollution.The Government has identified Compostable plastic as one of the alternative. The Rules define norms for compostable plastic. Further, to promote the use of such plastic, the provision of minimumthickness of fifty microns does not apply to carry bags made up of compostable  plastic, conforming IS/ISO 17088.*****
