ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	to (c) The Government of India, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change commissioned a scientific study titled “Climate Change and India: 4X4 Assessment - A Sectoral and Regional Analysis for 2030s”. The report provides an assessment of impacts of climate change in 2030 in four key sectors of Indian economy that also play important role in food supply, namely agriculture, water, forests and human health in four climate sensitive regions of India, viz. the Himalayan Region, the Western Ghats, the Coastal region and North Eastern Region. The study projects a variable rate of agricultural production including decrease in yield in some crops and change in the composition of the forests and net primary productivity.		The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has no information on pumping out of dangerous chemicals by certain crops due to rising temperatures. The vulnerability and likely impacts have been factored into the Government’s action on climate change.  The National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) under National Action Plan on Climate Change focuses on agriculture sector with the objectives including resource conservation, restoration of soil fertility and productivity focusing on integrated farming, water use efficiency and soil health management especially in rain-fed agriculture areas, and contributes to co-benefits of mitigation. Other schemes and programmes addressing climate change related issues include Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna (PMSKY), Soil Health Card, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojna (PKVY), Agricultural Contingency Plans and National Innovations on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA), and Sub-mission on Agro-forestry.                                                                *****
