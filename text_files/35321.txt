A debriefing session is organized after completion of the mock drill wherein all the participants belonging to all agencies are explained their role in mock drill in detail. The good work as well as shortcomings of various stakeholders are outlined so as to finetune the coordination among various agencies to improve collective response in case of any eventuality.Besides, the following steps are also being taken by the Railways in coordination with GRP/Civil Police for safety and security of passengers in trains and at stations:-1.
