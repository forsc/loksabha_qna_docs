                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (f):	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (f) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3920 BY SHRI SANJAY KAKA PATIL TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 17.07.2019 REGARDING SURVEY OF NEW RAIL LINE(a) to (c):      Pune-Miraj-Londa (467 km) doubling project was sanctioned in 2015-16 and construction works have been taken up in entire project length of Pune-Miraj-Londa wherever land is available. Work of acquisition of balance land has also been taken up.  The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions  of working agencies/contractors etc. and all these factors affect the completion cost of the project, which is finally worked out at the completion stage.Since complete encumbrance free land has still not been handed over by State Government to the Railways, therefore, no confirmed time frame can be fixed for completion of project at this stage.          At present, there is no proposal to introduce additional trains service on the Pune-Miraj-Londa section.  However, 11 pairs of trains (Mail/Express) are already serving the sector.  Besides, introduction of trains is an on-going process on Indian Railways subject to operational feasibility, traffic demand, availability of resources etc.(d):	Full capacity Pit line (26/24 coach capacity) is not available at Miraj.  Presently, pit line of 12 coach capacity is available at Miraj.(e) & (f):	There is no station named “Saanghi”,   Station “Sangli” is about 10 km from Miraj.  No pit lines are being constructed and there is no proposal to construct pit line at Sangli station.*****
