ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) to (c): 	As on 31.08.2020, there are 2084 Food Corporation of India (FCI) warehouses (owned & hired) and the storage capacity on that date including covered and Cover and Plinth (CAP) is approximately 817 LMT against total stocks of 700.27 LMT............2/--2-No damage to foodgrains is directly attributed to lack of adequate storage capacity. Foodgrains stocked with FCI are preserved scientifically. A negligible quantity become non-issuable due to various reasons mainly:i.	Due to natural calamities like cyclone/flood damages.ii.	Transit damages viz. enroute damage in wagon/truck due to contamination, wagon roof leakage etc.iii.	In some cases due to negligence of officials/officers, for which   suitable disciplinary action against defaulters are invariably taken.The quantum of damaged foodgrains in FCI during the last three years and current year is tabulated below:Year	Damage Accrual in FCI(in LMT)	% Damaged foodgrains against offtake quantity2017-18	0.027	0.0062018-19	0.05	0.012019-20	0.02	0.0042020-21(as on 31-07-20)	0.0151	0.0056 Government of India, in 2016, has also approved an action plan for construction of steel silos in the country for a capacity of 100 LMT in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode for modernizing storage infrastructure and improving shelf life of stored foodgrains.(d): 	Total Capacity available with FCI is as per requirement.  The utilization of storage capacity depends upon the level of procurement, movement of foodgrains etc. and may differ from time to time. In procuring regions, the capacity utilization is maximum when procurement operations are going on but, subsequently, the stock is moved to deficit regions.  This leads to liquidation of stock and the utilization of capacity also goes down hence, the capacity temporarily becomes surplus at micro level but overall, i.e., at macro level, the capacity with FCI is as per requirement.****
