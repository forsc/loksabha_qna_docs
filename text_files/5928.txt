                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): The Daltonganj airport belongs to the State Government of Jharkhand. No proposal has been received in Ministry of Civil Aviation from the State Government of Jharkhand for the development of Chiyanki Airstrip in Daltonganj. However, a technical study to assess feasibility for making Daltonganj Airport operational under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) was conducted by a multi-disciplinary team of Airports Authority of India (AAI) in April, 2017 and report was submitted to the State Government. Government of Jharkhand vide letter dated 10.08.2017 requested this Ministry to develop Bokaro Airport under RCS and AAI has signed MoUs with State Government of Jharkhand for development of Deoghar and Dhalbhumgarh Airports.;;(c) & (d):  Air operations in domestic sector have been deregulated and the airlines are free to operate anywhere in the country subject to Route Dispersal Guidelines (RDG) issued by the Government. It is upto the airline operator to provide air services to a specific place depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability. However, with the objective of facilitating / stimulating regional air connectivity especially to underserved and unserved airports in the country, the Government of India, Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik) in October, 2016. So far, no airlines have expressed interest in operating flights connecting North Eastern states with Jharkhand.
