Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL) works for the promotion of all Indian languages including regional languages and there are separate Institutions for development and promotion of Hindi, Urdu, Sindhi and Sanskrit languages.  -2-The Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology (CSTT) is providing publication grant towards the publication of University level books in regional languages.  The National Translation Mission implemented through the CIIL under which the books of knowledge texts mostly text books of various subjects prescribed in Universities and Colleges  are being   translated in all Languages of  the 8th Schedule of the Constitution of India.   University Grants Commission promotes regional languages in higher education course in the country and supports Universities under the scheme “Establishment of Centre for Endangered Languages in  Central Universities”.  ***
