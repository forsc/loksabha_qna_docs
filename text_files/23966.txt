(b)       The revised Model Concession Agreement duly approved by the Cabinet in January, 2018 provides for supplementary agreement to be executed between the concessionaire and the Ports to the effect that in case, the dispute between them is not resolved amicably, the same is to be settled by arbitration through SAROD- Ports.(c)        In view of the reply at (b) above, this question is not applicable.                                         ********
