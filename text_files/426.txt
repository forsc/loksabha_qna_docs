ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) Domestic sale of LPG by Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) during the last year i.e. 2018-19 was 21,725 TMT. State/UT-wise details are at Annexure.(b) to (d) OMCs have reported that they endeavour to meet the genuine demand of customers across the country and also endeavour to make supplies to each State/UT as per the Demand. However, sometimes delay in supplies may occur for reasons such as natural calamities, strikes, absenteeism, transport breakdowns, shortage of product, occupancy of jetty at ports etc. In such scenario, all efforts are made for meeting the Demand of LPG by augmenting bulk LPG supplies, arranging additional imports, positioning of bulk at the plants through alternate routes and operation of LPG bottling plants on sundays/holidays and during extended hours.
