ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) & (b) :	M/s Goa-Tamnar Transmission Project Limited (GTTPL) is an Inter State Transmission System (ISTS) licensee which is implementing the scheme “Additional 400 kV Feed to Goa and Additional System for Power Evacuation from Generation Projects pooled at Raigarh (Tamnar) Pool” awarded through Tariff Based Competitive Bidding. As per the information from M/s GTTPL, the area affected for the purpose of forest diversion by this project would be around 177 hectares.  However, the actual affected area which will be used for tree felling and execution of work will be only 23.098 hectares. This affected area will also be compensated with the provision of dwarf/medicinal plants below the conductor.  In addition, for requisite clearance under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, the project developer has to do Compensatory Afforestation in double the area, i.e. 354 hectares against the proposed diversion of 177 hectares of forest land. This plantation will be done and maintained for 10 years by the project developer.		The impact of transmission lines on the ecological and social system is minimal.  Therefore, in accordance with the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India’s EIA Notification 2006, transmission line projects are not required to undertake Environment Impact Assessment (EIA). However, necessary clearance under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 has to be obtained, when the transmission line passes through forest area. (c) & (d) :	M/s GTTPL had submitted 3 alternate routes for the above overhead lines along with application for grant of authorization under section 164 of Electricity Act, 2003. Authorization has been granted for the route involving minimum forest and protected areas.		As a mitigation measure, following have been taken into account:	(1)	Compensatory Afforestation (CA) as per the guidelines MoEFCC.  	(2)	Selection of route involving minimum forest and protected areas.	(3)	To reduce the impact further, the already existing defunct 110 kV line route has been considered for the alignment of above line. ************
