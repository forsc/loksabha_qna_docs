ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) & (b): The main objective of the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) is to provide good quality modern education - including a strong component of inculcation of values, awareness of the environment, adventure activities and physical education – to the talented children predominantly from the rural areas without regard to their family’s socio-economic condition.The major steps that have been undertaken to improve the functioning of the JNVs and to ensure transparency inter alia include the following:• Online Admission process in JNVs : All the functions in the admission process like issuance of Admit card for Selection Test and communication of results have been made online, leading to better access and simpler processes for the rural population;• Cluster System : Cluster system has been implemented at Regional level whereby the Cluster-in-charge, an Assistant Commissioner closely monitors the performance of 15-20 JNVs allotted to him and reports about their performance as well as areas requiring further improvements;• Panel Inspection : Panel inspection of the JNVs are also conducted annually by a team of officials at the Regional Office level. The team conducts micro level inspection of all the activities of a JNV and submits its report in a prescribed proforma;• Online Transfer and Postings of the staff: The process of transfer and posting of the teaching/non-teaching staff has been made online resulting in increased transparency and timely completion of the process;• Online recruitment of the staff: The recruitment process has been made online and faceless till appointment. The appointment letters are also downloaded by the candidates using their login and password. This has resulted in filling of large no. of posts without any controversy;• Implementation of Public Finance Management System (PFMS): Consequent upon the implementation of PFMS, almost all financial transactions are now in the digital mode facilitating monitoring of fund flow and status of utilization of funds;• For improving psychosocial health and well-being of the students, Counsellors have been engaged and tele-counselling is also provided.Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBVs) are residential schools from class VI to XII for girls belonging to disadvantaged groups such as SC, ST, OBC, Minority and Below Poverty Line (BPL). Under Samagra Shiksha, there is a provision of upgradation/convergence of KGBVs upto Senior Secondary level.The Government provides funds to States/UTs for operationalization of KGBVs. Administrative matters and operationalization of KGBVs come under the purview of concerned State Governments.However, in the framework of Samagra Shiksha, strategy for construction of hostels/schools and procedure for implementation of KGBVs have been specified for smooth functioning across the country. Further, minimum requirements for KGBVs such as Drinking Water & sanitation, Bedding, Food and Lodging, Medical Care/Contingencies etc. have also been mentioned in the draft framework which needs to be followed by States/UTs. In addition, it has been advised that States and UTs ensure convergence of KGBV/Girls Hostel with line departments and also ensure that funds allocated are appropriately utilized and there is no duplication of activities.To ensure transparency in KGBVs, a continuing evaluation has to be done by the State Government agencies through regular and well structured system of field visits.*****
