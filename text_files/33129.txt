                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) & (b)       Yes, Sir. The Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing Centrally Sponsored Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) w.e.f. 01.01.2017. The Year-wise and State/UT-wise, details of beneficiaries enrolled, beneficiaries paid and the total amount of maternity benefits disbursed during the last three years is at Annexure-I. (c)       The funds are released to the States/UTs on the basis of indicative targets and utilisation of released funds. The Year-wise and State/UT-wise details of Central share of funds released to States/UTs under PMMVY during the last three years is at Annexure-II. (d)       The state wise details of beneficiaries are at Annexure-I. (e)       The scheme Implementation Guidelines provide for setting up of Steering and Monitoring Committees at National, State and District levels. These Committees review the progress of implementation of the scheme periodically to strengthen the coordination and convergence between concerned departments and suggest modifications required for improving the implementation. Further, PMMVY is implemented through web-based Management and Information System (MIS) Software, viz. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana-Common Application Software (PMMVY-CAS) which is used as an effective tool for regular monitoring of the scheme. The PMMVY-CAS is enabled to monitor key indicators like number of beneficiaries enrolled, number of beneficiaries paid maternity benefits, total maternity benefits disbursed to eligible beneficiaries etc. on near-real time basis. The PMMVY is a component under Mission Shakti launched recently to provide integrated benefits  of safety, security and empowerment to women.  ****** Annexure-IStatement referred to in reply to part (a) & (b) and (d) of the Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 508 for answer on 04.02.2022 raised by Shrimati Sangeeta Kumari Singh Deo, Shri Raja Amareshwara Naik and Dr. Jayanta Kumar Roy regarding ‘Achievements under Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana’Year-wise and State/UT-wise details of number of beneficiaries enrolled, beneficiaries paid and total amount of maternity benefits disbursed under the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) during the last three yearsSl.
