However, the “Adopt a Heritage: Apni Dharohar, Apni Pehchaan’’  project,  a collaborative effort by the Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Culture and Archaeological Survey of India, State/ UTs Government for developing tourism amenities at heritage/ natural/ tourist sites across India aims to encourage companies from public sector, private sector, corporate citizens, NGOs, individuals and other stakeholders to take up the responsibility of developing and upgrading the basic and advanced tourist amenities at heritage/natural/ tourist sites. They would also look after the Operation & Maintenance of the same. Under the project, 26 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) have been awarded to 12 agencies for twenty-four (24) sites and two (2) Technological interventions across India. Further, in order to allow participation of the private sector in the  “Hunar Se Rozgar Tak” (HSRT) initiative of the Ministry of Tourism for creation of employable skills amongst the youth above the age of 18 years, on a scale higher than hitherto and to enhance the programme reach and delivery, the private sector Institutes also have been allowed to implement the programmes in four Hospitality Trades viz Multi Cuisine Cook, Food Beverage Service-steward, Room Attendant and Front Office Associate.
