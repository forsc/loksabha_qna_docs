                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF JAL SHAKTI(SHRI RATTAN  LAL  KATARIA)(a)  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) [SBM (G)] was launched with effect from 2nd October, 2014, with the goal to attain Open Defecation Free (ODF) India by 2nd October, 2019 by providing access to toilets to all the rural households in the country.  All the villages in the country have declared themselves ODF as on 02.10.2019. Having achieved the outcomes of ODF, Government has approved Phase-II of SBM(G) with the focus on sustainability of ODF status and to cover the villages with Solid and Liquid Waste Management.  Phase-II of SBM (G) is to be implemented during 2020-21 to 2024-25.(b)   Details of Centre share funds released under SBM (G) to Assam and Rajasthan and the utilisation reported by the States, since 2017-18 are as under:(Rs. in crore)State	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21	Release	Utilized	Release	Utilized	Release	Utilized	Release	UtilizedAssam	1171.95	1178.73	882.09	798.64	545.97	672.51	276.81	674.09Rajasthan	981.51	1051.83	865.88	691.77	390.00	551.55	229.26	688.83Funds utilized in some years are more than the funds released.  This is on account of unspent funds available with the States as on 01.4.2017 and the interest earned by the States during the respective years. (c) & (d) SBM (G) is a demand driven scheme, hence no pre-fix targets for individual household latrines (IHHLs) are set.   However, district-wise number of IHHLs constructed under SBM (G) in Assam and Rajasthan (including Ganganagar and Dausa districts) since 2017-18, as reported by the States on the online Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) of SBM (G), are given at Annexure-1 & Annexure-2 respectively.(e) & (f)  SBM (G) was launched with effect from 2nd October, 2014, with the goal to attain Open Defecation Free (ODF) India by 2nd October, 2019 by providing access to toilets to all the rural households. More than 10 crore IHHLs were constructed under the programme during the five years period. As a result, all the villages in the country have declared themselves ODF as on 02.10.2019.  The Government further approved Phase-II of SBM (G) with the focus on sustainability of ODF status and to cover all the villages with Solid and Liquid Waste Management by 2024-25.   All the States/UTs have been advised to ensure that no one is left behind in having access to toilets including newly emerging households.  Under SBM (G), Central share funds amounting to Rs.4,284.46 crore have been released to Assam from 2014-15 to 2020-21.*****
