ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (e):   Yes, sir. Before the revocation of Article 370 and 35A, ‘The Jammu and Kashmir Reservation Act, 2004’ was in force to provide reservation in jobs to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Socially and Educationally Backward Classes in the erstwhile state of Jammu & Kashmir. After revocation of Article 370, ‘The Jammu and Kashmir Reservation Act, 2004’ is applicable to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir and Union Territory of Laddakh with certain amendments, as mentioned in ‘The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019’. The number of people from the communities belonging to the reserved category to be benefited will be in proportion to the percentage of reservation for the respective categories.*****
