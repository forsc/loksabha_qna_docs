                                                        MINISTER OF LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI BHUPENDER YADAV)(a) to (e):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.*                                                    ******STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 307 TO BE ANSWERED ON 20.12.2021 BY SHRI LAVU SRI KRISHNA DEVARAYALU, HON’BLE M.P. REGARDING GIG AND PLATFORM WORKERS.(a):		For the first time, the definition of ‘gig worker’ or ‘platform worker’ has been provided in the Code on Social Security, 2020 (the Code). As per section 2 (35) of the said Code, a ‘gig worker’ means a person who performs work or participates in a work arrangement and earns from such activities outside of traditional employer-employee relationship. As per section 2(61) of the Code, ‘platform worker’ means a person engaged in or undertaking platform work. The Code on Social Security, 2020 does not define ‘gig economy’. (b) to (e):	The Code on Social Security, 2020 provides for social security including life and disability, accident insurance, health and maternity benefits, old age protection, crèche and  any other benefits as may be determined by the Central Government  through formulation of schemes for gig and platform workers. A Social Security Fund has also been provided for under the Code and one of the sources of fund, is contribution from aggregator between 1 to 2% of annual turnover of an aggregator subject to the limit of 5% of the amount paid or payable by an aggregator to such workers.  However, no scheme has been finalized as the provisions under the Code relating to gig and platform worker have not come into force.  *******
