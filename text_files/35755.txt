                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) to (f): The Department of Rural Development, Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) is implementing a number of welfare schemes for rural areas of the country  viz. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS), Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), Deen Dayal Upadhayay – Gramin Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs), National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) and Shyama Prasad  Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM) to alleviate poverty in rural areas and to bring about overall improvement in the quality of life of the people in rural areas.  Further, Department of Land Resources (DoLR), MoRD is implementing Watershed Development Component (WDC) of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) which is principally for development of rainfed portions of net cultivated area and culturable wastelands.   These schemes are implemented through State Governments and in consultation with the stakeholders including public representatives of the States within the framework of schematic guidelines. MoRD accords emphasis on proper implementation of all its rural development schemes. In order to ensure that the programme benefits reach the rural poor, the Ministry has evolved a comprehensive multi-level and multi-format system of monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of rural development programmes, including Performance Review Committee Meetings, District Development Co-ordination and Monitoring Committee (“DISHA”) meetings.  DISHA Committees are headed by Hon''ble MPs and include public representatives including those of the urban and rural local bodies. The scope of the DISHA Committee extends to 47 central or centrally sponsored schemes currently including all the above mentioned rural development schemes. It may be mentioned that the Ministry receives inputs on programmes from various Parliamentary Committees including Parliamentary Standing Committee and Estimates Committee. Further, the Ministry has constituted Consultative Committee of the Ministry, which also provides additional inputs on various programmes and themes relevant to rural development.PMGSY Guidelines now  specifically allow for consultation with the MPs for selection of the Schemes including their consent before the Ministry considers the proposal under PMGSY-III. Further, it requires foundation laying and inauguration events to be presided over by the local MP (LS) in presence of other local representatives. The local represnetatives are also invited to joint inspection by PIUs/SEs of the works periodically and be informed of the visits of SQM/NQM.  Under PMGSY, a total of 8 complaints have been received from Hon’ble Members of Parliament during the last three years and current year complaining about non-invitation in foundation laying and inauguration ceremonies of projects.  The complaints were examined and in consultation with the concerned States/UTs and the Hon’ble Members of Parliament were appraised of the factual reports submitted by the State Government on the complaints.  Necessary advisory has been issued by the Ministry in this regard and the States/UTs have been time and again advised to strictly comply with the provisions of the advisory. Further, under SPMRM, one complaint has been received from Hon’ble Member of Legislative Assembly of Rajasthan regarding changes in works by district officials and poor quality of work in cluster Raniwara Kalan, District Jalore which has been examined for resolution in consultation with the State Government. All complaints from public represnetatives are treated as VIP refrences and are accorded due priority in their disposal in consultation with the State/UT Governments DoRD allows for registering complaint through various forums viz., Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS), written complaints etc. The complaints received in the Department are forwarded to the concerned State Governments /Union Territory for taking appropriate action including investigation. Whenever specific complaints of irregularities are received, State Governments are requested to have it inquired and take necessary action. In serious cases of irregularities, central teams of its officials or National Level Monitors are sent for on-ground inquiry and based on their findings, State Governments are instructed for taking action on those responsible for the same.    *******
