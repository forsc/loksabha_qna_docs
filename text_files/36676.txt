                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) to (c) Water resources projects are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priorities. Role of Government of India is limited to being catalytic, providing technical support and, in some cases partial financial assistance in terms with the existing schemes being implemented by the Ministry of Jal Shakti.  Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) was launched during the year 2015-16, with an aim to enhance physical access of water on farm and expand cultivable area under assured irrigation, improve on-farm water use efficiency, introduce sustainable water conservation practices, etc. It is an umbrella scheme, consisting of two major components being implemented by the Department of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, namely, Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP), and Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP). HKKP, in turn, consists of four sub-components: Command Area Development & Water Management (CAD&WM), Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI), Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies, and Ground Water (GW) Development component.  In addition, PMKSY also consists of two components being implemented by other Ministries. Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) component is being implemented by Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, while Watershed Development component (WDC) of PMKSY is being implemented by Department of Land Resources. Government of India has approved continuation of PMKSY during 2021-22 to 2025-26, with extension of Ground Water component under PMKSY-HKKP being only for 2021-22, while approval of extension of PDMC has been processed separately by Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. The extension of PMKSY for 2021-22 to 2025-26 has been approved with an overall outlay of Rs. 93,068.56 crore (central assistance of Rs. 37,454 crore, debt servicing to NABARD for Rs. 20,434.56 crore and state share to be borne by the State Governments being Rs. 35,180 crore). Component-wise details for the central assistance are given below: Component	Total (Rs. in crore)AIBP and CAD&WM	23,918HKKP (SMI & RRR)	4,580HKKP (GW)	822WD	8,134Grand Total	37,454 However, State-wise details are not incorporated in the approval.  Apart from PMKSY, a special package has been taken up for financial assistance by Government of India in July, 2018 for completion of 83 surface minor irrigation (SMI) projects and 8 major / medium irrigation projects in drought prone districts in Vidarbha and Marathwada and rest of Maharashtra in phases, up to 2023-24. In addition, Government of India is also providing financial assistance to Shahpur Kandi (National) Project and relining of Rajasthan Feeder and Sirhind Feeder in Punjab State. Also, Polavaram Irrigation Project of Andhra Pradesh declared as National Project under Andhra Pradesh Re-organisation Act in March, 2014 and North Koel project of Jharkhand & Bihar, are also being provided financial assistance by the Government of India. (d) The State-wise details of central assistance released during last three years under each of the above mentioned schemes, are annexed herewith. *** ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN THE REPLY TO PART (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3487 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 24.03.2022 REGARDING “NEW IRRIGATION SCHEMES”Details of total funds allocated and expenditure incurred for each scheme, during the last three years, State and year-wiseA.
