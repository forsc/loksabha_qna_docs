                        be pleased to state:-















(a)  	whether the Government has formed any opinion regarding the inclusion of marital rape as an offence under the Indian Penal Code and if so, the details thereof;  (b)  	whether the Government acknowledges the prevalence of rape/ sexual harassment in marital life or conducted any study/ research in this regard; and  (c)  	if so, the details and the outcome thereof along with the remedial steps taken in this regard?






ANSWER




(a) to (c): The matter of marital rape is sub-judice before the High Court of Delhi in Review Petition in W.P. (Civil) No. 284/ 2015 filed by RIT Foundation against the Union of India. Further, the Department related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs, in its 146th Report had recommended that there is a need for a comprehensive review of the Criminal Justice System of the country. Earlier, the Parliamentary Standing Committee in its 111th and 128th reports had also stressed upon the need to reform and rationalize the criminal law of the country by introducing a comprehensive legislation in Parliament rather than bringing about piece-meal amendments in respective Acts. Accordingly, based on the feedback received from stakeholders, appropriate decision would be taken by the Government at appropriate time. *****
