While planning for potable water supply to households, priority is to be given to quality–affected habitations. In 2020-21, details of Central fund allocation to West Bengal, amount drawn by the State and reported utilisation, is as under:											(Rs. in crore)Central share	Expenditure under matching State ShareOpening Balance	Allocation	Amount drawn by the State	Total available fund with the State	Fund Utilised	1,146.58	1,610.76	778.52	1,925.09	1,049.79	583.94Further, in March 2017, to provide safe drinking water in 27,544 Arsenic/ Fluoride affected habitations in the country, including 9,112 habitations of West Bengal, National Water Quality Sub-Mission (NWQSM) was launched, which has now been subsumed under Jal Jeevan Mission. Under NWQSM, since March 2017, so far Rs. 1,305.70 crore has been released to Government of West Bengal out of which, Rs. 973.96 crore have been reported to be utilized by the State. State Government has reported that out of 9,112 habitations identified under NWSQM, in 5,993 habitations, provision of potable water supply has been made, in 326 habitations work is going on, in 2,792 habitations ground water quality has improved. In 61 habitations, work on making provision of potable piped water supply is yet to be taken.    Under Jal Jeevan Mission, State Government has prepared Annual Action Plan for 2020-21,inter alia, which includes provision for potable water supply in quality-affected habitations. At the time of announcement of the mission, as reported by the State, out of 163.26 lakh rural households, only 2.15 lakh households (1.32 %) had tap water supply against the national average of 17%. Since then, as on 02.2.2021, in West Bengal, 7.49 lakh households have been provided with tap water connections, thus tap water supply increased to 9.63 lakh households (5.90 %) against the national coverage of 34.30%. Keeping in view the goal to provide potable piped water supply to every home by 2024, State Government need to expedite the implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission as 94.10 % rural households are yet to be provided with tap water connections. Ministry does regular follow-up and hold review meetings with the State Government as well as field visit are taken up to expedite the implementation.****
