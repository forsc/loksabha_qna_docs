A cumulative grid connected capacity of 33,730.53 MW has been installed in the country as on 31.12.2019. In addition, solar  projects of capacity 22940 MW are under various stages implementation and 29470 MW under tendering.

(3) In order to strengthen the contractual provisions in the Contract (Power Purchase Agreements) between the solar power generators and the Procurers, and to facilitate setting up of Renewable Energy power projects, the Government, vide notification dated 22.10.2019 from Ministry of New & Renewable Energy, has made following major amendments to the ‘Guidelines for Tariff Based Competitive Bidding Process for Procurement of Power from Grid Connected Solar PV Power Projects’: (i)  Solar Power Generators have been allowed to submit documents/lease agreement to establish possession/right to use 100% (hundred per cent) of the required land in the name of the Solar Power Generator for a period not less than the complete term of the PPA, on or before the Scheduled Commissioning Date (SCD). (ii)  Clear and elaborate provisions for time extension and compensation to affected party in the event of natural and non-natural Force Majeure events with specific provisions regarding termination due to natural and non-natural Force Majeure events have been included. (iii)  Quantum of compensation for back-down has been increased from 50% to 100% with provision for recognition of only written instructions for back-down. (iv) Corresponding time extension in date for achievement of financial closure and scheduled commissioning date, in case there is a delay in adoption of tariff by the concerned State Electricity Regulatory Commission beyond a period of 60 days from the filing of such application.*****
