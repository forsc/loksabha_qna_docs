ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (c):   Health is a state subject. The Department of Health & Family Welfare, however, provides technical and financial support to the States/UTs under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), as part of National Health Mission (NHM), based on the proposals received from the States/UTs and subject to the resource envelope. Cancer is an integral part of NPCDCS. The State/UT wise details of funds provided in NPCDCS Program under Flexible Pool for Non-Communicable Diseases programme (NCD) under NHM during the last three years i.e. from the FY 20l8-19 to 2020-21 is given at Annexure 1.Patients with non-communicable diseases including cancer are getting treatment at various health facilities in the health care delivery system including Districts Hospitals, Medical Colleges, Central Institutes like AIIMS and private sector hospitals. The treatment in Government Hospitals is either free or highly subsidized for the poor and needy.Under NPCDCS, 677 NCD clinics at District level and 5392 NCD clinics at Community Health Centre level has been set up to ensure the treatment of common NCDs.The Central Government is also implementing Strengthening of Tertiary Care of Cancer Scheme in order to enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer. 19 State Cancer Institutes (SCIs) and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres (TCCCs) have been approved so far under the said scheme (Annexure 2). There is also focus on Oncology in its various aspects in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojna (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar (Haryana) and second campus of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata are also steps in this direction. All these enhance the capacity for treatment of cancer in the country. Under Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), health insurance cover of Rs. 5 lakhs per family per year for secondary or tertiary care hospitalization to over 10.74 cr. beneficiary families identified from Socio Economic, and Caste Census 2011 (SECC 2011) database is provided. AB-PMJAY provides treatment corresponding to a total of 1,669 procedures under 26 different specialties for NCDs. The treatment packages under AB-PMJAY are very comprehensive covering various treatment related aspects such as drugs and diagnostic services.
