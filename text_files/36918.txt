ANSWER




                                                        (a)	  Under Skill India Mission, more than 20 Central Ministries/Departments are implementing Skill Development Schemes/Programmes to enhance skill levels of millions of people on pan India basis through which more than 570 lakh persons have been trained since 2015. Under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) has been delivering skills through various schemes viz. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), Jan Sikhshan Sansthan (JSS), National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) and Craftsman Training Scheme (CTS) through Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), to youths across the country including Bihar.The details of number of youth trained under various schemes of MSDE state-wise are placed at Annexure I, II, III and IV respectively.Apart from MSDE, youth also getting skill training through 3 major skilling schemes of the other Ministries, viz. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojna (DDU-GKY) and Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETI) implemented by Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) and Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojna- National Urban Livelihood Mission (DAY-NULM) by Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). The details of number of youth trained under these schemesstate-wise are placed at Annexure V, VI & VII respectively.(b)	Government has taken various steps for generating employment in the country. Under PMKVY 2.0 scheme of MSDE, training Centres take all efforts to facilitate placements of certified candidates through multiple initiatives like Rojgar Mela, Yuva Sampark and Aatmanirbhar Skilled Employees Employer Mapping (ASEEM) portal, collaboration with industries and Council. Under present phase of the PMKVY i.e PMKVY 3.0, demand driven and bottom-up approach has been provisioned to boost demand for job roles which are prevailing at regional/local level. In addition, informed choices/aspirations of the candidates have been given primacy which aims to support the self-employment as well. This scheme also supports the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat by encouraging candidates to opt for local skill with local jobs. That the government has been successful to a large extent in achieving its aim in this regard, would be self-evident from findings in the third party evaluation reports as mentioned below. (c)	Yes Sir. All schemes presently being run by this Ministry have gone through third party evaluation exercise generally and also in particular, at the time of grant of extension of the respective schemes.  (d)	PMKVY: PMKVY 2.0 was evaluated by NITI Aayog in October 2020 under jobs and skills sector. The impact evaluation study draws inference of the scheme levelcontribution to the larger jobs and skills sector along with clear reflection of following strength and outcome achieved during implementation: •	The training provided under the scheme is relevant to the employers and they prefer candidates trained under PMKVY compared to untrained candidates.•	52 percent of the candidates who were placed in full time/part time employment and had completed training under the RPL component received higher salary or felt that they will get higher salary compared to their peers who have no certification.•	About 94 percent of the employers surveyed reported they would hire more candidates trained under the scheme.•	About 67 percent and 18 per cent of the employers surveyed reported that the overall experience with respect to the recruitment process was good and very good, respectively. Further, third-party impact evaluation of the scheme PMKVY 2.0 (2016-20) was conducted by the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA). The impact evaluation study draws following inference: •	The maximum percentage of beneficiaries (70.5%) received placement in their desired skill sector.•	To ensure that high standards of quality are maintained by PMKVY Training Centres, NSDC and empanelled inspection agencies use various yardsticks. These involve validations, surprise visits, and monitoring through the Skill India Portal (SIP) (erstwhile Skills Development Management System (SDMS)). These standards are intensified using the latest technologies.•	As an impact of the scheme, 118.2% change in monthly wages of beneficiary trainees has been recognized. Average monthly remuneration/wages of surveyed beneficiaries increases from Rs. 8,422.64 to Rs. 17,871.26 post completion of training under PMKVY 2016-20.JSS: 	Third-party impact evaluation of the scheme JSS was conducted by the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA)& it was completed by July, 2020. As per the report, women representation is 79%; rural share is 50.5%; 73.4% change in theemployment for enhanced livelihood; 89.1% change in the average income of each beneficiary; 85.7% mobilization of beneficiaries by JSS.ITI:	The final report of Tracer Study of ITI Graduates (published in January 2018 by the MSDE, GoI) mentions that 63.5% of total ITI pass-outs got employed (wage+ self, out of which 6.7% are self-employed) and 36.4% remained unemployed and was looking for jobs. Even though the first figure was low for females (55.3%) as compared to that for males (65.1%), the corresponding figures for SCs (65%)and STs (69.8%) were higher than the percentage of total pass-outs in (wage+ self)employed.NAPS:Third-party impact evaluation of the scheme NAPS was conducted by the National Productivity Council (NPC). As per the report, NAPS has been able to catalyze interest of both industry and youths towards apprenticeshiptraining and coupled with strong Govt. Support and policy advocacy, the scheme has startedto pick up the pace.There is a positive vibe across establishments and huge demand forapprenticeship. The two main stakeholders i.e., apprentice and the industry seebenefits from the programme. The apprentice has found it to be useful toincrease his/her chances of getting employment.
