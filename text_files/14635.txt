ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) & (b):   Yes, Sir. Indian Handloom artisans are engaged in production of high quality products of global acclaim like Banarasi Brocade, Pashmina Shawl, Odisha Ikat, Gujarat Patola, Bengal Jamdani, Bhagalpuri Tussar, Home furnishing of Kannur, Panipat, Karur & Chinnamalai, etc. Handloom is primarily a household activity undertaken by the weavers as individuals enterprise, under Master Weavers and as members of the Primary/Apex Cooperative societies and Handloom organizations. The main fibres used by weavers in the sector are cotton, silk, wool, linen, jute and acrylic. A lot of Handloom items are produced by the sector for the in-house consumption of weavers and their families. Due to the unorganized and traditional nature of the sector, the data pertaining to Handloom production is dispersed and largely unavailable for centralized quantification. (c):	In order to provide design support to the Handloom weavers, financial assistance is provided in the Block Level Clusters sanctioned under National Handloom Development Programme (NHDP) and Comprehensive Handloom Cluster Development Scheme (CHCDS) for engagement of designers qualified from reputed institutions including National Institute of Design (NID)/National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT). Financial assistance is also provided to handloom weavers for purchase of Hathkargha Samvardhan Sahayata (HSS) items i.e. Looms, Jacquard, Dobby etc. to upgrade their technology, improve quality of the fabric and enhance productivity.(d) & (e):    No such proposal is under consideration in the Ministry of Textiles.****
