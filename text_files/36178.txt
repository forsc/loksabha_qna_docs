ANSWER




(a): The National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) was approved on 18th May, 2006 to implement              e-Governance projects in the country. Subsequent to increase in devolution from 32% to 42% pursuant to the recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission, NeGP has been delinked from Union support since FY 2015-16. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India has launched Digital India Programme on July 1, 2015 with the vision to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge-based economy by ensuring digital access, digital inclusion, digital empowerment and bridging the digital divide. National e-Governance Plan has led to establishment of necessary digital infrastructure namely State Data Centre (SDC for application development hosting), State-wide Area Network (SWAN for connectivity), State Portal, State Service Delivery Gateway (for integrated services in a State), and Common Services Centres (CSCs for services near locality) across the country. 34 State-Wide Area Network (SWAN) and 30 State Data Centre (SDC) have been made operational.                     State e-Governance Service Delivery Gateway (SSDG) has been successfully implemented across the States/UTs. For making public services available to citizens on anytime, anywhere basis, MeitY has established 4.63 lakh CSCs (including urban & rural areas) across the country for enabling the people to access e-Governance services. Over 400 digital services are being offered by these CSCs. Under Capacity building scheme, more than 12,900 government officials from Centre, State/UTs have been trained (policy, programme and project level) in Digital India/ e-Governance programmes. The rollout of Mission Mode Projects(MMPs) and e-Governance initiatives under NeGP have led to delivery of 4020+ services as on February, 2022. The Passport, Income Tax, Road Transport, MCA21, Agriculture, e-Courts, Land Records, PDS, etc showcased the transformational capability of ICT and improved the service delivery significantly. E-District Mission Mode Project and Common Services Centres have resulted in the bouquet of basic services becoming available to common citizens in their locality in rural areas and in villages. (b) and (c):Tamil Nadu State Government has not sought any assistance from the Union Government for management and functioning of State Data Centres during the last five years.(d):The Objective of State Service Delivery Gateway (SSDG) project has been to fulfill the vision of NeGP by providing easy and convenient e-Services to the citizens through Common Service Centres (CSC) and not for exchange of data. The project has been successfully completed in March 2017.(e):Mobile e-governance Service Delivery Gateway(MSDG) is an integrated platform aimed at mobile governance by enabling all Government Departments to offer citizen centric services through mobile based delivery channels such as SMS, IVRS, mobile applications, etc. The year-wise or State-wise details (wherever possible) for the various services are given at annexure. ******** AnnexureMobile e-governance Service Delivery Gateway (MSDG):Yearly SMS sent:S.
