ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (c): The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country. All the districts (as on 31st May, 2014) of the States/UTs, which have accepted the scheme, have been covered. As on date, 661 JNVs have been sanctioned, out of which 649 are functional. Opening of new Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) is a continuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government/UT administration to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of the permanent building and making available required temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV depends on the availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority.02 JNVs have been set up at Mungeshpur (North West District) and Jaffarpur Kalan (South West District) in Delhi. 07 more JNVs had been sanctioned in November, 2016 for the districts of East Delhi, North East Delhi, West Delhi, North Delhi, South Delhi, South East Delhi and Shahdara. Schools will commence after Government of NCT of Delhi makes available the requisite extent of land and temporary accommodation for these Vidyalayas.*****
