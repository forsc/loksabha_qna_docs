                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY  (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (e): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2426 BY SHRI MANICKAM TAGORE B. TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 16.03.2022 REGARDING CURBING HUMAN TRAFFICKING(a) to (e): ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and, as such, State Governments are responsible for prevention, detection, registration and investigation of crime and maintaining law and order etc. on Railways through their law enforcement agencies viz. Government Railway Police (GRP)/District Police. Railway Protection Force (RPF) supplements the efforts of GRP/District Police to provide better protection and security of passenger area and passengers and for matters connected therewith. RPF is not empowered to investigate cases of Human Trafficking and whenever any case of suspected human trafficking is detected by RPF, the same is reported to GRP/District Police. The persons rescued and apprehended are handed over to concerned Police for further necessary action as per law. Close co-ordination with Anti Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs) of State police is maintained for information sharing and planning joint action against human trafficking.  However, in order to leverage the Pan-India reach, visible presence in railway stations and trains and effective response mechanism of RPF to supplement the efforts of State police, operation AAHT has been launched by RPF to take effective action in cases of Human Trafficking through railways. A detailed Security Circular No.03/2022 dated 02.02.2022 in this regard has been issued.Cyber cells of RPF are used for assisting during investigation/enquiry done by inquiry officers of  RPF i.e. under the provisions of The Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act and The Railways Act within its domain. However, in order to supplement the efforts of State police, cyber cells have been instructed for cyber patrolling of the web/social media to look for digital footprints/traces of human trafficking in the internet and to cull out the clues helpful in taking action against Human Trafficking through railways. Also, field formations of RPF have been sensitized to act proactively involving all the stakeholders to prevent any type of Human Trafficking through railways particularly from the vulnerable districts of the country bordering Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar. *****
