                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	The Government has taken following measures to reduce Human Elephant Conflicts (HEC) in the country:(i)	Financial and technical assistance is provided to elephant range states under the Centrally Sponsored scheme ‘Project Elephant’, to protect elephants, their habitat and corridors, to address issues of man-elephant conflict and the welfare of captive elephants.  The Scheme has also a component for ex-gratia relief in case of human death/injury and property/crop loss.  (ii)	Notification of critical elephant habitats as “Elephant Reserves” for better management of wild elephants.  (iii)	All the elephant States have been directed to implement Guidelines for Management of Human Elephant Conflict issued by the Ministry on 6.10.2017.(iv)	Various other Centrally Sponsored schemes being implemented by this Ministry contribute to the improvement in the natural habitat of elephants by augmenting water sources, planting of fodder trees, regeneration of bamboo etc.  Such schemes include Development of Wildlife Habitat and Project Tiger.  The Compensatory Afforestation Fund Act 2016 and the Rules made there under also provide for use of the Fund for development of wildlife habitats, including for elephants, establishment of animal rescue centres, etc. which also contribute to reduction in HEC. (v)	Wildlife Institute of India in consultation with the Ministry of Environment Forest & Climate Change, National Highway Authority, National Tiger Conservation Authority and World Bank Group has published a document namely ‘ Eco-friendly Measures to Mitigate Impacts of Linear Infrastructure’ to assist project agencies in designing linear infrastructure in a manner that reduces human-animal conflicts. (b) No elephant corridor has so far been identified by the State of Jharkhand, however the Elephant Task Force Report, 2010 titled ‘Gajah’ has identified 27 priority I and 61 priority II, regional landscape based elephant corridors in the country.  (c)&(d)	Welfare of captive elephant is one of the major objectives of the Centrally Sponsored scheme ‘Project Elephant’ wherein financial and technical assistance is provided to the States.  The Ministry vide letter dated 8.1.2008 has issued guidelines to all States on ‘Care and Management of Captive Elephants’. The Ministry has also constituted Captive Elephant Healthcare and Welfare Committee (CEHWC) on 22.08.2019 to look into the issues related to healthcare, welfare and management of captive elephants in the country. Further establishment, operation and maintenance of animal rescue centre and veterinary treatment facilities for wild animals are permissible activities under the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Rules, 2018.   ***
