ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE)  FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS & SPORTS  { SHRI KIREN RIJIJU }  (a) The “Khelo India – National Programme for Development of Sports” Scheme or the Khelo India Scheme, which is being implemented across the country, aims to infuse sports culture, achieve sporting excellence in the country and also to encourage sports all over the country.  The Khelo India Scheme in its present form was launched on 14th October, 2017. It would be a continuing scheme and the Government is making adequate funds available for the scheme.  (b) State/Union Territory-wise fund allocation is not made under the Khelo India Scheme. Year-wise budget allocation for the Khelo India Scheme is given below: <pre> Financial Year Budget Allocation (in Rs. crore) 2017-18 350.00 2018-19 500.09 2019-20 578.00 </pre> (c) and (d) The details of sports infrastructure projects sanctioned under the Khelo India Scheme along with the funds sanctioned/released thereunder and status of their progress and completeness is given at Annexure - I.  (e) So far 2880 athletes have been selected/identified for training under the Khelo India Scheme as detailed in Annexure - II. Further, 11897 athletes are being trained through the Sports Authority of India (SAI) under the said scheme as detailed in Annexure – III.  (f) ‘Sports’ being a State subject, the responsibility for providing sports infrastructure, including creation of world-class sports infrastructure, rests with the State/Union Territory Governments. Central Government supplements the efforts of State-Union Territory Governments. No such proposal is under consideration in this Ministry. ****
