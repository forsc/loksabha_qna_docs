                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (SMT. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) A study ‘The burden of neurological disorders across the states of India: The Global Burden of Disease Study 1990-2019” was published in Lancet 2021 by ICMR. As per the study, the number of deaths due to stroke was 6.99 lakhs in the country in 2019. (b) to (d) Patients with non-communicable diseases are getting treatment at various health facilities in the health care delivery system including Districts Hospitals, Medical Colleges, Central Institutes like AIIMS and private sector hospitals. Relevant data related to patients registered for treatment, including surgeries, is maintained by the Institutions and Hospitals concerned at their own level. Data of deaths is maintained by the Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India (ORGI). Health is a state subject. The Department of Health & Family Welfare, however, provides technical and financial support to the States/UTs under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), as part of National Health Mission (NHM), based on the proposals received in Program Implementation Plans (PIPs) from the States/UTs and subject to the resource envelope. The programme focusses on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, health promotion & awareness generation for prevention, early diagnosis, management and referral to an appropriate level of healthcare facility for treatment of the given Non-Communicable Diseases. A population-based initiative for prevention, control and screening for common Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) i.e. Diabetes, Hypertension and common Cancers viz. Oral, Breast and Cervical Cancers, has been rolled out in the country under NHM and also as a part of Comprehensive Primary Health Care under Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres. Under the initiative persons more than 30 years of age are targeted for their screening for common NCDs. Under NPCDCS, 640 NCD Clinics at District level and 5148 NCD Clinics at Community Health Centre level have been set up to ensure the treatment of common NCDs.Patients with Non-Communicable Diseases are diagnosed and treated at various tertiary health care facilities such as Medical Colleges, Central Institutes like AIIMS, etc. The treatment in Government health facilities is either free, or highly subsidized for the poor and needy. The treatment for in-patient care is also available under Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) for 10.74 crore families eligible under AB-PMJAY as per Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) database.Under Free Drugs Service Initiative of NHM, financial support is provided to States/UTs for provision of free essential medicines. Furthermore, quality generic medicines are being made available at affordable prices to all, under Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) in collaboration with the State Governments.Guidelines and advisories were sent by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to State/UT Governments from time to time emphasizing the need for continuation of non-COVID essential health services for management of NCDs during COVID pandemic.States/UTs were also advised to utilize the Population Based Screening (PBS) data during containment activities in order to identify those with NCDs and to place them under health surveillance.
