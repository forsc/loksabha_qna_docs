ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	and (b) 	The Standing Committee of the National Board for Wild Life has conducted 31 meetings since 2014. The Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife,which comprises of both official and expert members, considers and takes informed decisions on proposals received in the Ministry based on the recommendations of Chief Wild Life Warden, State Board for Wild Life and State Government.(c)	Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO) is the flagship publication of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). It is a periodic report that summarizes the latest data on the status and trends of biodiversity and draws conclusions relevant to the further implementation of the Convention. Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO-5) provides global summary of progress towards the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and is based on a range of indicators, research studies and assessments. It suggests reflection of biodiversity considerations in the planning and development infrastructure investments, such as the design and management of transportation systems, and other linear infrastructure, through processes such as biodiversity-inclusive environmental assessments and large-scale zoning to avoid the most vulnerable areas for biodiversity, and application of measures to preserve ecological connectivity, for example through overpasses, underpasses and green infrastructure. Ministry has requested the States/UTs that linear infrastructure proposals inside the Protected Areas (PAs) and notified Eco-sensitive Zones around PAs should be accompanied by an animal passage plan prepared by the project proponent on the basis of Guidelines on “Eco-friendly Measures to Mitigate Impacts on Linear Infrastructures on Wildlife” prepared by the Wildlife Institute of India. *****
