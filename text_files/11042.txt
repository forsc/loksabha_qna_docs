ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) to (f): Yes, Sir.Dispute resolution and amnesty are the two components of the scheme. The dispute resolution component aims at liquidating the legacy cases of Central Excise and Service Tax locked up in litigation, whereas the amnesty component seeks to bring the non-compliant tax payers under the tax net by way of voluntary disclosure. Status of the Scheme is as under:Dispute resolution (Legacy Cases)	Amnesty cases (Cases of voluntary disclosure)Expected Cases	Applications received	Applications receivedNo.	Amt. (in cr.)	No.	Amt. (in cr.)	No.	Amt.      (in cr.)182515	364791	161824	87828	27391	1995As can be seen, a majority of the eligible cases (legacy cases) have come under the Scheme. In order to encourage the remaining cases, including bigger cases,   to come under the Scheme, the period was extended for 15 days from 31.12.2019 to 15.01.2020. Further, the government has carried out outreach programmes and appropriate media campaign to create awareness.
