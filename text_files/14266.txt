DCP/J&K/Camp-gr/01-04 dated 25.10.2016 under the Prime Minister’s Development Package for Jammu and Kashmir 2015:i.	2 nos of 220/33 kV Grid Sub-stations: Diskit (Nubra) (50 MVA) and Padum (Zanskar) 50 MVA, ii.	220 kV S/C transmission lines on D/C Tower (total 307 km) including Kargil-Padum (Zanskar) (207 km) and Phyang to Diskit (Nubra) (100 km)iii.	one no of 220 kV line bay each at 220/66 kV Phyang (Leh) Substation and 220/66 kV Kargil  S/s iv.	1x25 MVAR, 220/33 kV bus reactor at Padum along with 220 kV bay.		Jammu Kashmir Power Development Department (JKPDD), State Government of Jammu and Kashmir, appointed Rural Electrification Corporation Transmission Projects Company Ltd. (RECTPCL) as the Project Implementing Agency (PIA) for the aforesaid works in March 2017. 		The above works are in advanced stage of awarding. The status of award of works is as under:i.	The works of design of 4 types of transmission towers and 9 types of foundations had been awarded to Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd and the above design work has been completed in February 2020. ii.	The fabrication of prototype sample towers as per design had been awarded to M/s Unitech in December 2019. The fabrication of prototype sample towers is targeted by 5th April 2020.iii.	The testing of fabricated prototype sample towers had been awarded to M/s Structural Engineering and Research Centre, Government of India in December 2019. The testing of fabricated prototype sample towers is targeted by 15th April 2020.iv.	The tenders for selection of EPC (Engineering Procurement and Construction) Contractors for Drass to Padum (Zanskar) and Phyang (Leh) to Diskit (Nubra) transmission lines and associated 2 Nos. 220 KV Sub-stations had already been floated by RECTPCL in October 2019 and November 2019 respectively and bidding process for award is targeted for completion in March 2020. Overall, the works are targeted for completion in 28 months after award of the EPC Contracts.		Earlier, on the request of JKPDD, the route of Zanskar transmission line was changed from Kargil-Padum to Drass-Padum due to Right of Way issues resulting in change in route alignment. Further, there was change in technical specifications due to topographical conditions like high altitude of 3000 to 5400 Meters above sea level, heavy snowfall with temperature upto (–) 45 Degree Celsius and avalanche prone area with high wind velocity. In the light of the above aspects, JKPDD has revised the cost of works. The Ministry is working out the modalities for mobilising additional resources for completion of the project.***************
