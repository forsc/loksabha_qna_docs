ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES & PENSIONS AND PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR.JITENDRA SINGH):    (a)&(b)There are two Boiling Water Reactors (BWR), TAPS 1&2 (2X160 MW) in operation in the country, at Tarapur in Maharashtra.(c)&(d)The presently operating BWR reactors have, in their original design, ventilation system for normal operation and emergency ventilation system for emergency conditions. The emergency ventilation system has specially designed filters for handling emergencies.  Following the Fukushima incident in Japan, the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) had constituted a committee to review the safety of the Indian Nuclear Power Plants. The committee had recommended installation of Containment Filtered Venting System (CFVS) in BWRs to further enhance the existing level of safety. A Containment Filtered Venting System (CFVS) was accordingly installed in TAPS 1&2 and commissioned in March 2018.(e)	TAPS-1&2 had been operating safely and reliably since the year 1969 even without the CFVS. The installation of CFVS was carried out to enhance the safety to a higher level. This is in line with our practice of constant review of safety and implementation of improvements/upgrades based on evolving global standards, events and experience feedback to keep the reactors at the state of the art in terms of safety.*****
