                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(Dr. SUBHAS SARKAR)(a) & (b): Promotion of Hindi in foreign countries is a matter of high priority for the Government. In this regard, several initiatives have been taken up by the Government of India to promote Hindi in foreign countries which, inter-alia, include organisation of World Hindi Conferences from time to time at various locations both in India and abroad.  Hindi Chairs have been established in various foreign Universities and Institutions and Hindi teachers are deputed in Indian Cultural Centres abroad.  Scholarships and Fellowships are awarded to the foreign students for studying Hindi language and literature under Indian Council for Cultural Relations Fellowship Programme.  In order to generate interest and ability of foreigners in speaking Hindi, “Baat Cheet” Clubs have been set up in Indian Missions and Posts abroad.  World Hindi Day is celebrated every year on 10th January by Indian Missions and Posts abroad to promote Hindi.  On the occasion of World Hindi Day 2022, UNESCO’s World Heritage Centre (WHC) has agreed to publish Hindi descriptions of India''s UNESCO World Heritage Sites on its official website.(c) : The Government has been making sustained efforts for the recognition of Hindi as an official language of the UN and to popularize Hindi throughout the UN system. In 2018, a Voluntary Financial Contribution Agreement was signed between the UN and the Government of India to promote Hindi within the UN system for a two-year term. This was the first Memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by the UN with any country. This was extended by another 5 years in 2019 and is currently in force till March 2025. Pursuant to this Agreement, the UN has launched Hindi social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram as well as a Hindi website of United Nations @ https://in.one.un.org/hindi/.  In addition, the UN broadcasts its programmes on the UN Radio website in Hindi @ https://soundcloud.com/un-news-hindi, issues a weekly Hindi news bulletin on Sound Cloud, publishes a UN blog in Hindi @ https://blogs.un.org/hi/ and has provided a Hindi extension of UN News mobile app for both Android and iOS.  On several occasions, Indian leaders have delivered statements in Hindi at the UN, including Prime Minister’s address at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Sessions in 2014, 2019, 2020 and 2021, and the then External Affairs Minister’s address at the UNGA sessions in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. (d) & (e): The use of Hindi Language in the Ministries/Departments/Subordinate offices of Central Government for the official purposes is guided by Article 343 of the Constitution, The Official Languages Act, 1963 and The Official Languages Rules, 1976.  The Department of Official Language issues guidelines to the Ministries / Departments / Subordinate offices of Central Government regarding the progressive use of Official Language Hindi through persuasion, incentive and goodwill from time to time.  The above guidelines are applicable only for Central Government offices and do not extend to offices under the State Governments.******
