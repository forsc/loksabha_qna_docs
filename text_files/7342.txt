                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a)	State-wise number of Anganwadi Workers/Anganwadi Helpers working in the country is at Annexure-I. The Anganwadi Services (under Umbrella ICDS) Scheme envisages the Anganwadi Workers & Helpers as honorary workers from local community who come forward to render their services, on part time basis, in the area of child care and development. Duties and Responsibilities of AWWs/AWHs are at Annexure-II. Being honorary workers, they are paid monthly honorarium as decided by Government from time to time. The Government of India has recently enhanced the honorarium of Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) from Rs. 3,000/- to Rs. 4,500/- per month; AWWs at mini-AWCs from Rs. 2,250/- to Rs. 3,500/- per month; Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) from Rs 1,500/- to Rs. 2,250/- per month; and introduced performance linked incentive of Rs. 250/- per month to AWHs,w.e.f. 1stOctober, 2018. Further, AWWs are allowed performance linked incentive of ? 500/- per month for using ICDS-CAS under POSHAN Abhiyaan.In addition to the honorarium paid by the Government of India, the respective State/UTs give monetary incentives to these workers out of their own resources as per details given at Annexure-III.  (b)	Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) are entitled for paid absence of 180 days of maternity leave, Awards at the National and State level, two sets of uniform per year, insurance coverage under the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan JyotiBimaYojana (for 18-50 years age functionaries), Pradhan Mantri Suraksha BimaYojana (for 18-59 years age functionaries) and AnganwadiKaryakartiBimaYojana (for 53-59 years age functionaries for the Insurance Cycle 2019-20).Under the Anganwadi Services scheme, children are provided multiple services such as Supplementary Nutrition (SNP),	Pre-school Non-formal Education, Nutrition & Health Education, Immunization, Health Check-up, and Referral Services. Other facilities available to Children under Anganwadi Services include provision of toilet and safe drinking water facilities, Learning Modules, etc.(c)	Several grievances/complaints are being received in this Ministry from time to time.Since the Anganwadi Services is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme and the administration, management & monitoring including recruitment of field functionaries are being done by the concerned State Government/UT Administration.  Hence, the grievances/complaints are forwarded to them for taking remedial measures.(d)	& (e)	The recommendations of Conference Committee on “Service conditions, wages and social security for various categories of workers employed in Central Government and State Government schemes (Anganwadi, Mid-Day Meal, SarvaShikshaAbhiyan and other schemes) under various Ministries of Central Government” was included in 45th Indian Labour Conference. The details of the recommendations for Anganwadi Workers/Helpers made are as under:i.	They should be first recognised as “workers” and not volunteers or honorary workers;ii.	They should be paid minimum wages;iii.	They should get all social security benefits like pension, gratuity, maternity benefits etc.;iv.	To begin with, the social security schemes for unorganised workers like AamAadmiBimaYojana (AABY) and RashtriyaSwasthyaBimaYojana (RSBY) should be extended to these workers;v.	Anganwadi Centres should be in pucca building in good conditions with all basic amenities. Similarly, for ASHA workers also, suitable working space with basic amenities should be provided;vi.	They should have right to organize and collective bargaining;vii.	Respective Departments should formulate “Employment Standing Order” for these workers to regulate their employment and service conditions (wherever not existing);viii.	For Anganwadi Workers and Helpers, who have already retired or retiring in near future, one time gratuity/ lump sum payment should be given;ix.	Such workers, as are kept on contract basis, should be retained for all such subsequent activities;   *********  Annexure-ISTATEMENT REFERRED IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF LOKSABHA UNSTARREED QUESTION NO. 933  FOR 22.11.2019 REGARDING ANGANWADI WORKERS ASKED BY ADV.
