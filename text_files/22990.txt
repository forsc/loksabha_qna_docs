                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):	Globally, the definition of the rare disease varies across different countries. The data pertaining to rare disease is not available as of now. Hence, definition for rare diseases has not been finalized. However the Indian Council of  Medical Research has initiated a rare disease registry, (ICMR Rare Disease registry, available at http:/bmi.icmr.org.in/irdr/index.php).(c) to (e):	Specific treatments like gene therapy and antisense molecules etc are quite expensive. Government has formulated a National Policy for Treatment of Rare Diseases (NTPRD) in July, 2017, However, owing to implementation challenges, the said policy was kept in abeyance till the revised policy was issued or till further orders, whichever was earlier. An Expert Committee was constituted by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in November 2018 to review the NPTRD, 2017 and draft revised NPTRD. Based on the report of the Expert Committee and with the approval of the competent authority, draft of the NPRD, 2020, has been finalized and placed on the website of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare with a view to elicit comments/views of all the stakeholders, including States/UTs. The Draft policy provides for lowering the incidence of rare diseases based on integrated preventive strategy encompassing awareness generation and screening programmes and, within the constraints on resources and competing health care patients, enable access to affordable health care to patients of rare diseases. Further under CGHS, no separate guidelines are issued and treatments of beneficiaries suffering from such diseases are considered by competent Authority on a case to case basis, in consultation with experts in the field.
