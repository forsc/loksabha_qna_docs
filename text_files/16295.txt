                                                        (a) to (d)	Under Skill India Mission, Ministry is implementing  Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) 2016-20 to impart Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) on pan-India basis including State of Maharashtra covering all districts. The scheme has two components viz Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed (CSCM) and Centrally Sponsored State Managed (CSSM).	Under CSCM there is no provision to allocate resources State Wise. However, under Centrally Sponsored State Managed (CSSM) component Rs. 85.77 Crore have been released to State of Maharashtra during FY 2017-18. However, till date, no utilization certificate has been submitted by Government of Maharashtra to this Ministry.	As on 17.03.2020, 1.82 lakh and 1.26 lakh candidates have been trained and certified, respectively, under Short Term Training (STT) courses in State of Maharashtra. Out of these certified candidates, 0.52 lakh candidates have been provided with placement. Also, 7.7 lakh candidates have been oriented under Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) component of the scheme in the State of Maharashtra.	Besides this, the Ministry promotes establishment of model and aspirational skill centres known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) in every district for imparting skill training throughout the country. As on date, 50 PMKKs have been allocated in 36 districts of Maharashtra covering all districts. Out of allocated PMKKs, 43 PMKKs have been established. Loan amount of rs. 17.85 Cr. have been disbursed so far for establishment of PMKKs in State of Maharashtra.
