                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (c):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.**                                            ******** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) TO (c) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *281 FOR ANSWER ON 09.12.2019 REGARDING MIGRATION OF LABOURERS BY SHRI GUMAN SINGH DAMOR.(a) to (c): Migration of labourers from one place to another is not specific to Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh. Job opportunities, better prospects, demand and supply gap, market forces are some of the factors that determine and push migration notwithstanding local job opportunities and implementation of employment generation Government schemes.      	Every citizen has a right to migrate to any part of the country in quest of better job opportunities and prospects. The Constitution of India guarantees all citizens the fundamental right to move freely through the territory of India.   The Principles of free migration are enshrined in clauses (d) & (e) of the Article 19 (1) of the Indian Constitution.     	To foster employment generation and local job opportunities, the Government is implementing Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Guarantee Scheme, Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme, Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana,  Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Antyodaya Yojana etc.     	Further, in order to mitigate the hardship caused by migration, the Government is implementing the Inter-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979 to regulate the employment of the inter-state migrant workmen and to provide for their condition of service. The Act inter-alia, provides for payment of journey allowance, displacement allowance, residential accommodation, medical facilities and protective clothing etc. to migrant workers. There is a well-established mechanism to enforce the provisions of the Act in the Central sphere by CIRM under the Chief Labour Commissioner (Central). The enforcement authorities under CIRM conduct regular inspections of the registered establishments and licenced contractors and the enforcement details in this regard for the last three years and the current year are annexed below. The provisions of the Act are enforced in the State sphere by the State enforcement agencies.
