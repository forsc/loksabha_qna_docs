ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI PANKAJ CHAUDHARY)(a)	Tax payments are made online through the tax payment portal maintained by NSDL on behalf of the Income Tax Department at the following address:https://onlineservices.tin.egov.nsdl.com/etaxnew/tdsnontds.jsp The details about tax collections during last three years and the current year are as under: Financial Year	Direct Tax Collection (Net)2018-19	1137718.482019-20	1050680.562020-21	947176.372021-22(up to 8.03.2022)	1191112.88(b)	Glitches were observed since the launch of the e-filing portal on 7th June 2021 and the Department has taken corrective measures through service provider, Infosys, based on feedback from taxpayers, tax professionals and representatives of ICAI. As a result of the same, the filing of ITRs has steadily increased. As on 15.03.2022 over 6.63 Cr ITRs have been e-filed by taxpayers. Processing of filed ITRs is done by Centralized Processing Centre (CPC) Bengaluru as a separate process. Duly verified valid ITRs are processed by CPC for determining the tax payable and amount of refund due, if any, to the taxpayer, and an electronic intimation is sent by e-mail to this effect. For AY 2021-22, CPC has processed more than 5.17 crore ITRs out of the 6.01 crore verified ITRs on the new system.(c)	The new e-filing portal www.incometax.gov.in is the interface for the taxpayer to view and respond to assessment notices issued by Departmental officers. E-proceeding notices may pertain to assessment, penalty or appeal etc. Till 13.03.2022, more than 29 lakh notices were posted on the e-filing portal by the department to taxpayers and around 15.62 lakh response to these notices were received through the e-filing portal. (d)	 There are specific provisions laid down in the Request for proposal (RFP) for Integrated E-filing and CPC 2.0 project and the contractual agreement between ITD and the Managed Service Provider (MSP) for failure to deliver the services as per agreed standards and timelines. Appropriate action is taken as per the provision of RFP and Contract between the department and MSP.-------
