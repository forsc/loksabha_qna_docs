None of the airline has bid to operate UDAN flights from Sabeya airport so far. UDAN is market driven scheme.  The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under UDAN from time to time. An airport which is included in the awarded routes of UDAN and requires upgradation/development for commencement of UDAN operations is developed under "Revival of unserved and underserved airports" scheme. Darbhanga airport has already been operationalized under UDAN.;
