                                                        THE MINISTER OF YOUTH AFFAIRS & SPORTS[SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR] (a) to (f): Sports being a state subject, the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports deals only with national level sport federations. State/UT level sport federations come under the purview of the States/UTs  and therefore action against non-recognised state sports federations/associations is to be taken by the respective State/UT Governments . The provisions of National Sports Development Code of India, 2011, are not applicable to State/UT level sport federations/associations. The National Rifle Association of India (NRAI), has informed that it gives affiliation to the State Rifle Associations as per the provisions of the NRAI constitution and has further informed that the Federation does not maintain record of recognition of the State Rifle Associations by the respective State Governments.  *****
