ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c) Yes, Sir. The RPF Training Centre, Chinkhill has been shifted to Nasik Road, Maharashtra. The Chinkhill Training Centre does not provide a conducive atmosphere for training and the existing buildings are in a dilapidated state with the absence of basic amenities. Chinkhill Training Centre was lying idle without any courses, thereby wasting  manpower.  Engineering  Department  had  already  declared most of the buildings of Chinkhill Training Centre as unsafe for human dwelling and advised for vacating these structures. The location of Chinkhill Training Centre was also not appropriate, as it was almost cut off from all social activities and facilities. The wards and families of the staff posted at Chinkhill were deprived of the basic facilities such as educational, medical and recreational facilities. Moreover, Nasik City has an advantage of having other Training Centres like that of IREEN, Maharashtra Police Academy, Artillery Training Centre etc. The RPF Training Centre of Nasik Road will be able to reap the benefits of the vicinity of these training institutions like calling their faculties for guest lectures and learning new methods of training from them. The Nasik Road Training Centre is larger compared to Chinkhill Training Centre and fulfills all the basic requirements for a RPF Training Centre. Except Central Railway no other railway was having 2 training centres in the same zone. It was not operationally viable to operate 2 training centres in the same Zonal Railway.(d) Does not arise.*****
