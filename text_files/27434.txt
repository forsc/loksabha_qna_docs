ANSWER




ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a):  As per the WHO report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic published from time to time from 2009 to 2021, the STEPS Survey (2014) conducted in the age group of 18-69 years reflects that the adult tobacco use prevalence in Bhutan is 24.8% (men – 33.6%, women – 13.6%).  As per the Global Youth Tobacco Survey conducted among 13-15 years old the prevalence of tobacco use in Bhutan has reduced from 30.3 % in the year 2013 to 22.2 % in the year 2019. Exposure to SHS in enclosed public places has reduced from 42.8 % in the year 2013 to 36.6 % 2019.  Further, as per the WHO report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic, the adult daily smoking prevalence rates in Iceland have fallen from 20% (2006) to 10% (2019).  (b) & (c):   A comprehensive legislation, namely the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003 (COTPA 2003) to regulate the use of tobacco products has been enacted to discourage the use of tobacco, with emphasis on protection of children and young people from being addicted to the use of tobacco, with a view to achieve improvement of public health in general as enshrined in Article 47 of the Constitution.. The provisions under COTPA, 2003 and the Rules made thereunder mandate prohibition of smoking in public places; ban on sale of tobacco products to and by minors, sale of tobacco products within a radius of 100 yards of educational institutions; prohibition on direct and indirect advertising of tobacco products and mandatory display of specified health warnings. To further accelerate the efforts towards tobacco control, Government launched National Tobacco Control Programme (NTCP) in 2007- 08 with the aim to (i) create awareness about the harmful effects of tobacco consumption, (ii) ensure effective implementation of the provisions under COTPA, 2003 (iii)Set up tobacco cessation centres to help people quit tobacco use, and (iv) facilitate implementation of strategies for prevention and control of tobacco advocated by WHO Framework Convention of Tobacco Control. NTCP is being implemented across the country covering 685 districts. The States/UTs undertake drives for enforcement of COTPA 2003, from time to time. Enforcement efforts are also monitored by the State Tobacco Control Cells (STCCs) and District Tobacco Control Cells (DTCCs).The National Health Policy 2017 already comprehensively includes the aspect of Tobacco Control and sets out the target for achieving 30% relative reduction in prevalence of tobacco use by the year 2025 from the levels in 2009-10. ********
