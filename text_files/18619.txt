ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c): 	Government has introduced Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) to cover personal accidents of people including people working in rural/agriculture sector in the age group of 18-70 years having bank/post office account and who give their consent to join/enable auto-debit on or before 31st May for the coverage period from 1st July to 31st May on an annual renewable basis.   The risk coverage under the scheme is Rs. 2 lakh for accidental death and full disability and Rs. 1 lakh for partial disability. The premium of Rs. 12 per annum is to be deducted from the account holder’s bank / Post office account through ‘auto-debit’ facility. The scheme is being offered by Public Sector General Insurance Companies or any other General Insurance Company who is offering the product on similar terms with necessary approvals and tie up with Banks and Post Offices for this purpose.Details of claims paid under PMSBY are given below :Cumulative Number of Claims Paid since Inception of PMSBY May, 2015 (Financial Year-wise)Period	Cumulative No. of Claims PaidAs on March, 2019	32176As on March, 2020	39969As on December, 2020	43617Contd….2/-- 2 -Farmers can also insure themselves under personal accident policy under Kisan Credit Card Scheme upto the age of 70 years for a risk cover of Rs. 50,000/- for accidental death or total disability and Rs. 25,000/- for partial disability.  Premium rate is Rs. 15 per year and some portion of the premium is borne by the concerned bank. Further, to cater to all insurance needs of farmers a Unified Package Insurance Scheme (UPIS) has been introduced from Kharif 2016 as a pilot scheme.  The scheme is voluntary for the State Governments to implement the pilot in the selected districts. The pilot scheme has been designed to take care of all the insurance needs of farmers associated with their life, properties and agricultural activities such as crops, loss of life, accidental death & disability, student safety, household, agriculture implements and tractor.  Out of total of 7 covers under UPIS, Crop Insurance is compulsory and the farmer has to avail atleast two from the remaining six covers.  Insured farmers have to also furnish the details, if they already availed similar coverage for them or their family members.    Most of the States had made coverage of these two sections voluntary; therefore, the coverage under other sections of the package including personal accident except crop insurance has been negligible or not reported.   *******
