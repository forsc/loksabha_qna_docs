ANSWER




                                                        (a) and (b): No, Sir. Government does not propose to set up a nationalised data governance centre. However, Government of India through Ministry of Science and Technology has formulated the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP), while Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY) is the nodal ministry to implement the policy.The Department of Science and Technology (DST) under Ministry of Science and Technology has formulated the NDSAP policy through close collaboration with the other line Ministries and MeitY by creating “data.gov.in” through National Informatics Centre (NIC). The NDSAP had identified MeitY as the nodal Ministry for the implementation of the policy through NIC, while Department of Science and Technology continues to be the nodal department on policy matters. The policy was notified by Department of Science and Technology (Govt of India Gazette dated 17th March, 2012). In pursuance of the NDSAP-Policy notified by Government of India in March 2012, MeitY through NIC has set up the Open Government Data (OGD) platform India-https://data.gov.in/ to provide open access by proactive release of the data available with various ministries/departments/organizations of Government of India.OGD platform is available as Software as a Service (SaaS) model. It is envisaged that Ministries/Departments would release datasets on proactive/auto consumption basis through Application Programming Interfaces(APIs)/Web Services ie in line with the principles of Open by Default from all e-Government Service Applications particularly from Digital India initiative of the Government. ********
