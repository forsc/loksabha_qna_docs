No specific guidelines or funds for demolition/rehabilitation of the people living in slums have been issued under the Smart Cities Mission(SCM). Under SCM, all projects are proposed and implemented by the cities in accordance with the Mission Statement and Guidelines. With regards to Slum development projects, 27 cities out of the selected 100 Smart Cities have reported a total of 45 slum re-development projects at an estimated cost of Rs 3,967 crore. Some projects require re-settlement of slum dwellers. Their details, as per information provided by the cities, are given in Annexure-II.(e):	 No separate funds are allocated by the Central Government under SCM to the States/UTs for rehabilitation purposes, however, cities may allocate a part of the project cost for the purpose. Further, under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, one of the verticals is related to slum re-development. When such projects are included, as a part of Smart City Proposal under convergence, benefits provided under PMAY-U are utilized by the concerned Smart Cities.                                            *****
