NVS has been advised to align it with theprovisions of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009.(e) Navodaya Leadership Institutes (NLIs) set up in different parts of the countryorganise regular in-service training programmes for the teachers of the JNVs toenable them to constantly upgrade their skills.

Opening of new Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) is acontinuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned StateGovernment/UT administration to make available requisite suitable land free ofcost for construction of the permanent building and making available requiredtemporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building isconstructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV depends on theavailability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority. One JNV each hasbeen sanctioned in all the districts of the country (as on 31st May, 2014). Thestate of Tamil Nadu has not yet accepted the Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme.*****
