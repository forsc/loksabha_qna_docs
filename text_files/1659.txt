MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT (SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’) (a)	 & (b): The Mid-Day Meal Guidelines prescribe the following nutritional and food norms under the Mid-Day Meal Scheme for improving the quality of mid-day meal:<pre>Items	For children of Primary classes	For children of Upper Primary classesA) Nutritional Norms (Per child per day)Calorie	450	700Protein	12 gms	20 gmsB) Quantum of Food Norms (Per child per day)Food-grains	100 gms	150 gmsPulses	20 gms	30 gmsVegetables	50 gms	75 gmsOil & fat	5 gms	7.5 gmsSalt & condiments	As per need	As per need</pre>(c): Under Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDMS), the Central Government fixes the cost of following components and provides financial assistance to States and UTs:<pre>(i)	Foodgrains: Foodgrains are provided through Food Corporation of India (FCI) to States/UTs at subsidised rates under National Food Security Act i.e. Rs. 2 and Rs. 3 per kg for wheat and rice respectively.  The economic cost of wheat is Rs. 25.06 per kg and that of rice is Rs. 36.02 per kg.(ii)	Cooking Cost: It includes cost of ingredients, e.g. pulses, vegetables, cooking oil, other condiments and cost of fuel and is Rs 4.48 for primary classes and Rs 6.71 for upper primary classes.(iii)	Honorarium to Cook-cum-helpers: It is provided @ of Rs. 1000 to each CCH per month for 10 months in a year.(iv)	Transportation Assistance (TA): It is provided at par with Public Distribution System (PDS) rates subject to a maximum of Rs. 1500 per MT, in all States and UTs other than 8 NER and 3 Himalayan States. The TA for 8 NER and 3 Himalayan States is at par with their respective PDS rates. (v)	Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (MME): It is calculated@ 3% of above mentioned four components.(d) to (g): No, Sir. Under MDMS, the cooking cost is fixed by the Central Government.  The Government reviewed the Scheme in 2018-19 and approved revision of cooking cost annually in April linked to inflation index (Consumer Price Index). Accordingly, the cooking cost was increased by 3.09% w.e.f. 1st April, 2019 for the year 2019-20 over and above the previously existing cooking cost. The current cooking cost is Rs. 4.48 for primary classes and Rs. 6.71 for upper primary classes and will be shared between the Centre and States as per the approved sharing pattern.(h): The Government has adopted an elaborate monitoring mechanism at Central, State and District levels to ensure quality food is served to children under the Scheme. At national level, an Empowered Committee, headed by Minister of Human Resource Development and also a National level Steering-cum-Monitoring Committee (NSMC) as well as Programme Approval Board (PAB) monitor the scheme and suggest measures for its smooth and effective implementation. </pre>At the State level, a State level Steering–cum-Monitoring Committee headed by the State Chief Secretary and, at the District Level, a District Level Committee under the Chairpersonship of the senior-most Member of Parliament of Lok Sabha from the district monitors the implementation of the scheme.  At local level Gram Panchayats/Gram Sabhas, members of Village Education Committees (VECs), Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs) and the School Management Committees (SMCs) monitor the regularity and wholesomeness of the mid-day meal served to children, cleanliness in cooking and serving of the meal, timeliness in procurement of good quality ingredients, fuel, etc., implementation of variety in menu so as to make it attractive to children and ensuring social and gender equity on daily basis. In addition to directing States and UTs to carry out Social Audit, the Centre constitutes Joint Review Missions (JRMs) consisting of educational and nutritional experts, which review the scheme through field visits from time to time.  The reports of JRMs are shared with concerned States and UTs for taking suitable action on the findings. *****
