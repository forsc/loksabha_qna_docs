ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) 	Since August, 2019, Government of India in partnership with States, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) – Har Ghar Jal after subsuming the then National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) to provide tap water connection to every rural household by 2024. Details of State/ UT–wise allocation of Central fund, in 2018-19 under the then NRDWP and under JJM, in 2019-20 & 2020-21, are annexed.(b) 	Under Jal Jeevan Mission, district-wise fund allocation is not made at Govt. of India level. However, the district-wise status of physical progress made under JJM across the country, including Sikar, Jhunjhunu, Churu, Jaipur, Ajmer and Alwar districts of Rajasthan, Satara, Solapur and Latur districts of Maharashtra, Araria district in Bihar and in Gujarat, is available on JJM dashboard at:https://ejalshakti.gov.in/jjmreport/JJMIndia.aspx.(c) & (d)	Under JJM, priority is given to quality–affected habitations, while planning water supply schemes to provide tap water supply to households. Further, at the time of fund allocation to States/ UTs, 10% weightage is given to the population residing in habitations affected by chemical contaminants viz. Arsenic, Fluoride, Iron, heavy metals, nitrate and salinity. Allocation of funds under JJM has increased fourfold in the current financial year vis-à-vis last year. However, in 2021-22, the State of Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Bihar are yet to draw any fund.In March 2017, to provide potable drinking water to identified 27,544 Arsenic/ Fluoride-affected habitations in the country, National Water Quality Sub-Mission (NWQSM) was launched, which has now been subsumed under JJM. For identified 6,849 Fluoride affected habitations of Rajasthan, Rs. 1,145.50 Crore and for 100 Fluoride affected habitations of Maharashtra, an amount of Rs. 18.79 Crore and for 1,043Fluoride affected habitations of Bihar, an amount of Rs. 171.96 Crore has been released under NWQSM. As reported, in all Fluoride-affected habitations of Gujarat, provision of safe drinking water has been made.As planning, implementation and commissioning of piped water supply schemes based on a safe water source takes time, purely as an interim measure, States/ UTs have been advised to install community water purification plants (CWPPs) in such habitations to provide potable water to every household at the rate of 8–10 litre per capita per day to meet their drinking and cooking requirements.(e) 	No such project is being funded by the Ministry.*****
