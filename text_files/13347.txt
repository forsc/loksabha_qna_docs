Both the projects could not be taken forward for execution being financially unviable.(c): In the overall interest of the Nation and to ensure that the projects are completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, Divisional level, zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues that are obstructing the progress of projects. To ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of project. *****
