ANSWER




                                                        (a)	  The coastal security plan at all the major ports is in place.  The ports are also under the cover of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and Indian Coast Guard (ICG).  International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code, of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), requires assessment of Port Facility Security (PFSA) and the development of the Port Facility Security Plan (PFSP).  Implementation of ISPS code ensures that the security of ships and port facilities is as per the requirement of the international instrument.  Accordingly, all Major ports and Non-major ports handling EXIM cargo and having interface with ships with international voyages comply with requirements of the ISPS code and audits of the same are carried out at regular intervals. Regular mock-drills and exercises are also conducted to ensure that the ports are in a state of readiness to handle any security threat.   (b)	  The Union Government provides security cover to all the twelve major ports.  All         non-major ports are, however, under the administrative control of respective State Governments.  The details in respect of non-major ports are not maintained in the Ministry of Shipping.(c) to (e)  The Road and Rail connectivity at Non-major ports of the country does not come under the purview of Ministry of Shipping.  Such information is not maintained/compiled in the Ministry of Shipping.                                         *******
