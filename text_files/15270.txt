The equity part of Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) is funded from internal resources and Government Budgetary Support.

However, there is no restriction on FDI in the nuclear industry for manufacturing of equipment and providing other supplies for nuclear power plants and related other facilities. Government of India has amended the Atomic Energy Act, 1962 in 2015 to enable the licensing of NPCIL’s Joint Ventures for setting up nuclear power projects. To boost domestic investment, Joint Ventures have been formed by NPCIL with public sector majors National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC), Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) and National Aluminium Company Limited (NALCO).(e)	Yes, Sir. (f)	Four indigenous Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs), each of 700 MW are to be set up at Gorakhpur in Fatehabad district of Haryana. These are planned in two phases of twin units – GHAVP 1&2 (2X700 MW) and GHAVP 3&4 (2X700 MW). Work on the first phase (GHAVP 1&2) is in progress. The Government has also accorded administrative approval and financial sanctions for GHAVP 3&4 and pre-project activities are in progress. The four units, on progressive completion by 2031 will generate 2800 MW of power.******
