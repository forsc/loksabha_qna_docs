ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) and (b) No Sir. Passenger Service Fee (PSF) has two components: PSF (Security Component) [PSF(SC)] and PSF (Facilitation Component) [PSF(FC)]. PSF (SC) which has now been termed Aviation Security Fee (ASF) is utilized to meet expenditure on providing security at airports. ASF is implemented since 1st July 2019 at the rate of Rs. 150/- for embarking domestic passenger and USD 4.85 for embarking international passengers. The revision in ASF is linked with annual inflation based on CPI-IW (Consumer Price Index Numbers for Industrial Worker) and is undertaken based upon recommendation of NASFT (National Aviation Security Fee Trust) which manages ASF. The rates of ASF have been revised from Rs.150/- to Rs. 160/- per embarking domestic passenger and USD 4.85 to USD 5.20 per embarking international passenger w.e.f. 01.09.2020. The annual revision of ASF was due on 01st July 2020, but considering the Covid 19 pandemic, the same has been deferred and the revised rate has been implemented w.e.f. from 01.09.2020. ;PSF (FC) was used for passenger facilitation/amenities which has been discontinued at major airports (covered under Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) of India Act 2008) by AERA and merged with User Development Fee (UDF). At airports other then major airports, PSF (FC) is being utilized to provide passenger amenities.;
