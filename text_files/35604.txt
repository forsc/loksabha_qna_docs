                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE(DR. BHAGWAT KRISHANRAO KARAD)(a)	As per information available, the details of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs),State-wise, along with year of incorporation and performance in terms of Net Profit are provided at Annexure-I. Based on the operational and functional requirement, recruitments of employees are done by the CPSEs themselves. The vacancies with regards to CPSEs are dynamic in nature and are not centrally monitored. However, the total number of regular employees as on 31.3.2021 in operating CPSEs is also provided at Annexure I.(b&c)	The Government has notified the New Public Sector Enterprise (“PSE”) Policy in February,2021 under which the public sector enterprises have been classified as Strategic and Non-Strategic sectors. The Strategic Sectors have been delineated based on the criteria of national security, energy security, critical infrastructure, provision of financial services and availability of important minerals.  Based on this, following Sectors are classified as Strategic Sectors:i.	Atomic Energy, Space and Defence;ii.	Transport and Telecommunication;iii.	Power, Petroleum, Coal and other minerals;iv.	Banking, Insurance and Financial ServicesIn Strategic sectors, bare minimum presence of the existing public sector commercial enterprises at Holding Company level will be retained under Government control. The remaining enterprises in a strategic sector will be considered for privatisation or merger or subsidiarization with another PSE or for closure. PSEs in non-strategic sectors shall be considered for privatisation, where feasible, otherwise such enterprises shall be considered for closureThe policy lays down a roadmap for future course of various PSEs including privatization, which is an ongoing process. The timing for execution of specific transactions, will be on a case-to-case basis and, inter-alia, be contingent upon the considerations of appropriate sequencing, sectoral trends, administrative feasibility, investors'' interest, etc.(d)	Since the commencement of the New PSE Policy for Atmanirbhar Bharat, the Government has, so far, not given ‘in-principle’ approval for strategic disinvestment of any PSE.(e)	Amount to be received from privatization of any PSE is contingent on the prevailing market conditions and investors’ interest at the time of sale.
