ANSWER




                                                        (a)        Ministry of Tribal Affairs is nodal Ministry for Notification of a community as Scheduled Tribe under Article 342 of the Constitution. However, the responsibility of issuance and verification of Scheduled Tribe certificate/ social status rests with the concerned State Government/ UT Administration. All complaints/grievances/representations received in this regard are forwarded to State Government/ UT Administration concerned. The information is not maintained centrally.           The Ministry has been issuing advisories from time to time regarding issuance of ST certificates with proper verification and ensure that deserving ST persons are issued certificates without undue delays and difficulties. The last such advisory was issued on 17/02/2020.(b)       Department of School Education and Literacy (DoSEL), Ministry of Education is implementing Samagra Shiksha scheme. Bridging gender and social category gaps at all levels of school education is one of the major objectives of the scheme. The Scheme reaches out to girls, and children belonging to SC, ST, Minority communities and transgender. The Scheme also focuses on the identified Special Focus Districts (SFDs) on the basis of adverse performance on various indicators of enrollment, retention, and gender parity, as well as concentration of SC, ST and minority communities.(c)        This Government launched Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban in June, 2015 for providing pucca house to all eligible families / beneficiaries in urban areas of the country under ‘Housing for All by 2022’ mission. The Scheme covers all eligible urban beneficiaries universally including those belonging to Scheduled Tribe Category. To pursue the objective of ''Housing for All by 2022,'' the Government is also implementing Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) w.e.f. 1st April 2016 which aims for construction of 2.95 crore pucca houses with basic amenities for eligible rural households with minimum 60% target for SC/ST at the National level. As per guidelines 17.5 % of its total budget is earmarked to Scheduled Tribes every financial year.(d)       Police and Public Order are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibility of maintaining law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens rests with the respective State Governments. The State Governments are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provisions of laws. Ministry has not received reports of any instances on the Police department of some states treating the tribals as habitual offenders.  The National Crimes Record Bureau that is entrusted with maintaining records of crimes in the country in its report has highlighted about some initiatives including providing better citizen centric services like e-portals for reporting of crimes online. Others include opening of Women help-desks at Police Stations to encourage women to freely report crime. Such measures are expected to encourage victims of any crime to seek justice.*****
