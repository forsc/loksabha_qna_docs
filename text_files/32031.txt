ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) and (b)Yes Sir.	Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has received requestsfor blanket ban on manufacture and sale of fire crackers from individuals only, not from any agency. The details is given as Annexure-I.(c) The firecracker case is Sub-judice in Hon’ble Supreme Court, in Writ Petition (Civil) 728 of 2015in the matter of Arjun Gopal & Ors vs. Union of India &Ors. Hon’ble Supreme Court limited the manufacturing and sale of conventional firecrackers and allowed only the crackers with reduced emission (improved crackers) and green crackers. The Petroleum and Explosive Safety Organisation (PESO) has been directed to ensure fireworks with permitted chemicals only to be purchased/possessed/sold/used during Diwali and all other religious festivals, of any religion whatsoever, and other occasions like marriages, etc. PESO ensures that only those crackers whose decibel (sound) levels are within the limits are allowed in the market and take action by suspending the licenses of the manufacturers on such violations. Accordingly, new formulation fireworks and crackers as per the guidelines of the Supreme Court are manufactured and sold in the country.Further, other steps taken to ensure safety of the general public from air and noise pollution due to bursting of fire crackers inter alia include advisories for noise monitoring on the occasion of Diwali, prohibition of the use of fireworks between 10.00 p.m. and 6.00 a.m., publicity regarding the ill effects of the firecrackers and awareness programme.*****
