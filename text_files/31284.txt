ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS (SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) to (d):	The prices of petroleum products in the country are linked to the price of respective products in the international market. Prices of LPG in the country are based on Saudi Contract Price (CP), the benchmark for international prices of LPG. Saudi CP has risen approximately 238% from April, 2020 to October, 2021 (236 USD/MT to 797 USD/MT). However, for domestic LPG, the Government continues to modulate the effective price to consumer to insulate the common man from rise in international prices.x-x-x-x-x
