The reasons for slow pace of utilization in some projects include delay in transfer of grants from States to the institutions, construction delays due to unfavourable terrain or monsoon for hilly States, natural calamities etc. Regular review meetings have been taken up with States and institutions that lag behind in utilization, to resolve issues and urge them to utilize expeditiously.***
