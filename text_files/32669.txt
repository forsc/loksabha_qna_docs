                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (c): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 104 BY SHRI PARTHIBAN S.R. TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 02.02.2022 REGARDING NEW RAILWAY LINES IN TAMIL NADU. (a) & (b): The Railway projects are sanctioned Zonal Railway wise and not State wise as the Railways’ projects may span across various state boundaries. As on 01.04.2021, across Indian Railways including Tamil Nadu, 187 New line projects of 21,037 Km length, costing approx. `4.06 lakh crore are in different stages of planning/sanction/execution, out of which commissioning of 2,621 Km length has been achieved and expenditure of approx. `1.06 lakh crore has been incurred upto March, 2021. Zonal Railway wise details of Railway projects including cost, expenditure and outlay are made available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in >Ministry of Railways>Railway Board >About Indian Railways >Railway Board Directorates >Finance (Budget) >Rail Budget/Pink Book (Year)> Railway wise Works Machinery and Rolling Stock Programme.Budget outlay has been provided to the projects in a rationalized manner and budget has been allotted to the projects which are in advance stage of completion, priority projects, important New Line & National projects, executable & important Gauge conversion projects and     the    projects    which    are     important   from   the  throughput enhancement considerations. Thus, focused attention is given in fund allotment, rather than thinly spreading the resources without commensurate results.Since 2014, there has been substantial increase in Budget allocation and commensurate commissioning of projects. The Average Annual Budget allocation in the Indian Railways for New Line, Gauge Conversion and Doubling works during 2014-19 has increased to `26,026 crore per year from `11,527 crore per year during 2009-14, which is 126% more than average annual  budget  outlay  of  2009-14.  The  Annual  budget  allocation for these Projects  for   Financial   Year 2019-20  was  `39,836 crore  (246%  more  than average annual  budget allocation during 2009-14) and `43,626 crore in Financial Year 2020-21 (278% more than the Average Annual Budget allocation during 2009-14). For Financial year 2021-22, highest-ever budget outlay of `52,398 crore has been provided for these works, which is 355% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14. During 2014-21, 3,681 km New line sections have been commissioned across Indian Railways at an average of 525.86 km/year which is 52% more than the average commissioning during 2009-14(345.40 km/year). TAMIL NADUTamil Nadu is covered by South Western Railway (SWR), Southern Railway (SR) and South Central Railway (SCR) zone of Indian Railways.As on 01.04.21, 09 new line projects covering a length of 871 km costing of `7,910 crore falling fully/partly in Tamil Nadu are in different stages of planning/approval/sanction and an expenditure of `575 crore has been incurred upto March 2021.There is substantial increase in budget allocation since 2014. Average annual Budget allocation for Infrastructure and safety works, falling fully/ partly in State of Tamil Nadu, during 2014-19 has been enhanced to `1,979 crore per year from `879 crore per year during 2009-14, which is 125% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14.  For financial year 2019-20 budget allocation of `2410 crore (174% more than average annual allocation of 2009-14) and for financial year 2020-21 `2812 crore (220% more than average annual budget allocation of 2009-14)  has been provided for these works. For financial year 2021-22, budget outlay of `3730 crore (original budget outlay `2,972 crore and additional `758 crore) has been provided for these works, which is the  highest ever budget allocation and 324% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14. During 2014-21, 996 km sections (404 km of Gauge Conversion and 592 km of Doubling) falling fully/partly in the State of Tamil Nadu have been commissioned at an average rate 142.29 km per year.(c): The completion of any Railway project(s) depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, deposition of cost share by State Government in cost sharing projects, priority of projects, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project(s) site, number of working months  in  a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions etc. and all these factors affect the completion time of the project(s) due to which the confirmed time frame for completion of projects cannot be ascertained at this stage. However, Railways is making all the efforts for expeditious completion of projects. *****
