ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS [SHRI KIREN RIJIJU]  (a) & (b) Sports being a State subject the responsibility for promotion of sports rests with the State/UT Governments. Central Government supports State / UT Governments in their efforts by providing assistance to National Sports Federations (NSFs) for preparation and participation of Indian athletes in international sporting events and running expert training facilities in Sports Authority of India (SAI) centres. At present no NSF has been recognized for the sport of Ice Hockey. To ensure that Ice Hockey players of the country including those from Ladakh are able to participate in international sports events with financial support from the Government, if a proposal from a sports body for seeking Government recognition as NSF for the sport of Ice Hockey is received, the Government will consider giving recognition to such a body. For promotion of Ice Hockey, this Ministry has recognized Ice Hockey Association of India, who is eligible to receive financial assistance limited to Rs. 2.00 lakh for holding local competition in Ice Hockey sport during Leh festival.  (c) No such equipments have been bought from abroad by this Ministry for disbursement among the sports personalities of Union Territory of Ladakh. (d) Does not arise.  ****
