ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d):	The erstwhile rural housing scheme Indira AwaasYojana (IAY) aimed at providing houses to families Below Poverty Line (BPL) in rural areas. The  Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) in their Performance Audit Report on IAY pointed out major challenges in implementation including non-assessment of housing shortage, lack of transparency in selection of beneficiaries, low quality of house, lack of technical supervision, lack of convergence, weak mechanism for monitoring, etc. To address these shortcomings and lacunae in IAY and in the context of Government’s priority for “Housing for All” by 2022, the scheme has been restructured into Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), which came into effect from 1st April, 2016.PMAY-G aims to provide a pucca house with basic amenities to all houseless households and households living in kutcha and dilapidated house in rural areas by 2022. The beneficiaries are identified based on housing deprivation parameters as per Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC), 2011 after due verification by Gram Sabha. To achieve the objective of “Housing for All” by 2022 in rural areas, it is aimed to provide assistance for construction of 2.95 crore houses. In the first phase from 2016-17 to 2018-19, the target assigned to the States / UTs is construction of 1.00 crore houses. Under phase II, assistance would be provided for construction of remaining 1.95 crore houses in three years i.e., 2019-20 to 2021-22.  The year-wise targets under Phase -II is as under:-Financial Year	                   Target (Number of houses)2019-20	                                60.00 Lakh2020-21	                                70.00 Lakh2021-22	                                65.00 Lakh(e):	To achieve the objective of “Housing for All” by 2022 in rural areas, the Government has taken following steps under PMAY-G: i.	All States / UTs now have a single bank account of PMAY-G at the State/UT level, the State Nodal Account, from where the assistance is transferred directly to beneficiary account through Fund Transfer Order, thus ensuring smooth and faster transfer of funds to the beneficiary.ii.	Implementation and monitoring of the scheme is through end to end e-Governance model. All activities of implementation of scheme from identification of beneficiaries till completion of houses are done through MIS-AwaasSoft. iii.	Evidence based monitoring of construction of house through uploading of geo-tagged photographs at each pre-determined stage of house construction through the mobile application- AwaasApp. This has helped in reduction of time in verification of house construction enabling  faster release of assistance leading to timely house completion.iv.	Increasing availability of trained rural mason by implementing ''on the job'' Rural Mason Training Programme which has helped in construction of quality houses at a faster pace.v.	Assigning each house sanctioned under PMAY-G to a local functionary to improve   monitoring and facilitate timely construction of houses.vi.	Awards to the best performing States/UTs based on performance index dashboard, thereby creating healthy competition and motivation among the States/ UTs for achieving the set targets.*****
