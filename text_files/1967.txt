(c) & (d) Yes Sir.The Central Asian Countries namely Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are members of the Eurasian Economic Union (EaEU). A Joint Feasibility Study has been conducted to explore the possibility of Free Trade agreement with EaEU where Russia, Armenia, Belarus are the other three countries. The Joint Feasibility Study (JFS) has found that there is a significant realizable potential to enhance the bilateral trade with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan through a trade agreement. Further, a Joint Statement has been shared with Uzbekistan to commence a Joint Feasibility Study to explore the feasibility of Preferential Trade Agreement between India and Uzbekistan. The likely potential of the bilateral trade would be determined once the Joint Feasibility Study gets completed.  (e)	There are existing institutional mechanisms in the form of Inter-Governmental Commissions (IGCs), Joint Commission Meetings (JCMs) and Joint Working Groups (JWGs) where bilateral trade issues are taken up for discussions.   During the last three years and in the current year meetings of 3 IGCs, 2 JWGs and 3 JCMs have been held. The Ministry also takes up export promotion matters with Export Promotion Councils, Trade Bodies, Commodity Boards and Embassies of India in the Central Asian Region for identifying and addressing issues which hamper exports. On account of such efforts on the part of various stakeholders, including the Government, India’s merchandise export in the aggregate to the Central Asian countries increased in 2017-18 and 2018-19 vis-a-vis with the respective previous financial year.
