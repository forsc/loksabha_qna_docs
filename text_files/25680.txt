Indian Railways being the largest transporter in India contributes significantly to the growth of Indian economy. Inspite of Covid situation, Railways freight loading has increased in 2020-21 as compared to 2019-20.A large number of coaches, locomotives and wagons are manufactured in Railway Production Units, Workshops, Public Sector Units and Private sector factories in India. The Rolling stock manufactured in 2020-21 is tabulated below:-Rolling stock	Production 2020-21Locomotives	764Coaches 	4903Wagons	        12521Railways are thus, actively contributing in growth of Indian economy.As part of “Atmanirbhar Bharat”, procurement of material for Indian Railways is being done through “Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order” issued by Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Government of India. Import of goods as a percentage of total goods procured has come down drastically from 6.05% in 2012-13 to 1.38 % in 2019-20.Rolling Stock produced by Indian Railways is fully indigenous except for some items such as wheels & axles which are partly imported. Efforts are being made to reduce even these imports by setting up additional capacities. (b)	Railway is a Pan India organization and does not draw plans based upon State boundaries.(c) Works are processed for sanction based on operational requirement, technical feasibility, commercial viability, financial justification and resource availability.(d) At present, there is no such proposal.
