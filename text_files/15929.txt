ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b)According to India’s Second Biennial Update Report (BUR-2) submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), India’s total Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2014 were 2.607 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The energy sector accounted for 73% of the total GHG emissions for the year 2014 followed by the agriculture sector accounting for 16%, the Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) for 8% and waste sector for 3%. Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector was a net sink, sequestrating 12% of total emissions. Thus, net GHG emissions considering LULUCF in 2014 was 2.306 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent.India’s per capita emission in 2014 was 1.8 tonne which is less than one-third of global average. Further, between 1850 and 2010, energy related cumulative CO2emissions from India were only 2.7% of the world emissions.(c) to (f)  Climate change is a global phenomenon and requires the cooperation of all nations based on the principles of ‘Equity’ and ‘Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities’ and developed countries taking the lead in climate action. India is a Party to the UNFCCC, its Kyoto Protocol (KP) and the Paris Agreement (PA). For addressing the challenge of climate change, India adheres to the paramountcy of the UNFCCC processes. It has proactively contributed to multilateral efforts to combat climate change and continues to do so while undertaking its own independent, enhanced initiatives in climate mitigation and adaptation besides meeting all its commitments under the UNFCCC, its KP and PA. The Government of India stands committed to combating climate change through its several programs and schemes. This includes inter-alia implementation of National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), which comprises missions in specific areas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, water, sustainable agriculture, sustaining the Himalayan ecosystem, sustainable habitat, Green India and strategic knowledge for climate change.Under the Paris Agreement, India has submitted its Nationally Determined Contributions outlining eight targets for 2021-2030, including (i) to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030 from 2005 level, (ii) to achieve about 40 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030 with the help of transfer of technology and low-cost international finance, (iii) to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. Independent studies rate India’s efforts highly and compliant with the requirements under PA.Thirty-three states and Union Territories have prepared a State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) consistent with the objectives of NAPCC to address their State-specific actions. These SAPCCs inter-alia outline sector-specific and cross-sectoral priority actions.*****
