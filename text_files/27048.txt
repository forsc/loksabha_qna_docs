In view of this, Government remains vigilant and is taking all necessary measures to ensure the safety and security of Indian nationals and ongoing projects. The Embassy of India in Kabul continues to function normally and is providing regular services, including consular and visa. As a security measure in July 2021, India-based personnel from the Consulate of India in Kandahar were temporarily withdrawn. However, the Consulate continues to operate visa and consular services through its local staff. Our Mission in Kabul also continues to extend necessary assistance to Indian nationals in Afghanistan. Security advisories for Indian nationals are issued regularly.***
