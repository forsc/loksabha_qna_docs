Government has taken various steps for generating employment in the country like encouraging private sector of economy, fast tracking various projects involving substantial investment and increasing public expenditure in various schemes.Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY) has been launched by the Ministry of Labour and Employment for incentivising employers for promoting employment generation. Under this scheme, Government is paying entire employer’s contribution (12% or as admissible) towards EPF and EPS for all eligible new employees for all sectors for 3 years.This scheme has a dual benefit, where, on the one hand, the employer is incentivised for increasing the employment base of workers in the establishment, and on the other hand,  these workers will have access to social security benefits of the organised sector. The scheme aims to cover a large number of informal workers to the formal workforce for availing the Social Security Benefit.  In order to provide social security benefits to the workers in the unorganized sector including workers in agriculture sector, the Government has enacted the Unorganized Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008. This Act stipulates formulation of suitable welfare schemes for unorganized workers on matters relating to: (i) life and disability cover, (ii) health and maternity benefits, (iii) old age protection and (iv) any other benefit as may be determined by the Central Government. Life and disability cover is provided through Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti BimaYojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) to the unorganized workers depending upon their eligibility. Government of India and State Governments pay the annual premium in equal share without any burden on the beneficiary.*****
