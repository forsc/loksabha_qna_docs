RAGHAVAN, HON’BLE M.P(a):	Yes Sir, the Government is aware of the position as stated in the Economic Survey.  (b)& (c):The Government in its endeavour to ensure resolution of Commercial cases expeditiously, fairly and at reasonable cost to the litigant, has enacted the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act, 2015, and the act was further amended in 2018, which facilitates the fast tracking of Commercial disputes by reducing the specified value of a commercial dispute to Rs. 3 lakh from the earlier Rs. 1.00 Crore and establishment of Commercial Courts at District Judge level in the jurisdiction of High Courts enjoying Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction. A mandatory provision of “Pre-Institution Mediation and Settlement” (PIMS) (an Alternative Dispute Resolution Mechanism) in cases which do not contemplate urgent interim relief has also been introduced by the amended Act to facilitate out of court settlement and ease the work load of the Courts. The Government also amended the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, which, inter-alia, provides time limit for arbitral award, incentivizing quick disposal of disputes, neutrality of arbitrator, timely execution of arbitral award by restricting the scope for challenging it. The Government has also taken steps to promote institutional arbitration in the country.In this regard, the New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Ordinance2019 has been promulgated on 2nd March, 2019. The Government has also amended the Specific Relief Act, 1963, which inter-alia empowers the State Government in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court to designate certain civil courts as Special Courts within the local limits of the area to exercise jurisdiction and to try a suit under the Act in respect of contracts relating to infrastructure projects. As a results of the continuous efforts of the Government, India inDoing Business Report 2019 released on 31st October 2018, achieved 77th position out of the 190 economies, a jump of 23 positions from the 100th position in the previous report. In Enforcing Contracts indicator, India’s ranking improved by 1 position – from 164 in the 2018 Report to 163 Rank in the 2019 report. Further, the Government is also fully committed to speedy disposal of cases and reducing pendency and has, in conjunction with the judiciary, taken many corrective steps.  The Government has taken several initiatives to provide an ecosystem for faster disposal of cases by the judiciary. The National Mission for Justice Delivery and Legal Reforms established by the Government has adopted a coordinated approach for phased liquidation of arrears and pendency in judicial administration through various strategic initiatives, including improving infrastructure for courts, leveraging Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for better justice delivery, and filling up of vacant positions of Judges in High Courts and Supreme Court.
