ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c):	Section 15 of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 prohibits a person other than medical practitioner enrolled on a State Medical Register to practice medicine in the State. Any person acting in contravention shall be punishable with imprisonment for a period upto one year or with fine upto rupees one thousand or both. Since health is a State subject, the primary responsibility to deal with such cases of quacks lies with the respective State Governments. The Central Government, in keeping view of the above, requested Chief Ministers of all the States to take appropriate action under the law against quacks and also to evolve suitable policies to ensure availability of quality health workforce in rural areas.
