                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE(DR BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (e) With resurgence of COVID-19 trajectory in the country by the end of December 2021, a number of States/UTs reported an increasing COVID-19 test positivity rates. However, as on 31st January 2022, the trend seems to be stabilizing with a decreasing trend in many States/UTs. With the reporting of Omicron Variant, a highly mutated variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus, and its classification as a Variant of Concern by the World Health Organization, the Union Ministry of Health & FW revised its Guidelines for international arrivals. Following a risk based approach; provisions for mandatory pre-departure & post arrival RT-PCR testing on day 8th of arrival and a mandatory home quarantine for 7 days have been made in the present guidelines for all international travelers to India. Union Ministry of Health & FW is coordinating and collaborating with other stakeholder Ministries/departments including Ministry of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, Ministry of Railways and all States/UTs etc. Daily review meetings at the level of Hon’ble Union Health Minister with all relevant stakeholders including subject experts. Regular review meetings with States/UTs through video conferencing have been conducted under Hon’ble Union Health Minister and senior officials of Health Ministry to review preparedness and response measures to COVID-19 pandemic. States/UTs have been repeatedly urged to undertake the following activities:•	Strict monitoring of International travelers in the community. •	Contact tracing of positive individuals & follow up for 14 days.•	Genome sequencing of positive samples through INSACOG Labs in a prompt manner.•	Continued monitoring of areas where cluster of positive cases emerge.•	Further strengthening of COVID-19 testing infrastructure and ensuring early identification of cases through adequate testing across the States.•	Ensure preparedness of health infrastructure (availability of ICU, oxygen supported beds, ventilators, etc.) and upgrade health infrastructure under ECRP-II including in rural areas and for pediatric cases. •	Commissioning all PSA plants, ensuring sufficient logistics, drugs etc.•	Ensure rapid COVID-19 vaccine coverage.•	Ensuring adherence to COVID Appropriate Behaviour.Union Ministry of Health & FW continues to provide support to States/UTs to enhance preparedness and response capacities against COVID-19 and other public health emergencies. Ministry of Health & Family Welfare continues to provide technical guidance for managing various aspects of COVID-19. So far more than 180 guidelines/advisories/SoPs/plans have been provided to States/UTs. These include guidance on containment and surveillance; updated COVID-19 clinical management protocols for adults as well as for children & adolescents; guidance on co-infections (including COVID-19 and Seasonal Influenza co-infection); guidelines for management of post-COVID sequlae; revised guidelines on home isolation; discharge protocol, testing strategy, safe resumption of activities in workplaces, markets etc. States are supported in terms of supply of logistics which includes PPE Kits, N-95 masks, oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators, ventilators and drugs etc. States are also supported in terms of installation of Oxygen concentrator plants/ PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption plants) plants. To disseminate various clinical guidelines for appropriate management of cases, a series of webinars were held under MoHFW''s Center of Excellence initiative for all State Level Centers of Excellence and district level public and private COVID health facilities in collaboration with AIIMS, Delhi and Indian Medical Association.Since 3rd January 2022 COVID-19 vaccination has been initiated for the age-group 15-18 years and provision has also been made for administration of precautionary 3rd dose for the healthcare workers, frontline workers and people above 60 years of age with co-morbidities since 10th January, 2022. COVID-19 vaccine is made available free of cost for all citizens of the country aged 15 years and above, irrespective of their socio-economic status, at all Government COVID-19 Vaccination Centres (CVCs). Details of Covid-19 vaccine doses provided to States/UTs and doses administered are provided at Annexure. The allocation of vaccines to States & UTs is done on the basis of pro-rata target population, the progress of vaccination in the State/UTs and vaccine wastage.Funding support is also provided to States/UTs through various avenues like National Health Mission, State Disaster Response Funds (SDRF) and Emergency COVID-19 Response and Preparedness (ECRP) packages.Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science & Technology under Mission COVID Suraksha has provided financial support to vaccine manufacturing facilities for enhanced production capacities.
