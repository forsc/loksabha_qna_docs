ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER FOR CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS (SHRI D. V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a) :During project phase in 2014-15 & 2015-16, the amount spent on CSR by Brahmaputra Cracker and Polymer Limited (BCPL), a Petrochemical PSU under Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals, was Rs. 90,07,190/- and Rs. 98,27,000/- respectively in the state of Assam. The plant was commissioned and came into operation in the month of January 2016. Since Profit After Tax (PAT) of the company has been negative, the company did not undertake any CSR project during 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19.However During 2018-19, an amount of Rs. 52 Lakhs was spent for various developmental initiative in and around BCPL installations in Assam through district administration with the approval of the Board of BCPL, as a goodwill gesture.(b) & (c):(i) BCPL under administrative control of Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals is not undertaking any CSR initiatives in 2019-20 as PAT for the first quarter were negative.(ii) There are also three Chemical PSUs under the administrative control of Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals viz. HIL (India) Ltd. (HIL), Hindustan Organic Chemicals Ltd. (HOCL) and Hindustan Fluorocarbons Ltd. (HFL; subsidiary company of HOCL).Though HIL is a profit making company, it is not required to spend funds on CSR as the company’s net worth/turnover/net profit does not fall under the CSR criteria laid down in the Companies Act, 2013. However, HIL has been incurring expenditure on CSR related activities like supply of drinking water to households, providing uniform and books/stationery for students of Govt. school, construction of girl’s toilets in village school, etc. in the vicinity of the company’s manufacturing units. Similar activities will be carried out by the company in the current FY 2019-20 also.Since HFL is a loss making company and its average profit before tax for the last 3 years is negative (loss), it is not required to make provision for CSR funds as per the Companies Act, 2013. However, towards social welfare activities the company is sponsoring Vidya Volunteers (teachers) in the schools and constructed toilets in the villages near its plant site.HOCL has been making losses continuously since 2011-12 and has made profit only in 2018-19 after implementation of restructuring plan of the company. As the average profit before tax for the last 3 years of the company is negative (loss), it is not required to make provision for CSR funds as per the Companies Act, 2013. As such, no development work under CSR funds are being undertaken by the company.(iii) The details of actual CSR expenditure during the year 2018-19 vis-à-vis proposed CSR fund allocation during the year 2019-20 with respect to the PSUs under Department of Fertilizers are as below:-(Rs. in Lakh)S.
