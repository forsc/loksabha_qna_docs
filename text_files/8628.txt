ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) to (d): 	The Income Tax Department (ITD) conducts suitable actions as per law in relevant cases, where any credible information is received about violation of provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961.  There is no mention of the term ‘raid’, in the Income-tax Act, 1961. However, the ITD has recently carried out survey operations on several traders indulging in onion trade in the State of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi on the basis of information that these traders are indulging in manipulation of onion prices and cash transactions, leading to generation of unaccounted income.A preliminary outcome of such operations revealed that most of these traders were indulging in various malpractices which, inter-alia, includes: suppression of turnover, having unaccounted stock, manipulation of books of accounts, cash sales, violation of the provisions related to restriction on cash transactions like section 40A (3) and section 269SS & 269T of the Income tax Act, 1961. Further, disclosure of information regarding specific taxpayers is prohibited except as provided under section 138 of Income tax Act, 1961.********
