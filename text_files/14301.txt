ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): Details of the passenger growth as submitted by the Scheduled Indian Carriers to Directorate General of Civil Aviation for November 2019 are attached as annexure-I.;;The airlines have been continuously inducting aircraft to support the traffic growth in the country.  The Available Seat Kilometer (ASKM) and Revenue Passenger Kilometer (RPKM) in Scheduled domestic services by Indian airlines for last three years is attached as annexure-II.;;Due to suspension of operation by M/s Jet Airways (India) Limited, there was a reduction in capacity in the domestic sectors for some time. However, to mitigate the impact of reduction in capacity, the domestic slots vacated by Jet Airways, starting from April 2019 have been allocated on ad-hoc basis to other Indian carriers. Subsequently, some of the domestic airlines started inducting more aircraft in their fleet which resulted in capacity increase on the domestic sectors. However, as per information made available by Scheduled Indian Carriers, details regarding the year on year growth in the numbers of air passengers carried by Indian Scheduled airlines in Scheduled domestic services is attached as annexure-III.
