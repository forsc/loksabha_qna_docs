                                                        MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D.V. SADANANADA GOWDA)(a):	The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare publishes the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM), which are incorporated in the Schedule -I of the Drugs (Price Control) Order. There is no separate categorization in NLEM about life-saving drugs. National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) under the Department of Pharmaceuticals fixes the ceiling price of scheduled formulations as per the provisions of the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO, 2013). The Schedule I of DPCO, 2013 was last amended by adopting NLEM, 2015 consisting of 377 medicines. NPPA has fixed the ceiling prices of 881 scheduled formulations of medicines under NLEM, 2015. The details of price fixed are available on NPPA’s website,  www.nppaindia.nic.in.(b) to (d):	The Standing National Committee on Medicines (SNCM) has been constituted by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare on 03.07.2018 to review and revise the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM), 2015 by way of additions and deletions in existing NLEM. The NLEM revision process consists of consultative mechanism of subject experts from throughout the country and other important stakeholders. Amongst others, the Committee will suggest inclusion of Medical Devices, medical disposables, medical consumables and other products used for health and hygiene of general public in NLEM. The Committee is deliberating the matter to submit its report. (e) & (f):	The health benefits packages defined under Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri – Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) are comprehensive, covering treatment for 25 specialties that include super specialty care like oncology, neurosurgery and cardio-thoracic surgery etc. The health benefits package rate (in case of medical surgical) or defined day-care benefits includes the costs of medicines and drugs from 3 days prior to hospitalization and 15 days post discharge from the hospital. The treatment under AB PM-JAY is provided as per the Standard Treatment Guidelines (if available) and professional judgement of the healthcare provider.However, there is no proposal with the National Health Authority regarding linking of essential medicines with AB PM-JAY.*******
