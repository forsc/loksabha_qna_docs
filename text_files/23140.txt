This is in line with the National Education Policy 2020 which envisages imparting programmes in higher education, using mother tongue/local language as a medium of instruction, and/or offer programmes bilingually, in order to increase access and Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) and also to promote the strength, usage, and vibrancy of all Indian languages.  Drawing upon the NEP 2020the Ministry of Education has constituted a Task Force, for suggesting modalities for imparting technical education in regional languages, with the objective to nurture the talent among students who have pursued their education in local language for their smooth transition into technical education.*****
