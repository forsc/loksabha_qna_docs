ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a): As per National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020), implementation of the Policy requires multiple initiatives and actions, which will have to be taken by different bodies in a synchronized and systematic manner. Accordingly, Ministry of Education, its implementing agencies, regulatory bodies, State/UT Governments, other stakeholder Ministries/Departments, etc. have started taking initiatives towards implementation of NEP 2020.(b) and (c): One of the fundamental principles of NEP, 2020 that will guide both the education system at large, as well as individual institutions is substantial investment in a strong, vibrant public education system as well as the encouragement and facilitation of true philanthropic private and community participation.As part of a holistic education, secondary schools will also collaborate with ITIs, polytechnics, local industry, etc for vocationalisation. Skill labs will also be set up and created in the schools in a hub and spoke model which will allow other schools to use the facility. Further, students at all HEIs will be provided with opportunities for internships with local industry, businesses, artists, crafts persons, etc., as well as research internships with faculty and researchers at their own or other HEIs/research institutions, so that students may actively engage with the practical side of their learning and, as a by-product, further improve their employability. NEP 2020 provides for HEIs to focus on research and innovation by setting up start-up incubation centres; technology development centres; centres in frontier areas of research; greater industry-academic linkages; and interdisciplinary research including humanities and social sciences research.*******
