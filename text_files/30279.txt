ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI (SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a) to (d) A statement is laid on the table of the House. Statement referred in reply of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 168 to be answered on 09.12.2021(a) to (d) Since August 2019, Government of India in partnership with States, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), a centrally sponsored programme, to make provision of potable tap water supply to every rural household of the country by 2024.For targeted delivery and monitoring of specific outcomes of JJM, provisions have been made for linking of every tap water connection provided to the household with the Aadhar of the head of the household in pursuance of section 7 of the Aadhar (Targeted Delivery of Finance and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 (18 of 2016) subject to statutory provisions. However, in the case of non-availability of Aadhar in respect of the beneficiary, tap water connection is being provided by producing the following documents, namely:A.	if he has enrolled, his Aadhaar Enrolment Identification slip; andB.	any one of the following documents, namely:i.)	Bank or Post office Passbook with Photo; orii.)	Permanent Account Number (PAN) Card; oriii.)	Passport; oriv.)	Ration Card; orv.)	Voter Identity Card; orvi.)	MGNREGA Card; orvii.)	Kisan Photo passbook; orviii.)	Driving license issued by the Licensing Authority under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (59 of 1988); orix.)	Certificate of identity having photo of such person issued by a Gazetted Officer or a Tehsildar on an official letter head; orx.)	any other document as specified by the Implementing Agency State Governments and Union Territory Administrations;As informed by Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), Biometric based Aadhaar online authentication success is a factor of quality of finger print, network connectivity, placement of finger etc., which can be further improved by use of iris device. Alternatively, UIDAI provides offline modes of verification which are not dependent on network connectivity or quality of biometrics and can be achieved by simply showing physical Aadhaar, e-Aadhaar, m-Aadhaar or sharing offline XML.Further, in all cases, where Aadhaar authentication fails due to poor biometrics of the beneficiaries or due to any other reasons, following remedial mechanisms have been provisioned as per S.O. 852(E) dated 24.02.2020:i.)	In case of poor fingerprint quality, Iris scan or face authentication facility shall be adopted for authentication, thereby the Implementing Agency shall make provisions for Integrated Risk Information System scanners or face authentication along with finger print authentication for delivery of benefits in seamless manner;ii.)	In case the biometric authentication through fingerprints or Iris scan or face authentication is not successful, wherever feasible and admissible authentication by Aadhaar One Time Password or Time-based One-Time Password with limited time validity, as the case may be, shall be offered;iii.)	In all other cases where biometric or Aadhaar One Time Password or Time-based One-Time Password authentication is not possible, benefits under the Scheme may be given on the basis of physical Aadhaar letter whose authenticity can be verified through the Quick Response code printed on the Aadhaar letter and the necessary arrangement of Quick Response code reader shall be provided at the convenient locations by Implementing Agency.Moreover, Section 4(6) of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 provides for informing the Aadhaar number holder of alternate and viable means of identification and shall not deny service to him on this ground.*****
