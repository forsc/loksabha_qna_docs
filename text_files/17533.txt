ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a) :	As per Unified District Information System for Education plus (UDISE+), 2018-19 the Gender Parity Index (GPI) at various level of Education is as under:<pre>Particular	Primary 	Upper Primary 	Secondary  	Higher SecondaryGPI	1.03	1.12	1.04	1.04 (UDISE+ 2018-19 is provisional)</pre>GPI at various levels reflects equitable participation of girls in the School system.  	Department of School Education and Literacy, Ministry of Education is implementing an Integrated Scheme for School Education namely Samagra Shiksha. Bridging Social and Gender Gaps in School Education continues to be one of the major objectives of Samagra Shiksha.  In order to ensure greater participation of girls in education, under Samagra Shiksha,  various interventions  have been targeted for girls which include opening of schools in the neighbourhood as defined by the State, provision of free text-books to girls up to Class VIII, uniforms to all girls up to class VIII, provision of gender segregated toilets in all schools, teachers’ sensitization programmes to promote girls’ participation,  provision for Self-Defence training for the girls from classes VI to XII,  stipend to CWSN girls from class I to Class XII, construction  of  residential  quarters  for  teachers  in  remote/hilly  areas/in areas with difficult terrain.   Moreover, Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBVs) have been sanctioned in Educationally Backward Blocks of the country where the female rural literacy rate is below the national average.  KGBVs are residential schools from class VI to XII for girls belonging to disadvantaged groups such as SC, ST, OBC, Minority and Below Poverty Line (BPL). The objective behind establishing KGBVs is to ensure access and quality education to girls from disadvantaged groups by setting up residential schools and to reduce gender gaps at all levels of school education. Some of the non-negotiable operational aspects of KGBV are:-<pre>•	Deputing sensitive and trained women wardens, teachers and staff;•	Boundary Wall ;•	Posting of watchman for 24 hours;•	Restricted entry of male members in the dormitories;•	Self defence training;•	Good quality and nutritious food;•	Bedding (replacement after every three years); •	Medical care etc. </pre>   Under Samagra Shiksha, State specific projects for varied interventions under equity, including menstrual health and hygiene, are emphasized for enhancing access, retention and quality by promoting enrolment drives, retention and motivation camps, gender sensitization modules etc.*****
