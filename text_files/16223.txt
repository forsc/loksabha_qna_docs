ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) Tax authorities of Centre and States can access the e-way bill portal developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) and view real-time data. Further, NIC has started sharing e-way bill data on near real time basis (with a gap of about 30 minutes in pulling real time data) to those States which make such requests. Presently, Uttar Pradesh and Kerala are pulling the near real time data using Application Program Interface (API). The e-way bills contain relevant details of GST invoices also.(b) & (c) Yes Sir. With access to real time e-way bill data and invoice details, it has become possible to detect cases of fraudulent activities and irregularities under GST much before returns are filed.(d) & (e) Various measures have been undertaken to reduce fraud cases under GST. Based on the recommendations of the GST Council, rule 138E has been inserted to the Central Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017 which restricts generation of e-way bill by those taxpayers who have not furnished returns for a consecutive period of two months. Vide notification No. 36/2019 – Central Tax dated 20.08.2019. It would curb fraudulent activities under GST by identifying those cases where there is a mismatch between the information furnished in return vis-à-vis the e-way bill.
