Some of the measures taken in this regard are as under:   1.	 Use of Unmanned Aircraft System (Drones) is being promoted for various uses, such as agriculture, aerial survelliance, land mapping and survey, monitoring of oil pipelines and electric transmission lines, mining etc.;   2.

Advanced Surface Movement and Guidance Control System (ASMGCS) have been installed at airports to support flight operation during poor visibility conditions. Two more ASMGCS are being procured for Bhubaneswar and Cochin airports.   4.	 AAI   has established Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast ( ADS-B)    based Approach Surveillance Services to avoid delay of flights due to congestion in terminal airspace at 7 airports.

Airport Collaborative Decision Making (ACDM) system has been deployed at Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Guwahati and Trivandrum Airports. The ACDM system enables optimal use of runway and facilitates an efficient departure sequence of air traffic with least average delay.    7. In order to identify, adopt and implement new technologies in Communication, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM), AAI is developing a comprehensive modernization roadmap for implementation of CNS/ATM technologies.
