Under corresponding component schemes of PMKSY, MoFPI provides credit linked financial assistance (capital subsidy) in the form of Grants-in-Aid to entrepreneurs for setting up of Mega Food Parks and  Agro Processing Clusters. Also, a Special Food Processing Fund of Rs. 2000 crore was set up with NABARD in November 2014 to provide affordable credit for investments in setting up Mega Food Parks as well as processing units in the MFPs. In 2019, the coverage of the fund was extended to setting up of Agro Processing Clusters and individual manufacturing units within them. The status of Mega Food Parks and Agro Processing Clusters, assisted under PMKSY in Bihar, is placed at Annexure.*****
