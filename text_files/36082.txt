Further, as per the obligations and provisions of the Act, inter-alia it is the responsibility of the States/UTs to identify maximum eligible beneficiaries/households as per criteria evolved by them for the inclusion and exclusion of beneficiaries under the Act and issue NFSA ration cards to the persons/households identified up to their respective ceiling limits of NFSA coverage. The Department in the past had also advised the States/UTs from time to time to identify and cover maximum eligible and left out persons, which may also include the vulnerable sections of the society such as homeless, shelterless persons, destitute women, etc. who might be genuinely eligible under NFSA but not having ration cards so far. States/UTs were also advised to organize special drives, camps, etc. to facilitate the identification and inclusion of maximum eligible and vulnerable persons under NFSA within their respective NFSA coverage limits.*****
