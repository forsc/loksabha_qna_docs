                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a)&(b)	The Union Cabinet on 23.10.2019 approved the revival plan for Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) which inter-alia includes reduction in employee cost through Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) for employees of age 50 years and above.VRS was implemented all over India in BSNL including Kerala with effect from 31.01.2020. Total 78,569 employees in BSNL including around 4593 employees in Kerala have retired voluntarily.(c) & (d)	Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has laid down benchmarks for various Quality of Service (QoS) parameters including call drops by way of QoS regulations issued from time to time. TRAI monitors the performance of Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) including BSNL against the benchmarks through Quarterly Performance Monitoring Reports (PMRs). TSPs in India are required to ensure that the call-drop rate in their mobile networks remains within the benchmarks laid down by TRAI.Wherever the benchmark is not met by TSPs, the explanation of the service provider is called for and after considering the explanation submitted by service providers in this regard, TRAI imposes financial disincentives for non-compliance with the benchmark.BSNL has informed that it is meeting majority of the QoS parameters fixed by TRAI for both Landline and Mobile subscribers in almost all the Circles.The steps taken by BSNL for improving its mobile services are as follows:i) 	It regularly conducts Drive tests/ Inter Circle Network audit/ surprise checks and optimizes its network for improving its Services.ii)	It is augmenting its Mobile Network progressively by carrying out expansion of Mobile Network in various phases to enhance coverage/ capacity of Mobile network depending on techno-commercial viability and availability of funds.iii)	It continuously monitors the Call drop related problem in its network for better performance.(e) & (f)	No Sir.
