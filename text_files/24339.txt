                                                        MINISTER OF TOURISM 			        (SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) and (b):	Yes, Sir.  The tourism industry has been severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Ministry of Tourism has engaged National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) in January, 2021 to conduct study on India and the Coronavirus Pandemic: Economic Losses for Households Engaged in Tourism and Policies for Recovery. As per the results of the study:•	Due to overall economic slowdown during 2020-21, tourism economy or tourism direct gross value added (TDGVA) saw a fall of 42.8 percent in Q1; 15.5 percent in Q2 and fall of 1.1 percent in Q3.•	Due to significant drop in tourist arrivals and hence tourism expenditure, during the pandemic, it is estimated that TDGVA plummeted by as much as 93.3 percent in Q1 of 2020-21 over its level in the same quarter of previous year. It picked up slightly to post a fall of 79.5 percent in Q2 and that of 64.3 percent in Q3.•	A significant number of jobs were lost in the tourism sector once the lockdown was implemented.  14.5 million Jobs during Q1, 5.2 million during Q2 and 1.8 million jobs during Q3 are expected to have been lost as compared to estimated 34.8 million jobs in the pre-pandemic period of 2019-20. (Direct jobs)Representations for financial relief received from industry stakeholders and State Governments have been taken up with the Ministry of Finance. The initiatives taken by the Ministry of Tourism and relief measures announced under the Atmanirbhar Bharat package are at Annexure-I.(c) to (e):	Development of tourism is primarily the responsibility of the concerned State/UTs. However, Ministry of Tourism provides financial assistance under the schemes of ‘Swadesh Darshan’ and ‘National Mission on Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual, Heritage Augmentation Drive (PRASHAD)’ for development of tourism infrastructure in the country. Submission of project proposals by the State Government/UTs and its sanctioning is a continuous process. The projects are sanctioned subject to availability of funds, submission of suitable Detailed Project Reports, adherence to scheme guidelines and utilization of funds released earlier. The details of the projects sanctioned under Swadesh Darshan and PRASHAD scheme including those in Chhattisgarh are given at Annexure-II.******
