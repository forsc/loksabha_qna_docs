ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) To fulfill the mandatory requirements for flying of civil drones, an online portal by the name of Digital Sky has been developed. A preliminary version of the Digital Sky platform has been made effective from 01.12.2018. The operator of the drone has to register each drone on the Digital Sky portal. On completion of the online registration process, a Unique Identification Number (UIN) is imparted to the drone. The UIN is the identity to track the drone. Before operating a drone flight, the flight path of each drone has to be entered into the Digital Sky.  Approval for the flight path of the drone is given by the air traffic control on the Digital Sky platform. Post flight log of the drone flight are available on the Digital Sky. The Digital Sky System provides identification and tracking of each drone.(b) The regulations prescribe checks/ procedures for overseeing details of use, purchase and selling of drones. Safety and security requirements for Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) are also provided in the regulations. The Digital Sky with its features of drone flight incident reporting enables tracking of civil drones. The system can therefore determine accountability in case of an accident.;(c) An amount of Rs. 46.26 crore has been approved in principle for the Digital Sky platform.(d) The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has launched the preliminary version of the Digital Sky platform.The Digital Sky platform, inter-alia, includes features of registration of RPAS, issuance of RPAS operator permit, flight path approvals, tracking of RPAS flights and post flight data analysis. The DGCA thus keeps track of the registered civil RPAS.;
