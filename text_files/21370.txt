ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a)	No, Sir.  Department has no regulation to cover the Gramin Dak Sevaks (GDSs) under Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) and Employee State Insurance (ESI). The GDSs are holders of a civil post but outside the regular civil service. Hence, they cannot be treated as regular employees. In a civil APPEAL No. 3050 and 3151 OF 2019 of Gurusewak Singh and Others Hon’ble Supreme Court has observed that a GDS is not an employee under the Gratuity Act, 1972. Work done by GDS is part time in nature and for this work, they are paid Time Related Continuity Allowance (TRCA). In addition, it is imperative for every GDS to have alternate means of livelihood prior to their engagement. (b)	The details of welfare schemes extended by the Government to GDSs are enclosed in Annexure-I.(c)	The maximum working hours for GDSs has been restricted to  five hours a day as the  work of GDS is part time in nature and for this work, they are being paid TRCA. It is imperative for every GDS to have alternate means of livelihood before they are considered for engagement.(d) 	No, Sir. (e)	No, Sir. The Gramin Dak Sevaks work for a minimum of four hours and maximum five hours a day. This work is part time in nature and for this work, they are being paid Time Related Continuity Allowance. In addition, it is imperative for every GDS to have alternate means of livelihood for their engagement. Moreover, the Hon’ble  Supreme Court in the Judgement pronounced in 1977, held that though the Gramin Dak Sevaks are holders of civil posts, but they are outside the regular civil service. Recently, in a  common order dated 17.11.2016 of Hon’ble  CAT Principle Bench Delhi in OAs No. 749/2015, 3540/2015 & 613/2015 filed by GDS, the Hon’ble  CAT rejected the claim of GDS for parity with regular civil servant. Promotional Avenues : -(1)	Gramin Dak Sevaks are considered for absorption as multi-tasking staff in 50% of vacancies on seniority cum fitness basis and 25 % by Competitive Examination.(2)	Gramin Dak Sevaks upto the age of 50 years are considered for recruitment for 50% of vacancies of Postman cadre and 25% of vacancies of Mail Guard cadre by way of Competitive Examination.(3)	Unfilled vacancies of Postal Assistants out of the promotion quota are offered to Gramin Dak Sevaks subject to fulfillment of educational qualification, age, etc. and they qualifying successfully in the aptitude test.
