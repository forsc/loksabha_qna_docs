ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) to (d):	‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India.  However, the Government attaches highest importance to reporting and investigation of crimes, especially in the matter of crimes against women and weaker sections. In order to facilitate complainants, including women and weaker sections, to register FIR the Government has taken the following steps:-2-L.S.US.Q.NO.3797 FOR 16.07.2019i.	Criminal Law has been amended in 2013 to make it mandatory for police to register FIR in case of rape and sexual assault on women.ii.	The Criminal Law was further amended in 2018, which has the provision for investigation to be completed in two months by police in case of rape of women.iii.	The Scheduled Caste and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 has been amended to provide that in case of a complaint on crime against SC/ST, the preliminary enquiry shall not be required for registration of an FIR.iv.	The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has issued advisories to States/UTs on compulsory registration of FIRs. Further, in order to ensure that the police register FIR for cases when they receive a call/complaint related to a crime committed outside the jurisdiction of the police station concerned, States/UTs have been advised to instruct police to register ‘Zero FIR’. MHA has issued advisory reiterating States/UTs for mandatorily registration of FIR in sexual assault cases on women and also requesting States/UTs for completion of such investigation in 2 months.v.	Ministry of Home Affairs has issued an advisory dated 26.09.2018 to all   States/ UTs  to  comply  with  the   amended   provisions  in  the -3-L.S.US.Q.NO.3797 FOR 16.07.2019Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.vi.	Ministry of Women and Child Development has also introduced the scheme of One Stop Centres to provide integrated support and assistance to women affected by violence and a Scheme for Universalisation of Women Helpline to provide 24 hours emergency and non-emergency response to women affected by violence. Apart from above, the Ministry of Women and Child Development in collaboration with the Ministry of Home Affairs has envisaged engagement of Mahila Police Volunteers in States/UTs who will act as a link between police and community and facilitate women in distress. vii.	Further, Government of India conducts awareness generation programmes and publicity campaigns on various laws relating to women and their rights through workshops, cultural programmes, seminars, training programmes, advertisements in print and electronic media etc.*********
