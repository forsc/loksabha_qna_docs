The Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying is implementing Centrally Sponsored Scheme Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) for development and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds since December 2014. Under the Scheme, several scientific technologies have been made accessible to the farmers such as sex sorted semen (for production of female calves with 90% accuracy), IVF technology for production of animals with high genetic merit at a faster rate and genomic selection. The scheme is important in enhancing milk production and productivity of bovines and to meet growing demand of milk and making dairying more remunerative to the rural farmers of the country. The scheme is leading to multiplication of elite animals of indigenous breeds and increased availability of indigenous stock.\		The Department is implementing National Programme for Dairy Development (NPDD) across the country since Feb-2014 with an objective of creating/strengthening of infrastructure for production of quality milk, procurement, processing and marketing of milk & milk products by the State Implementing Agency (SIA) i.e. State Cooperative Dairy Federations/ District Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union. This year, the scheme has been restructured and from 2021-22 to 2025-26 the focus will be on quality improvement with installation of bulk milk coolers and strengthening of milk testing facilities for State Cooperative Dairy Federations/ District Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union/SHG run private dairy/Milk Producer Companies/Farmer Producer Organisations.		The Central Sector Scheme Supporting Dairy Cooperatives and Farmer Producer Organizations engaged in dairy activities (SDCFPO) was launched during 2017-18. The scheme is being implemented by National Dairy Development Board (NDDB). Main objective of the scheme is to assist the Cooperative Societies and farmer producer organizations engaged in dairy activities by providing soft working capital loan to tide over the crisis on account of severely adverse market conditions or natural calamities. Due to Economic Impact of Covid-19 on Dairy Sector, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying has introduced a new component “interest subvention on Working capital loans for Dairy sector” as one of the component with an outlay of Rs 20 Crore for 2020-21. Temporarily, the other component namely “working Capital loan” was kept in suspension during 2020-21. As on 02.07.2021, NDDB have conveyed sanction of Interest Subvention amount of Rs 150.58 Crore against working capital loan amount of Rs 10588.64 Crore @ 2% p.a. and released Rs 71.63 Crore as interest subvention amount.

GoI provide 2.5% interest subvention to National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). As on 31.05.2021 40 projects in 11 states has been approved with total outlay of Rs 4957 Crore. Out of this amount loan component is Rs. 3381 Crore. Till 30.5.2021, Rs.1157 Crore. Loan has been disbursed to End Borrowers and Interest subvention released by GoI to NABARD is Rs. 54.59 Crore.

The programme aims to control FMD and Brucellosis by 2025 with vaccination and eventual eradication of FMD by 2030. The FMD results in a reduction of milk production which is a direct loss to the farmers. So far around 17 crores of cattle and buffalo has been vaccinated against FMD in the country.		Poultry sector in India is divided into highly organized commercial sector. 80 % of the total market share is organized commercial sector and the rest is unorganized. The organized commercial sector contributing 80 % is already modernized and technically improvised. However, Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying, is implementing “Entrepreneurship development and employment generation” (EDEG) under NLM Under which, a component called, Poultry Venture Capital fund (PVCF) for which includes credit cum subsidy linked activities is implemented through NABARD. Under this component establishment of composite Backyard Poultry unit having parent farm, mother unit and Hatchery unit can be established.		Further, to increase the Poultry production under National Livestock Mission financial assistance is provided to States/ Union Territories Governments for implementation of Rural Backyard Poultry Development (RBPD) and Innovative Poultry Productivity Project (IPPP). These programmes envisage the components which take care of the shelter, feed, medicine, equipments, litter etc. to improve the living conditions of the Poultry birds.
