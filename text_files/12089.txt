ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER FOR MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND MINISTRY OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a)	Latest studies show an increase in temperatures as well as occurrence of Heat Waves in many parts of country during the recent years. One of the reasons for the increase in heat waves is global warming associated with the increase in greenhouse gasses like Carbon dioxide, Methane etc. in the atmosphere.In India, rise in maximum temperatures as well as Heat Waves are found to be more in the months of April, May & June. Core Heat-wave Zone (CHZ) is the most prone area for Heat Wave (HW) & Severe Heat Wave (SHW) with highest frequency of occurrence during the month of May. The CHZ covers States of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The Heat Wave events happened during last three years, viz. 2017, 2018 & 2019 are given in the table below: States	Heat Wave eventsYear 2017Andhra Pradesh	1Jharkhand	2Maharashtra	6Odisha	8Telangana	12West Bengal	1Year 2018Uttar Pradesh	2Maharashtra	5Jharkhand	1Kerala	3Chattisgarh	1Year 2019Maharashtra	15Kerala	6Bihar	4Rajasthan	1(b) 	India Meteorological Department (IMD) uses temperature data from surface observatories to track heat waves. IMD also uses various numerical weather prediction models to track and predict occurrence and intensity of Heat Waves.In India the latest criteria used for defining the HW are based on the climatological values for the period of 1971–2000 and are given below:Criteria for declaring heat wave based on maximum temperature (Tmax):Heat wave over a station is declared only when the actual Tmaxof the station is 40°C for plains and 30°C for Hilly regions. However, when the Tmax is 40°C for coastal stations and 45°C for other stations, conditions are declared as heat wave.The following criteria are used for defining severity of the heat wave:When normal Tmax   is less than or equal to 40°C andi.  ActualTmax is greater than  Normal Tmax  by  5°C / 6°C:  heat waveii.  ActualTmax  is greater than  Normal Tmax  by  7°C:  severe heat waveWhen normal Tmax is greater than 40°C andi.  ActualTmax is greater than  Normal Tmax  by  4°C / 5°C: heat waveii. Actual Tmax is greater than  Normal Tmax  by  6°C: severe heat waveNote: Normal Tmax – Average maximum temperature of the day.		Actual Tmax – observed  maximum temperature of the day.Criteria for Hot dayWhenever, the maximum temperature remains 40ºC or more and minimum temperature is 4.5ºC or more above normal, it may be defined as Hot Day, provided it is not satisfying the heat wave criteria given above. (c) 	A large section of mostly daily wage labourers and others engaged in outdoor work and/ or exposed to indoor heat in Indian cities are more likely to be affected by heat waves. In addition to cities and villages, specific industrial operations (e.g., mining, thermal power, furnace, refineries) emit as well as absorb considerable heat. With the majority of workplace settings in developing countries being heavily influenced by outdoor temperatures, it can be expected that both indoor and outdoor workers will experience increased heat stress. Even relatively modest increase in ambient temperatures could be expected to tip large worker populations over the threshold into the realm of heat stress related health risks and thereby impact the productivity. Four Common heat health impacts resulting from excessive exposure to heat waves include dehydration, cramps, exhaustion and heatstroke. It is also learnt that there is a sharp rise in number of cases of acute gastroenteritis and food poisoning due to spoilage of food and reduction of its shelf life due to high temperatures. There is also rise in number of cases of anxiety, palpitations, nervousness and behavioural change linked to extreme temperature rise. The occupational profile of most of the victims was ascertained as agricultural labourers, coastal community dwellers, and people living below poverty line (BPL) category with mostly outdoor occupations.Taking these onto notice, Government has adapted Heat Action Plan in different States to tackle the impact of Heat Waves.Heat Action Plan is a comprehensive early warning system and preparedness plan for extreme heat events. The Plan presents immediate as well as long-term actions to increase preparedness, information-sharing, and response coordination to reduce the health impacts of extreme heat on vulnerable populations. IMD in collaboration with local health departments has started preparing/implementing Heat Action Plan in many parts of the country to forewarn about the heat waves and also advising action to be taken during such occasions. Heat action plan became operational in the year 2013.
