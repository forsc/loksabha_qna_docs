DRDO follows the Merit based Flexible Complementing Scheme (FCS) for Defence Research Development Services (DRDS) Cadre, where promotions are based purely on merit without any linkage to availability of vacancies or seniority.

The Incentives upto 06 Variable increments to Scientists, Professional Update Allowance are applicable to all the three organizations and derive their authority from the common letters issued by Ministry of Finance for three strategic departments.DRDO has been requesting for PRIS (O)-Organizational (20%) and PRIS (G)-Group (10%) two components of Performance Related Incentive Scheme (PRIS) available to other strategic scientific organizations namely DAE and DOS, but not to DRDO.*****
