State-wise cumulative rainfall during 01.06.2021 to 04.08.2021 for the States/Union Territories under North-West Region is given at Annexure-I. 	In the eventuality of drought and other natural calamities, the State Governments are empowered to initiate necessary relief measures from State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) which is readily available with them. Additional financial assistance, over and above SDRF, is considered from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) on receipt of Memorandum from State Governments and in accordance with extant norms and procedures.	The Government of India has released the 1st installment of its share under SDRF to the States for the financial year 2021-22, as per the details given at Annexure-II. 	No State has submitted any Memorandum seeking financial assistance from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) during Kharif 2021 season.(c) to (e): 	Advisories have been issued to all States/Union Territories before the onset of Monsoon 2021 season for reviewing the States’ preparedness in managing any weather related contingency for mitigating the adverse impacts of an aberrant monsoon. They have been advised to update/fine-tune the District Agriculture Contingency Plans; to tie-up the availability of seeds and other inputs for implementing the Contingency Plans; to construct water harvesting structures; to promote agronomic practices for conservation of moisture; to promote cultivation of less water consuming crops by crop diversification;  to restore irrigation infrastructure; to review the progress of preparation & implementation of District Irrigation Plans/repair of hand-pumps & drinking water projects; and  Establishment and activation of Drought Monitoring Centre at the State Headquarters. Progress of Monsoon and Area coverage etc. are monitored weekly through Weather Watch Group meetings as well as video conferencing, advising the States to take steps according to the prevailing situation.
