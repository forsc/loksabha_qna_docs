The existing laws are adequate for protection of citizens including journalists. Also the Press Council of India takes appropriate action on receipt of specific complaints from affected journalist. Representations on providing security are received from or on behalf of individuals, including journalists. All such representations are examined and based on inputs received regarding threat assessment, required action is taken. There is no mechanism/requirement to segregate the request protectees according to profession of the individuals. Central Government attaches highest importance to prevention of crime. An advisory on safety of journalists has been issued to States/UTs on 20th October, 2017 which is available at the Ministry of Home Affairs’ website viz. www.mha.gov.in.(d) to (e) : No such proposal is under consideration at present.  *****
