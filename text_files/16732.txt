ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	to   (e):   About one fourth of India’s  total imports  are under the ''Others'' category of Indian Trade Classification (Harmonized System) [ITC (HS)], 2017, Schedule – I (Import Policy). Accordingly,  Government has initiated a review of the imports under ''Others'' category and advised Trade and Industry to accurately  mention the specific ITC (HS) code of the item sought to be imported while filing the Bill of Entry.  In addition to efforts being made by the Government, trade  advisories were issued requesting  importers to propose separate new  ITC (HS) codes where no  such codes exists for a specific item. As part of this initiative, the  Finance (No.2) Act, 2019 dated 1st August, 2019  created new specific ITC (HS) codes for a number of items, which were earlier in the ''Others'' category. Matters related to  mis – classification of  export-import items are dealt with by the Customs Authorities under the relevant provisions of law. *****
