                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d) Yes, Sir. Updating survey for doubling between Bibinagar-Nallapadu stations (246.50 km) has been completed in 2017-18. Pagidipalli-Guntur line is part of this survey as proposed doubling was to take off from Pagidipalli. Doubling projects are taken up as per operational requirement of Railways. A number of capacity enhancement works like Kukkadam & Rayanaguda crossing stations, Bommaipalli (Crossing station with standard lay-out), Ramannapet (Standard layout) etc have been taken up in this section. The line capacity utilization of the section was assessed between 69% to 82% and the project was not taken forward as there was no immediate operational requirements at that time.Now, as per the anticipated operational requirement, doubling of Guntur-Pagidipalli-Bibinagar (248 km) has been approved for inclusion against Umbrella work of 2019-20 subject to requisite Government approvals. Final location survey has been taken up. Further consideration of this proposal is possible once Detailed Project report becomes available and results thereon are firmed up.*****
