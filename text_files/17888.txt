(available at the link: https://www.meity.gov.in/esdm/pli)(b): Under the PLI Scheme, cumulative investment of approximately INR 11,000 crore is projected over 5 years.(c): As a result of the aforesaid PLI Scheme, the Domestic Value Addition is expected to grow from the current 15% - 20% to 35 - 40% in case of Mobile Phones and from 35%- 40% to 45% - 50% for electronic components. (d): The Government has not proposed to ban the import of electronic equipment and parts thereof from China.(e): Steps are being taken to broad-base the sources of electronic components / raw material imports in India while promoting domestic electronics production at the same time, in order to reduce dependency on a single market / geographical region, so that any sudden / abrupt / unforeseen event such as the COVID-19 outbreak in China does not cause large-scale shortage of inventory in the domestic market. To promote domestic electronics manufacturing, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has launched three new schemes, viz., Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing, Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) and Modified Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC 2.0) Scheme, on April 1, 2020, to attract and incentivize large investments in the electronics value chain and promote domestic value addition and exports. Further, alternate supply lines are also being explored in coordination with Indian Embassies, Industry Associations and domestic Industry. Electronics industry is also being encouraged to take advantage of the aforementioned new schemes to strengthen the domestic electronics sector. ********

There has been a substantial growth in e-payments by Government and also in digital infrastructure in terms of mobile networks. The report, however, notes that India is required to take further efforts to bring down the volume of paper clearing and increase acceptance infrastructure to enhance digital payments.(e) and (f): The government has undertaken the following measures to enhance the cyber security posture of digital payment systems in the country:Steps taken by CERT-In (Indian Computer Emergency Response Team):i.	CERT-In issues alerts and advisories regarding latest cyber threats and countermeasures on regular basis to ensure safe usage of digital technologies. Regarding securing digital payments, 37 advisories have been issued for users and institutions. ii.	All authorised entities/ banks issuing PPIs in the country have been advised by CERT-In through Reserve Bank of India to carry out special audit by empanelled auditors of CERT-In on a priority basis and to take immediate steps thereafter to comply with the findings of the audit report and ensure implementation of security best practices.iii.	Government has issued guidelines for Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) regarding their key roles and responsibilities for securing applications / infrastructure and compliance.iv.	All the Government websites and applications are required to be audited with respect to cyber security prior to their hosting.

Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY) conduct programmes to generate information security awareness. Specific books, videos and online materials are developed for children, parents and general users about information security that are disseminated through Portals like “www.infosecawareness.in”, and “www.cyberswachhtakendra.gov.in”.Steps taken by RBI (Reserve Bank of India):xi.	RBI has set up a Cyber Security and IT Examination (CSITE) Cell within its Department of Supervision in 2015. A comprehensive circular on Cyber Security Framework in Banks issued on June 2, 2016 covers best practices pertaining to various aspects of cyber security.xii.	RBI has also set up a Cyber Crisis Management Group to address any major incidents reported including suggesting ways to respond.   RBI also conducts cyber security preparedness testing among banks on the basis of hypothetical scenarios with the help of CERT-In. RBI carries out IT Examination of banks separately from the regular financial examination of the banks since 2015 to assess their cyber resilience evaluate the processes implemented by banks for security checks like VA/PT etc. and their follow up action.   xiii.	In October 2018, RBI prescribed a set of baseline cyber security controls for Urban cooperative banks (UCBs). To further strengthen the cyber security resilience of the UCBs, a comprehensive cyber security framework was issued on December 31, 2019.   xiv.	RBI has also issued circular on Customer Protection – Limiting Liability of Customers in Unauthorised Electronic Banking Transactions dated July 17,2017.xv.	In total, since March 2020, RBI issued more than 18 advisories/alerts to the supervised entities on various cyber threats and best practices to be adopted. Some of them were issued in close coordination with CERT-In.Steps taken by NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India):xvi.	NPCI has put in place a mechanism through its Board-level Risk Management Committee (RMC) and it monitors and reviews risk management and cyber security of the Company on a regular basis. xvii.	NPCI has adopted a layered approach of Prevent, Detect & Respond towards addressing Cyber Threats. The cyber security risk management extends all 3 layers with various teams undertaking activities tasked according to the state of the risk encountered.xviii.	As part of its Software Development Lifecycle, security assessments for NPCI’s infrastructure are carried out regularly to identify and fix vulnerabilities. Deviations from processes are also tracked separately. In addition, it is required that security coding practices and data privacy measures are in line with the compliance standards to ensure maximum security of various in-house applications developed by NPCI.xix.	NPCI conducts periodic Phishing simulation exercises on its employees to ascertain their ability to identify such attacks and not fall prey to such attacks. NPCI has recently on-boarded a Central Threat Intelligence platform and have started sharing the information on Cyber threats and relevant IOC’s to the member banks that participate in NPCI’s digital ecosystem.*******
