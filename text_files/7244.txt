In order to meet the shortage of doctors in PHCs and to improve doctor-patient ratio, the States are encouraged to adopt flexible norms for engaging doctors for public health facilities.  Financial support is also provided to States for providing performance-based incentives, hard area allowance, providing accommodation and transport facilities in rural and remote areas, etc for engaging doctors in the public health facilities. Also, States are advised to put in place transparent policies of posting and transfer, and ensure rational deployment of healthcare professionals. State/UT Governments are impressed upon from time to time to fill up the vacant posts including those of doctors.             The Ministry has also taken measures to improve the availability of doctors through establishment of new Government colleges and increase of seats to existing Government medical colleges under centrally sponsored scheme and rationalization of norms for Government medical colleges in terms of faculty, land etc. to facilitate setting up of new medical colleges. More than 29000 MBBS seats have been increased in the last 5 years.(c)  As per the budget announcement 2017-18, 1.5 lakh Sub Health Centres and Primary Health Centres are being transformed into Health and Wellness Centres across the country under Ayushman Bharat (AB-HWCs) for provision of comprehensive primary care that includes preventive healthcare and health promotion at the community level with continuum of care approach.

RHS provides reliable and updated information on rural health infrastructure and requirements of public health facilities in rural areas.
