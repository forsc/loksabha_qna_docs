However, the detailed list of overcharging cases where demand notices have been issued is available on the NPPA’s website www.nppaindia.nic.in. (c):       Yes, Sir. (d):      Since inception of the NPPA till March, 2020, NPPA has issued 2086 demand notices to pharmaceutical companies for overcharging consumers on the sale of formulations at prices above the ceiling price notified by NPPA. Demand Notices have been issued for total amount of Rs. 6411.28 crore.  An amount of Rs. 965.81 crore has been recovered from the Pharma Companies. An amount of Rs. 4081.93 crore is under litigation.
