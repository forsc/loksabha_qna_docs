ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (c): The Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan(RMSA) was under implementation since 2009 to 2017-18 for universalizing secondaryeducation in the country. RMSA programme provided a number of incentives to encourageenrolment and retention of children in schools as well as for improvement of quality ofeducation. These included enhancing access to secondary schools, strengthening schoolinfrastructure like school building, additional classrooms, laboratories, libraries, arts & craftrooms, toilets, drinking water facilities etc.In current scenario, RMSA scheme along-with Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) andTeacher Education (TE) have been subsumed under an Integrated Centrally SponsoredScheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha which has been launched from 2018-19. It isan overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to classXII and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of schooleducation.The Samagra Shiksha aims to achieve universal access of children in schools fromPre-School to Senior Secondary in an inclusive and equitable manner, focusing on quality ofeducation with improved infrastructure in the schools. With a view to facilitating States andUTs, the Scheme provides support to establishment of new schools by up-gradation of UpperPrimary Schools to Secondary Schools and up-gradation of Secondary Schools to SeniorSecondary Schools and, thus, for establishment of composite schools. The scheme alsosupports strengthening of infrastructure of existing schools.The erstwhile RMSA and the existing Samagra Shiksha seek to enhance enrolment atSecondary and Higher Secondary levels by providing a secondary school and highersecondary school within a reasonable distance of 5 Km and 7-10 Km, respectively of everyhabitation, to improve quality of education by ensuring that all schools conform to prescribedstandard norms and to remove gender, socio-economic and disability barriers. These normsare indicative for funding under the scheme and the states can prioritize as per their localrequirements.The Annual Work Plan & Budget (AWP&B) under the erstwhile RMSA and theexisting Samagra Shiksha are prepared by the States and UTs based on their requirements andpriorities under different interventions including the requirement of the new High Schoolsand Inter Colleges (Senior Secondary). These plans are then appraised andapproved/estimated in consultation with the States and UTs as per the programmatic andfinancial norms of the scheme and availability of budgetary resources.Since the inception of RMSA in 2009 and Samagra Shiksha in 2018-19, sanction hasbeen given for opening of 12896 new secondary schools and 44 higher secondary schools,besides addition of new stream in 851 Senior Secondary Schools. So far, 1486 secondaryschools have been sanctioned to the State of Uttar Pradesh out of which 1478 secondaryschools have become operational. The construction of school infrastructure is carried out asper Schedule of Rates (SoR) notified by the State Government or Central Public WorksDepartment (CPWD) rates whichever is lower.*****
