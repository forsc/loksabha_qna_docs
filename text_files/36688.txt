                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL) (a) & (b) Since August, 2019 Government of India in partnership with States, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) after subsuming erstwhile National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) to make provision of potable water to every rural household through tap water connection, by 2024. At the time of announcement of Jal Jeevan Mission, out of 18.93 Crore rural households, 3.23 Crore (17%) households were reported to have tap water connections. So far, 6.00 Crore (31%) rural households have been provided with tap water connections in last 30 months. Thus, as of date, out of 19.32 Crore rural households in the country, 9.24 Crore (47.83%) households are reported to have tap water supply in their homes. The State/ UT, district & village-wise status of tap water connection in rural households, schools and anganwadi centres etc. as reported by States/ UTs is in public domain and available on JJM dashboard at: https://ejalshakti.gov.in/jjmreport/JJMIndia.aspxDrinking Water being a State subject, it is States, who plan, design, approve and implement drinking water supply schemes. Government of India supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical and financial assistance. As such details of individual rural water supply projects, expenditure on their purification techniques and district-wise fund allocation/ utilization are not maintained at Government of India level. The estimated outlay of the mission is Rs. 3.60 lakh Crore, out of which Central share is Rs. 2.08 lakh Crore. State/ UT-wise expenditure reported under centrally sponsored programme JJM (erstwhile NRDWP) since 2014-15 is annexed.*****
