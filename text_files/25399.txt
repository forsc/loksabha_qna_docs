ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICUTLRURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ?? ????? ?????? ??????			                     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	Yes, Sir.  Based on the research conducted in Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and State Agriculture Universities (SAUs) in the country, it is observed that elevated CO2 increased the photosynthetic rate, biomass and yield, especially in C3 crops (rice, wheat, barley, oats, rye etc.). It was also found from the experiments that increase in CO2 enhanced wheat yield by 30% over a period of 36 years (base year 1980). However, wheat and rice grown in high CO2 levels had 3-9% less minerals (zinc & iron) and 6-8% less protein. Research also indicated that increased CO2 together with increased temperatures, which is the most commonly observed phenomenon in the changing climate, drastically affects yield of several food crops.(b)	Yes, Climate resilient crop varieties that can minimise the impact of climate change on nutritional quality have been developed.(c)	ICAR has developed 17 bio-fortified varieties in rice, wheat, maize, mustard, groundnut, finger millet, etc. for increased availability of minerals like zinc, iron, calcium and protein without affecting the yield.***********
