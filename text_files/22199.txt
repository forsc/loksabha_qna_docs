Under NIP – 2012 read with its amendment, Matix and CFCL have set up Greenfield and Brownfield urea plants respectively. Further, a decision has been taken to revive 4 closed units of the FCIL namely Gorakhpur, Sindri, Talcher and Ramagundam and one closed unit of HCFL namely Barauni by setting up of new Ammonia-Urea complex. Each of these units has the installed capacity of 12.7 LMT per year.   The Government of India has also notified the New Urea Policy (NUP) – 2015 on 25th May, 2015 for existing 25 gas based urea units with the objective of maximizing indigenous urea production; promoting energy efficiency in urea production; and rationalizing subsidy burden on the Government. NUP-2015 has led to additional production from the existing gas based urea plants.  These measures are meant to reduce the dependence on import of urea.   *********
