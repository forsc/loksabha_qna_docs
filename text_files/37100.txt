                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????   (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):     Organic Farming is a process of production system where in synthetics are avoided or largely excluded to preserve the ecosystem and to maintain biodiversity within the farm. The modern concepts of organic farming combines Tradition (mixed farming and indigenous technical knowledge), Innovation (hybrids, bio-fertilizers, farm yard manure, enriched composts, oilcakes, micro irrigation, improved agronomic practices including crop rotation, intercropping & mulching in possible areas/ crops  and cultural & biological control of pests and diseases including ecological engineering) and Science (supplying required nutrients and management of pests and diseases without synthetics).Promotion of organic farming results in concurrent improvement of soil health there by reducing soil erosion, recycling of wastes, reduced use of synthetics especially mineral fertilizers and pesticides leading decreased nitrate leaching in to ground and surface water.  Government is promoting organic farming through dedicated schemes namely Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and Mission Organic Value Chain Development in North East Region (MOVCDNER).  Both the schemes provide end to end support to organic farmers from organic production to certification and marketing including post harvest management support like processing, packaging, storage etc.Farmers are provided financial assistance of Rs 31000/ ha / 3 years under PKVY and Rs 32500/ ha/ 3years under MOVCDNER for organic inputs such as seeds, bio-fertilisers, bio-pesticides, organic manure, compost/vermi-compost, botanical extracts etc. In addition under MOVCDNER scheme need based financial assistance is provided as subsidy to FPOs and Private entrepreneurs for post harvest& value addition infrastructure.Government is promoting Natural Farming through Bhartiya Prakritik Krishi Padhati (BPKP), introduced during 2020-21 as a sub scheme of Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) for the promotion of traditional indigenous practices including Natural Farming. The scheme mainly emphasizes on exclusion of all synthetic chemical inputs and promotes on-farm biomass recycling with major stress on biomass mulching, use of cow dung-urine formulations and other plant-based preparations. Under BPKP, financial assistance of Rs 12200/ha for 3 years is provided for cluster formation, capacity building and continuous handholding by trained personnel, certification and residue analysis. Until now, under natural farming an area of 4.09 lakh ha area has been covered and a total fund of Rs. 4980.99 lakh has been released to 8 States across the country.				    ***********
