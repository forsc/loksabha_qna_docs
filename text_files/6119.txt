(b)	Ministry of Earth Sciences has dedicated projects on Ocean Observation Networks, Ocean Modelling and a multi-institutional project on monsoon mission. Scientists from various national institutes are involved in these projects. Coupled physical-biological models together with the data collected using ship cruises and profiling platforms are used to study the biogeochemical and ecological responses to physical forcing towards understanding the monsoon and forecasting the changes due to climate change. The observations made in the coastal waters of eastern and western continental shelf of India combined with model simulated data are used to assess the coastal marine ecosystem. The data collected helped in understanding the health of coastal waters and the vulnerability of our coastal zones to adverse human impacts and industrialization.(c)	Ministry of Earth Sciences formulated an umbrella scheme on Ocean Services, Technology, Observations, Resources Modelling and Science through which projects are executed primarily by the institutions attached to the ministry in collaboration with the other research and academic institutions in the country. Other significant steps pertaining to oceanographic research in Indian Ocean includes, commencement of construction of two new coastal research vessels, restoration of beaches at Puducherry and Kadalur using technology interventions, commencement of setting up of 6 low temperature thermal desalination plants in Lakshadweep islands, exploration of deep sea mineral resources viz. polymetallic nodules and polymetallic sulfides from Indian Ocean, bathymetric survey of major portion of deep waters in Exclusive Economic Zone of India , development of ocean technologies etc.(d)	The fund allocated and utilized for this purpose during the last three years are as under:	Amount in crores of rupeeBudget Head	Year	Budget Allocated (Plan)	Expenditure (Plan)Ocean Services, Technology, Observations, Resources Modelling and Science (O-STORMS)	2016-17	305	297.65Ocean Services, Technology, Observations, Resources Modelling and Science (O-STORMS)	2017-18	316	310.63Ocean Services, Technology, Observations, Resources Modelling and Science (O-STORMS)	2018-19	440.50	434.49
