Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY) had proposed to amend the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011 notified under section 79 of the IT Act, 2000. The proposed amendments to the said Rules were published on MeitY website on 24.12.2018 inviting public comments. The proposed amendments were intensely debated in the electronic and print media.  In order to convey the perspectives of proposed amendments, a meeting was held with legal experts and the privacy advocates on 29.12.2018.  Based on this discussions, and comments received through public consultation, the Rules are being finalised.Further. section 69A of the IT Act empowers Government to block any information generated, transmitted, received, stored or hosted in any computer resource in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above.Government regularly interacts with social media platforms regarding the steps to be taken to make social media safer. ********
