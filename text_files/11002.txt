                                                            THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE    AND CORPORATE AFFAIRS                                            (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)    ????? ??? ???????? ????? ???????? ??? ????? ??????                                   (???? ?????? ???? ?????)(a):  All data related to CSR as filed by companies in MCA21 registry is available in public domain which can be accessed at www.csr.gov.in. On the basis of filings made by the Companies in the MCA 21 registry, the Sector-wise and State/UT-wise details of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) expenditure by Companies during financial years 2015-16, 2016-17 and 2017-18 are at Annexure - I and Annexure - II respectively. Contd…2/-- 2 -(b) to (d): CSR is a Board driven process and the Board of the company is empowered to plan, decide, execute and monitor the CSR activities of the company based on the recommendation of its CSR committee. Schedule VII of the Act enlists the activities which may be included by companies in their CSR policy. Even Schedule VII is broad based and can be interpreted liberally in terms of MCA’s circular no. 21/2014 dated 18th June, 2014. The entire CSR architecture is disclosure based and CSR mandated companies are required to file details of CSR initiatives annually in MCA21 registry. Whenever any violation of CSR provisions is reported, action against such non-compliant Companies are initiated as per provisions of Companies Act, 2013 after due examination of records and following due process of law. So far, sanction for prosecution has been accorded in 366 cases. All CSR related offences are compoundable. So far 121 applications for compounding have been made and 37 cases have been compounded. (e): The Ministry has set up High Level Committee (HLC-2018) to review the CSR framework and make recommendations to develop a more robust and coherent CSR regulatory and policy framework, and underlying ecosystem. The HLC-2018 has submitted its report on 07th August, 2019 which is available on the Ministry’s website at www.mca.gov.in.******Annexure - IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 184DEVELOPMENT SECTOR-WISE CSR EXPENDITURE (IN RS.
