                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES (SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) to (c): Ministry of Food Processing Industries has been implementing Mega Food Park Scheme (MFPS) to create modern infrastructure for the food processing. This scheme is now a component of the new Central Sector Umbrella Scheme – Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY). Ministry does not establish Mega Food Parks in the country on its own. The proposals under Mega Food Park Scheme for setting up of Mega Food Parks in the country are invited through Expression of Interest (EoI) from time to time. Selection of suitable proposals for these projects is done as per the Scheme guidelines, based on the merit, through a three tier stringent appraisal process as per the prefixed criteria. Ministry has floated EoI on 03.02.2021 for submission of proposals for setting up of Mega Food Parks in the country under Scheme for Mega Food Park. Last date of submission of proposal is 03.03.2021. As on date, there is no proposal under consideration to establish any new Mega Food Parks in the country under the Mega Food Park Scheme of the Ministry.  As per the Mega Food Park Scheme guidelines, the Scheme provides a capital grant at the rate of 50 percent of the eligible project cost in general areas including Uttar Pradesh and at the rate of 75 percent of eligible project cost in difficult and hilly areas i.e. North East Region including Sikkim, J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and ITDP notified areas of the States subject to a maximum grant of Rs.50 crore per project. The time schedule for completion and successful operationalization of a Mega Food Park project is 30 months from the date of final approval to the project.*****
