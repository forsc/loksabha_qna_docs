SINGH) (a) to (c) : 	As per Section 7 of the Electricity Act 2003, any generating company may establish, operate and maintain a generating station without obtaining a license/permission under this Act, if it complies with the technical standards relating to connectivity with the grid. Accordingly, sanction of the Government is not required for setting up of thermal power projects (TPPs). Any corporate body or individual can invest in thermal power generation without seeking permission from the Government. However, for setting up of hydroelectric projects, the detailed project reports (DPRs) are required to be submitted for concurrence of the Central Electricity Authority (CEA). During last three years and current year, CEA has concurred the DPRs for setting up of seven hydroelectric projects with an aggregate installed capacity of 7,004 MW.  The details of these projects along with present status are given at Annexure. ****************
