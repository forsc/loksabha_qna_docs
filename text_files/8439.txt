The goal of NPCB&VI for reduction of blindness is in line with the Vision 2020: The Right to Sight’ initiative of the World Health Organisation (WHO).(b):	Under NPCB&VI recurring grant is provided to States/UTs for conducting eye surgeries including cataract surgeries at District Hospitals, identified Non-Governmental Eye hospitals and private practitioners for control of blindness and visual impairment in the country.As per reports furnished by States/UTs, more than 60 lakh cataract surgeries are being conducted annually under NPCB&VI.
