(c)	PM-KISAN is a continuous and ongoing Scheme in which the financial benefits are transferred to the bank accounts of the identified beneficiaries as and when their correct and verified data is uploaded by the concerned States/UTs on PM-KISAN web-portal. The benefits under the Scheme are paid to the beneficiaries from the period of their registration and all the subsequent periods.(d)	The benefit under the Scheme is paid to the beneficiaries as and when their data is validated and corrected on the PM-KISAN portal by the respective States/UTs.(e)	The following special provisions have been made for the farmers of the tribal regions so that the benefit of PM-KISAN Scheme could be given to them:(i) For NE States: In some of the North Eastern States, the land ownership rights are community based.  In such States an alternate implementation mechanism of eligibility has been developed for the farmers and is implemented with the approval of the Committee comprising of Ministers of Ministry of Development of North East Region (DoNER), Ministry of Land Resources, Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare and concerned State Chief Ministers or State nominated Ministers.Manipur: In case of Manipur, the certificate issued by the village authority, namely, the Chairman/Chief, authorizing any tribal family to cultivate a piece of land, may be accepted. Such certification of village Chairman/Chief shall be authenticated by the concerned sub-divisional officers, subject to the exclusion criteria enshrined in the Scheme.Nagaland: (1) In case of community owned cultivable land in the state of Nagaland which is under permanent cultivation, for identification of beneficiaries under PM- KISAN, the certificate issued by the village council/authority/village chieftain regarding land holding, duly verified by the administrative head of the circle/ sub division and countersigned by the DeputyCommissioner of the District shall suffice subject to  the exclusions under the operational guidelines.(2) In case of cultivable land in the State of Nagaland which is categorised as Jhum land as per definition under Section – 2 (7) of the Nagaland Jhum Land Act, 1970  and which is owned by the community / clan / village council / village chieftan, the identification of beneficiaries under PM-Kisan scheme, shall be on the basis of certification of land holding by the village council / chief / head of the village, duly verified by the administrative head of the circle/sub division and countersigned by the Deputy Commissioner of the District.

This lineage chart shall be submitted before the Gram Sabha for calling objections.  After approval of the Gram Sabha, the village level/Circle level revenue officials will verify and authenticate the Vanshavali and possession of holding.  This authenticated list of farmers after due verification of succession chart shall be countersigned by the District level Revenue authority.  Farmers’ names, subject to the exclusion criterion after following the aforementioned process, shall be uploaded on the PM-KISAN portal along with other required details for disbursement of benefit under the Scheme.
