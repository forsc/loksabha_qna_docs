The campaign focuses on enhancing the accessibility of Built Environment, Transportation System and Information and Communication Technology Ecosystem to make the life of Persons with Disabilities more convenient. Details of achievements so far are as follows:Till date, under Built Up Environment, Rs. 465.49 crores have been released to States/UTs to make 1180 identified buildings accessible. Out of these, 356 buildings have been made accessible. CPWD has made 998 central government buildings accessible.Department of School Education and Literacy has informed that around 71% Government and Government aided schools have been provided with ramps with handrails and accessible toilets.Under the Transportation System, 709 A1, A & B category railway stations, seven Short Term Facilities (provision of non slippery walkway from parking to Station building, provision of signages, provision of at least one drinking water tap, provision of at least one disable friendly toilet and ‘May I help you’ booth etc. have been provided) and 2 Long Term Facilities (facilities for inter-platform transfer and engraving on edges of platforms) have been provided at 603 railway stations.
