                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW) (a) and (b) To prevent the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, Indian Railways had discontinued all regular passenger carrying trains w.e.f. 23rd March, 2020. Since November, 2021 Mail/Express trains are being operated with regular numbers, rationalised time table and with fares and categorisation as applicable.  Indian Railways do not operate trains on State-wise basis, as Railway network straddles across State boundaries.  As on 15.03.2022, on a daily average basis, 8971 trains which includes 1734 Mail/Express trains, 5437 Suburban trains and 1800 passenger trains were operated over Indian Railways.  Besides, passenger train services are being restored in a phased manner.*****
