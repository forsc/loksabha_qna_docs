                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):  Health  is a  State  subject  and therefore  primary  responsibility  to  ensure   effective and  sufficient  health  facilities  including  setting  up  of  super  speciality  hospitals  lies  with State Governments. Super speciality hospitals are being constructed both in public and private sector, and  data on number of functional / under construction super speciality hospitals is not maintained centrally. However, under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY), Government has sanctioned 75 Projects of Up-gradation of existing Government Medical Colleges/Institutions (GMCIs) which includes setting up of 63 Super Specialty Blocks (SSB) in various parts of the country. List of 63 such projects is at Annexure.  These projects under PMSSY are implemented on cost sharing basis between Central and State Governments. There is no proposal under PMSSY for setting up of additional super speciality hospitals in each district in the country.(c): PMSSY aims at correcting the regional imbalances in the availability of the tertiary healthcare and medical education in different parts of the country. The Ministry has, while finalizing the up-gradation projects, given higher priority to the States generally considered backward with respect to the broad socio-economic indicators. Further, State Governments also have to agree to contribute their share in the total cost of the project as well as operate and maintain the facilities created. Therefore, willingness of the State Governments   is also important. (d): The  State/UT and project-wise details of approved costs and  Central share released is given in Annexure.(e): Approval of GMCI up-gradation projects also contains timelines for  their completion. Progress in implementation is regularly reviewed for expeditious and time-bound completion of projects.
