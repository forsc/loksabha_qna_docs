                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (c): Government has taken various steps for generating employment in the country including in Madhya Pradesh, like encouraging private sector of economy, fast tracking various projects involving substantial investment and increasing public expenditure on schemes like Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) run by Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA), Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) scheme run by Ministry of Rural Development and Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM) run by Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs. Details of the employment generated through these schemes/ programmes are given at Annexure-I-IV. Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) has been initiated by Government inter alia, for facilitating self-employment. Under PMMY collateral free loans upto Rs. 10 lakh, are extended to micro/small business enterprises and to individuals to enable them to setup or expand their business activities. Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY) was launched by the Ministry of Labour and Employment for incentivising employers for promoting employment generation. Under this scheme, Government is paying entire employer’s contribution (12% or as admissible) towards EPF and EPS for all eligible new employees for all sectors for 3 years.  The last date of registration under PMRPY was 31.03.2019.Besides these initiatives, flagship programmes of the Government such as Make in India, Digital India, Swachh Bharat Mission, Smart City Mission, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, Housing for All, Infrastructure development and Industrial corridors have the potential to generate productive employment opportunities. Ministries/ Departments/ States run skill development schemes across various sectors to improve the employability of youth and also facilitate placements. Schemes such as the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) wherein Government reimburses 25 percent of the stipend payable to apprentices also enhances employability of the youth to access employment.The interests of the workers affected by closure of a company are protected through measures such as provision of compensation under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Counseling, Retraining & Redeployment (CRR) scheme is a social safety net to provide opportunities of self/ wage employment to the employees (or dependents) of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) separated under VRS/VSS or retrenched due to closure/ restructuring of CPSEs. CRR aims to reorient VRS/VSS optees/ dependents through short duration skill development training to enable them to adjust in the new environment and adopt new avocations after their separation from the CPSEs. CRR scheme is being implemented in collaboration with National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) under Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship.*****
