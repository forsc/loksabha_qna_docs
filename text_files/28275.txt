                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI PANKAJ CHAUDHARY)(a) & (b): The Income-tax Act, 1961 recognizes taxation of individuals based on the slabs of total income, as prescribed by the Finance Act of the respective years.

Accordingly, no such data is maintained by the Income-tax Department.(c) & (d): Does not arise in view of (a) and (b) above.
