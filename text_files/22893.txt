ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (c) Allocation for State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) is made under the scheme titled ‘Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP)’. Rs. 30 cr have been allocated to CCAP in Budget Estimate (BE) 2021-22. Revised Estimate (RE) for Financial Year 2020-21 was Rs. 24 cr and BE 2020-21 was Rs. 40 cr for the scheme. The allocation in BE 2021-22 has been made in line with actual expenditure in previous years under the scheme. (d) and (e) The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) was constituted under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974. It was later also entrusted with powers and functions under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. CPCB serves as a field formation and also provides technical services to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change under the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. Principal functions of CPCB are (i) to promote cleanliness of streams and wells in States by prevention, control and abatement of water pollution and (ii) to improve the quality of air and to prevent, control and abate air pollution in the country.The State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) were constituted with the objectives of prevention and control of water pollution and maintaining or restoring wholesomeness of water. Later SPCBs were also entrusted with the responsibilities of prevention, control and abatement of air pollution under the provisions of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. SPCBs are also engaged in implementation of Rules made under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. In consideration of the quality of air in NCR and adjoining areas, a ‘Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)’ was constituted through an ordinance in October, 2020, which has lapsed on 12.03.2021. It is not true that Air Pollution is no longer in the domain of Pollution Control Boards (PCB). PCBs and Commission have concurrent jurisdiction over Air Pollution.*****
