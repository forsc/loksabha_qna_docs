ANSWER




                                                        (a), (b) and (c): India is today emerging as a big digital power with a proactive people-centric program of creating digital infrastructure focusing on digital delivery of services and thereby digital empowerment leading to digital inclusion where every common man is enjoying benefits of digital governance.  Of late India has also become an important country where social media platforms have spread their wings. Social media platforms have become the most prominent media to facilitate interactions. The spread of social media has also in its own way contributed to awareness, connectivity, education, community self-help, information and updates, and business promotion. All this could happen because the big digital economy operates beyond geographical borders.With the proliferation of social media sites, the desire to stay connected online has grown over the years. Digital technologies, such as social networks, online shopping, and games, use a set of persuasive and motivational techniques to keep users returning. Technology is designed to utilise the basic human need to feel a sense of belonging and connecting with others. (d): The Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000 has provisions for regulating the use of digital and communication tools by citizens in personal and professional life.  Section 79 of the Act and rules notified therein pertaining to intermediaries expects users not to host, display, upload, modify, publish, transmit, update or share any information that is harmful, objectionable, and unlawful in any way.  Intermediaries are required to disable/remove unlawful content on being notified by appropriate government or its agency. MeitY under its Information Security Education and Awareness (ISEA) programme creates user awareness at all levels on issues relating to safe and secure use of digital and communications tools. A dedicated website for information security awareness (https://www.infosecawareness.in) has also been set up.  (e) and (f): There is no such proposal with the Ministry.********
