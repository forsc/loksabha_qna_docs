                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a) & (b):	For bringing overall improvement in the quality of life of the rural poor, including in the backward districts, through employment generation, strengthening of livelihood opportunities, promoting self-employment, skilling of rural youths, provision of social assistance, infrastructure development in rural areas, the Department of Rural Development is implementing various Schemes such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana–National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), Deen Dayal Upadhyay – Gramin Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY),  Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Rurban Mission (SPMRM). In order to unlock potentials to rapidly transform the lives of people in the under-developed pockets of the country in a time bound manner, the Aspirational Districts Programme, was launched by NITI  Aayog in January 2018.  Under this programme, 112 backward districts across 27 States, have been identified in a transparent manner where a rapid transformation in the field of health and nutrition, education, agriculture and water management, financial inclusion and skill development are being undertaken.  States are the main drivers and district magistrates make the fulcrum, on whom the whole programme rests.  Senior Central Government officials are appointed as ‘Guardians’ (or ‘Prabharis’) for a district, who regularly visit and provide guidance to the district administration.  Additionally, an empowered committee has been set up comprising Secretaries to the Government of India, which meets at regular intervals under the chairmanship of CEO, NITI Aayog to identify key constraints and challenges in the sectors under focus and make suitable recommendations w.r.t. policy and funding.(c) & (d):	The details of funds allocated/released during last three years and current year under the Department of Rural Development Schemes, State-wise Scheme-wise, are placed at Annexure I(a) to I(i). Review of implementation of various Rural Development programmes is an ongoing process. Programmes are reviewed through Performance Review Committee Meetings, Common Review Mission, Area Officers Schemes, District Development Co-ordination and Monitoring Committee named as “DISHA” Committee, Reports of National Level Monitors etc. Actions as appropriate are taken on the reports of these reviews.*****
