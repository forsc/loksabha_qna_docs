ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI  & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  Despite adequate rainfall, Kerala generally faces water scarcity from February to May in some parts of the mid land and high land areas where the terrain is highly undulating. The groundwater stored during monsoon season is generally lost as base flow at a faster rate in high gradient areas. Further, because of high gradient and low thickness of aquifers, there is limited scope of artificial recharge/rainwater harvesting in these areas.(b) to (d) Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management including rainwater harvesting in the Country is primarily States’ responsibility. Further, Kerala has taken up ‘Ente Kulam’, a water conservation initiative that includes revival of water bodies. In addition, domestic well recharge through rooftop rainwater recharge is being promoted under the “Haritha Keral Mission” by involving the gram panchayats. In addition, 12 million rainfall conservation/recharge structures were constructed under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.As per information received from Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, the Model Building Bye Laws, 2016, has been issued for guidance of the States/UTs which has a chapter on ‘Rainwater Harvesting’. 33 States/UTs including Kerala have incorporated the rainwater harvesting provisions. Provision of rainwater harvesting is applicable to all residential plots above 200 sqm and all residential buildings above 100 sqm.Water being a State subject, efforts to initiate suitable demand side and supply side interventions including preserving the open wells and its water quality is primarily States’ responsibility. However, steps taken by the Central Government for sustainable water management are at the following URL: http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf.*****
