MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE & FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ?????? (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d):  State Government of Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala, Nagaland have reported that no case of use of banned pesticides have been reported in their States. Government of India is implementing a central sector scheme, “Monitoring of Pesticide Residues at National Level”, under which samples of vegetables, fruits and other crops are collected from the retail outlets, markets, farm gate etc. and analyzed by enlisted NABL laboratories for pesticide residues. Under the scheme, a total of 30,664 samples of fruits, vegetables and   other crops were collected and analysed during 2019-20 for the presence of pesticide residues; and residues of banned pesticides have been detected in 78 (0.25%) samples. Reports of such instances have been shared with concerned State Governments to take appropriate legal and corrective actions as per the provisions of the Insecticides Act, 1968. Further, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has reported that Banned pesticides are not allowed for production/ripening of fruits and vegetables and as per Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restrictions on Sale) Regulation 2011, the ripening of fruits is permitted by using Ethylene gas at a concentration upto 100 ppm (100µl/L) depending upon the crop, variety and maturity.(e):  Registered Pesticides are periodically reviewed with regard to their safety and efficacy. On receipt of new studies / reports/ references/ information by government from time to time, the review is done by constituting expert committees. Based on the recommendations of such expert committees and after due consultation with Registration Committee, the Ministry of Agriculture has so far banned or phased out 46 pesticides and 4 pesticide formulations for import, manufacture or sale in the country. In addition, 5 banned pesticides are allowed to be manufactured for export only, 8 pesticide registrations have been withdrawn and 9 pesticides have been placed under restricted use.******
