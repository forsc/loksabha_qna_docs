ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a): GST rate on bunker fuel (IFO 180 CST, IFO 380 CST) for use in ships or vessels is presently at 5 per cent.(b), (c) and (d): Initially the GST rate on bunker fuel was prescribed at 18% on the recommendation of GST Council. Subsequently, on observing that high rate of GST on bunker fuel supplied to foreign going vessels was making India less competitive vis a vis neighbouring countries, the GST Council recommended the reduction in GST rate on bunker fuel to 5%. The GST Council further observed that this GST rate on bunker fuel would encourage coastal shipping at par with foreign going vessels and also obviate the administrative problems of monitoring the end use.*****
