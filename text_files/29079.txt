                                                        MINISTER FOR CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS & HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE                               (SHRI MANSUKH MANDAVIYA) (a) to (c):   The following steps are taken by the Government every season to meet the requirement of fertilizers in all the States. i.	Before the commencement of each cropping season, Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (DA&FW), in consultation with all the State Governments, assesses the requirement of fertilizers. After assessment of requirement, DA&FW projects month-wise requirement of fertilizers. ii.	On the basis of month-wise & State-wise projection given by DA&FW, Department of Fertilizers allocates sufficient/ adequate quantities of fertilizers to States by issuing monthly supply plan and continuously monitors the availability.iii.	The movement of all major subsidized fertilizers is being monitored throughout the country by an on-line web based monitoring system called integrated Fertilizer Monitoring System (iFMS);iv.	The State Governments are regularly advised to coordinate with manufacturers and importers of fertilizers for streamlining the supplies through timely placement of indents for railway rakes through their state institutional agencies like Markfed etc.-2-v.	Regular Weekly Video Conference is conducted jointly by Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (DA&FW) and Department of Fertilizers (DoF) with State Agriculture Officials and corrective actions are taken to dispatch fertilizer as indicated by the State Governments. vi.	The gap between demand (requirement) and production for Urea & other fertilizer is met through imports. The import for the season is also finalized well in advance to ensure timely availability. P&K Fertilizers are de-controlled in the country.vii.	      Concerns raised by various State Governments are addressed from time to time.  (d)	:   Government of India has declared fertilizer as an essential commodity under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and notified Fertilizer Control Order, 1985 and Fertilizer (Movement Control) Order, 1973. State Governments have been adequately empowered to ensure selling of fertilizers at MRP besides stopping black marketing/smuggling of fertilizers. State Governments are empowered to conduct search, make seizures and take punitive action against any person violating provisions of Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and Fertilizer Control Order 1985. In addition to above, necessary directions are also issued time to time to State Governments to curb the hoarding/black-marketing of fertilizers.                                     ********
