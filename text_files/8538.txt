                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR CULTURE AND TOURISM(PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a)	Archaeological Survey of India is responsible for protection, preservation, conservation, maintenance and removal of encroachment of centrally protected monuments, archaeological sites and remains including forts in various States of the country including Tuglaqabad Fort in Delhi.  It is a continuous process, where essential conservation work is executed as per the requirements of different sites and availability of resources and cases for removal of encroachments are taken up as per provisions of Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958 and Rules, 1959.  The responsibility to demolish the encroachment from protected monument rests with State Government. (b)	No, Sir. (c)&(d)	Recently the Hon’ble Delhi High Court has issued directions on 7.11.2019 that no construction is permitted in the areas/zones falling within the protective provisions of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958; and that any properties purchased and money invested shall be at the risk, cost and peril of the purchasers.  (e)&(f)	Pro-active steps are taken by Archaeological Survey of India under the provisions of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958 and Rules, 1959 to keep the historical monuments including forts free from encroachments in all the States and UTs. However, for removal of encroachment Archaeological Survey of India is completely dependent on State Governments.
