                                                    (a)	 whether the generation of electricity from coal power plants has fallen short during the last five years including pre and post COVID-19 situation;(b) 	if so, the details thereof and the reasons therefor; and(c) 	the corrective steps being taken in this regard?






ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (c) :        The quantum of power generated from coal based power plants (of capacity 25 MW and above) during the last five years from 2015-16 to 2019-20  and  the current year 2020-21 (up to August 2020) are given at Annexure-I. During the last five years, power generation from coal based power plants of 25 MW and above in India has been increasing except during the last year i.e. financial year 2019-20. The quantum of power generated, month- wise, during and after the lockdown due to Covid-19  i.e. from April to August 2020 as compared to the corresponding months (April to August 2019) before Covid-19 are given at Annexure-II. The decrease in generation of power from coal based power plants this year is due to the impact of Covid-19. However, with gradual normalisation of activities during and post lockdown period, the demand and hence generation in August, 2020 was almost equal to that in the corresponding month last year. As the demand for power further increases, generation from coal based power plants would also increase.**************
