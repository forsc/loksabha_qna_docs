ANSWER




MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a)	& (b)	No specific representation has been received from the Haj pilgrims about the provisional guidelines issued by the Haj Committee of India for Haj 2021 except removal of some of the Embarkation Points for Haj 2021. The arrangements for Haj 2021 are being made under special circumstances with special norms, rules & regulations, eligibility criteria, etc. due to Covid-19 Pandemic. Provisional guidelines including Embarkation Points, age criteria, cost of Haj, etc. for Haj 2021, have been issued by Haj Committee of India after extensive consultation with concerned Ministries and Indian Mission in Saudi Arabia.(c) 	Haj quota is allocated every year by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Government of India has been consistently making efforts to increase Haj quota for the country, as a result of which, the total quota which was 1,36,020 in the year 2014 has been increased to 2,00,000 during Haj 2019. 	The total number of Haj pilgrims from the country is discussed bilaterally between theGovernment of India and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabiadecides the Haj quota for each country including India every year.*****
