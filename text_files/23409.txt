ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI DANVE RAOSAHEB DADARAO)(a) to (d)  :	Yes, Sir. It is the responsibility of Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) as the National Standards Body, to ensure that there is synergy in the standardisation work taking place in the country and that there is no overlap or duplication of the work carried out by other Standards Developing Bodies. With increasing convergence of technologies, there is also a need for better coordination of work among all standardisation bodies in the country working in different sectors. Indian National Strategy for Standardization (INSS) published by Department of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce and Industry has recognized this and has recommended convergence of standardization, in which BIS has been given the role of overarching body for all the standardization activities in India.    At present, there are a number of domain specific Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) in the country that develop standards in their respective areas. As per BIS Act, 2016, BIS may recognize or accredit any institution in India or outside which is engaged in standardization. With the objective of ensuring one national standard for one subject in the country, BIS has launched a scheme for recognition of SDO’s and would act as the umbrella organization for steering India’s standardization efforts, by recognizing these bodies and wherever necessary, to recognize the standards developed by these bodies as Indian Standards.  *****
