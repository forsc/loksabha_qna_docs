ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	No specific census/survey of landless farmers has been conducted and as such the exact number of landless farmers in the country is not available. However, State-wise number of wholly leased-in operational holdings as per Agriculture Census 2015-16 is given in the Annexure.(b):	The National Commission on Farmers, under the Chairmanship of Prof. M.S. Swaminathan, had, inter-alia, recommended that “wherever feasible, landless labour households should be provided with at least 1 acre per household, which will give them space for home gardens and animal rearing”.  The major recommendations of the Commission were included in the ‘Draft National Policy for Farmers’ submitted by the Commission itself in 2006. Based on the ‘Draft National Policy for Farmers’, the Government approved the National Policy for Farmers (NPF)-2007. Contd….2/-- 2 -The policy provisions in NPF-2007 include, inter-alia, asset reforms to strengthen implementation of laws relating to land reform, with particular reference to tenancy laws, land leasing, distribution of ceiling surplus land and wastelands, providing adequate access to common property and wasteland resources, etc. Since, ‘Land’ and its management falls within the legislative and administrative jurisdiction of the States and the role of Central Government is advisory in nature, State Governments have been advised for distribution of land to the eligible poor by action plans and by undertaking special drives. (c):	Government is not contemplating any proposal to conduct a specific survey or study on the number and conditions of landless farmers. (d): 	The subject relating to Land and its management falls within the jurisdiction of States. Thus the role of Central Government in the field of land reforms is only of advisory nature.  With a view to address the issues in the area of land leasing, NITI Aayog has developed a ‘Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act, 2016’ for adoption by States and circulated to all the States. The Model Act offers an appropriate template for the states and UTs to draft their own piece of legislations, in consonance with the local requirements and adopt an enabling Act. Key elements of the Model Land Leasing Act are to legalize land leasing to promote agricultural efficiency, equity and poverty reduction; facilitate all tenants, including share croppers to access insurance bank credit and bank credit against pledging of expected output; and legalize land leasing in all areas to ensure complete security of land ownership right for land owners and security of tenure for tenants for the agreed lease period.
