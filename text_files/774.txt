To reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level.ii.	To achieve about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030 with the help of transfer of technology and low cost international finance including from Green Climate Fund (GCF).iii.	To create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.(d) : Yes Sir. Coal is contributing to about 73% of electricity generation in India. (e) :  During 2018-19, India’s coal import  have increased due to following reasons:1.	Huge difference in demand and actual supply of coking coal to steel sector resulting in import of coking coal.2.	Sudden surge in the demand of power, resulting raised in coal consumption evident from rise in PLF to boost up the power generation by the generators.3.	Shortfall in power generation from other renewable source of energy.4.	More supply to power sector and less supply to non-power sector resulting in import by the non-power sector consumers._____
