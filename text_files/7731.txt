ANSWER




MINISTER OF  PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a)to(c): A  statement is laid on the table of the House. STATEMENT IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 121 FOR ANSWER ON 27/11/2019 ASKED BY SHRIMATI MEENAKASHI LEKHI, M.P. REGARDING “DECLINE IN COAL OUTPUT”.(a):All India raw coal production increased from 565.77 MT in 2013-14 to 730.35 MT (Prov.) in 2018-19, an absolute increase of 164.58 MT as compared to increase of coal production of 73.01 MT between 2008-09 and 2013-14.While there was a positive growth in production in the first quarter of the current year (April-June 19), production has been slipping since July. This is largely because of heavy rainfall witnessed in coal mining areas of the country. This year rainfall has continued in the month of October also which hampered the growth in production during this month that normally taken place after the rainy session. (b): During the current year (April-October 2019), though there has been a decline in dispatch to Power sector, it has not affected the coal availability position at the Power House end. Presently, stock at Power House end stands at 22.78 MT as on 19.11.2019, equivalent to 14 days’ consumption with 5 power plants under critical list, as against last year same day’s stock of 11.68 Million tonnes, equivalent to 7 days’ consumption, with 25 Power plants reeling under criticality. (c): The coal production of CIL and its subsidiaries is being reviewed regularly at the highest level of Ministry. CIL has been asked to make all out efforts to reach the target by improving production in the remaining months of the current year. The focus of the Government is on accelerating domestic production of coal through allocation of more coal blocks, pursuing with State Government for assistance in land acquisition and coordinated efforts with Railways for movement of coal.Prior to ongoing tranche of coal allocation, coal blocks were allocated to private companies for captive use purpose only and not for sale of coal. In the current tranche of auction, 25% of coal production has been allowed for sale of coal for private companies. In order to enhance coal production, CIL has taken the following steps:•	Opening of 55 greenfield projects having capacity of 92 MTPA and expansion of 193 brownfield projects having capacity of about 310 MTPA in next five years.•	Portal based monitoring of on-going projects to ensure timely completion of projects.•	Introduction of state of the art technology to improve its work efficiency with high capacity Heavy Earth Moving Machinery (HEMM), like 42 cum Shovel and 240 T Rear Dumpers in Gevra Expansion, Dipka & Kusmunda open cast mines.•	Introduction of Surface Miners in opencast mines to improve operational efficiency & to cater to environmental needs.  During 2018-19 in CIL, around 50% of the opencast coal production was through Surface miners.•	Introduction of Mass Production Technology in underground coal mines, 2 mines are worked with Powered Support Longwall technology and 9 mines are worked with Continuous Miner technology. ****
