                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) and (b):	    As per the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India, the primary responsibility with respect to ‘Police’ & ‘Public Order’ lies with the State Governments concerned.  In so far as NCT of Delhi is concerned, Delhi Police has reported that a total of 100 gantry mounted Over-Speed Violation Detection Camera systems (OSVD) have been installed at 49 road stretches in the NCT of Delhi.   In addition, Red  Light  Violation  Detection -2-L.S.US.Q.NO.2030 FOR 03.03.2020Camera System (RLVD) has been installed at 34 intersections, which also has the facility to check violation of speed limits. The details of locations/ roads at which such devices have been installed are at Annexure I and Annexure II. 75 OSVD cameras have been installed on various roads and RLVD cameras have been installed at 18 intersections in the month of December, 2019 after implementation of the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, i.e. 01.09.2019.  The details of locations/ roads at which such devices have been installed are at Annexure III and Annexure IV.   As on date, no such device is non-operational.(c) and (d): Details of the notices served by Delhi Police to the erring motorists on the basis of violations detected through these systems during the period from February, 2019 to August, 2019 are as under:-Violation	No. of notices issuedRed light/stop line/ driving against the flow of traffic	14,44,721Over-speeding	9,91,481Total	24,36,202As per the new system, notices were sent by Delhi Police electronically through SMS to the violators on their respective mobile numbers and        e-payment  gateway  facility was given to  the  violators  for depositing the -3-L.S.US.Q.NO.2030 FOR 03.03.2020challan amount electronically.  However, after the notification of the amended MV Act w.e.f. 01.09.2019, the above-mentioned process had to be stopped since traffic personnel of Delhi Police have not been as yet authorised to compound the challaning amount under section 200 (1) of the MV Act, 1988 by the Government of NCT of Delhi.  However, the violations are printed in notice forms, and sent by registered post to the violators.  The number of such notices issued with effect from 01.09.2019 to 26.02.2020 are 21,406. *******
