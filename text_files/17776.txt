ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) & (b):	Agricultural Produce including organic agricultural produce are different from industrial products, thereby necessitating different kinds of handling and facilities. Organic farming policy, 2005 envisages promotion of organic farming in value chain mode for providing better returns to farmers. In line with the policy, Government of India has been promoting export of certified organic niche crops of North East region of the country in a value chain mode under Mission Organic Value Chain Development. Apart from formation of Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) and input support, major thrust of the programme is on processing and marketing. Support up to Rs. 2 crores is provided to FPOs/ entrepreneurs for setting up of collection and grading centres, transport vehicles, reefer vans, integrated processing units that can add value to organic produce  fetching good returns to farmers.	Similarly, Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) certification, primary processing and marketing of organic agriculture produce are supported under the organic farming scheme of  Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana. 	In addition to above, Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) provides Financial Assistance to only registered member exporters of scheduled products including organic agricultural produce through its schemes. APEDA is also engaged in negotiations for mutual recognitions/equivalency for organic products with importing countries. Efforts of APEDA have resulted in obtaining equivalency of National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) with the standards of European Union and Switzerland for unprocessed plant products and conformity assessment with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The recognition agreements help in increase of export which in turn helps organic farmers. (c)  In view of (a) & (b) above, the Question does not arise. *******
