The clarifications of the State Government were sought with respect to comments/observations received from the Ministry of Rural Development (Department of Land Resources) and the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmer Welfare). After receipt of necessary details/clarifications from Government of Maharashtra, the Bill was referred to the Ministry of Law & Justice (Department of Legal Affairs). The Department of Legal Affairs has requested for certain documents from the State Government and also requested for a discussion with the officials of the State Government. This has been communicated to Government of Maharashtra on 16.07.2021. The Bill is presently under examination in Ministry of Home Affairs in consultation with the nodal Ministries/Departments and the State Government of Maharashtra. As the consultation process in such cases takes time, no time frame can be laid down for according such approval.                                          *******
