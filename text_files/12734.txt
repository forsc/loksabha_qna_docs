                                                        ANSWERMINISTER FOR CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS (SHRI D. V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a) & (b): Yes Sir, The import of chemicals and petrochemicals has increased during the last five years. The data of imports of major Chemicals and Petrochemicals monitored by the Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals for the last five years is as under:Year Imports (000 MTs) 2014-15 10105 2015-16 11041 2016-17 11338 2017-18 12345 2018-19 12663It may be seen that imports of Chemicals & Petrochemicals has been increasing during the last five years. This increase of imports of chemicals & petrochemicals is due to insufficient domestic production capacity to meet the growing domestic demand, comparatively higher cost of production in the country, also due to comparatively smaller scale of operations.(c) : The government has no plan to increase exports incentives under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS). (d) & (e) : Currently, there is no proposal under consideration of Department of Revenue to increase import duty to cut down imports. *****
