ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	 As on 17.7.2019, 25,00,613 beneficiaries had received  the 1st installment and 13,23,564 beneficiaries the 2nd installment in the State of Rajasthan under the PM-Kisan Scheme. As per the online confirmation received from the banks through the PM-Kisan portal, district-wise details of successful credit of the financial benefit in the bank accounts of the concerned beneficiaries are given at Annexure. (b):	PM-Kisan is a continuous and ongoing Scheme, in which the financial benefits is transferred to the bank accounts of the identified beneficiaries only when their correct and verified data is uploaded by the concerned States / UTs on PM-Kisan web-portal. The financial benefit under the Scheme is provided in 3 equal installments of Rs. 2000/- each every four months. Uploading of data of beneficiaries on the portal involves several levels of verifications, validations and corrections by different authorities, banks and the concerned State / UT Governments, and hence it takes time to get the final correct data for release of benefits to the eligible beneficiaries. However, the beneficiaries who have not so far received the benefits are eligible to receive the same from the 4-monthly period in which their names are uploaded on the PM-Kisan portal and also subsequent installments thereafter. Therefore, it is not possible to indicate any definite time frame for completion of release of benefits to all beneficiaries. (c):	 The Government regularly conducts meetings with all the State / UT Governments, including those who have not  on-boarded the scheme so far, through Video Conferencing, physical meetings, physical communications as well as e-mails, several times during a month, exhorting them to expeditiously upload data of farmers on the PM-Kisan Portal to enable release of the benefits to the eligible beneficiaries.
