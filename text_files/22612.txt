Out of these, five airports namely, Shirdi, Durgapur, Pakyong, Kannur and Kalaburagi have already been operationalized.;(c): Declaration of an airport as an International airport depends upon the traffic potential and the demand from airlines for operation of international flights besides provision of Ground Lighting Facilities, Instrument Landing System, adequate runway length, Immigration, Health and Animal & Plant Quarantine services etc. Out of 21 airports, which have been accorded ''in-principle'' approval, Mopa in Goa, Navi Mumbai and Shirdi in Maharashtra, Kushinagar and Noida in Uttar Pradesh, Dholera and Hirasar in Gujarat, Bhogapuram in Andhra Pradesh and Kannur in Kerala have been approved for development as international airports.(d) and (e): Besides developing/ constructing Greenfield airports, Government of India, Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik) in October, 2016 with the objective to facilitate / stimulate regional air connectivity to  underserved and unserved airports in the country and making air travel affordable to the masses.
