Out of the existing Central Labour Acts, about 17 are more than 50 years old and a few of them are even 70 years old.  Accordingly, in line with the recommendations of the Second National Commission on Labour, the Ministry has taken steps for drafting four Labour Codes i.e. The Code on Wages; The Code on Industrial Relations, The Code on Occupational Safety, Health & Working Conditions & The Code on Social Security by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the relevant provisions of the existing Central Labour Laws.   The  Codes have been drafted after exhaustive consultation with representatives of trade unions, employers’ associations and State Governments.  Total of 8 tripartite consultations have been held on Labour Codes. Besides, the drafts were also placed on the website of the Ministry to seek the comments of all stakeholders including general public.  The Central Labour Acts which have been subsumed in the proposed Labour Codes will be repealed on their enactment.(c):		The Ministry has also undertaken amendments in various Central Labour Acts like the Payment of Bonus Act 1965enhancing the eligibility limit for payment of bonus from Rs 10000/- to Rs. 21000/- per month and the Calculation Ceiling from Rs. 3500/- to Rs. 7000/- or the minimum wages; the Payment of Wages Act, 1936  enabling payment of Wages to employees by Cash or Cheque or crediting it to their bank account; the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986prohibiting employment of children below 14 years in any occupation or process;the Maternity Benefit Act 1961, increasing the paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks; Payment of Gratuity Act,1972 enhancing the gratuity limit of Rs. 10 lakhs to Rs. 20 lakhs.*******
