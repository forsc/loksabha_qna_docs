(ii) Ministry of Power released a notification on charging infrastructure standards permitting private charging at residences and offices. (iii) Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) announced that battery-operated vehicles will be given green license plates and be exempted from permit requirements.(iv) MoRTH issued a notification advising states to waive road tax on EVs, which in turn will help reduce the initial cost of EVs.
