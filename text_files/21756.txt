It can increase morbidity and mortality by reducing resistance to infections. The overall under five child mortality rate was 49.7 as per NFHS-4. However, the preliminary data of NFHS-5 released for 22 States/UTs shows a declining trend in under 5 mortality rate.(c) to (e) Anganwadi Services is a self-selecting Scheme which is universal and open to all beneficiaries without any pre-condition, so as to extend services under the Scheme to all the habitations including SC/ST and Minority across the country. States/UTs have been requested time to time to optimize coverage of beneficiaries including child beneficiaries. Further, directions have been issued to all States/UTs for conducting local survey of Anganwadi Centres under their jurisdiction and get the children of appropriate age enrolled at the AWCs, if not already enrolled. States/UTs were also advised to ensure that any child, pregnant woman or lactating mother, coming to the AWC must be provided age appropriate supplementary nutrition, irrespective of their enrollment at the AWCs.  *****
