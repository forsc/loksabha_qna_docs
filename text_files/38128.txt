                                                         (a to d):  Malnutrition amongst children is a major challenge in the area of Tribal regions of the country.        Government accords high priority to the issue of malnutrition, particularly in respect of children.  The Ministry of Health and Family welfare, Woman and Child Department and Ministry of Tribal affairs have undertaken various initiatives to provide adequate nutrition among the pregnant women, mothers and children across country including  tribal areas. (A).  Under National Health Mission (NHM), the Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, Adolescent Health and Nutrition (RMNCAH+N) is implemented across the life cycle to improve health of women and children including tribal children.
