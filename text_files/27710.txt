PMKVY has two training components, namely, Short-Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). Under PMKVY-STT, training is being imparted through empanelled training centres (TCs) whereas under PMKVY-RPL, orientation/bridge courses are being organized in camps, employer premises, and small and medium enterprises.

Further, under third phase of PMKVY i.e. PMKVY 3.0, local administration is also being involved for orientation/bridge course in camps for the candidates under RPL component.
