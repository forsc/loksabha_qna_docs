ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT (SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (c): The study titled  “Emerging Employment Patterns of 21st Century India” is only one of the studies commissioned by Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM). This study is available at www.indicus.org/publications.php The findings of this study have been contested by other studies, including another study commissioned by EAC-PM which is available at https://eacpm.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/population-education-and-employment-in-India-1983-2018.pdf. Thus, the conclusion of different studies vary.	Government has taken several initiatives to improve working conditions of the labour force. Government has undertaken amalgamation and rationalization of different labour laws into 4 labour codes  viz The Code on Wages, the Code on Industrial Relations, the Code on Social Security and Welfare and the Code on Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions. The Labour Codes envisage extension of minimum wages and timely payment of wages to all workers, provision of appointment letter, annual medical check-up, grievance redressal mechanism for workers, and safety and other welfare measures.  *****
