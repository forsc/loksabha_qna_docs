However, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has been supplementing the efforts of State Governments by issuing various advisories from time to time. MHA has advised the States to establish special study centres in prisons and organize workshops to popularise educational programmes offered by National Open School, Distance Education Board and Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU), etc. for education of inmates.A comprehensive Model Prison Manual 2016 was also forwarded to all States and UTs in May, 2016. The Manual has a dedicated chapter on ‘Education of Prisoners’, which provides that at the time of admission in the prison, prisoners should be classified on the basis of their academic/educational qualifications and their aptitude for further learning. It has been emphasised that education is vital for the overall development of prisoners and that education of illiterate young offenders and adult prisoners shall be compulsory. State and UT-wise number of prisoners who have benefitted from educational  facilities  in  prisons  during the year 2019 are given in Annexure-II.                                                  ******
