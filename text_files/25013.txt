                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)&(b)	The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is monitoring the generation of COVID -19 Biomedical waste (BMW) through the COVID19BWM App. Out of 202 operational Common Biomedical Waste Treatment Facilities (CBWTFs) across the country, 195 CBWTFs are reporting their data on the app. About 56898.14 Ton of COVID-19 BMW generation has been reported on the app from June-2020 to June 2021. The CPCB has taken following steps to ensure that CBWTFs report data on the COVID19 BMW app:•	Show Cause Notices were issued to 106 CBWTFs for not using the COVID19BWM tracking App in July, 2020;•	33 CBWTFs were directed to deposit Environmental Compensation charges in September, 2020;•	Out of the above-mentioned 33 CBWTFs, 28 CBWTFs have started reporting data on the App, while two(2) CBWTFs have deposited the Environmental Compensation Charges. Another two (2) CWTFs have partially submitted Environmental Compensation Charges and action under Section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 is initiated by CPCB for remaining non-compliances;•	State Pollution Control Boards/Pollution Control Committees (SPCBs/ PCCs) have been requested vide email dated 15.04.2021 to: (i) ensure daily usage of Tracking App by Healthcare Facilities and CBWTFs, and (ii) submit daily data related to COVID-19 BMW through app or an email;(c)&(d)	The CPCB guidelines for ‘Handling, Treatment and Disposal of Waste Generated during Treatment/ Diagnosis/ Quarantine of COVID-19 Patients’ prescribe for extended operation of CBWTFs (in terms of hours) to treat and dispose incremental quantity of BMW generated from COVID-19 treatment in consultation with respective SPCBs/ PCCs. Further, the guidelines also prescribe that in case of increased generation of yellow color-coded (incinerable) COVID-19 waste (i.e. beyond the capacity of existing CBWTFs and captive BMW incinerators), respective SPCBs/ PCCs may permit disposal of such BMW through Hazardous Waste incinerators at existing Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facilities or captive industrial incinerators ensuring separate arrangement for COVID19 BMW handling and waste feeding. The CPCB, in the matter of O.A. 710/2017before the Hon’ble National Green Tribunal, has also recommended for setting up of CBWTFs in following States/Union Territories (UTs):•	States - Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura•	UTs - Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep****
