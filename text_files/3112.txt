Further, in exercise of powers conferred under proviso to Article 309 read with Articles 233 and 234 of the Constitution, the respective State Government, in consultation with the High Court, frames the Rules and Regulations regarding the issues of appointment, promotion, reservations etc. of Judicial Officers in the State Judicial Service.  Therefore, Central Government has no role in this regard.  As per information made available by State Governments / High Courts on the web-portal hosted on the website of Department of Justice, sanctioned and working strength of Judicial Officers in District and Subordinate Courts are 23,235 and 17,785 respectively, leaving 5,450 posts of Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Courts vacant.  State-wise list is at Annexure.The following steps have been taken by the Government to facilitate filling of vacancies in lower judiciary:-(i)	In September, 2016, Union Minister of Law & Justice wrote to the Chief Ministers of States and the Chief Justices of High Courts to enhance the cadre strength of the District and Subordinate Courts and provide physical infrastructure to the State judiciary.  The same was reiterated in May, 2017.  In August, 2018, in the context of increasing pendency of cases, the Union Minister of Law & Justice has written to all Chief Justices of High Courts to monitor the Status of the vacancies regularly and to ensure proper coordination with the state Public Service Commission to fill up vacant posts as per time schedule prescribed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the Malik Mazhar Sultan case.(ii)	The filling up of vacancies is also being monitored by the Supreme Court in a suo-motu Writ Petition (Civil) No. 2 of 2018.(iii)	A series of meetings were held by Secretary, Department of Justice with Registrars General of all High Courts and Law Secretaries of all State Governments / UTs through Video Conferencing in the month of January, 2018, July, 2018 and November, 2018 to follow up on filling up posts of Judicial Officers in District and Subordinate Courts.(iv)	The Department of Justice has hosted a web-portal on its website for reporting and monitoring of sanctioned and working strength, and vacancies of Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Courts on monthly basis.(v)	In order to facilitate regular filling up of these vacancies in a smooth and time-bound manner, the Department of Justice vide its letter dated 28th April, 2017 suggested creation of a Central Selection Mechanism to the Hon’ble Supreme Court. The Hon’ble Supreme Court suo motu converted the Government’s suggestions into a Writ Petition on 09th May, 2017 and directed all State Governments (including Union Territories) to file their responses and suggestions by way of affidavits to the Supreme Court Registry.Appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts is made under Article 124 and 217 of the Constitution of India respectively.  These Articles do not provide for reservation for any caste or class of persons.  The Government has, however, been requesting the Chief Justices of the High Courts that while sending their recommendations for appointment of Judges in respective High Courts, due consideration be given to suitable candidates belonging to Schedule Castes, Schedule Tribes, Other Backward Classes, Minorities and Women.  Suggestions / representations from various quarters for providing reservations in Judicial Appointments are received from time to time.  (e) to (g) : There is no proposal at present to amend the Constitution so as to provide reservations in Appointments of Judges in Supreme Court and High Courts.**************** Statement referred to Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 2835 for reply on 10th July, 2019 regarding Reservation in Judicial Recruitment.Sanctioned / Working Strength and Vacancies of Judicial Officers in District and Subordinate Courts (As on 04.07.2019)Sr. No.	Name of State / UT	Sanctioned Strength	Working Strength	Vacancies1	Andaman and Nicobar	12	12	02	Andhra Pradesh	597	537	603	Arunachal Pradesh	32	26	64	Assam	430	344	865	Bihar	1847	1174	6736	Chandigarh	30	30	07	Chhattisgarh	468	397	718	D & N Haveli	3	3	09	Daman & Diu	4	3	110	Delhi	758	535	22311	Goa	50	44	612	Gujarat	1506	1135	37113	Haryana	658	485	17314	Himachal Pradesh	167	154	1315	Jammu and Kashmir	312	233	7916	Jharkhand	676	453	22317	Karnataka	1307	1104	20318	Kerala	537	465	7219	Lakshadweep	3	3	020	Madhya Pradesh	2021	1524	49721	Maharashtra	2147	2025	12222	Manipur	55	40	1523	Meghalaya	97	39	5824	Mizoram	64	46	1825	Nagaland	33	27	626	Odisha	917	737	18027	Puducherry	26	11	1528	Punjab	675	588	8729	Rajasthan	1348	1130	21830	Sikkim	25	19	631	Tamil Nadu	1174	887	28732	Telangana	413	341	7233	Tripura	120	88	3234	Uttar Pradesh	3416	1989	142735	Uttarakhand	293	228	6536	West Bengal	1014	929	85Grand Total	23,23517,7855,450
