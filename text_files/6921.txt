                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a) & (b): NITl was constituted to actualize the goal of competitive and cooperative federalism among States. To drive the spirit of competition among States/UTs, NITl has sought to establish a structure of evidence based policy making by devising robust mechanism for monitoring and evaluation of outcomes in key sectors of governance. The Output Outcome Monitoring Framework developed by NITl Aayog has created a paradigm shift from outlays to outcome based governance for improved evidence-based policy-making. Focusing on effective management and better outcomes backed by data analysis, NITl has developed a number of social indices and dashboards.(c) & (d): The performance of States in various sectors such as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), health, water resources, education, innovation, have been ranked by SDG India Index, Health Index, Composite Water Management Index, School Education Quality Index and India Innovation Index respectively and these indices are also used for Ranking of States & UTs.  They primarily demonstrate best practices in the high ranking States/UTs and also enable peer learning as well as sharing of best practices among various States/UTs. These reports are available at NITI website www.niti.gov.in. -----
