ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE					(SHRI AJAY BHATT)IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE   (a) There is no official information that India is one of the top importers of military hardware globally since no country officially reveals information on their import of defence equipment.(b) During the last three financial years (2018-19 to 2020-21) 59 contracts have been signed with foreign vendors for capital procurement of defence equipment of Armed Forces. The countries from which defence equipment sourcing is being undertaken include Russia, USA, Israel, France etc.(c) Defence Testing Infrastructure Scheme (DTIS) has been launched by the Government of India to promote indigenous defence production, with special focus on participation of MSMEs and Start-ups by bridging gaps in defence testing infrastructure in the country. The objective of this scheme is to set up Defence Testing Infrastructure that will provide easy access and meet the testing needs of the domestic defence industry.(d) Defence Testing Infrastructure is often capital intensive requiring continuous upgradation and it is not economically viable for individual defence industrial units to set up in-house testing facilities. Setting up of Defence testing Infrastructure will provide easy access and thus meet the testing needs of domestic defence industry.(e) The DTIS scheme is to run for the five years with implementation date of March 2025.*****
