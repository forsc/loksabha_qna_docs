Kochi to Koottanad section (96 km) has been commissioned in June, 2019 and another 47 km of this section is ready for commissioning.Initially pipeline laying contracts were awarded in January, 2012 and construction works started in February, 2012. However, construction works were stopped in year 2013 due to severe resistance against Right of User (RoU) opening in Kerala. Subsequently in 2015, with support from Government of Kerala, construction activities were re-commenced from September / October, 2017 onwards. Further, Kochi-Koottanad-Mangalore section has beenseverely affected with unprecedented floods during August-September, 2018 which resulted in delay of projects.(d) The expected final cost of this project is Rs. 4,915 crore.
