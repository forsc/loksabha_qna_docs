ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR) (a.& b): On receiving the reports of occurrence of Dengue cases in 2021, multidisciplinary Central Teams were deputed to 15 States and UTs. The teams observed that -i) Prolonged and intermittent rains resulted in high dengue vector density due to large number of breeding places, ii) Vector Borne Disease field staff was involved in duties assigned for various activities for COVID-19 which affected public health measures for prevention and control of Dengue and iii) Gaps observed in monitoring of key entomological indicators which provide early warning signals about abundance of vector density which may lead to increase in transmission if preventive actions are not taken proactively. (C): Majority of people infected with dengue virus are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms such as an uncomplicated fever. A few may develop severe illness, and complications those may require hospitalization. Government of India has not received any report from the States that COVID pandemic has affected the treatment of dengue patients. However, as a precautionary measure, during 2020 Government of India developed National guidelines on Dengue case management during Covid-19 Pandemic involving Experts, which was approved by Joint Monitoring Group (JMG) under Chairmanship of DGHS, and was shared with all the States and Stakeholders for implementation.
