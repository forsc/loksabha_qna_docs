ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SH. ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a), (b) & (c): The gross Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection of September, 2019 was the lowest since Feb, 2018 when the collection was Rs. 85,962 crores. The monthly gross GST collection (CGST+ SGST+ IGST+ GST Compensation Cess) for the financial year 2018-19 and 2019-20 (till 31st Jan, 2020) is as under:(Figures in Rs. Crores)Month	2018-19	2019-20April	103459	113865May	94016	100289June	95610	99939July	96483	102083August	93960	98202September	94442	91916October	100710	95379November	97637	103491December	94726	103184January	102503	110818February	97247	March	106577	Total	1177369	1019167The Budgeted Estimate (BE) of GST revenue collection (CGST+ IGST+ GST Compensation Cess) for FY 2019-20 is Rs. 6,63,343 crores as against net actual collection (as per Principal Chief Controller of Accounts, CBIC flash figures) of Rs. 4,44,009 crores till December, 2019.(d) The GST collection in any particular month depends upon the total taxable value of goods or services or both supplied in that month. However, it can be seen that the GST collections have been more than Rs. 1 lakh crore for the last three months and the collection in January, 2020 has been the second highest since implementation of GST.(e) The steps taken by the Government to achieve the target set for this financial year are GST rate rationalization to improve tax compliance, mandatory e-filing and e-payment of taxes, penalty for delayed payment, extensive use of third party sources such as State VAT Department, Income Tax etc. for compliance verification, regular enforcement & compliance verification of tax returns, taxpayer education and media campaign etc.*****
