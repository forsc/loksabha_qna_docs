                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a) 	As per the report published by the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) & the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) - “The World of Organic Agriculture Statistics and Emerging Trends 2020” – India’s share in world organic exports is less than 1 percent. The Government of India has been promoting organic farming in the country, including organic cultivation of fruits and vegetables, through dedicated schemes namely Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER) to cater to the needs of domestic and export markets respectively. Both the schemes stress on end-to-end support to organic farmers i.e. from production to certification and marketing. Post-harvest management support including processing, packing and marketing has been made integral part of these schemes to encourage organic farmers.(b) 	The details of percentage distribution of various value-added organic products that were exported from India in 2019-20, are at Annexure-I. The details of top five organic products exported from India are at Annexure-II.(c) 	For promotion of export of its scheduled products, including vegan products, APEDA implements ‘Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Promotion Scheme of APEDA’. APEDA undertakes/ provides assistance for various activities under its scheme viz. facilitating participation of exporters in international trade fairs, organising Buyer-Seller Meets (BSMs), organising capacity building programmes for exporters and also for farmers for export-oriented production,  providing assistance for creation of infrastructure and implementing protocols for ensuring quality of exports etc.  ****** Annexure-IPercentage Distribution of Various Value-added Organic Products exported ( 2019-20)S.
