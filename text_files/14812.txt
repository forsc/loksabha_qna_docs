ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b) Proposals for opening of Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) are considered only ifsponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments /Union Territories Administrations thereby committing resources for setting up a new KV aswell as the availability of necessary sanction of the Government. For State sponsored KVsunder the Civil Sector, as per the norms of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS), theproposals should come from the State Government instead of from District Collectors. KVShas informed that it had received 4 proposals directly from the District Administrations foropening of new KVs at Asifabad, Suryapet, Vikarabad and Narsampet in Telangana. Thediscrepancies noticed during the scrutiny of these proposals have been brought to the noticeof the State Government of Telangana for necessary rectification.(c) to (e) Yes, Sir. The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme provides for opening of one JawaharNavodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country. All the districts of pre-bifurcatedState of Andhra Pradesh were covered under Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme (exceptHyderabad which is an urban district). After bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, 9 of its districtscame under the jurisdiction of the newly formed State of Telangana. The remaining newlycarved districts of Telangana do not have any JNVs. Opening of new JNVs is a continuousprocess which depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government / UTadministration to make available requisite suitable land free of cost and making availablerequired temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building isconstructed. However, actual sanction and opening of the JNV depends on the availability offunds and approval by the Competent Authority. As such no time frame can be given in thisregard.*****
