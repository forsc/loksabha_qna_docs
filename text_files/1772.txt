ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (e):  	   A statement is laid on the Table of the House.--2--STATEMENT IN REPLY TO THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *150 FOR 02.07.2019The Central Government has adopted a multi-pronged approach to ensure effective surveillance and domination of international borders to check infiltration of illegal migrants.  Physical infrastructure like border fencing, floodlighting, construction of border roads and establishment of border outposts has been created.  Vulnerable border outposts are regularly reviewed and strengthened by deploying additional manpower, special surveillance equipments and other force multipliers. A technological solution in the form of Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS) has been implemented in some vulnerable border areas.  	Border guarding forces conduct regular patrolling, lay nakas and establish observation posts and carry out anti-tunnelling exercises to stop illegal infiltration.  However, some illegal migrants are able to sneak into India in a clandestine and surreptitious manner, mainly due  to difficult mountainous and riverine terrain in parts of the long international borders.  There is no accurate central data regarding exact number of such illegal immigrants. As per the Constitutional scheme, India, as a sovereign nation, has the first and foremost constitutional duty and obligation towards its citizens  to  ensure  that demographic and social structure of the country is not changed  to  their  detriment  and  resources of the nation are utilised to fulfil the fundamental    rights   of   Indian   citizens   and   are   not    diverted   to   the--3--L.S.S.Q.NO. 150 FOR 02.07.2019detriment of citizens of India due to influx of illegal immigrants into the territory of India.  	To deal with such illegal immigrants, the powers of the Central Government under Section 3 of The Foreigners Act, 1946 to detect, detain and deport illegal foreign nationals and powers under Section 5 of The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 to remove an illegal foreigner by force have been entrusted under Article 258(1) of the Constitution of India to all the State Governments. Further, under Article 239(1) of the Constitution of India, Administrators of all Union Territories have also been directed to discharge the functions of the Central Government relating to the aforesaid powers. 	Central Government has also issued consolidated instructions regarding deportation/repatriation of foreign nationals to all States & UTs vide MHA letter No.25022/19/2014-F.I dated 24.04.2014.  Further advisories   have   also   been   issued   to the  State   Governments/UT Administrations regarding identification of illegal migrants and monitoring thereof, vide MHA letter No.24013/29/Misc./2017-CSR.III(i) dated 08.08.2017 and letter No.25022/63/2017-F.IV dated 28.02.2018.  The State Governments/UT Administrations have been taking action against illegal immigrants by booking them under the relevant provisions of The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 and The Foreigners Act, 1946.  ******
