                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                          (HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a)	to (c) Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has informed that the amendment in the Unified Building Bye Laws  2016 (UBBL 2016) notified on 12.02.2020, has incorporated the provisions for Child Care Room (CCR) and Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure (EVCI).  The provision for CCR has been made as per the directions of the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi in the Writ Petition (Civil) 7356/2018. The provisions for EVCI have been incorporated based on the Guidelines and Standards for Charging Infrastructure for Electric Vehicles issued on 14.12.2018 and 01.10.2019 by the Ministry of Power.  (d) 	The Sanction Letter for Building Plans (Form B1 of UBBL 2016) clearly stipulates that “All the provisions of the UBBL 2016 shall have to be followed.  Violation of Building Bye-Laws will not be compounded.”  The Sanction Letter further provides that “…Any deviation done against the bye-laws is liable to be demolished and the sanctioned plan may be revoked.  The Architect, Engineer, Supervisor engaged on the job will run the risk of having his/ her license cancelled…..”.In the event of non-adherence/deviation from the approved building plans, the concerned local bodies issue show cause notice and take action under the relevant provisions of their respective Acts.                                  ******
