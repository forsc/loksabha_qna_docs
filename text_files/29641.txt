                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a):		 The Code on Wages, 2019, provides for universal minimum wage and floor wage across organized and unorganized sector. The Code mandates the Central Government to fix floor wage applicable across the Central and the State sphere.  Section 9 of the Code lays Contd..2/-::  2  ::down that the minimum rates of wages fixed by the appropriate Government under section 6 shall not be less than the floor wage. The said provisions of the Code on Wages, 2019, have not come into force.(b):		 Periodic revision of the minimum wages is a statutory requirement. Under the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, both the Central and the State Governments are appropriate Governments to fix, review and revise the minimum wages of the employees employed in the scheduled employments including agriculture  under their respective jurisdictions. The Central Government and the State Governments are mandated under section 3(1) (b) of the Act to revise the Minimum Rates of Wages payable to the employees engaged in the scheduled employments in their respective jurisdictions at intervals not exceeding five years. Accordingly, the minimum rates of wages in the scheduled employments in the Central sphere were last revised by the Central Government in 2017. The details of periodic revision of minimum rates of wages in the scheduled employments in the State sphere are not Centrally maintained. Further, in order to take care of the rising prices, the Central Government revises the Variable Dearness Allowance (V.D.A) on basic rates of minimum wages every six months effective from 1st April and 1st October every year on the basis of Consumer Price Index for Industrial workers. V.D.A. was last revised w.e.f. 01.10.2021. A statement showing increase in the rates of wages on account of increasing V.D.A payable to the employees engaged in the scheduled employments in the Central Sphere is at Annexure.       (c) to (e):	On 26.08.2021, the Central Government has launched e-SHRAM portal which is a National Database of the Unorganised Workers. It has been made available to the States/UTs for registration of unorganised workers on e-SHRAM portal. It targets to register all eligible unorganised workers in the country. As on 01.12.2021, over 10.06 crore unorganised workers have been registered on e-SHRAM portal. All eligible registered unorganised workers are entitled to get benefit of an accidental insurance cover of Rs. 2.0 Lakh for a year free of cost through Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY).  One of the key objectives of the portal is to deliver the benefits of Social Security Schemes of the Central Government and the State Governments through e-SHRAM portal to the unorganized workers.*                                                         *******
