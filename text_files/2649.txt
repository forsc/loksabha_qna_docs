                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TOURISM (INDEPENDENT CHARGE)(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) to (c):	The Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) develops and regulates National Waterways declared by the Government for Navigation and Shipping. As informed by IWAI, River Cruise/Tourism has been a regular feature on National Waterways (NW) – 2 (River Brahmaputra) since last few years. Various private companies are operating Cruise Vessels on NW – 2. During the winter months of October – March, several vessels carry both foreign and domestic tourists regularly ply between Kaziranga and Dhubri in Assam.          Further, India and Bangladesh signed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on MoU on Passenger and Cruise Services on Coastal and Protocol routes between India and Bangladesh on 25.10.2018 which connects river Ganga (NW – 1) to river Brahmaputra (NW – 2) through Bangladesh. A Cruise vessel started its voyage on 29.04.2019 from Guwahati to Kolkata through Indo – Bangladesh Protocol route.           Development and promotion of tourist destinations and products including river cruise circuits and implementation of tourism projects is primarily the responsibility of the respective State Government/Union Territory (UT) Administration.         However, the Ministry of Tourism provides Central Financial Assistance (CFA) under relevant schemes to State Governments/Union Territory Administrations and to Central Agencies for various tourism projects including Cruise Terminals and Cruise Vessels, subject to availability of funds, submission of Utilisation Certificates for funds released earlier and adherence to the scheme guidelines. The Ministry of Tourism has received a proposal from IWAI for development of Jetties at various points of embarkation/disembarkation of River Cruises on National Waterways- I & II.*******
