ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(DR. SUBHAS SARKAR)(a) to (c): Section 19  of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 lays down the norms and standards for schools. Section 19(2) of the RTE Act, 2009 states that where a school established before the commencement of the RTE Act does not fulfil the norms and standards specified in the Schedule, it shall take steps to fulfil such norms and standards as its own expenses, within a period of three years from the date of the commencement of the RTE Act, 2009. Section 23 (2) of the RTE Act, 2009 had mandated 31st March, 2015 as the deadline for a teacher who, at the commencement of this Act, does not possess minimum qualifications as  laid down under Section 23(1) of the RTE Act, 2009 to acquire such minimum qualifications. However, the same was extended till 31st March, 2019.Education is in the concurrent list of the Constitution and majority of the schools are under the domain of the respective State and UT Government which is also the appropriate government as per Section 2(a) of the RTE Act, 2009.Therefore, the recruitment, service conditions and deployment of teachers comes under the purview of the respective State and Union Territory Government. The recruitment of teachers in schools is a continuous process and the vacancies keep arising due to retirement, resignation and additional requirements on account of enhanced students’ strength/ new schools. Further, the requirement of infrastructural facilities in schools are worked out every year by the respective State/Union Territory on incremental basis depending on their need and priority and reflected in their Annual Work Plan and Budget (AWP&B).******
