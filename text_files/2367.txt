                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) to (d)  As per Section 165(1) of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, a State Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, constitute one or more Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals for such area as may be specified in the notification for the purpose of adjudicating upon claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving the death of, or bodily injury to, persons arising out of the use of motor vehicles, or damages to any property of the third party so arising, or both. Sub-section (2) of Section 165 empowers the State Government to appoint such number of members as the State Government may think fit to appoint. Sub-section (3) of Section 165 empowers State Government to regulate distribution of business if there are two or more Claims Tribunals for an area. Thus, the matter regarding disposal of cases by Motor Accident Claims Tribunals comes under the jurisdiction of State Governments. The State-wise data for pending road accident cases/ compensation is not maintained by the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways.  *****
