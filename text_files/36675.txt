                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) Works related to conservation of natural and man-made water bodies like baolis, tanks, ponds, johads and lakes etc., as well as formulation of policy for the same, lie in the domain of the State Government concerned. However, some of the policies framed by Government of India in order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments in this regard, are as below: 1.	National Water Policy 2012 formulated by this Ministry, inter-alia, provides that encroachments and diversion of water bodies (like rivers, lakes, tanks, ponds, etc.) and drainage channels (irrigated area as well as urban area drainage) must not be allowed, and wherever it has taken place, it should be restored to the extent feasible and maintained properly2.	Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change has notified Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017 for protection, conservation and management of wetlands.3.	The provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974 are being implemented by the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) /Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) to regulate discharge of effluents and enforcement of standards in respect of polluting sources.4.	Government of India has stipulated general discharge standards and industry specific effluent discharge standards under Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, with an aim to prevent pollution in the water bodies.5.	‘Indicative Guidelines for restoration of water bodies’ have been issued by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) as a guidance to the stakeholders for ensuring restoration/ rejuvenation of water bodies. 6.	Guidelines for immersion of idols in water bodies formulated during 2010 has been revised and the “Revised Guidelines on Idol Immersion in Water Bodies “are being implemented in the country with effect from 1st January, 2021. (b) & (c) Government of India has launched the first census of water bodies in convergence with the sixth round of minor irrigation census (reference year 2017-18) under the centrally sponsored scheme “Irrigation Census”. The objective of the census of water bodies is to develop a national database for all water bodies by collecting information on all important aspects of the subject including their size, condition, status of encroachments, use, storage capacity etc. Information being compiled under this shall also include State wise and District wise details.***
