                                                        THE MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES & PUBLIC ENTERPRISES(SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a) & (b): The Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) function under the administrative control of the respective Ministries/ Departments. The complaints regarding malpractices in procurement and  awarding of contracts and tenders in respect of CPSEs  are dealt by Central Vigilance Commission, Vigilance Offices of respective Ministries/ Departments/ CPSEs and action is taken on them after investigation as per laid down procedure by the concerned authorities. (c): Government has issued instructions in July 2011 that all Government Ministries /Departments including their attached/subordinate offices and autonomous bodies may use the generally applicable Integrity Pact in their procurement transactions/ contracts. These instructions have also been extended in September 2011 to CPSEs. The administrative Ministry/ Department concerned is responsible for the implementation of the guidelines in respect of CPSEs under its control. The practice of entering into Integrity Pacts is expected to address corruption in procurement transactions/contracts and to promote transparency in public procurement. Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) has issued guidelines/ instruction to CPSEs for mandatory publication of tender enquiries on Central Public Procurement Portal (CPP) on 20th December, 2011 and on boarding of Government e-Marketplace (GeM) on 5th November, 2018.(d): In order to delegate operational autonomy to the CPSEs, Government has introduced Maharatna, Navratna and Miniratna schemes. The Board of such CPSEs are empowered to take decisions in the areas of capital expenditure, investment in joint ventures/subsidiaries, human resources management, etc. The appointment of functional Directors of CPSEs (CMD and fulltime Directors)  on the Boards of CPSEs is made on the basis of laid down eligibility criteria and selection process of Public Enterprises Selection Board  in line with job description/operational requirements of the CPSEs . Regarding listing of CPSEs, Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) has issued guidelines on 17.2.2017 laying down the mechanism and procedure for time-bound listing of CPSEs on stock Exchanges. DPE has also written on 13th March, 2020 to the administrative Ministries/ Departments to take appropriate steps, in coordination with DIPAM, to ensure timely listing of eligible unlisted CPSEs under their control.(e)&(f): DPE has issued guidelines on  15th May, 2008 which inter-alia provides that functional  Director  of  the  company  including  the  Chief   Executive   who   has retired/resigned from  the  service  of  the  company,  after  such  retirement/  resignation,  shall not accept  any  appointment  or  post,  whether  advisory  or  administrative,  in  any  firm  or company,  whether  Indian  or  foreign,  with  which  the  company has  or  had  business relations,  within  one  year  from his/her date  of  retirement  without the prior  approval  of Government. The guidelines also provide that the concerned   administrative   Ministry/Department   shall   examine   requests   received   from Functional Directors including Chief Executives on a case to case basis. For improvement in the functioning of CPSEs, DPE has issued guidelines on (i) Corporate Governance, and (ii) professionalization of Boards of CPSEs by appointment of Independent Directors on the Boards of CPSEs, and also organizing orientation programmes for capacity building of Directors of CPSEs, etc.***
