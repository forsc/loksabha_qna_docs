SHRI THOMAS CHAZHIKADAN: Will the Minister of SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT be pleased to state:(a) whether the Government is aware that in the State of Kerala, most of the applicants are not able to avail the benefits of Economically Weaker Section (EWS) Reservation as the criteria fixed for house plot and agricultural lands are not suitable to Kerala, if so, the details thereof; (b) whether there is no segregation of house plots and agricultural lands in Kerala, if so, the reasons thereof; (c) whether there is a necessity to amend the criteria of assets as prescribed by the Government since the residential houses are constituted in the agricultural land itself in Kerala, if so, the details thereof; (d) whether the Government has received any memorandum/petition to amend the criteria, if so, the details thereof; and (e) whether the Government would consider to amend the criteria to suit Kerala as the applicant is eligible even if he possesses agricultural land less than five acres; and (f) if so, the details thereof?

                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SUSHRI PRATIMA BHOUMIK)(a) to (d): The State Government of Kerala  has stated that many persons are not able to get benefit of the EWS reservations due to exclusion of households with 100 sq yards of residential land from the EWS category. In Kerala numerous families are residing in houses constructed in the agriculture properties/farms, and permission for construction requires at least 1452 Sq.yards of land. Therefore, the Government of Kerala have requested to delete the residential plot size and replace the same with the built up areas of house irrespective of the land parcel size and earmarked land utilization; and for amending the threshold value of exclusion criteria to 500 sq. yards in municipal area and 1000 sq yards in non-municipal areas.(e) & (f): Since the EWS category is meant for the most deprived households, and the eligibility conditions are decided for the country as a whole, it is not possible to specify a separate criteria for the State of Kerala.*****
