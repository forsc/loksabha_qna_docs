ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) Environmental conditions are quite complex and challenging. The Government is taking all possible steps for addressing these challenges to improve environment. Further, pollution of any geographical location is attributed mainly due to anthropogenic activities which inter-alia include activities like industrial, commercial, transportation, construction, etc. With the increase of population and demand for development, factors causing environmental pollution are both point and non point source in nature. For prevention and control of pollution, the Government has taken various steps like notification of industry specific emission and effluent standards under the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 and their enforcement through consent mechanism, regular monitoring, issuance of directions for installation of online effluent and emission monitoring systems for continuous check on pollution levels. (b) to (d) The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) implements two major afforestation schemes namely National Mission for a Green India (GIM) for plantation on landscape basis and National Afforestation Programme (NAP) for tree plantation in degraded forests through Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMCs) at village level. Already in every forest Division JFM Committees constituting local youth, women and men are in place. They are mainly involved in afforestation, forestry work and conservation activities. People’s participation in the tree plantation and forest conservation is encouraged. Afforestation activities are under taken by respective States in their programmes. The Ministry also supports the efforts of State Government through Central Sponsored Schemes (CSS). Every effort is made to make plantations successful and mortality replacements are carried out from time to time. However, quality of plantation sites, vagaries of nature and anthropogenic factors affect the overall survival of plantations.The forest cover has stabilized and has been gradually increasing over the years. The latest ‘India State of Forest Report (ISFR 2019) revealed that the total forest cover of the country is 7,12,249 square kilometres (which is 21.67 percent of the geographical area of the country) compared to 7,08,273 sq km (21.54 percent of the geographical area of the country) in ISFR 2017. This is an increase of 3976 sq km of forest cover combined, at the national level, as compared to the previous assessment i.e. ISFR 2017. Every two years, Forest Survey of India (FSI) under the Ministry undertakes assessment of country’s forest resources, the result of which are presented as the India State of Forest Report (ISFR). As per ISFR, 2019, district wise forest cover of Banswara District and Dungarpur District is 268.42 sq km and 302.30 sq km respectively. In Banswara- Dungarpur Parliamentary Constituency, there is an increase of 7.42 sq km and 11.30 sq km of forest cover in Banswara and Dungarpur District respectively compared to data published in ISFR 2017.(e) As per the report received from Rajasthan Forest Department, for monitoring and evaluation of development activities carried out under various schemes, a separate wing under various schemes, a separate wing under APCCF (M&E) is working in the department. Suitable actions are being taken against officers/employees who are responsible for plantation failure by the relevant rules of the concerned state. *****
