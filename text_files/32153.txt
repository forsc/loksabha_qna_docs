                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE(a): As per inputs received from public sector banks (PSBs), state and union territory (UT)-, and bank-wise details of loan outstanding by PSBs as on 30.9.2021, are at Annexure I.(b): As per inputs received from PSBs, state and UT- and bank-wise details of loan disbursed during the last three financial years and first half of the current financial year are at Annexure II.(c): As per inputs received from PSBs, state and UT- and year-wise details of repayment received in the loans disbursed during last three financial years and first half of the current financial year are at Annexure III. (d): Comprehensive steps have been taken to effect recovery and reduce non-performing assets (NPAs) in banks, which enabled PSBs to recover Rs. 5,49,327 crore over the last seven financial years. The steps taken include, inter alia, the following: (1)	Change in credit culture has been effected, with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) fundamentally changing the creditor-borrower relationship, taking away control of the defaulting company from promoters/owners, and debarring wilful defaulters from the resolution process. To make the process more stringent, personal guarantor to corporate debtor has also been brought under the ambit of IBC. Under IBC, resolution plans have been approved in 394 cases up to June 2021, with Rs. 2.45 lakh crore amount realisable by financial creditors.(2)	The Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 has been amended to make it more effective, with provision for three months’ imprisonment in case the borrower does not provide asset details, and for the lender to get possession of mortgaged property within 30 days.(3)	As per RBI instructions, wilful defaulters are not sanctioned any additional facilities by banks or financial institutions, and their unit is debarred from floating new ventures for five years.(4)	Wilful defaulters and companies with wilful defaulters as promoters/directors have been debarred from accessing capital markets to raise funds, vide Securities and Exchange Board of India (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2016.(5)	Jurisdiction of Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRTs) was increased from Rs. 10 lakh to Rs. 20 lakh to enable the DRTs to focus on high value cases resulting in higher recovery for the banks and financial institutions. Six new DRTs have also been established to expedite recovery.(6)	With Government infusion supplementing the raising of capital by PSBs from market, PSBs have achieved a high provisioning coverage ratio of 83.7% as on 31.3.2021, equipping them to take decision on resolution of NPAs without being constrained on account of such decision impacting their profitability.(7)	Key reforms have been instituted as part of the Public Sector Banks Reforms Agenda, including, inter alia, the following:(i)	Stressed Asset Management Verticals were set up in banks for focused slippage prevention, recovery arrangement and time-bound action in respect of large-value stressed assets.(ii)	Board-approved loan policies of PSBs now mandate tying up necessary clearances/approvals and linkages before disbursement, scrutiny of group balance-sheet and ring-fencing of cash flows, non-fund and tail risk appraisal in project financing.(iii)	Use of third-party data sources for comprehensive due diligence across data sources has been instituted, thus mitigating risk on account of misrepresentation and fraud.(iv)	Monitoring has been strictly segregated from sanctioning roles in high-value loans, and specialised monitoring agencies combining financial and domain knowledge have been deployed for effective monitoring of loans above Rs. 250 crore.(v)	To ensure timely and better realisation in one-time settlements (OTSs), end-to-end OTS platforms have been set up in PSBs.  *** 												Annexure I											Amounts in crore Rs.State-wise details of loans outstanding of Public Sector Banks as on 30.9.2021S.
