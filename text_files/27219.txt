ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) 	Yes, Sir.  The sanitation status of India as per the report of UNICEF and World Health Organization’s Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) titled as ‘Progress on Household Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene 2000-2020 – Five Years into the SDGs’ is given below:National Sanitation Estimates (%)At-least Basic	71Limited(shared)	12Unimproved	2Open Defecation	15JMP methodology involves gathering data from various researches and reports conducted on the subject and derive conclusions using them. Many of these surveys and reports are based on very small samples and use varied methodologies and are generally not representative of the ground situation. JMP does not use primary survey or research to derive the ground situation. Hence JMP at best provides an estimate derived from different reports and is not a true reflection of the ground level situation.(b) 	Sanitation is a State subject. Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, has been implemented through the State Governments to improve overall sanitation in rural areas. Government of India provides financial and technical assistance to the State Governments and issues guidelines to support them to implement the programme. Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) guidelines inter alia provide that a duly completed toilet shall have water storage facility for hand washing and cleaning to ensure that proper hygiene is maintained. Further, under SBM (G), rural pans are used that require only 1-2 litre of water for flushing.  Further, under the Jal Jeevan Mission, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, being implemented in the country, it has been envisaged to provide piped water supply to every rural household in the country.*****
