Under this scheme few of the enablers like assured price for offtake of CBG withlong term agreements by OGMCs; inclusion of bio manures produced from CBG plants asFermented Organic Manure (FOM) under Fertilizer Control Order 1985; inclusion of CBGprojects under Priority Sector Lending by RBI have been provided.(b) So far 9 CBG plants have been commissioned and started supply of CBG underSATAT scheme. These plants are located in Andhra Pradesh (1No.), Gujarat (3 No.),Haryana (1 No.), Maharashtra (3 No.) and Tamil Nadu (1No.).These plants are set up byentrepreneurs and private companies who have raised financial resources to develop theseplants on the basis of LoIs issued by OGMCs.(c) Technology for a plant is chosen by the entrepreneurs depending upon various factorsincluding feedstock techno-commercial feasibility, etc. Conversion of waste/ bio-mass intoCBG has multiple benefits viz. reduction of natural gas import, reduction of GHG emission,reduction in burning of agriculture residues, remunerative income to farmers, employmentgeneration, effective waste management etc., and at present is being supplied as fuel intransportation sector.
