ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) State/UT-wise details of LPG connections released under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) are at Annexure.(b) No Sir. At present, no such proposal is under consideration of the Government.(c) The demand of LPG is increasing from year to year basis. The domestic LPG consumption during 2016-17 was 18,868 TMT, which has increased to 21,728 TMT in 2018-19. In order to strengthen the supply network to cater the increased LPG customers including PMUY customers, Oil Marketing Companies have commissioned 6600 LPG distributorship across the country including rural areas during the last three years and the current Financial Year (upto 31.12.2019). OMCs have reported that all distributors, except Durgam Kshetriya Vitraks, are under instructions to make home delivery of LPG cylinders in their authorised area of operation. Further, in order to address accessibility, OMCs have taken assistance from Common Service Centres (CSC) to provide various digital services including LPG refill booking services on pan India basis to bridge the gap between the distributor network and the requirement of the customer.(d) PMUY was launched with an objective to provide clean cooking fuel to 8 crore LPG connections to poor households and that was achieved on 7th September, 2019. On implementation of the PMUY Scheme LPG penetration has increased from 61.9 % as on 01.04.2016 to 97.4 % as on 01.03.2020.(e) to (g) OMCs continuously monitor the refills taken by the PMUY beneficiaries and OMCs have reported that 89 % of PMUY beneficiaries who are at least one year four months old have come back for refill. PMUY beneficiaries have purchased more than 48 crore LPG refills till January, 2020. The number of refills purchased by the beneficiaries is indicative of the fact that users are shifting from use of Biomass to LPG for cooking purposes. Further, the LPG consumers including PMUY consumers, registered under PAHAL scheme, get cylinders at non-subsidised price and subsidy, as admissible, is transferred to consumers directly into his/her bank account subject to applicable cap on subsidized refills.
