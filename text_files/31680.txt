                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a)  to (d)   It is the responsibility of the States/Union Territories (UTs) and Local Bodies to ensure required treatment of sewage to the prescribed norms before discharging into rivers and other water bodies, coastal waters or land to prevent and control of pollution therein. As per the report of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of March 2021, 72,368 million litres per day (mld) of sewage is generated from urban areas in the country, against which 1469 nos. Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) of 31,841 mld treatment capacity are available. State/UT wise details of number of sewage treatment plants (STPs) are at Annexure-I.               As per the CPCB Report of March 2021, there are 38 STPs in Delhi, out of which 3 STPs are non-operational. Department of Environment, Govt. of National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi has informed that 28 STPs were found complying with design parameters based on value of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Total Suspended Solid (TSS). 8 STPs were found to be compliant with respect to stringent standards prescribed by Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) based on value of BOD and TSS = 10 milligram per litre (mg/l). DPCC is also conducting periodic sampling of major drains (24 nos.) outfalling in river Yamuna and at various locations (8 nos.) in the stretch of river Yamuna.               CPCB in association with various State Pollution Control Boards/Committees have been monitoring the water quality of rivers and other water bodies across the country through a network of monitoring stations under the National Water Quality Monitoring Programme. As per the last report published by CPCB in September 2018, 351 polluted stretches have been identified on 323 rivers in the country based on monitoring results in terms of Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), an indicator of organic pollution, which includes the Delhi stretch of river Yamuna as per details given below: Contd...P/2//2//River	Polluted river stretch	Priority(BOD value range)	BOD Range  (mg/l)Yamuna	Along Wazirabad to Asagpur	Priority I(BOD exceeding 30 mg/l)	9-80 For conservation of rivers, this Ministry has been supplementing the efforts of the States/UTs by providing financial and technical assistance for abatement of pollution in identified stretches of rivers in the country through the Central Sector Scheme of Namami Gange for rivers in Ganga basin, and Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) for other rivers. NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches on 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country with the project sanctioned cost of Rs.5961.75 crore, and inter-alia, a sewage treatment capacity of 2677 mld has been created. Under the Namami Gange programme, a total of 353 projects, including 157 projects for sewage treatment of 4952 mld and a sewer network of 5212 kms, have been sanctioned at a cost of Rs.30458 crore.Operation & Maintenance is the responsibility of State/UT Governments and the Local Bodies. Up-gradation and optimal operation of STPs is a continuous process and is attended to by them, as and when required. Such up-gradation is also taken up under NRCP and Namami Gange programme. 10 sewage treatment infrastructure projects at an estimated cost of Rs. 2296 crore have been sanctioned under the Namami Gange programme for creation/upgradation of the 1362 mld of sewage treatment capacity in Delhi.CPCB has issued directions on 21.01.2015 to the SPCBs/PCCs  under the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution), Act 1974 to issue directions to Local Authorities responsible for sewerage management in respective cities/towns and to submit time bound action plans for collection, transportation and treatment of sewage generated in urban areas. CPCB has also issued directions on 09.10.2015 to Local Authorities under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for sewage management in Class I Cities and Class II towns to ensure treated wastewater is disposed in accordance with the stipulated standards. Besides, in compliance of the orders of National Green Tribunal (NGT) in Original Application No.673/2018 regarding rejuvenation of polluted river stretches in the country, States/UTs are required to implement approved action plans, including setting up/upgradation of STPs, for restoration of the polluted stretches in their jurisdiction as identified by CPCB and published in their report of 2018, within the stipulated timelines. As per the orders of NGT, regular review on implementation of action plans is undertaken in the States/UTs and also at Central level. ***** ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3182 TO BE ANSWERED ON THE 16TH  DECEMBER, 2021 ON ‘NON- OPERATIONAL STPS’State/UT-wise details  of sewage treatment plant available including DelhiStates / UTs	Sewage Generation (in mld)	Installed Capacity (in mld)	Number of STPs Installed	Non Operational STPs	Operational Treat-ment Capacity(in mld)Andaman & Nicobar Islands	23	0	-	-	0Andhra Pradesh	2882	833	66	5	443ArunachalPradesh	62	0	-	-	-Assam	809	0	-	-	-Bihar	2276	10	1	0	0Chandigarh	188	293	7	1	271Chhattisgarh	1203	73	3	0	73Dadra   & Nagar Haveli	67	24	3	0	24Goa	176	66	11	0	44Gujarat	5013	3378	70	1	3358Haryana	1816	1880	153	0	1880Himachal Pradesh	116	136	78	0	99Jammu & Kashmir	665	218	24	6	93Jharkhand	1510	22	2	0	22Karnataka	4458	2712	140	32	1922Kerala	4256	120	7	4	114Lakshadweep	13	0	-	-	0Madhya Pradesh	3646	1839	126	3	684Maharashtra	9107	6890	154	7	6366Manipur	168	0	-	-	0Meghalaya	112	0	-	-	0Mizoram	103	10	1	1	0Nagaland	135	0	-	-	0NCT of Delhi	3330	2896	38	3	2715Orissa	1282	378	14	0	55Pondicherry	161	56	3	0	56Punjab	1889	1781	119	1	1601Rajasthan	3185	1086	114	10	783Sikkim	52	20	6	0	18Tamil Nadu	6421	1492	63	0	1492Telangana	2660	901	37	5	842Tripura	237	8	1	0	8Uttar Pradesh	8263	3374	107	8	3224Uttarakhand	627	448	71	2	345West Bengal	5457	897	50	13	337Total	72368	31841	1469	102	26869*****
