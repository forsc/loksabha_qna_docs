ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)	Government of India has been according the highest priority to obtain a permanent membership for India in an expanded United Nations Security Council. Towards this objective, India is actively engaged in the ongoing Inter-Governmental Negotiations (IGN) on United Nations Security Council reforms at the United Nations and has been working with other reform-oriented countries through its membership of the G-4 (India, Brazil, Germany and Japan) and the L.69 Group (cross-regional grouping of developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America). As a measure of its increasing stature and acceptability of its role in the United Nations Security Council, India was elected as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the 8th time during 2021-22, with an overwhelming majority (184 of 193 votes) during the elections held on June 17, 2020 in New York. A number of countries have bilaterally expressed official affirmations of support for India’s candidature to a permanent seat in an expanded United Nations Security Council. United Nations Security Council reforms and expansion of its membership, with India as a permanent member, continues to be one of Government of India’s key priorities in all its bilateral and multilateral engagements including at the highest levels and the Government is engaging with other countries on this issue.  ***
