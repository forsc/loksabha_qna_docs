ANSWER




ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH ANDFAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (d):       Water pollution / contamination can lead to an increase in water borne diseases and are a major public health concern. Details of cases and deaths caused by major waterborne diseases like Acute Diarrhoeal Disease and Enteric Fever (Typhoid) is attached at Annexure I. Water being a State subject, initiatives for water management, including its quality is primarily the responsibility of the States. However, various steps have been taken by Department of Water Resources for facilitating ground water quality improvement/ remediation of contamination in the country, as given below:a.	Data on ground water quality available with CGWB is being shared with concerned State Governments for taking necessary remedial measures.b.	CGWB constructs wells for Exploration of Ground Water. Successful contamination- free wells are handed over to the State Governments for gainful utilization.c.	Under the National Aquifer Mapping Programme (NAQUIM) of CGWB, special attention is being given to the aspect of ground water quality including contamination by toxic substances such as Arsenic in ground water.d.	Awareness generation programs/ workshop on various aspects of ground water including preventing ground water pollution and safe use of contaminated water are being conducted by CGWB periodically.The mainstay of combating ground water contamination is by provisioning of safe drinking water and accordingly Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation is supporting states through implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM). Under JJM, while planning water supply schemes to provide tap water supply to rural households, priority is given to quality affected habitations. While allocating the funds to States/ UTs in a particular financial year, 10% weightage is given to the population residing in habitations affected by chemical contaminants, as on 31st March of the preceding financial year.As indicated by Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, while states are planning & taking action for commissioning of piped water supply schemes based on a safe water source, as an interim measure States/ UTs have been advised to install community water purification plants (CWPPs) in such habitations, to provide potable water to every household to meet their drinking and cooking requirements.
