ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a)	The quota allocated to Haj Committee of India (HCoI) is distributed amongst the States/UTs on the basis of their respective Muslim population, based on the 2011 census figures as well as on the basis of number of applications. (b)	No, Sir. As per the new Haj Policy for HCoI pilgrims for Haj 2018-22, the surplus seats generated by underutilized quota of states are utilized for providing 500 seats to Mehram, 2000 additional seats to state of Jammu & Kashmir as a special measure, full quota to States/Union Territories receiving 500 or less Haj application forms and for the ladies going for Haj without Mehram. The quota still remaining is further allocated to States/Union Territories in proportion of number of applications received. This year, in 18 states, 100% applicants are going for Haj pilgrimage. (c)	The responsibility for making air travel arrangements for Haj Pilgrims selected by the Haj Committee of India is with the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA). The Annual Bilateral Agreement between India and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) provides that the Saudi air transport companies will share equally without any exception the transportation of Hajis with the Indian national carriers. Further, as per the conditions laid down by civil aviation authority of Saudi Arabia, no contracts are allowed to be made with any third party for transportation of Hajis. Accordingly, various airlines of India and Saudi Arabia participate in the bidding process for air travel of Haj pilgrims. For Haj 2019, three airlines namely Air India, Spicejet and Saudia Airlines are transporting pilgrims from 21 Embarkation Points. *****
