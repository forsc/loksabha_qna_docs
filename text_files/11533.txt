With a borderless cyberspace coupled with the possibility of instant communication and anonymity, the potential for misuse of cyberspace and social media platforms for criminal activities is a global issue. There are media reports about social media platforms being misused to spread rumours, fake news and defame public personalities.  The Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000 has provisions for removal/blocking of objectionable online content. Social media platforms are intermediaries as defined in the Act. Section 69A of the IT Act, 2000 empowers Government to block any information generated, transmitted, received, stored or hosted in any computer resource in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above. Further, section 79 of the Act provides that intermediaries are required to disable/remove unlawful content as and when brought to their knowledge by appropriate government or its agency or through a court order. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules 2011 notified under this section require that the intermediaries, which includes social media platforms, shall observe due diligence while discharging their duties and shall inform the users of computer resources not to host, display, upload, modify, publish, transmit, update or share any information that is harmful, objectionable, and unlawful in any way.Government has taken several steps to keep acheck on the spread of fake news, pornographic and anti-national content via social media platforms.

Section 67B of the Act specifically provides stringent punishment for publishing, browsing or transmitting child pornography in electronic form(iii)	Ministry of Home affairs (MHA) has issued a number of advisories which includes advisory on cyber-crime prevention and control dated 13.01.2018 and  also an advisory on incidents of lynching by mobs in some States fueled by rumors of lifting/kidnapping of children dated 04.07.2018.
