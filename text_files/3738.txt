ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (e):	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO  IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (e) OF THE  STARRED QUESTION NO *316 FOR ANSWER ON 15.07.2019  REGARDING SCHOLARSHIP SCHEMES OF TRIBAL STUDENTS. (a):	The Ministry is implementing following scholarship schemes for facilitating education of Scheduled Tribe (ST) students in the country: -(i)	Pre-Matric Scholarship for ST students (Class IX and X)(ii)	Post Matric Scholarship for ST students.(Class XI onwards)(iii)	National Fellowship and Scholarship for Higher Education for ST students.(iv)	National Overseas Scholarships for ST students for studying abroad.              The Ministry of Tribal Affairs has been implementing Centrally Sponsored schemes viz.,(i) Pre-Matric Scholarship and (ii)Post Matric Scholarship for Scheduled Tribe (ST) students, through the States/UTs.  The details of funds released and utilised under Pre-Matric and Post Matric Scholarship schemes for Scheduled Tribe students during the last three years and the current year, State/UT-wise and year-wise are as per Annexure.I & II respectively.            Under the scheme of National Fellowship and Scholarship for Higher Education for ST students, disbursement of scholarship is made to bank accounts of students by DBT mode/ identified Institutes.   In so far as the scheme of National Overseas Scholarships for ST students for studying abroad is concerned, the scholarship amount is disbursed through the Indian Missions abroad/   Ministry of External Affairs.  Details of funds released under these schemes during the last three years and the current year is given at Annexure.III.(b):  Under the Centrally Sponsored schemes  viz.,(i) Pre-Matric Scholarship and (ii)Post Matric Scholarship for Scheduled Tribe (ST) students, being implemented through States, the States Governments publish advertisements every year  in local newspapers/ social media about the applicability of the schemes, send circulars to Schools /Institutions and also organise Adivasi Vidyarthi Sammelan etc to make students aware of the scholarship schemes.  For Fellowship and National Overseas Scholarship for ST students, Ministry invites applications by publishing advertisements in Employment News and Ministry’s website, and the universities are also informed to advise the students to apply.  Applications for Scholarship for Higher Education (Top Class Education) of ST students are obtained on National Scholarship Portal (NSP) and, for this purpose, apart from details placed on the NSP, all the concerned Institutes are also informed to make the students aware of the scheme and to encourage them to register their applications for availing the scholarship.  (c ):	 The amount of scholarship whenever revised under the schemes for Scheduled Tribe  students at (a) above, are kept at par with similar schemes of other Ministries.  The enhancement, if any, in the amount of scholarship under the schemes as and when considered is decided by the competent authority from time to time.(d) & (e):	The receipt of proposals from the State Governments for grant in aid under the schemes (i)Pre-Matric Scholarship and (ii) Post Matric Scholarship for Scheduled Tribe (ST) students is an ongoing and continuous process.  These schemes are demand driven and funds are released on receipt of proposals complete in all respects including Utilization Certificates and subject to availability of funds in a particular year.  The State Governments/ UT Administrations have been regularly requested to submit their proposals well in time.    The DBT Mission has mandated that the amount of scholarship should go to the account of students by Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode.  In this regard, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs has informed all State Governments and emphasised the requirement of inviting applications through portal.   Nineteen (19) States use their own portal and seven (7) States use National Scholarship Portal (NSP) for receiving the applications.  This has resulted in timely receipt of applications, verification and disbursement of scholarship amount.***** Annexure-IAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. *316 for 15.07.2019 raised by Dr. Heena Gavit, Shri Sunil Dattatray Tatkare, MP regarding Scholarship Schemes of Tribal StudentsDetails of Fund Released and Utilization to State Governments/UT Administrations under the Scheme of Pre-Matric Scholarship for ST students(? in lakh)Sl.No.	Name of the State/UT	2016-17	 2017-18	 2018-19	 2019-20(as on. 10.07.19 )		Fund Released	Utilised 	Fund Released	Utilised 	Fund Released	Utilised 	Fund Released1	Andaman & Nicobar	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	5.00	0	_2	Andhra Pradesh	0.00	0.00	5282.94	5282.94	1210.81	696.53	_3	Arunachal Pradesh	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0	_4	Assam	321.33	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0	_5	Bihar	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0	7131.476	Chhattisgarh	2534.15	2534.15	1805.30	1805.30	4755.63	3760.58	_7	Dadar & Nagar Haveli	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	20.00	20.00	_8	Daman & Diu	0.00	0.00	8.04	8.04	0.00	0	5.899	Goa	52.64	52.64	3.75	3.75	80.83	63.95	_10	Gujarat	80.81	80.81	3650.84	3650.84	4482.31	4482.31	_11	Himachal Pradesh	51.21	51.21	0.00	0.00	38.91	28.21	_12	Jammu & Kashmir	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0	_13	Jharkhand	0.00	0.00	1704.53	1704.53	2345.92	1804.61	_14	Karnataka	0.00	0.00	1364.59	1364.59	1256.31	1003.18	_15	Kerala	796.40	796.40	0.00	0.00	308.73	308.73	287.3116	Madhya Pradesh	0.00	0.00	5539.17	5539.17	5884.33	5741.08	_17	Maharashtra	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0	_18	Manipur	867.38	867.38	619.09	619.09	773	0	_19	Meghalaya	0.00	0.00	156.69	122.94	0.00	0	_20	Mizoram	336.36	336.36	132.25	132.25	319.79	234.99	_21	Nagaland	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0	_22	Odisha	3376.36	3376.36	5134.98	5134.98	6665.88	6665.88	3405.9223	Rajasthan	0.00	0.00	3284.79	3284.79	1716.12	1716.12	_24	Sikkim	0.00	0.00	25.72	25.72	7.97	1.11	_25	Tamil Nadu	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0	_26	Telangana	0.00	0.00	358.02	358.02	693.84	638.45	_27	Tripura	0.00	0.00	232.89	0.00	0.00	0	_28	Uttar Pradesh	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0	_29	Uttarakhand	0.00	0.00	104.44	104.44	0.00	0	_30	West Bengal	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	584.62	400.65	_ 	Total	8416.64	8095.31	29408.03	29141.39	31150.00	27566.3810830.59 Annexure-IIAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. *316 for 15.07.2019 raised by Dr. Heena Gavit, Shri Sunil Dattatray Tatkare, MP regarding Scholarship Schemes of Tribal StudentsDetails of Fund Released and Utilization to State Governments/UT Administrations under the Scheme of Post-Matric Scholarship for ST students(? in lakh)Sl.No.	Name of the State/UT 	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20 (as on. 10.07.19)		Fund Released	Utilised	Fund Released	Utilised	Fund Released	Utilised	Fund Released1	A.& N.
