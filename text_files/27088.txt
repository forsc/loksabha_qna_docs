ANSWER




              THE MINISTER OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                       (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) to (c): A statement is laid on the table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) TO (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 260 DUE FOR ANSWER ON AUGUST 05, 2021 REGARDING “SHORTAGE OF DRINKING WATER IN CITIES”:(a) & (b):	State of Maharashtra has informed that none of its big and medium size city is facing very serious problem of drinking water.  Aurangabad, Latur, Solapur and Bhusawal are some of big/medium size cities of the State of Maharashtra, which are facing some shortage of drinking water.	Ministry of Jal Shakti (MoJS) has identified 255 Districts and 1,597 Blocks across the country as water stressed. From the information made available by MoJS, 756 ULBs have been identified as water stressed.(c):	Over exploitation of ground water, increase in population of cities and inefficient use of available water are some of the reasons for shortage of drinking water in cities.Urban Development is a State subject.  Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) supports States through programme interventions.  MoHUA has taken several steps towards sustainable management of water in urban areas through issuance of various guidelines and its national Missions, such as Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). Under AMRUT, Water Supply is one of the thrust areas.  Out of total approved plan size of ?77,640 crore of all the States/Union Territories (UTs) for the entire Mission period, ?39,010 crore (50%) has been allocated to Water Supply sector only. States/UTs have sanctioned projects worth ?42,148 crore in Water Supply sector under AMRUT, of which 676 projects worth ?10,021 crore have been completed, 647 projects worth ?31,763 crore are under implementation and 21 projects worth ?363 crore are at various stages of tendering.  Some States/UTs have taken projects in excess of approved SAAPs.  The entire cost of excess projects will be borne by the States/UTs themselves.So far, 107 lakh household have been provided water tap connections under AMRUT and in convergence with other schemes.Adequate focus has been given on requirement of rainwater harvesting and water conservation measures in Unified Building Bye Laws (UBBL) of Delhi, 2016, Model Building Bye Laws (MBBL), 2016 and Urban and Regional Development Plan Formulation and Implementation (URDPFI) Guidelines, 2014, formulated by MoHUA for the guidance of the States and their adoption suiting local conditions.
