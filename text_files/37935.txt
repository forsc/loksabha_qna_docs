Schedule VII of the Act indicates the eligible list of activities that can be undertaken by the companies as CSR. The Ministry vide General Circular no. 21/2014 dated 18th June, 2014 and 14/2021 dated 25th August, 2021 had clarified that items mentioned in Schedule VII are broad based and can be interpreted liberally.

(i) and (xii) promoting healthcare including preventive healthcare and sanitation, and disaster management respectively. Subsequently, Ministry vide General Circular no. 01/2021 dated 13.01.2021 had clarified that spending of CSR funds for carrying out awareness compaigns/programmes or public outreach campaigns on COVID-19 vaccination programme is an eligible CSR activity. Furthermore, vide General Circulars no. 05/2021, 09/2021 and 13/2021 dated 22.04.2021, 05.05.2021 & 30.07.2021 respectively, Ministry had also clarified that spending of CSR funds for setting up makeshift hospitals and temporary COVID care facilities and ‘creating health infrastructure for COVID care’, ‘establishment of medical oxygen generation and storage plants’, ‘manufacturing and supply of Oxygen concentrators, ventilators, cylinders and other medical equipment for countering COVID-19’ and COVID-19 vaccination for persons other than the employees and their families, are eligible CSR activities. As per input provided by Department of Public Enterprises(DPE), DPE has been issuing guidelines from the financial year 2018-19 to all administrative Ministries and Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) for adopting a theme-based focused approach every year on CSR expenditure by the CPSEs. The theme for the year 2021-22 was ‘Health & Nutrition, with special focus on COVID related measures including setting up makeshift hospitals and temporary COVID care facilities’.Under the Act, CSR is a Board driven process and the Board of the company is empowered to plan, decide, execute and monitor CSR activities based on the recommendations of its CSR Committee. The CSR framework is disclosure based and CSR mandated companies are required to file details of CSR activities annually in MCA21 registry. All data related to CSR filed by companies in MCA21 registry is available in public domain at www.csr.gov.in. CSR expenditure w.r.t. relief works related to COVID-19 is not required to be filed separately by the companies, however, the same is covered under the broader ambit of ‘Healthcare’ development sector. On the basis of the filings made by the companies in the MCA21 registry, details of CSR funds spent in ‘healthcare’ development sector by Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and Private companies, in the State of Maharashtra and in the districts of Bhandara and Gondia during the Financial Year (FY) 2019-20 and 2020-21 is as follows: (in Rs.
