The financial support from the Ministry along with the income generated by Auroville Foundation is used for meeting the objectives of strengthening the Auroville Foundation.(d): The Government has recently made appointment of full-time Secretary of the Auroville Foundation. The selection of the Chairman of the Governing Board of the Auroville Foundation is in process.*******
