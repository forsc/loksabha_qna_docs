However, under National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to States/UTs for strengthening their healthcare systems including modernization and equipping them with advanced diagnostic machines and increasing the number of doctors and employees in public healthcare facilities, based on the requirements projected by States/UTs in their annual Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs).            The annual approvals conveyed through Record of Proceedings (RoPs) after appraisal of PIPs for all the States/UTs including Karnataka for last three years are available in the public domain at the URL:  https://nhm.gov.in/index4.php?lang=1&level=0&linkid=449&lid=53.In an effort to improve the quality of services and provide a uniform benchmark to assess the functionality of public health facilities, Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) guidelines have been developed and disseminated among States/UTs, laying down norms for essential and desirable services for District Hospitals(DH), Sub-district Hospitals(SDH), Community Health Centres (CHC), Primary Health Centres(PHC), Sub- Health Centres (SHC).Under National Health Mission (NHM), States are also supported for upgradation of public healthcare facilities as per IPHS and construction as per norms of DHs, SDHs, CHC, PHCs and SHCs. Maternal and child health wings(MCH Wings) and other critical care areas like Operation theatre, Obstetric High Dependency Unit/Intensive care unit, Sick Newborn Care Unit, New Born Stabilization Unit, Nutritional Rehabilitation Centers, District Early Intervention Centers etc. are also supported.Further, as per the budget announcement 2017-18, 1.5 lakh Health Sub Centres and Primary Health Centres are to be transformed into Health and Wellness Centres across the country by December, 2022 under Ayushman Bharat (AB-HWCs) for provision of comprehensive primary care that includes preventive healthcare and health promotion at the community level with continuum of care approach.The AB-HWCs will provide an expanded range of services to include care for non - communicable diseases, palliative and rehabilitative care, Oral, Eye and ENT care, mental health and first level care for emergencies and trauma as well as Health promotion and wellness activities like Yoga apart from services already being provided for Maternal and Child Health including immunization and communicable diseases. Services at AB-HWCs are free and universal to all individuals residing in the service area.  So far, approvals for 52,744 Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs) have been accorded. Out of those, as reported by the States/UTs, 19,607 AB-HWCs are operationalized till 12th July, 2019.Under Free Drugs Service Initiative (FDSI) of National Health Mission, financial support is provided to States / UTs for provision of free essential medicines in public health facilities based on the requirements posted by them in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) within their overall resource envelope. All the States/UTs have reported that they have notified free drug policy in their respective States/UTs.The number of essential medicines to be provided free of cost is decided by the States and varies from State to State. However, the Ministry has provided illustrative list of essential medicines that should be provided at Sub Centres, Primary Health Centres, Community Health Centres and District Hospitals. The list is available in public domain at   nhsrcindia.org/sites/default/files/Facility wise essential Medicine 06 July-16.pdf.

The Government has taken various steps to encourage doctors to render their services in rural areas.  These efforts include:-•	Under NHM, States are encouraged to adopt flexible norms for engaging specialist doctors for public health facilities. These include various mechanisms for ‘contracting in’ and ‘contracting out’ of specialist services, methods of engaging specialists outside the government system for service delivery at public facilities, offering negotiable salaries to attract Specialists including flexibility in strategies such as ''You quote, we pay".•	Financial support is also provided to States for providing performance-based incentives, hard area allowance, providing accommodation and transport facilities in rural and remote areas, sponsoring training programmes, etc for engaged human resources to address the issue of shortage in the public health facilities.•	Also, States are advised to put in place transparent policies of posting and transfer, and ensure rational deployment of healthcare professionals. As the posts required for health facilities are filled up by respective State/UT Governments, they are impressed upon from time to time to fill up the vacant posts.
