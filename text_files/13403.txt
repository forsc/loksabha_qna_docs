ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	India is in the position of having the youngest population amongst the most populous countries in the world for at least the next decade and perhaps for two decades.  This is often regarded as a demographic dividend as the working age population ratio to those that need to be supported is very high.  However, it is to be noted that without the right conditions of education and gainful employment these demographics may not provide the expected dividend.(b)	 The Government has taken various steps for generating employment in the country like encouraging private sector of the economy, fast tracking various projects involving substantial investment. Schemes like Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM) and National Urban Livelihood Mission (DAY-NULM). Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana and Startup India are also being implemented by the Government for facilitating employment. Besides these initiatives, flagship programmes of the Government are also contributing to generate productive employment opportunities. Ministries/Departments/States run skill development schemes across various sectors to improve the employability of youth -2-and also facilitate placements. Schemes such as the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) wherein Government reimburses 25 percent of the stipend payable to apprentices also enhances employability of the youth to access employment. (c)	 Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (2016 - 2020) is the flagship outcome-based Skill Training Scheme of the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE) which aims to train 10 million youths by 2020 pan India including Rural and Urban areas. MSDE does not maintain any segregated data for rural and urban areas. There are three training routes under the scheme: Short term Training (STT) for fresh skilling of school / college drop outs and unemployed youth, Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) to recognize the existing skills and Special Projects to address skilling requirements of groups which are underrepresented or require special initiatives and efforts. RPL only provides orientation to the already skilled workforce, and does not mandate placements. Total of  33,29,328 candidates under STT, 1,62,616 candidates under Special projects and  33,20,021 candidates under RPL have been trained as per Systematic Data Management System reports up to 17.01.2020.  Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), a placement linked skill development program for rural poor youth under National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) all over the country. During the year 2019-20 (up to 31st October, 2019) 1, 27,918 candidates have been provided training.
