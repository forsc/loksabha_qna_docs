ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER FOR CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D.V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a) & (b):  Sir. There is no fixed trend in fertilizer consumption as evident from the figures annexed at  Annexure- ‘A’.  Also, the pattern of consumption of fertilizers in the country cannot be only attributed to the fertilizer prices. Urea is being provided to the farmers at a statutorily notified Maximum Retail Price (MRP). The MRP of 45 kg bag of urea is Rs.242 per bag (exclusive of charges towards neem coating and taxes as applicable) and the MRP of 50 kg bag of urea is Rs.268 per bag (exclusive of charges towards neem coating and taxes as applicable). The difference between the delivered cost of urea at farm gate and net market realization by the urea units is given as subsidy to the urea manufacturer/importer by the Government of India. Accordingly, all farmers are being supplied urea at the subsidized rates.Also, Government of India has implemented Nutrient Based Subsidy Policy w.e.f. 1.4.2010 for Phosphatic and Potassic (P&K) fertilizers. Under the policy, a fixed amount of subsidy, decided on annual basis, is provided on subsidized P&K fertilizers depending on their nutrient content with an objective to make available these fertilizers to farmers at a reduced price. Under this policy, MRP is fixed by fertilizer companies as per market dynamics at reasonable level. Average MRP of P&K fertilizers from the year 2010-11 to 2018-19 are at  Annexure –‘B’.(c):    Government of India has declared fertilizer as an essential commodity under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and notified Fertilizer Control Order, 1985 and Fertilizer (Movement Control) Order, 1973. State Governments have been adequately empowered to ensure selling of fertilizers at MRP besides stopping black marketing/smuggling of fertilizers. State Governments are empowered to conduct search, make seizures and take punitive action against any person violating provisions of FCO, 1985 and Essential Commodities Act, 1955.	Strict instructions have been issued to all State Governments for the effective monitoring of the fertilizer distribution and regular steps are being taken by the State Government to curb black-marketing of fertilizers. In order to check black-marketing, special raids are also organised in all districts of the State during Kharif and Rabi season. To maintain the availability of fertilizers in all parts of State, the supply monitoring are carried out by the senior officers of the Government at State and district level so that artificial scarcity cannot be created and reduce the chances of black marketing.******
