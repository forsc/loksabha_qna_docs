                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a):	Yes. As a part of observation of International Day of Yoga (IDY) on 21st June, 2020 this Ministry has reached out to people through digital media. Due to restrictions on mass gatherings arising from the contagious nature of COVID-19, the theme for International Day of Yoga (IDY) 2020 was adopted as ‘Yoga at Home, Yoga with Family’. The Ministry of AYUSH made various online resources available on its digital platforms like the Yoga Portal and the social media handles like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to provide ample opportunities for the people to learn Yoga from their homes. The Ministry also organized the ‘My Life, My Yoga (MLMY)’ i.e. the Jeevan Yoga video blogging contest with attractive prizes for the winners and runners-up in association with Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) in which contestants from 130 countries participated. (b):   Ministry of AYUSH has issued a document titled “Guidelines for Yoga practitioners for COVID 19” for improving immunity.The Ministry of AYUSH has launched a three-month awareness campaign on “Ayush for Immunity” on 14.08.2020, with the objective of acquainting the people with the strengths of various Ayush-based solutions including Yoga for enhancing immunity and preventing diseases. (c):   There is no separate fund allocated by the Ministry of AYUSH for research in Yoga in view of Covid-19 pandemic. (d):  The Ministry of AYUSH has intensified its digital and online activities for Yoga Education and Training to the aspirants and practitioners of Yoga through its three autonomous bodies namely Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga (MDNIY), New Delhi, Central Council for Research in Yoga & Naturopathy (CCRYN), New Delhi and National Institute of Naturopathy (NIN), Pune. Being openly disseminated online, the number of beneficiaries of the same is not maintained.Online discourses on Yoga by prominent Yoga gurus and experts were organized as a part of the promotional campaign for IDY 2020. From April to 15th July, 2020, MDNIY had conducted Online classes for the general public, wherein around 5 lakh people benefitted. To facilitate training from home, daily telecast of the Common Yoga Protocol (CYP) was organized on DD Bharti for making more and more people familiar with CYP and preparing them for the main event. (e):   At present Yoga is not a regulated system of healthcare. There are various Universities/Institutions which impart Yoga training to youth, not only at domestic level but also internationally. Ministry of AYUSH does not maintain data of such training. However, the interest in Yoga in the country and worldwide has grown with observation of International Day of Yoga in last 6 years, and more youth are inclined towards pursuing it.Further to this, at the Central level, Ministry of AYUSH also strives to promote the system and to create awareness for the benefit of the people. For this purpose an Information Education and Communication (IEC) Scheme, has been devised by the Ministry, activities under which include steps to reach out to people and to create awareness about Yoga. IEC activities include programs on TV, Radio, Print-media etc. Activities in this regard outside India are carried out by the Indian Missions abroad as well as ICCR.The Ministry had also activated all the Indian Missions and Posts abroad to promote and MLMY and Yoga at Home Yoga with Family actively. Prominent celebrities from the entertainment industry gave promotional messages on Yoga, encouraging the people to be active participants from their homes in the IDY.
