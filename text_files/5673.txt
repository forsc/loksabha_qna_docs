                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a)and (b): The Election Commission of India has informed thatfollowing the recommendations of its Technical Expert Committee (TEC) in a report submitted in 2007,the Commission formally declared 1989-90 vintage EVMs “Not fit for further use”. The next model of EVMs (M-1), manufactured from 2000 to 2005, have also been put out of use after Lok Sabha elections, 2014 due to their non-compatibility with Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT). However, M-1 EVMs (under 15 years life) are being provided to the State Election Commissions for use in local body elections. For replacement of M-1 EVMs (9,30,430) and to meet requirement of EVMs for Lok Sabha Elections, 2019 as well as expected simultaneous polls in some States, the Commission procured 13.95 lakh Ballot Units (BUs) and 10.55 lakh Control Units (CUs) between 2016 to 2019. (c): The Commission has informed that the project cost of the aforesaid procurement of 13.95 lakh BUs and 10.55 lakh CUs was estimated as Rs. 2056.20 crore (excluding taxes and transportation).(d): The Commission has further informed that a total of about 14.86 lakh Bus, 11.31 lakh CUs and 11.59 lakh VVPAT Units were used in elections to the Lok Sabha 2019 and simultaneous election to State Legislative Assemblies.(e) and (f): As informed by the Commission, the EVMs, being used by them, are indigenously designed, developed and manufactured by M/s Bharat Electronic Limited (BEL), Bangalore and M/s Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL), Hyderabad under technical guidance of the Commission’s Technical Expert Committee. There is no technical collaboration with any foreign establishment.   (g): The Commission has informed that the EVMs are completely non-tamperable. These EVMs are technically sound and the Commission has put in place strict administrative safeguards for their free, fair and transparent use. All the elections are being held using VVPAT Units connected to EVMs since June, 2017.
