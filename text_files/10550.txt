ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF JAL SHAKTI(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) 	As per Joint Monitoring programme (JMP) Report of UNICEF and WHO on ‘Progress on Household Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene 2000-2017’, open defecation in Bangladesh is less than 1%.(b) and (c) 	All the rural areas of the country have declared themselves Open Defecation Free (ODF) as on 2.10.2019.(d) 	Sanitation primarily is a behavioral issue. This involves changing the mindset amongst people to stop open defecation and to adopt safe sanitation practices. Under Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) [SBM(G)], the preferable approach is to adopt Community Approaches to Sanitation (CAS) focusing heavily on triggering entire communities and on achieving collective behavioral change with emphasis on awareness generation. Up to 5% of the programme funds can be spent on Information, Education and Communication (IEC) and capacity building at the State and District level, and up to 3% at the Central level.  Massive media campaigns have been carried out at national level using Audio Visual (TV) and Audio (Radio) aids. States have also carried out IEC campaign including interpersonal Communication (IPC). Cleanliness drives and awareness campaigns are also held at regular intervals.  Besides conventional IEC tools, social media are also used for spreading the mass awareness.  A Facebook page for SBM(G) has been created and twitter handles are also active. Media celebrities have been roped in as brand ambassadors.  Financial incentive of Rs.12,000/- is also provided to the Below Poverty Line (BPL) households and certain identified categories of Above Poverty Line (APL) households for construction of individual household latrine (IHHL).
