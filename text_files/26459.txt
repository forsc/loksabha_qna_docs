ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) As on date, 281 Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) are functioning in the temporary building including 17 in Bihar provided by various sponsoring authorities. The State / UT-wise details are annexed.(b) The teaching-learning and overall developments through sports are not hampered.(c) Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan has informed that at present there is no KV functional in the rented building. Construction of permanent buildings for KVs is a continuous process, which depends upon identification of suitable land, completion of lease formalities in favour of KVS by the sponsoring authorities, submission of drawings / estimates by construction agency, availability of funds and requisite approvals etc. As such, no definite time frame can be given in this regard. The land for KV, Siwan district of Bihar has not been transferred by the State Government in favour of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan so far.*****
