ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (d) :	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.******* STATEMENTSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF STARRED QUESTION NO.265 TO BE ANSWERED IN THE LOK SABHA ON 11.07.2019 REGARDING DEMAND AND SUPPLY OF POWER.*********(a) & (b) : 	As reported by State to Central Electricity Authority (CEA), the details of demand and supply of power in various States of our country including Uttar Pradesh, in terms of electrical energy and peak demand during the current year 2019-20 (up to June, 2019)  is at Annex. As against All India average of 0.6% peak power shortage there is no peak shortage in West Bengal,  and further while there is energy deficit of 0.4%  at All India level, there is  0.3% energy shortage in West Bengal. (c) : 		Proposal to provide for penalties on power distribution companies for gratuitous load shedding and make provisions for direct subsidy transfers by States to power consumers are issues under discussion for finalisation of Amendments to the Electricity Act.(d) :  		The total coal receipt in the power plants was 112.0 Million Tonne (MT) during the current year 2019-20 (Upto May, 2019) against 107.3 MT during the same period during last year showing a growth of 4.3%. With the concerted efforts of Ministry of Power, Ministry of Coal and Railways, the coal stock available with the power plants monitored by CEA on daily basis has improved to 26.09 MT as on 04.07.2019 which is sufficient for 15 days of generation as compared to 15.5 MT for 10 days as on the same day last year. Thus, due to enhanced coal supply to power plants, the demand of power in the Electricity grid is being met by thermal generating stations and supported by other generating sources. An Inter-Ministerial Sub-Group comprising representatives of Ministry of Power, Ministry of Coal and Ministry of Railways, CEA, CIL and SCCL monitors coal supply position on regular basis. Based on the decisions taken in the meeting, CIL/SCCL augment supply of coal and the Railways give priority in supply of rakes to power plants having less coal stock.****************
