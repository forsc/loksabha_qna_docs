ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES(SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a) & (b) Modernization and improvement of infrastructure of Prasar Bharati All India Radio (AIR) and Doordarshan (DD) is a continuous process. This includes adoption of modern High Definition (HD) technology, Digitisation of Studios and Transmission Operation, replacement/ upgradation of old/outlived equipment, digitized content dissemination and expansion of DTH and TV Channels.		As a Public Service Broadcaster, Prasar Bharati primarily focuses on AIR & DD’s programming on issues of public interest, viz. health, education, empowerment, social justice, etc. However, it is the constant endeavor of Prasar Bharati to provide impactful and entertaining programmes on AIR & DD to become the preferred channel of choice of people.         With the launch of DD ArunPrabha dedicated to the State of Arunachal Pradesh and DD Assam dedicated to the State of Assam running 24x7, and DD Retro, dedicated to iconic and archival content, foot print of DD Network has been expanded. DD has telecast iconic programmes like Ramayana, Mahabharata, Chanakya, Shri Krishna, etc. and this led to exponential growth of DD National and DD Bharati’s viewership. DD National held the first position in BARC ratings for several consecutive weeks during the lockdown. Channels of Doordarshan Network are also broadcasting educational content to provide learning opportunities to students during COVID-19 times.In addition, more than 70 “YouTube” channels have been created by Prasar Bharti to disseminate the audio/video content. Further, more than 248 AIR channels have been made available on “NewsonAir” app on Android and iOS mobile platform.  (c) 		At present, there is no approved scheme for increasing broadcasting capacity of 100 Watts FM Transmitter at Amreli. Most of the area of Bangaon Parliamentary Constituency falls under the coverage of AIR FM Station at Krishnanagar and Kolkata.  ******
