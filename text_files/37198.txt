ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)    As per Section 6 (1) of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA), 2005, the Central Government may by notification specify the wage rate for unskilled work for its beneficiaries. Accordingly, the Ministry of Rural Development notifies Mahatma Gandhi NREGA wage rate for every financial year for States/UTs. To compensate the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA workers against inflation, the Ministry of Rural Development revises the wage rate every year based on change in Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labour (CPI-AL). If the calculated wage rate of any State is coming lower than the wage rate of previous financial year, it is being protected by maintaining the previous financial year wage rate. The revised wage rate is made applicable from 1st April of each financial year. However, State Governments can provide wage over and above the wage rate notified by the Central Government under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS).(b)   As per the provision of the Act, “If a person employed under the Scheme meets with death or becomes permanently disabled by accident arising out of and in the course of employment, he or his legal heirs, as the case may be, shall be paid by the implementing agency an ex-gratia as per entitlement under the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana or as may be notified by the Central Government.” (c)&(d)  Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is a demand driven wage employment programme which provide for the enhancement of livelihood security of the households in rural areas of the country by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every household of rural area whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.   Under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS, individual assets can be created on the own lands in which such households can also work and will be entitled to get wages also as per the notified wage rate of the States/UTs. The works that are permissible for such farmers on their own land are: land development, farm pond, dug wells, other water harvesting structures, horticulture, sericulture, plantation, farm forestry, PMAY-G houses (unskilled wage component of 90-95 days), cattle shed, goat shed, poultry shed, piggery shed, fodder trough, fish drying yards etc. As per Para 5 of Schedule I of Mahatma Gandhi NREGA ,works creating individual assets shall be prioritized on land or homestead owned by households belonging to the:i.	Scheduled Castesii.	Scheduled Tribesiii.	Nomadic tribesiv.	de-notified  tribesv.	other families below the poverty linevi.	women-headed householdsvii.	physically handicapped headed householdsviii.	beneficiaries of land reformsix.	the beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Awass Yojana- Graminx.	beneficiaries under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (2 of 2007), and after exhausting the eligible beneficiaries under the above categories, on lands of the small or marginal farmers as defined in the Agriculture Debt Waiver and Debt Relief Scheme, 2008 subject to the condition that such households shall have a job card with at least one member willing to work on the project undertaken on their land or homestead. *****
