ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	No specific census/survey of landless farmers has been conducted and as such the exact number of landless farmers in the country is not available. However, details of wholly leased-in operational holdings in the country, including Chhattisgarh as per Agriculture Census 2015-16 are given in the Annexure.(b) to (e):	Government receives representations from time to time on various issues concerning agricultural sector. The subject relating to Land and its management, however, falls within the jurisdiction of States and the role of Central Government is only advisory in nature. With a view to address the issues in the area of land leasing, NITI Aayog has developed a ‘Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act, 2016’ for adoption by the States. The Model Act offers an appropriate template for the States and UTs to draft their own legislations, in consonance with the local requirements. Key elements of the Model Land Leasing Act are to legalize land leasing to promote agricultural efficiency, equity and poverty reduction; facilitate all tenants, including share croppers to access insurance, bank credit and bank credit against pledging of expected output; and legalize land leasing in all areas to ensure complete security of land ownership right for land owners and security of tenure for tenants for the agreed lease period.
