ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) : The National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) provides different timelines as well as principles and methodology for its implementation. Accordingly, Ministry and other implementing agencies under its purview have already started taking initiatives towards implementation of National Education Policy 2020 to achieve the objectives as envisaged in NEP 2020. As per NEP 2020, implementation of the Policy requires multiple initiatives and actions, which will have to be taken by multiple bodies in a synchronized and systematic manner. Further, in pursuance of the goals and objectives of the NEP 2020 and to assist States/UTs in its implementation, Ministry of Education has developed an indicative and suggestive NEP Implementation Plan for School Education.(b): A detailed consultation process with various stakeholders including UGC, AICTE, CBSE and Kendriya Vidyalays have been held before and after announcement of National EducationPolicy 2020. Further, suggestions have been invited from States / UTs Government and also from other stakeholders through MyGov platform. There has been wide publicity with a positive and encouraging response from stakeholders on NEP 2020. However, State of Kerala and Tamil Nadu have expressed their concerns on certain issues related to the NEP, 2020. A series of workshops have been held with States/UTs to address their concerns and also to discuss innovative ideas for NEP implementation.(c) and (d): The National Education Policy was framed in 1968. Subsequently, the National Policy on Education was framed in 1986 for which Programme of Action was issued in 1992. More than three decades have passed since then. During this period significant changes have taken place in our country, society economy, and the world at large. New technologies have transformed the way in which we live, work, and communicate with each other with easy flow of information and knowledge, within the country and across the world. Nations and economies are more connected now. The corpus of knowledge has vastly expanded and research has become multi-disciplinary, and far more collaborative. Skilled manpower is in demand globally. Innovation is at the core of global leadership. In order to achieve these objectives, a new Education Policy was needed. Accordingly, after detailed deliberations/consultations with various stakeholders, the National Education Policy 2020 has been announced on 29.07.2020 after a period of 34 years. The National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) is the first education policy of the 21st century and aims to address the many growing developmental imperatives of our country. The Policy proposes the revision and revamping of all aspects of the education structure, including its regulation and governance, to create a new system that is aligned with the aspirational goals of 21st century education, including SDG4, while building upon India’s traditions and value systems.*******
