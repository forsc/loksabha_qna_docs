ANSWER




(a): Skill development and creating skilled talent is an important mission to ensure that the rapidly growing Digital Economy of India is provided with the trained and skilled manpower that is required. To further aid digital adaption, the Ministry has focused on digital literacy for citizens across the country, especially in rural areas. In line with this, the Pradhan MantriGramin Digital SakshartaAbhiyan (PMGDISHA) was approved by Union Cabinet in February 2017 to usher in digital literacy in rural India to cover 6 crore rural households (one person per household). Under the PMGDISHA Scheme, as of 28.02.2022, around 5.66 crore candidates have been enrolled. Around 4.81 crore candidates have completed the training out of which more than 3.54 crore candidates have been certified. In the state of Rajasthan, as of 28.02.2022, around 30.95 Lakh candidates have been enrolled. Around 26 Lakh candidates have completed the training out of which more than 18.77 Lakh candidates have been certified. The state-wise status including the district-wise details of Rajasthan state, is given as Annexure-I& II respectively.(b): Under the PMGDISHA Scheme as of 28.02.2022, around 1.96 crore women/girls have been certified out of which 9.37 lakh women/girls were certified in the state of Rajasthan. The state-wise status of the certification of women/girls under the PMGDISHA Scheme, including district-level details for the State of Rajasthan, is given at Annexure-III & IV respectively.(c): The main objective of the PMGDISHAScheme is to impart digital literacy skills to the rural population. A beneficiary may get an opportunity for a job as a result of the digital literacy training however employment generation is not included as an objective of the scheme. (d): The current PMGDISHA Scheme is under implementation till 31-03-2023 to achieve the envisaged targets. Launch of phase two of the scheme is not being considered at this stage.(e): The PMGDISHA Scheme covers rural population in the age group of 14-60 years. However, special emphasis is given to enrolling digitally illiterate school students under the scheme. After undergoing the training program, such beneficiaries are empowered to use digital devices for their education in online as well as offline mode. In addition, rural schools are also engaged in training and examination wherever required. ******** Annexure-IThe state-wise  PMGDISHAstatusas of  28.02.2022:Sl.
