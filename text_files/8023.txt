ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (e)  As per the Inland Vessels Act, 1917, investigations into casualties on boat mishap/accident is vested with the concerned State Government.  Further, operation of ferry/ boat services on inland waterways being a State subject, the data related to boat mishaps/ causes of such accidents is not maintained by Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI). The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has prepared and issued detailed guidelines on Boat Safety in September, 2017 for both mechanized & non-mechanized boats in consultation with States and other stakeholders.  These guidelines address all facets of boat safety and provide framework on Boat Navigation including causes of accidents, Early Warning System, Weather Forecasting, Safety Standards, Regulatory and Legal issues, Search and Rescue and Capacity Development.  The implementation and enforcement of safety standards is largely dependent on the proactive role to be played by local administration, State and District Disaster Management Authorities. Further, for development of safe shipping and navigation on viable National Waterways as per its mandate, Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) takes up river training and conservancy works for fairway development and aids to navigation including River Information System (RIS). IWAI has also formulated Crisis Management Plan (CMP) for National Waterways which covers prevention, preparedness and response plans for various crisis situations covering collision and vessels related issues. In addition, consultation with stakeholders including State Governments is carried out regularly on various issues pertaining to development of National Waterways including safety aspects.                                              *****
