                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a):	The National Health Mission (NHM) envisages achievement of universal access to equitable, affordable & quality health care services that are accountable and responsive to people’s needs. NHM encompasses its two Sub-Missions, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM). The main programmatic components include Health System Strengthening in rural and urban areas, Reproductive-Maternal- Neonatal-Child and Adolescent Health (RMNCH+A), and Communicable and Non-Communicable Diseases.Under NHM, technical and Financial support is provided to States/UTs for strengthening of their healthcare systems based on the proposals submitted by them in their Program Implementation Plans (PIPs), subject to availability of resources.The status of implementation of National Health Mission (NHM) in the country are summarized in Statements showing physical achievements and progress under NHM during the last five years and the current year, State/UT-wise and are placed at Annexure-I to VI.(b):	A statement showing State/ UT-wise release and utilization of funds under National Health Mission (NHM) during the last five financial years i.e. from 2016-17 to 2020-21 and the current FY i.e. 2021-22 is placed at Annexure –VII.A statement showing targets set at the national level under National Health Mission and current status thereon is placed at Annexure-VIII.(c):	National Health Mission comprises of two sub-missions i.e. National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and National Urban Health Mission (NUHM). A Statement showing State/UT-wise release of funds under NRHM and NUHM during the last five financial years i.e. from 2016-17 to 2020-21 is placed at Annexure-IX.(d):	The proposals from State/UT Governments are received in the form of Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) under NHM and Government of India provides approval for the proposals in the form of Record of Proceedings (RoPs) as per available resources. The details of PIPs and RoPs since 2007 for all States/UTs including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan are available at website of National Health Mission i.e. https://nhm.gov.in at the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) as under: https://nhm.gov.in/index4.php?lang=1&level=0&linkid=449&lid=53(e):	The Government has continued to allocate more funds to strengthen the National Health Mission (NHM). Allocation to NHM has increased from Rs. 27,989.00 crore in 2020-21 BE to Rs.31,100.00 crore in 2021-22 BE.Further, the National Health Policy, 2017, also envisages the States to increase their health spending to at least 8% of their budget and two thirds of such expenditure should be on primary care. In addition, as per the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) under NHM, States are required to increase their State’s Health Budget by at least 10% annually.The approved Programme Implementation Plan (PIP) issued in the form of Record of Proceedings (ROPs) for each State /UT clearly lays down that to avail the 2nd Tranche of release under NHM, the State should ensure at least 10% increase in State Budget over last year and where such increase over last year is less than 10%, then the average of last 3 years would be considered and the same should be more than 10%.  Increase in health budget over 10% is one of the conditionalties for release of 2nd tranche of funds under NHM.(f):	As stated earlier, under NHM, technical and Financial support is provided to States/UTs for strengthening of their healthcare systems based on the proposals submitted by them in their Program Implementation Plans (PIPs), subject to availability of resources. The NHM driven reforms have resulted in the development of resilient health systems, albeit at different stages of maturity that enable successful scaling up of existing interventions for fighting against emergence of newer infectious diseases like COVID-19.NHM was at forefront of community awareness, mobilization and engagement activities related to COVID-19. NHM interventions have played active role in awareness creation, surveillance and contact tracing for COVID-19 infection through frontline workers. They also counseled & educated the suspected cases and community on precautions to be taken. Healthcare facilities supported under NHM were the first point of contact for healthcare needs of the people staying in rural and remote areas. The non-COVID essential services were also provided to the beneficiaries, wherever possible, during COVID-19 pandemic. A series of orientation-cum-Review Meetings were organised with States/UTs on digital platforms for ensuring the continuation of non-COVID essential services as well as COVID-19 related services. States/UTs were also requested for maintenance of non-COVID essential services e.g. for maternal, new born and child care, dialysis, tuberculosis, HIV, maintenance of voluntary blood donation, etc with special focus in remote/rural areas. Comprehensive guidance note was shared with States/UT for enabling delivery of essential health services during the COVID-19 outbreak covering several important aspects of health systems preparedness including reorganisation of service delivery, human resources, supply of medicines and diagnostics, programme management, etc. Similarly, the World’s largest vaccination drive National Covid – 19 Vaccination Programme (NCVP) utilizes the infrastructure and logistic arrangements created under Universal Immunization Programme (UIP). The entire immunization programme relies on the platforms created by NHM.Also, the training of healthcare providers across the spectrum for effective COVID -  19 management utilizes the NHM Training framework.(g):	Ministry of Health & Family Welfare have taken several steps for evaluation of proper utilization of funds released under the National Health Mission (NHM) by States/UTs which interalia includes:•	Performance Audit under NRHM by the CAG,•	Annual Statutory Audits by CAG empanelled major Chartered Accountant audit firms;•	Concurrent Audits by Chartered Accountant audit firms;•	Financial review by Institute of Public Auditors of India (IPAI) in several States;•	Examination of quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR) furnished by the States;•	Visits by the teams of the Financial Management Group of the Department to the States/UTs for periodic review.•	Annual visits to States by Common Review Mission (CRM) which inter-alia, looks at financial systems and mechanisms.•	Implemented Public Financial Management System (PFMS) developed by the office of the CGA, Ministry of Finance for monitoring and management of funds on real time basis.•	Integrated monitoring visits by senior officials of the Ministry and National Health System Resource Centre.
