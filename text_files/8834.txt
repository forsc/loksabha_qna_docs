ANSWER




                                                         MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) and (b): 	Procurement of paddy and wheat is made under both Non- Decentralized Procurement Scheme (Non-DCP) and  Decentralized Procurement Scheme (DCP). Bihar has adopted Decentralized Procurement Scheme (DCP) under which, the State Government itself undertakes direct purchase of paddy/rice and wheat from farmers, also stores and distributes the procured rice/wheat under National Food Security Act (NFSA) and Other Welfare Schemes (OWS). Accordingly, FCI does not operate procurement centres in Bihar.       	However, FCI may assist the State Govt. in procurement operation in DCP states on specific request of State Government. No such request has been received from Government of Bihar.        	Further Coarsegrains including maize are procured by State Governments/ their agencies as per the procurement plan prepared in consultation with FCI and approved by the Central Government. However, no proposal for procurement of maize has so far been received from Government of Bihar.  ****
