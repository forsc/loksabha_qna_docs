                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a): The details of gross Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenues collection in the country including the State of Tamil Nadu during the last three years and the current year (till Feb, 2021) are as under: -Month	GST Collection (in Rs.

Further, these figures also include both, refund sanctioned against FORM GST RFD-01A and FORM GST RFD-01.)The details of pendency of refund claims filed in FORM GST RFD-01, for Tamil Nadu, is given below: - No. of Refund Applications	Refund Claim Amount (in Cr.)             2,033 	        838.93 (These figures are inclusive of taxpayers assigned to both, Central and State/UT tax administrations.)Remaining applications (about 39,958) are either completely rejected or may be issued deficiency memo by the proper officer for which fresh application is required to be filed.(d): In normal course, all the applications claiming GST refund received in the Department need to be processed and disposed of by the proper officer within 60 days from the date of receipt of the application. If the applicant is not refunded within 60 days from the date of receipt of the application, interest shall be payable in respect of such refund from the date immediately after the expiry of 60 days from the date of receipt of the application, till the date of refund of such tax. Therefore, GST Department examines all the refund applications and sanction the refund in a time bound manner. Various reasons given below may be attributed for pendency of GST refund cases beyond 60 days: i)	Deficiency memo issued against incomplete GST refund application for which taxpayer is yet to reply;ii)	Show Cause Notices (SCN) issued for rejection of the refund for which taxpayers have not responded so far;iii)	Risky taxpayers identified by Directorate General of Analytics and Risk Management, CBIC through Red Flag Reports;iv)	Bank validation issues.*****ANNEXURE-IFinancial Year wise Refund Claimed (Figures are based on refund filing date and not the refund period)F.Year based on filing date	All India Figures	Tamil Nadu Figures	No. of Refund Applications filed	Refund Claim Amt (in Cr.)
