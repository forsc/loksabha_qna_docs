                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b)  Air pollution is one of the triggering factors for respiratory ailments and associated diseases. There is no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct correlation of death/ disease exclusively due to air pollution. Health effects of air pollution are synergistic manifestation of factors, which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity, etc., of the individuals. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare along with Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) has conducted the study titled ‘India: Health of the Nation’s States - The India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative’ which was published in 2017. The study report provided the distribution in diseases and risk factors across all states of the country from 1990 to 2016. The five leading risk factors identified for Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in 2016 include child and maternal malnutrition, air pollution, dietary risks, high systolic blood pressure, and high fasting plasma glucose.Government of India has notified National Ambient Air Quality Standards vide notification No.B-29016/20/90/PCI-I dated 18th November 2009.  As per Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS) data, out of 132 targeted cities, ambient air quality data in 96 cities showed a decreasing trend of PM10 (Particulate Matter) whereas 36 cities showed an increasing trend of PM10 concentration in 2020-21 as compared to 2019-20. 18 cities were found to be within the prescribed National Ambient Air Quality Standard PM10 less than 60µg/m3) in 2019-20 which has increased to 27 in year 2020-21. (c )  to (e ) The Government has launched National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) in 2019 as a national-level strategy to reduce air pollution levels across the country. Several steps are undertaken in the NCAP which inter alia includes the following:?	City Specific Clean Air Action Plans have been prepared and rolled out for implementation in 132 non-attainment and million-plus cities. These action plans focus on city-specific short/ medium/ long term actions to control air pollution from sources such as vehicular emission, road dust, burning of biomass/ crop/ garbage/ municipal solid waste, landfills, construction activities, industrial emission, etc.?	Under NCAP, Centre level Steering Committee, Monitoring Committee and Implementation Committee have been constituted and periodic review of the implementation progress is conducted. Also, a State Level Steering Committee and Monitoring Committee chaired by Chief Secretary and Principal Secretary, Environment Department are constituted. City/ District level Implementation Committee chaired by Municipal Commissioner/ District Magistrate is constituted, which periodically review the status of progress of implementation of actions under NCAP. These committees have participation of stakeholders.?	Rs. 418.60 crore have been sanctioned to non-attainment cities under NCAP for initiating actions such as expansion of monitoring network, construction and demolition waste management facilities, non-motorised transport infrastructure, green buffers, mechanical street sweepers, composting units etc.?	15th Finance Commission (XV-FC) has identified 42 Urban Agglomerations (UA) with million plus population for performance based grants based on improvement in air quality for period FY 2020-21 to 2025-26 under Million-Plus Cities Challenge Fund (MPCCF). Funds to the tune of Rs. 12,139 crore have been allocated for the said purpose. For 2021-22, funds to the tune of Rs. 2217 crore have been allocated. Rs. 4400 crore were disbursed during 2020-21 to these cities.?	PRANA, a portal for monitoring implementation of NCAP has been launched.The Government has taken several steps for mitigation of air pollution which include the introduction of BS-VI norms for fuel and vehicles since April 2020; promotion of E-vehicles; expansion of network of Metro rails for public transport; promotion of cleaner fuels such as PNG; stringent emission norms for industries including coal-based Thermal Power Plants (TPPs); zig-zag technology for brick kilns; Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for plastic and e-waste management; real-time monitoring of major polluting industries, etc. Details of measures taken by the Government for air quality management are at Annexure I.	Integrated Command and Control Centres (ICCCs) have been operationalized by  76 Smart cities.  *****
