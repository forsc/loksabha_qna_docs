                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) India has a coastline of nearly 8000 km. The major reef formation areas are primarily four, (i) Gulf of Kutch; (ii) Gulf of Mannar; (iii) Lakshadweep Islands; and (iv) Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The total area of coral reefs in India is estimated to be 2,375 Sq. Km.As per information provided by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), they have carried out a study with satellite derived historical SST (Sea Surface Temperature) data for the major Indian coral reef regions (Gulf of Kachchh, Lakshadweep, Gulf of Mannar, Andaman and Nicobar) and established the warmest months, thermal thresholds and range of positive SST anomalies conducive to coral bleaching events for each of the regions. The ISRO has also developed a Coral Bleaching Monitoring and Alert System for these regions during Indian summer months and hosted on its VEDAS geo-portal (https://vedas.sac.gov.in/vstatic_1/Coral/). In summer 2016, a field validation was carried out at Poshitra reef in Gulf of Kachchh region, following a bleaching alert and thirteen sampled coral species and a sea anemone were found bleached with an average bleaching of 3.9% at colony scale.(b)The Government has taken steps to protect and sustain Coral Reefs in the country through promotional as well as regulatory measures. The promotional measures have been implemented through a Central Sector Scheme under National Coastal Mission of the Ministry at four sites namely Lakshadweep, Gulf of Kachchh, Gulf of Mannar and Andaman & Nicobar Islands for restoration, monitoring, conservation and management of coral reefs.Regulatory measures are implemented through Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification (2019) under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986; the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972; the Indian Forest Act, 1927; the Biological Diversity Act, 2002; and rules under these acts as amended from time to time.
