ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) and (b):  In May 2020, Air India made it mandatory to fill up the health form prior to check in becasuse of guidelines issued in reference to COVID-19 pandemic. Few problems were encountered by passengers mainly on account of filling up of the health form. Since submission of health form was a mandatory requirement, this process had to be incorporated in the web check in process. (c):  In order to facilitate web-check in by passengers, following steps were taken by Air India: ;i. A process to call all the passenger booked on AI flights was instituted so that 100% of the passengers whose contacts were available on the booking reference were called to help them in doing web check in. This is done between 48 hours and 6 hours, prior to flight departure;ii. Further, step by step check in process was uploaded on the web site of Air India;iii. A Chat Bot was installed on the website which facilitates check in for passengers.Presently, about 85% passengers of Air India are availing web check in facility.
