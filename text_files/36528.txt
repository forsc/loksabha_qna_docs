BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (e) : National Medical Commission (NMC) is a statutory body which is entrusted with the responsibility of discharging the duty of maintenance of highest standard of medical education in the country. The professional conduct of medical practitioner is governed by Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 which was notified by erstwhile Medical Council of India.

Any act of violating the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 amounts to professional misconduct. The Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB) of the National Medical Commission or the appropriate State Medical Councils have been empowered to take disciplinary action against a doctor for violation of the provisions of the aforesaid Regulations. The Ethics and Medical Registration Board is an Appellate Authority in the matter.*****
