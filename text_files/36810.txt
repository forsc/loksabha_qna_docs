The recognition of HEIs to offer programmes under Open and Distance Learning (ODL) and/or Online mode is processed as per the provisions stipulated under these Regulations. (c)  The List of recognized Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) offering courses under the ODL is available at https://deb.ugc.ac.in/pdf/RecognisedHEIs(ODL)-FINALLIST.pdf.(d)  As per UGC Regulation 2020 (Open and Distance Learning Programmes and Online Programmes), the degree at undergraduate and postgraduate level acquired through Open and Distance Learning mode and/or Online mode are treated equivalent to the corresponding degrees and diplomas acquired through conventional mode.
