Nutri-cereals contribute substantially for food & nutritional security and are highly nutritious. Millet crops perform well in marginal (dryland) environments and are superior in nutritional properties with high micronutrient with low glycemic indices. Millets are not only comparable to major cereals with respect to their nutritional features but are very good sources of carbohydrates, micronutrients & phytochemicals with nutraceutical properties. Millets are natural source of iron, zinc, calcium & other nutrients.	The production of millets has increased from 137.11 lakh tonnes in 2018-19 to 179.59 lakh tonnes in 2020-21. To encourage the farmers to grow nutri-cereals (millets), Government declares Minimum Support Price (MSP) of three major millets i.e, jowar, bajra & ragi along with a   minimum return of at least 50 per cent over all India weighted average cost of production before main season of Kharif every year. MSP of jowar, bajra & ragi from 2013-14 to 2021-22 is as under:	(Rs per quintal)Year	Jowar	Bajra	Ragi	Hybrid	Maldandi		2013-14	1500	1520	1250	15002014-15	1530	1550	1250	15502015-16	1570	1590	1275	16502016-17	1625	1650	1330	17252017-18	1700	1725	1425	19002018-19	2430	2450	1950	28972019-20	2550	2570	2000	31502020-21	2620	2640	2150	32952021-22	2738	2758	2250	3377
