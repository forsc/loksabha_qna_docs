ANSWER




                                                        (a) 	The National Skill Development Mission (NSDM) was launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on 15.07.2015 to create convergence across sectors and States in terms of skill training activities and for skilling at scale with speed and standards. As a corollary, the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 which was launched on 29th July 2020, envisages that the school curricula and pedagogy will aim for holistic development of learners by equipping them with the key 21st century skills and reduction in curricular content to enhance essential learning and critical thinking. The policy emphasises integration between vocational and academic streams in all schools and higher education Institutions in a phased manner. As per the policy, vocational education will start in school from the 6th grade and will include internship. The Ministry of Education has been implementing the Samagra Shiksha Scheme which supports States for strengthening Government schools and for creation and augmentation of infrastructure facilities based on the gap determined by Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) and proposals received from the respective State / UT. MSDE is also focusing on using its infrastructure for skill training in schools.(b)	The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) in collaboration with Ministry of Education (MoE) has taken a number of initiatives towards integrating skills and education. Under aegis of MSDE, National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and its Sector Skill Councils (SSCs) are facilitating Ministry of Education for the implementation of the Samagra Shiksha scheme in 12,332 schools across 31 States and Union Territories (UTs)*, offering 125 job role-aligned courses across 21 Sectors. Under this initiative, more than 13 Lakh+ students have been reported to be enrolled in 2020-21 academic year.  Further, in order to integrate Vocational Education with regular education, Government in Budget 2020-21 has proposed to integrate apprenticeship embedded degree programmes to give impetus to vocational training. Accordingly, University Grants Commission (UGC) has already issued Apprenticeship/Internship embedded degree programme guidelines on 7th August, 2020 under which a student can opt for Vocational hands-on-training in commercial/industrial set up wherein training done will be counted in credits for the purpose of graduate degree programme.(c) 	the total number of candidates that have received skills in Delhi as a part of Skill Development Mission since its inception in various schemes of MSDE are as follows:PMKVY (no. of candidates trained/oriented)-	4,81,776JSS (no. of candidates trained	26,584NAPS (no. of candidates trained)	18435DGT (no. of candidates enrolled)	60,101Total	5,86,896
