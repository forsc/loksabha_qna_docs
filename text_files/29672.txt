ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE(a): As per Reserve Bank of India (RBI) inputs, public sector banks (PSBs) are not covered by the Companies Act and hence the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy related provisions of the Companies Act are not applicable to these banks. However, RBI has issued guidelines on Corporate Social Responsibility, Sustainable Development and Non-Financial Reporting – Role of Banks. (b) to (e): Bank-wise details of amount spent on CSR during the last three years is at Annex. With regards to PSBs adherence to the provisions of CSR, RBI has apprised that no such deviations were observed. As regard State / Union territory-wise funds allocated, and monitoring the amount spent by the PSBs under CSR in the country particularly in the backward and scheduled castes dominated regions, it may be noted that CSR spending, approved by the bank Board, includes expenditure on activities that are not attributable to specific locations and are spread across the country with multiple organisations, including PSBs,  supporting a project pan-India, e.g., Swachh Bharat Kosh, National Sports Development Fund, Clean Ganga Fund, PM’s National Relief Fund, etc. and therefore, the full CSR expenditure State / Union Territory-wise or backward and scheduled castes dominated regions wise cannot be apportioned. The major CSR activities on which the PSBs have spent funds include, inter alia, the following:(i)	Education- granting scholarships to students, improving the infrastructure at schools, etc.;(ii)	Healthcare- welfare of physically/mentally challenged persons, providing ambulances and critical care medical equipment to hospitals/health-centres, etc.;(iii)	Enabling employment enhancing vocational skills through Rural Self Employment Training Institutes, vocational centres etc.;(iv)	Ensuring environmental sustainability by initiating/supporting programmes for afforestation, rainwater harvesting, protecting forest cover, etc.;(v)	Providing safe drinking water, sanitation etc.; and(vi)	Rural and slum developmentFurther, as per instructions issued by RBI in respect of PSBs, audit of expenditure incurred under CSR forms part of the statutory audit of the PSB, which is carried out by auditors appointed by the PSB concerned. ***       AnnexDetails of the funds allocated to CSR, bank wise(amount in lakh Rs.)S.
