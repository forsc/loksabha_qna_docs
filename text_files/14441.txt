Since 2014-15 till date, a total amount of Rs.3843.92 crore has been released by the Government of India to Assam under SBM(G), and the State has utilized Rs.3690.41 crore as per the Utilisation Certificates received.  The salient features of SBM(G) are:(i)	Emphasis on behaviour change including interpersonal communication; strengthening implementation and delivery mechanisms down to Gram Panchayat level(ii)	Flexibility to States in designing delivery mechanisms taking into account their local culture, practices, sensibilities and demands(iii)	Greater emphasis on capacity building, especially in community approaches and programme management - training of KRCs (Key resource Centres) and involvement of Collectors to provide leadership at the district level(iv)	Programme being run as a citizens’ movement with cooperation of all sections of society including NGOs, corporates, youth etc.(b) 	SBM(G) is being implemented in all the rural areas of the country including all the districts of Assam.  (c) 	SBM(G) was launched on 2nd October, 2014 with the aim to attain Open Defecation Free (ODF) India by 2nd October, 2019 by providing access to toilet facilities to all rural households of the country. Total 10.29 crore individual household toilets have been constructed under this programme till 06.03.2020, and all the 6,03,175 villages in the country have declared themselves ODF.  (d) & (e)	Phase II of SBM (G) has been recently approved by the Government to be implemented from 2020-21 to 2024-25 in a mission mode.  Phase II of SBM(G) aims at sustainability of ODF status of all villages and to cover all the villages with proper solid and liquid waste management.  The total estimated outlay is Rs.1,40,881 crores. Of this Rs.52,497 crore will be allocated from the budgetary provision of Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation and the State Governments and the remaining amount will be dovetailed from different sources such as from the 15th Finance Commission tied grants to rural local bodies for sanitation and water, convergence with MGNREGS and other schemes of Central/State Governments, and revenue generation models particularly for solid and liquid waste management.
