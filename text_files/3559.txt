ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO) (a) As per Emissions Gap Reports of United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), global carbon emissions from anthropogenic sources has increased from 53 billion tones of CO2eq in year 2013 to 53.5 billion tones of CO2eq in year 2017, which is equivalent to rise of 0.94 % in the five years from 2013 to 2017.  (b) to (d) Climate change is a global phenomenon and requires cooperation of all nations based on the principle of ‘Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities’. India is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, its Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. India is meeting its commitments under the aforesaid instruments.The Government is implementing National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which comprises of eight missions in specific areas of solar energy, energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan ecosystem, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. Thirty three States/Union Territories (UTs) have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change in line with NAPCC taking into account State’s/UT’s specific issues relating to climate change. Under the Paris Agreement, India has submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) with target to reduce the emissions intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level, to achieve about 40 % cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030, and to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tones of CO2eq through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. India declared a voluntary goal of reducing the emissions intensity of its GDP by 20–25%, over 2005 levels by 2020, despite having no binding mitigation obligations as per the Convention. A slew of policy measures were launched to achieve this goal. As a result, the emission intensity of our GDP has decreased by 21% between 2005 and 2014. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is supplementing the efforts to combat climate change by implementing the central sector scheme of ‘Climate Change Action Plan’ under which Rs. 127.79 crores have been spent during the last five years (2014-15 to 2018-19). Since 2015-16, Ministry is also implementing a centrally sponsored scheme ‘National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change’ to support adaptation measures of States/Union Territories, under which an expenditure of Rs. 454.63 crores has been incurred during last four years (2015-16 to 2018-19).*****
