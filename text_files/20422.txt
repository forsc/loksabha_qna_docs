                                                        MINISTER FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a) to (c)A statement of reply is laid on the Table of the House. **** Statement referred to in the reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 152 due for reply on 11.02.2021(a)	Yes. To improve the ‘quality of life’ and enhance ''ease of living'' in villages, Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) – Har Ghar Jal was announced on 15th August, 2019 with an objective to provide Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC) to every rural household by 2024. The mission is being implemented in partnership with States, with an estimated outlay of Rs. 3.60 lakh Crore. At the time of announcement of JJM on 15th August 2019, out of total 18.93 Crore rural households, 3.23 Crore rural households (17%) of the country had tap water connections. Since then over 3.37 Crore families living in rural areas provided with tap water connection in their homes. Now, out of total 19.17 Crore rural households in the country, more than 1/3rd (34.50%) i.e. 6.60 Crore rural families have tap water supply in their homes. To bring in transparency and share the information, an online JJM–dashboard has been developed, which shows State/ UT, district and village–wise progressin making provision of tap water supply to rural households as well as to schools and anganwadi centres. The dashboard can be accessed at:https://ejalshakti.gov.in/jjmreport/JJMIndia.aspx(b)	& (c) Yes. To bring an innovative, modular and cost-effective sensor based IoT solution at the village level to monitor the functionality of water supply system, a ‘Grand challenge for development of Smart Water Supply Measurement and Monitoring System’ has been launched in September, 2020 in partnership with the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY). Under the challenge, support to applicants is provided to develop their solution, demonstrate proof-of-concept at test-bed facility developed at CDAC campus, Bangalore and then deploy the solution at pilot-locationsin villages across the country. The challenge will also give boost to sensor & IoT ecosystem, and provide thrust to initiatives viz. Atmanirbhar Bharat, Digital India and Make in India.***
