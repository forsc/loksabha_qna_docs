                                                        MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	to (c) A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 322 FOR ANSWER ON 16.07.2019 REGARDING TRANSPARENCY IN PANCHAYATI RAJ SYSTEM(a)	to (c) 	‘Panchayat’ being a State subject, governance of Panchayats is the primary responsibility of concerned State Government / Union Territories (UTs) administration. Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) initiatives supplement the efforts of States/UTs. Under the Digital India Programme, the Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) is implementing e-Panchayat Mission Mode Project (MMP) wherein a suite of core software applications has been developed to address various aspects of Panchayats’ functioning including planning, budgeting, implementation, accounting, monitoring, social audit and delivery of citizen services like issue of certificates, licences, tax collection etc. These applications collectively form part of Panchayat Enterprise Suite (PES). One of the applications under PES is National Panchayat Portal (NPP), which provides a framework for development of website of Rural Local Bodies (RLBs) including Panchayats. These individual websites can be accessed through https://www.panchayatportals.gov.in, wherein websites of 1,52,747 Panchayats/rural local bodies have already been enabled and 1,23,093 of these have also been registered. Since Panchayats is a state subject, MoPR not only has provided the States with a tool for websites development but also pursues with them for websites development and digitalisation of Panchayats’ data.*****
