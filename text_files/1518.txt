ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’ )(a) to (c): No such decision has been taken so far. However, University Grants Commission(UGC) vide its letter dated 09th March, 2018 issued instructions to create the StudentsCounselling Centre and guidelines to all Universities that all the Higher Education Institutions(HEIs) should mandatorily put in place a “Students Counselling System” for the effectiveredressal of problems and challenges faced by students. It should be a unique, interactive andtarget-oriented system, involving students, teachers and parents to address common studentconcerns ranging from anxiety, stress, fear of change and failure to homesickness and a slew ofother academic worries. It should bridge formal as well as communicative gaps between thestudents and the institution at large. Teacher counsellors, trained to act as the guardians ofstudents at the college level, should remain in close touch with the students allotted to themthroughout the year, cater to their emotional and intellectual needs and guide them to move up intheir career at regular interval of time. Teacher counsellors can coordinate with wardens ofhostels and exchange pre-emptive or corrective action.******
