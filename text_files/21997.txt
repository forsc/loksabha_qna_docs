ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (a) and (b): The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the supervisor of the banking system and releases a Financial Stability Report (FSR), which contains, inter alia, its projections of gross non-performing assets (NPAs) based on macro stress tests. While the latest FSR, of January 2021, does not contain projections in respect of overall stressed advances, stressed retail advances and deposit rates, as per the report, the gross NPA ratio of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs), under the baseline scenario, may increase from 7.5 per cent in September 2020 to 13.5 per cent by September 2021.As per RBI inputs, the said gross NPA ratio has been arrived at without factoring in the impact of the policy actions under way, viz., RBI’s resolution framework for COVID-19-related stress and one-time restructuring of loans to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which aim to facilitate revival of real sector activities and mitigate the pandemic’s impact on borrowers. Under the said framework/scheme, resolution/restructuring of eligible loan accounts is permitted without asset classification downgrade. Therefore, the actual movement of gross NPA ratio of SCBs will depend on the extent to which the benefit of the said framework/scheme is availed of by the eligible borrowers and facilitates revival and mitigates the pandemic’s impact on borrowers.Bank-wise details of stressed advances as a percentage of the overall advances and stressed retail advances as a percentage of the retail advances of SCBs, as at the end of each of the last five financial years and at the end of December 2020, as per RBI data, are at Annex.*** AnnexLok Sabha Unstarred Question no. 3107, regarding Stressed Assets of
