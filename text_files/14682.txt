ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b)The Second National Communication submitted by India to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)indicates that the impacts ofclimate change will be particularly severe in low-elevationcoastal zones, where many of India’s largest cities arelocated, including the mega cities of Mumbai and Chennai. The Government is implementing National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which comprises of missions in specific areas of solar energy, energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan eco-system, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. Most of these Missions, inter-alia, focus on adaptation to adverse impacts of climate change. Thirty-three States/Union Territories including the States of Maharashtra and Tamilnadu have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) in line with NAPCC taking into account State’s specific issues relating to climate change. These SAPCCs inter-alia outline sector specific and cross sectoral priority actions. The Government is also implementing the scheme, “National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change” to support adaptation measures of States/UTs in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate Change.Furthermore, National Disaster Management Authority has issued several disaster specific guidelines for managing extreme weather-related disasters including floods.Each state has its own State Disaster Management Authority to deal with extreme weather events.(c) The Ministry has issued a new Coastal Regulation Zone Notification in January 2019 in supersession of the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 2011. The newCoastal Zone Regulation 2019 has been framed after undertaking wide range of consultations with all stakeholders and based on the recommendations of a Committee of Experts constituted specifically for the task of scientifically addressing the issues of coastal regions. This new regulation lays due emphasis on management and conservation of marine and coastal ecosystems, development in coastal areas, eco-tourism, livelihood options, sustainable development of coastal communities, etc. and commercial projects have to obtain environment clearance (EC) if they fall in the CRZ areas as per guidelines.(d)The Ministry has launched National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) on 10thJanuary2019 as a national level strategy for pan India implementation to reduce air pollution levels across the country through strategies for local, city, regional and transboundary levels. NCAP is a mid-term, five-year action plan keeping 2019 as the base year. Taking into account available international experiences and national studies, tentative national level target of 20%–30% reduction of PM2.5 and PM10 concentration by 2024 is proposed under NCAP. This is keeping 2017 as base year for comparison of concentration. The Hon’ble National Green Tribunal in O.A. No. 681 of 2018 in its order dated 20.11.2019 ordered that “Having regard to adverse impact on public health and constitutional mandate that right to clean air is a fundamental right, the Ministry of Environment,Forest &Climate Change may modify the NCAP by reducing the timelines and increasing the target for reduction of air pollution”. The cities are developing their own plans under NCAP based on local emission sources and related factors.* * * * *
