ANSWER




                                                        (a) 	The Government has set up the Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) at NITI Aayog with an objective to create scientific temper and cultivate the spirit of curiosity, creativity, imagination and innovation among young minds and inculcate skills such as design mind-set, computational thinking, adaptive learning, physical computing, rapid calculations, measurements, etc. NITI Aayog has not entered into agreement with any institution for skill development in the country under AIM.(b)	The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) Scheme and National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) for short-term skill training and Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS) through the Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) for long-term skill training. The State/ Union Territory (UT) -wise details of candidates benefitted under the schemes viz. PMKVY, JSS, NAPS and CTS from 2016-17 are given at Annexure I, Annexure II, Annexure III and Annexure IV respectively. (c)	As regards feedback from trainees of skill development schemes, the guidelines of the PMKVY 3.0 scheme, which was launched on 15.01.2021, provide for feedback-based rating mechanism of the Training Centres (TCs) along with existing grading received during accreditation and affiliation of the TCs. This mechanism of rating will help identify the most preferred TCs in the long run. Under the recalibrated rating system, empanelled PMKVY TCs would receive feedback from candidates on training delivery, infrastructure, quality of trainers and support provided for gainful employment. (d) The National Skill Development Mission (NSDM) is aimed at creating convergence across sectors and States in terms of skill training activities.  Training is not only done by the Central Ministries and Departments but also by the State Governments. States are encouraged to create State Skill Development Missions (SSDM) along the lines of NSDM, with a Steering Committee and Mission Directorate at State level. In order to improve the performance of the States including Madhya Pradesh in skilling, MSDE through the Skill Acquisition and Knowledge Awareness for Livelihood Promotion (SANKALP) scheme is supporting the States through the conduct of workshops and seminars, development of manuals and guidelines, review of quarterly progress reports, periodic video conferences and follow-up visits to the States. The States are provided with regular guidance and hand-holding support. Further, to spread effectively the idea of skill planning at district level, SANKALP has focused on strengthening the District Skill Committees.
