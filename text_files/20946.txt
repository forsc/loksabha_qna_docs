ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR CULTURE & TOURISM(PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a): 	Yes, Sir. During renovation of the Indian Museum building prior to bi-centenary celebrations in 2014, most of the artifacts were removed by the Museum Authority. Huge number of artifacts had to be handled during renovation work, and inspite of best efforts and due care, in one case minor damage of detachment of parts could not be avoided. However no financial loss has occurred.(b)&(c):	There are two broad categories of methods which are used to have been followed for protecting priceless artefacts; one is preventive conservation and another is curative conservation depending upon the state of artefact. Preventive conservation is generally followed to prevent the artefacts from getting further deteriorated mainly because of weathering and other natural phenomena. Curative conservation is done only when the artefacts have already been affected by the weathering effect or other natural causes. Curative conservation is a sort of remedial solution to the artefacts.(d):	Phase-I of modernization work of Indian Museum was awarded to NBCC by Board of Trustees (BoT) at its meeting held on 22.01.2011. Work was executed by vendors appointed by NBCC. Although a major part of renovation work was included within the scope of Phase-I, some important items of works were not taken up though these were initially included within the scope. Major works pertaining to providing modern storage system, fire-fighting, fire-detection and prevention and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) were not taken up though sanctioned. Works sanctioned at a cost of Rs. 83.66 crore were executed for Rs. 105.70 crore, while works estimated to cost Rs. 25.76 crore not awarded at all by NBCC. The maintenance and remaining renovation work of Indian Museum buildings has now been assigned to CPWD.(e):	In Indian Museum, safety and security of the entire premises is presently under the control of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) with effect from 24.12.2019. The museum building has 431 Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras to enable electronic surveillance of the entire premises. In addition, to ensure security of objects in store, SOPs have been devised to ensure maximum security to stored objects.For all renovation work of Indian Museum, CPWD has been presently assigned this responsibility and all estimates are being placed before competent authorities for approval based on year to year budgetary provisions.*****
