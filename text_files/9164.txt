Benchmarking India’s Payment Systems facilitates an assessment of India’s progress against payment systems and instruments in major countries and provides further impetus to the planned efforts for deepening the digitisation of payments.2.   A comprehensive exercise for benchmarking India’s Payment Systems was undertaken by selecting a mix of 21 countries (including advanced economy countries, Asian economies and BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) nations spread across all the continents where payment systems are considered robust, diverse and efficient. The countries include Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom and the United States of America.3.   Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has relied on publicly available information in this report and has made every effort to ensure that the information contained in the report is accurate.4.   Payment Systems have been rated on the basis of categories, which are as under:(a) “Leader”: ranked 1st or 2nd or 3rd;(b) “Strong”: in the top rungs of the countries other than the leaders (4th to 9th);(c) “Moderate”: ranked in the middle (10th to 15th); and,(d) “Weak”: in the lowest rungs (16th to 21st).5.   The benchmarking exercise aims to provide an understanding of the payment systems in place in India and how their usage preferences compare with other countries. It is also a starting point for a meaningful analysis of the efficiency levels of India’s payment systems.6.  The benchmarking has been done over a range of 21 areas and 41 indicators as indicated below.
