ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (e):  Air fare is neither regulated nor established by the Government. Under the provision of Sub-rule (1) of Rule 135 of the Aircraft Rules 1937, airlines are free to fix the reasonable tariff having regard to all relevant factors including the cost of operation, characteristics of service, reasonable profit and the generally prevailing tariff. The prices are fixed by airlines keeping in mind the market, demand, seasonality and other market forces. The airfare increases with increase in demand of seat as the lower fare buckets get sold out fast. The airlines remain compliant to the Sub Rule (2) of Rule 135 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937 as long as the fare charged by them is in line with fare displayed on their websites. ; Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has set up a Tariff Monitoring Unit that monitors air fares on certain routes selected on random basis to ensure that the airlines do not charge air fares outside the range declared by them. The fare monitoring analysis carried out by DGCA in the recent past has shown that the air fares remained well within the fare bucket uploaded by the airlines on the respective websites. In case, any steep fare hike is observed, Ministry of Civil Aviation/Directorate General of Civil Aviation sensitize the airlines for necessary intervention.
