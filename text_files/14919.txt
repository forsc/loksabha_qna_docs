                                                        (a) to (d) 	MSDE is implementing a pilot scheme, Pradhan Mantri YUVA (PM YUVA) Yojana towards creating an enabling ecosystem through entrepreneurship education, training, advocacy and easy access to entrepreneurship network. The scheme focuses on students/trainees and alumni coming out from skilling ecosystem {i.e. Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), Polytechnics, Pradhan Mantri Kuashal Kendras (PMKKs) and Jan Sikshan Sansthans (JSS)}. The scheme is being implemented in 10 States and 2 Union Territories {viz. i.e. Uttar Pradesh (6 districts), Uttarakhand (4 districts), Bihar (10 districts), West Bengal (12 districts), Assam (11 districts), Meghalaya (2 districts), Maharashtra (5 districts), Tamil Nadu (17 districts), Telangana (8 districts), Kerala (4 districts), Delhi (1 district) and Puducherry (1 district)}.  The scheme envisages creation of 600 new and 1000 scale-up enterprises. Under the scheme, mobilisation campaigns are being organized to spread awareness about entrepreneurship as a career option among various potential target groups. Further, orientation workshops are being conducted on entrepreneurship in the project institutes for aspiring/potential entrepreneurs. 		Further, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) in collaboration with GIZ, Germany has launched a pilot project called ‘Economic Empowerment of Women Entrepreneurs and Start-ups by Women’ to support aspiring and existing women entrepreneurs in India. Presently, this pilot programme is being implemented in the North Eastern Region (Assam, Meghalaya and Manipur), Rajasthan and Telangana where 147 women have been given incubation and acceleration support as part of its first cohorts. Furthermore, with an aim to promote a culture of entrepreneurship among India’s youth and inspire them to set-up their own enterprise and create employment opportunities for others, National Entrepreneurship Awards Scheme (NEAS) has been instituted in 2016. Under the scheme, awards are conferred to the aspiring first generation entrepreneurs including women and those individuals/ organizations who are working as eco-system builder in the field of entrepreneurship development. The awards also seek to highlight model of excellence for others to emulate and improve upon. So far, out of a total of 95 awards conferred (including 8 awards to the entrepreneurs and  two awards to the eco-system builders from Karnataka) during last 4 years (2016 to 2019), 39 women have received National Entrepreneurship Awards including 1 women awardee (Healthcare Sector in Year 2018) from Karnataka.In addition to the above, Government is providing financial assistance in form of loan to entrepreneurs under various schemes viz Rashtriya Mahila Kosh (exclusively for women) implemented through Ministry of Women and Child Development, Stand Up India Scheme implemented through Department of Financial Services (Ministry of Finance), Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Programme implemented through Ministry of Rural Development and Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency or MUDRA implemented by Department of Financial Services (Ministry of Finance).
