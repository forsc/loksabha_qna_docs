                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) to (d)  The Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan (GKRA) was launched on 20th June 2020, for a period of 125 days, with resource envelop of Rs. 50,000 Crore to boost employment and livelihood opportunities for migrant workers returning to villages and similarly affected citizens in rural area. The Abhiyaan adopted a multipronged strategy of providing immediate employment & livelihood opportunities to the distressed, to saturate the villages with public infrastructure and creation of livelihood assets to boost the income generation activities and enhance long term livelihood opportunities by giving focus on 25 works (including works under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) in 116 selected districts across 6 States namely Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The GKRA ended on 22nd October, 2020 and a total of 50.78 crore person-days employment were generated with a total expenditure of Rs. 39,293 crore during the Abhiyaan.No districts of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were included in the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan. The details of physical achievements/work done during the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan is given at Annexure.  State-wise number of districts covered under the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan is given as below: Sr.       No.State	        Number of Districts1	Bihar	                        322	Jharkhand	                 33	Madhya Pradesh	                244	Odisha	                         45	Rajasthan	                226	Uttar Pradesh	                31         Total 	                       116  (e)      Training has been conducted through Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) during Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan. A total of 1,922 trainings were conducted and 68,136 candidates were trained.(f)      There are two skill development programme for rural youth under DAY-NRLM, namely, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) and Rural Self Employment Training institutes (RSETIs). Both these programmes are aimed at increasing employability of rural youth, either for wage employment or self employment.  Project ‘UNNATI’, launched in December 2019 by Government of India, is a skilling project that intends to upgrade the skill base of the Mahatma Gandhi NREGS workers, and thereby improve their livelihoods, so that they can move from the current partial employment to full employment.  The Ministry of Rural Development has launched the Rural Mason Training (RMT) program under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) to address the issue of insufficient number of skilled masons for construction of quality PMAY-G houses. The initiative not only avails livelihood opportunities for the rural workforce but also contributes towards the availability of a skilled workforce for the construction of rural infrastructure under different schemes. The MoRD has partnered with the Construction Skill Development Council of India (CSDCI) and National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) in the implementation of the RMT program. Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is implementing Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) under Skill India Mission for skill based training of the youth across the country  (including youth belonging to rural areas) under Short Term Training (STT) courses and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). Under PMKVY, STT is linked to placement, while RPL does not mandate placements as it recognizes the existing skills of candidate.  At present, third phase of PMKVY i.e. PMKVY 3.0 is being implemented. PMKVY 3.0 is a demand driven scheme with bottom-up approach and District Skill Committees (DSCs) have been entrusted with the task of identifying local demand, based on which training has been arranged in the district which strengthens the local skill capability including in the rural areas. Also, Skill Hub Initiative has been launched under the PMKVY 3.0 wherein the focus is on the introduction of skill training programmes in the education ecosystems. The initiative would consider the policy level synergy on integration of vocational education with general education as envisioned in the NEP 2020. *****
