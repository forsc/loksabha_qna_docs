                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (e): The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act) is the primary law for children in country. The Act provides a security net of service delivery structures including measures for institutional and non-institutional care to ensure comprehensive well being of children in distress situations. As per the JJ Act, destitute children are considered as “Children in need of care and protection (CNCP). The primary responsibility of execution of the Act lies with the States/UTs. The Government of India has implemented the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 which is a comprehensive law that provides protection to children from the offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography. The Act provides mandatory reporting, child friendly provisions of recording of statement and evidence and speedy trial of the cases. Recently, the POCSO Act has been amended in order to make it more effective in dealing with cases of child sex abuse in the country. It addresses the need for stringent measures to deter the rising trend of child sex abuse in the country on one hand and the menace of relatively new kind of crimes on the other hand.The Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing a centrally sponsored Child Protection Services (CPS) Scheme (erstwhile Integrated Child Protection Scheme) for supporting the children in difficult circumstances.The primary responsibility of implementation of the scheme lies with the State Governments/UT Administrations. Under the scheme institutional care is provided through Child Care Institutes (CCIs), as a rehabilitative measure. The programmes and activities in Homes inter-alia include age-appropriate education, access to vocational training, recreation, health care, counselling etc. Under the non-institutional care component, support is extended for adoption, foster care and sponsorship. Further CPS also provides for “After care” services after the age of 18 years to help sustain them during the transition from institutional to independent life. The details of CCIs under CPS scheme as informed by the States/UTs during 2019-20 is at Annexure-I. Details of the funds released to the States/UTs under the said schemes during the last three years the current year, is at Annexure-II. Further, under Section 41 of the Act, registration of institutions including Homes for children in conflict with law has been made mandatory with penalty in case of non-compliance. The State Governments/UT Administrations, as per Section 54 of the JJ Act, are required to conduct regular inspection and monitor the CCIs to ensure that the institutions are run as per the provisions of the Act and the Model Rules, 2016 framed there-under.*** Annexure-IThe details of CCIs under CPS scheme as informed by the States/UTs during 2019-20(up to 30.01.2020) 	 	Institutional Care [Homes]	Open Shelters	Specialised Adoption Agencies#	State	No. Assisted	Beneficiaries	No. Assisted	Beneficiaries	No. Assisted	Beneficiaries1	Andhra Pradesh	66	2954	9	262	14	1402	Arunachal Pradesh	5	185	0	0	1	103	Assam	52	1617	7	104	21	724	Bihar	26	1567	5	134	13	1385	Chhattisgarh	65	2042	10	127	12	956	Goa	20	557	2	225	2	167	Gujarat	45	1706	0	0	12	868	Haryana	24	1322	14	425	7	529	Himachal Pradesh	32	1268	4	91	1	1510	Jammu and Kashmir	17	823	0	0	2	011	Jharkhand	41	1466	5	125	12	9212	Karnataka	79	3124	38	1084	25	31913	Kerala	30	721	4	100	11	22214	Madhya Pradesh	67	2804	8	348	26	24315	Maharashtra	74	2320	2	50	17	17016	Manipur	42	1160	14	296	7	5517	Meghalaya	44	868	4	150	4	518	Mizoram	45	1178	0	0	7	2619	Nagaland	39	609	3	60	4	520	Orissa	93	7112	12	300	25	25021	Punjab	19	620	0	0	6	7722	Rajasthan	85	2459	22	401	24	9923	Sikkim	16	496	4	64	4	2024	Tamil Nadu	198	12864	11	275	20	20025	Tripura	23	717	2	58	6	4926	Uttar Pradesh	74	3703	20	517	25	24727	Uttarakhand	20	437	2	50	2	1528	West Bengal	70	4156	49	1226	23	32629	Telangana	40	1306	0	0	11	32030	Andaman & Nicobar	10	401	-	0	2	1031	Chandigarh	7	252	0	0	2	1732	Dadra and Nagar Haveli	0	0	1	25	1	1033	Daman and Diu	1	25	-	0	-	034	Lakshadweep	-	0	-	0	-	035	Delhi	29	1614	9	313	3	5936	Puducherry	27	1043	2	42	2	16 	Total	1525	65496	263	6852	354	3476Annexure-IIDetails of the funds released to the States/UTs under CPS during the last three years the current year as on 30.01.2020 (Rs. in Lakh)Sl.
