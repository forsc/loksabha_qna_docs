Fit India Freedom Run was launched on the concept of virtual run, i.e., ‘it can be run anywhere, anytime’. This year, the 2nd edition of the Freedom Run, i.e., Fit India Freedom Run 2.0, was dedicated to the commemoration of the 75th year of India’s independence based on one of the pillars of Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav, “Resolves@75”. It was organised across the country from 13th August to 2nd October, 2021. The citizens were exhorted to make a resolve to include physical activity of at least 30 minutes daily in their lives with the motto of “FITNESS KI DOSE AADHA GHANTA ROZ”. It was virtually launched on the 13th August, 2021 from National Stadium, New Delhi. The campaign of 51 days had a massive reach of more than 9 crore participation with social media impressions of around 19 crore.(b) As a part of Fit India Freedom Run 2.0, a nationwide campaign was initiated by this Ministry to encourage individuals and public/private organisations to participate/organise the Freedom Run at their localities or any other convenient places. Individuals and organisations were provided with a registration facility on the Fit India portal for participating in Fit India Freedom Run. However, the participant organisations were registered from one nodal point for uploading the data even though they organised events in various parts of the country. Hence, district and village-wise details of such events are not available with this Ministry. As per the registration details on the Fit India website, the details of total events organised by individuals and various organisations and the participation in such events across the country are as follows:•	A total of 9,03,26,822 people participated in the Fit India Freedom Run and they covered a cumulative distance of 19,91,29,888 kilometres. •	The total number organisations registered for conducting the Fit India Freedom Run was 99,506 and the cumulative participation in such events was 9,00,34,986 people.•	The total number of individuals registered for participating individually was 2,91,836 and the total distance covered by them was 31, 28,788 kilometres.(c) Fit India is a people’s Movement.
