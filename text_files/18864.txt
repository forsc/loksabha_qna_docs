Thus, an increase of 333% over the average annual budget allocation of 2009-14 (`682 crore per year).Budget allotment for infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/partly in the State of Rajasthan for financial year 2019-20 was `4686 crore, which is 587% more w.r.t. 2009-14. Budget allocation of `4582 crore has been provided for Financial Year 2020-21, which is 572% more with respect to average Budget outlay for 2009-14.During 2009-14, 798 Km length (61 Km New Line, 675 Km Gauge Conversion and 62 Km Doubling) falling fully/partly in the State of Rajasthan was commissioned at an average rate of 160 Km per year.During 2014-19, 1517 Km (80 Km New Line, 484 Km Gauge Conversion and 953 Km Doubling) falling fully/partly in the State of Rajasthan has been commissioned at an average rate of 303 Km per year, indicating an increase of 90% over the commissioning during 2009-14.(b) & (c):  Sanction of projects for development of Railways is a continuous process.
