                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a) to (d) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO.70* FOR 5TH FEBRUARY, 2021(a) to (d) The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare administers a Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) for “Establishment of new medical colleges attached with existing district/referral hospitals”. Establishment of 157 new Medical Colleges has been approved under the scheme in three phases. The fund sharing ratio between the Central Government and States under the Scheme is 90:10 for NE/Special Category States and 60:40 for other States. Under the Scheme, a new medical college can be taken up by upgradation of a district hospital. As per the Scheme guidelines, such projects can be approved in districts where there are no prior Government or private medical college.   Under Phase-I of the Scheme, 58 districts in 20 States/UT have been approved for establishment of medical colleges. Total cost of establishment of one Medical College under this Phase is Rs.189 crore. Entire Central Share of Rs.7541.10 crore has been released to the State/UT Governments for these medical colleges. Out of these 58 medical colleges, 46 have become functional.  Details are at Annexure-I.	Under Phase-II of the Scheme (launched in February, 2018), 24 new medical colleges in 8 States have been approved.  The total cost of establishment of one Medical College under this Phase is Rs.250 crore. Funds to the tune of Rs.3150.70 crore have been released to the State Governments. Details are at Annexure-II.Under Phase-III of the Scheme launched in August, 2019, 75 new medical colleges have been approved in 18 States/UTs. The total cost of establishment of one Medical College under this Phase is Rs.325 crore. Funds to the tune of Rs.4111 crore have been released to the State Government/UT Administrations. Details are at Annexure-III.	The norms for establishment of medical colleges have been specified under the Establishment of Medical College Regulations, 1999. The National Medical Commission (NMC) has also framed Minimum Requirement Regulations, 2020 which provide for minimum standards viz. requirement of land, infrastructure, faculty, residents, equipments for the medical colleges. The applicant medical college must fulfill these requirements in order to obtain permission from the NMC as mandated under the NMC Act, 2019. The permission is granted only after physical verification of the infrastructure, human resources and other facilities.The establishment of new medical colleges will extend tertiary medical care to hitherto uncovered districts, increase the number of doctors and improve the doctor – population ratio. This will also promote affordable medical education in the country and optimally utilize the existing infrastructure of district hospitals.
