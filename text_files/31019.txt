                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	The Aspirational Districts Programme was launched on 5th January 2018 by the Government of India . Anchored by NITI Aayog, it aims to bring transformative changes in the most under-developed districts of India called Aspirational Districts. There are 112 Aspirational Districts, across 26 States and 1 Union Territory, under the Aspirational Districts Programme. At the time of selection, these districts have shown relatively less progress in key social and economic indicators. They were selected through a transparent process on the basis of published data. The programme aims at rapid transformation of these backward districts across sectors which are critical for improving quality of life or economic productivity of citizens. These sectors are Health and Nutrition, School Education and Basic Infrastructure, and also Agriculture and Water Resources and Financial Inclusion & Skill Development. 49 key performance indicators have been selected across these sectors and a district’s performance is monitored on the basis of progress made on these indicators. The broad strategy of the Aspirational Districts Programme rests on the 3 Cs – Convergence (between Central and State Schemes), Collaboration (between Centre, State, District Administration, Development Partners and Citizens) and Competition (between Districts). Every month, districts are ranked on the basis of progress made on the key performance indicators mentioned above, and this instills them with a sense of competition which results in rapid improvement. Another strategy of the programme is nomination of Joint Secretary/Additional Secretary level officials from Government of India as Central Prabhari Officers for each of the districts. The role of these Prabhari Officers is to guide the district administration on the basis of their long experience.  (b)	The list of Aspirational Districts in the States of Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh is provided in Annexure I.(c)	These Aspirational Districts were selected on the basis of their relatively less progress in key social and economic indicators on the basis of published data, applicable to all districts regardless of when they were created. List of data sets and the weight attached to them for selection of these districts is attached in Annexure - II. (d)	Details of the 49 Key Performance Indicators on which their performance is tracked on a monthly basis is attached in Annexure-III. Further details about the performance of the districts on these indicators is available on the Champions of Change Dashboard (http://championsofchange.gov.in/site/coc-home/).(e)	The Union Government under sections 46(2), 46(3) and 94(2) of the Andhra Pradesh Re-Organization Act (APRA), 2014 has released an amount of Rs. 1750 crore for development of seven backward districts (Ananthapuramu, Chittoor, YSR Kadapa, Kurnool, Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam) to the Successor State of Andhra Pradesh in 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17, 2019-20 and 2020-21. (f)	Details of release made to successor states for development of backward districts/ areas post bifurcation by the Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance are provided in Annexure IV.As the main strategy of the programme is based on convergence of existing schemes which have their own funding arrangement, large infusion of additional fund is not envisaged under the Aspirational Districts Programme. However, in order to foster a competitive spirit, and for addressing the critical gaps, additional allocation on challenge route is also envisaged. Every month, districts are assessed on the basis of monthly progress and the best performing Districts in overall terms and in each of the five sectors are identified. The first and second rankers in overall terms are awarded ?10 crores and ?5 crores respectively. The first ranker from each of the five sectors is awarded ?3 crores each. As per the scheme guidelines, districts having District Mineral Fund (DMF) in excess of Rs.30cr annually are not eligible for this assistance. Funds allocated to the Aspirational Districts of Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh based on their performance as of December 2021, is placed at Annexure-V.***** Annexure IList of Aspirational Districts in Andhra Pradesh and ChhattisgarhS.
