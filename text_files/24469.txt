ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ (SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL)(a) to (c) SVAMITVA Scheme aims to provide the ‘Record of Rights’ to village household owners possessing houses in inhabited areas in villages with issuance of legal ownership rights (Property cards/Title deeds). It is being implemented with the collaborative efforts of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, State Revenue Department, State Panchayati Raj Department and Survey of India (SoI). It helps in determining clear ownership of property by mapping of land parcels using drone technology. States need to sign Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with SoI for implementation of the scheme. So far, 24 States have signed MoU with SoI. State of Tamil Nadu is yet to sign MoU with SoI. The Scheme envisages to facilitate monetisation of properties leading to ease of securing bank loans, reducing property related disputes, comprehensive village level planning and determination of property tax, which would accrue to the Gram Panchayats directly in States where it is devolved. The Scheme also envisages the establishment of a network of Continuously Operating Referencing System (CORS) stations across the country for determining accurate locations. CORS network established under the scheme will have far-reaching implications as it would also facilitate any survey related activities like road construction, irrigation works and infrastructure works etc. in future.  Thus, State Governments can leverage the infrastructure established and data/information generated through drone survey including the property cards under the scheme in streamlining planning and collection of revenue in rural areas. The Scheme aims to cover all the villages across the country by March 2025 with estimated cost of Rs. 566.23 crores.  As on 14th July, 2021, the status of implementation of the scheme is attached at Annexure- I.***
