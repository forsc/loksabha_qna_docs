ANSWER




MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a):  A bilateral Protocol on Visits to Religious Shrines was signed in September 1974 by India and Pakistan. Under the Protocol, it is the obligation of the concerned country to make every effort to ensure that the places of worship in the agreed list of shrines under the Protocol are properly maintained and their sanctity preserved. (b): There have been reports of acts of vandalism of places of religious worship belonging to minority communities in Pakistan. The Government has raised all such cases with the Government of Pakistan, calling upon it to take steps to protect and promote the safety, security and well-being of its minority communities and their places of religious worship. Pakistan has also been asked to take immediate measures to expeditiously bring the perpetrators of such despicable acts to justice. *****
