(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):     The Government has no such proposal under their consideration for opening of agricultural export centers in the country.(b) :     To promote Agricultural tourism is primarily responsibility of the concerned State Governments /Union Territory Administrations. However, the Ministry of Tourism has taken the initiative of identifying, diversifying, developing and promoting niche tourism products in the country.  This is done in order to overcome the aspect of ‘seasonality’ and to promote India as a 365 days destination, to attract tourists with specific interest, and to ensure repeat visits for the unique products in which India has a comparative advantage.*****
