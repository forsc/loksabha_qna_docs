                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a), (b), (c), (d) & (e) The Central Government has launched National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) under the Central Sector “Control of Pollution” Scheme as a long-term, time-bound, national level strategy to tackle the air pollution problem across the country in a comprehensive manner with targets to achieve 20 % to 30 % reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations by 2024 keeping 2017 as the base year for the comparison of concentration. 102 non-attainment cities including cities in Indo-Gangetic Plain have been identified based on ambient air quality data for the period 2011 – 2015 and WHO report 2014/2018.  Unique meteorological conditions along with emissions from various local sources like industrial emissions, vehicular emissions, stubble burning, road and soil dust, construction and demolition activities contribute to poor air quality in Indo- Gangetic Plain particularly during winter months.         Steering, Monitoring and Implementation Committees have been constituted at Central level for overall guidance, policy formulation and implementation of NCAP. These Committees have participation from States as well. Similar Committees have been constituted at State level for State level execution. Meetings of Steering, Monitoring and Implementation Committees were held on 10 June 2019, 28 May 2019, 22 August, 2019,  respectively.  Further, a High Level Task Force (HLTF) was constituted for the management of air pollution in Delhi and NCR in November, 2017 in which Chief Secretaries of Haryana, Delhi and Punjab participate. The HLTF closely monitors the implementation of measures related to management of air pollution in Delhi and NCR. 12 HLTF Meetings/ Meetings at the level of Prime Minister Office have been held.	Also, regular meetings have been held with the States of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh , Punjab ,Rajasthan and Delhi under the chairmanship of Hon’ble Minister, Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Cabinet Secretary and Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for inter-State coordination for the abatement and control of air pollution. Measures to prevent and control air pollution from various sources like industrial emissions, vehicular emissions, stubble burning, road and soil dust, construction and demolition activities etc are coordinated in these meetings.Out of 102 non-attainment cities identified under NCAP, for the cities with million plus population and PM10>90µg/m³, Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Chang is funding ?10 crores in the current year for 28 such priority cities for various components, that inter alia include public awareness and capacity building activities.For the rest 62 non-attainment cities, funding of ?10 lakhs per city for cities with population less than 5 lakhs and ? 20 lakhs per city, for cities with a population of 5 to10 lakhs have been sanctioned for taking up activities related to advocacy, awareness generation, sensitization , capacity building etc.	Further, a Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) has been notified for prevention,    control and abatement of air pollution in Delhi and NCR. It identifies graded measures and implementing agencies for response to four AQI categories, namely, Moderate to Poor, Very Poor, Severe and Severe + or Emergency.                                      ***
