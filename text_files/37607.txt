ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE (SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a) to (e): The primary responsibility of development of infrastructure facilities for judiciary rests with the State Governments. To augment the resources of the State Governments, the Union Government has been implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for Development of Infrastructure Facilities for Judiciary by providing financial assistance to State Governments / UTs in the prescribed fund sharing pattern between Centre and States. The Scheme is being implemented since 1993-94. It covers the construction of court buildings and residential accommodations for Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Judiciary. A sum of Rs. 8758.71 crore has been released under the Scheme so far since its inception, out of which Rs. 5314.40 crore (60.68 %) has been released since  2014-15.  The Scheme has been extended from 2021-22 to 2025-26 with a budgetary outlay of Rs. 9000 crore including Central share of Rs. 5307.00 crore. Besides the construction of Court Halls and Residential Quarters, the Scheme now also covers the construction of Lawyers’ Halls, Digital Computer Rooms and Toilet Complexes in the District and Subordinate Courts. The release of funds under the Scheme is supplementary in nature and project-wise funds are not released under the Scheme. As on date 20,812 Court Halls and 18,338 Residential Units are available in District and Subordinate Courts. The State-wise details of availability of Judicial Infrastructure is at Annexure-I. A web portal and mobile app named “Nyaya Vikas” has been developed for online monitoring of construction projects under the above scheme which was launched in 2018.  “Nyaya Vikas Version 2.0”, with upgraded features has been launched in April, 2020. The State-wise statement of Completed, Under Construction and proposed Projects of Court Halls and Residential Units as on 28.03.2022 is at Annexure-II. As regards likely time for completion of projects, there is project to project variation in terms of size of the project and quantum of funds released.  However, on the Nyaya Vikas portal,  besides geotagging of the projects, provision is also there for indicating start date and completion date of the projects taken up under the scheme.      The above scheme only caters to the civil infrastructure of the District and subordinate courts. As regards information technology needs, the Government of India implemented the eCourts Mission Mode Project throughout the country for Information and Communication enablement of district and subordinate courts. In the phase I of the project, out of total outlay of Rs.935 cr, the Government incurred an expenditure of Rs.639.41 cr. In the Phase II of the eCourts project, out of total outlay of Rs.1670 crore, the Government has released a sum of Rs.1668.42 crores as on 28.03.2022 to various organizations involved in the implementation of the project.  One video conference equipment each has been provided to all Court Complexes including taluk level courts and additionally funds have been sanctioned for additional VC equipment for 14.443 court rooms. Funds for setting up 2506 VC Cabins have been made available. Additional 1500 VC Licences have been acquired. VC facilities are already enabled between 3240 court complexes and corresponding 1272 jails. A sum of Rs.7.6 crore has been released for procurement of 1732 Document Visualizers.  Status of year wise and High Court release and utilization as on 28.02.2022 is at Annexure-III.    The Department does not centrally maintain any data on number of courts having separate toilets for women and transgender respectively. However, the Registry of Supreme Court of India has compiled data on the status of judicial infrastructure and court amenities, according to which 74% court complexes have separate ladies toilets, while 84% have gents toilets.  While extending the scheme, new components have been included such as Lawyers Halls, Digital Computer Rooms and also to cover the construction of toilets, in the district and subordinate courts and Rs.47.00 crore has been allocated for the construction of Toilet complexes in the District and Subordinate Courts for a period of 5 years i.e. 2021-22 to 2025-26. ****** (a)	Annexure-ISTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTs (A) TO (E) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 4946 FOR REPLY ON 01.04.2022.(As on 28.03.2022)Sl.
