                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF JAL SHAKTI(SHRI  PRAHLAD  SINGH  PATEL)(a) 	Details of Centre share funds released to the State of Bihar under Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) [SBM(G)] during the last three years are as under:Financial Year	Funds released(Rs. in crore)2018-19	2943.692019-20	1867.382020-21	88.56(b) 	As per the data reported by Government of Bihar on the online Integrated Management Information System of SBM(G), 80,48,095 Individual Household Latrines (IHHLs) and 5,796 Community Sanitary Complexes (CSCs) have been constructed in Bihar during the last 3 years.  (c) 	Under SBM(G), the State Governments are to submit Utilization Certificate (UC) and Audited Statement of Accounts (ASA) for each financial year duly audited by a Chartered Accountant empaneled by the Office of Comptroller & Auditor General of India. The expenditure incurred under SBM(G) in Bihar have been reviewed from the UCs and ASAs submitted by the State Government and also during the review meetings, video conferences, etc, from time to time.(d) 	During some review meetings, slow progress of utilisation of funds in the State was observed.  During the review meetings itself, the State Government was instructed to expedite the utilisation of funds.   Letters were also written to the State Government in this regard.  Further, some of the shortcomings observed during examination of the UCs & ASAs are: proportionate State share was not released timely against Centre share of Rs.852.25 crore released during 2019-20; and advance given to other programme viz. Ganga Action Plan (GAP) from SBM(G) funds during 2018-19.  The shortcomings were communicated to the State Government with the request to take corrective actions at the earliest. Accordingly, the State Government took necessary action and released the pending State share and also recouped the advance from GAP funds to SBM(G) funds during 2019-20.*****
