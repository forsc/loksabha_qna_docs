ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES(SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR):(a) to (d)	Yes Sir, Film Promotion Fund, set up by the Government in 2017 provides financial assistance to the independent Indian filmmakers to promote their films at International Film Festivals across the world, thereby promoting Indian cinema in the international arena.  Financial assistance is provided to the filmmakers once their films are selected in International Film Festivals or events like Oscars.    Every year, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting organizes National Film Awards wherein films from across the country in Hindi/Regional Languages are awarded under different categories.	Also, every year, films are selected for Indian Panorama section of the International Film Festival of India (IFFI).  From these entries, 47 films, including 26 Feature Films and 21 Non-Feature Films, are selected in various Indian languages every year. Besides, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting Under the Government’s policy of “Ease of doing business” and “Digital India” launched the web portal www.ffo.gov.in on 20th November, 2018  to create a single window facilitation and clearance mechanism that eases the process of filming in India by foreign filmmakers.  This was done with a view to create greater ease in filming in India and at the same time endeavouring to create a film-friendly ecosystem and promoting the country as a filming destination.  This facility has been extended to domestic filmmaker from April, 2019.    (e)	National Film Archive of India (NFAI) was established in 1964 with the task of preserving the rich cinematographic heritage of the nation.  NFAI has digitized and restored several films that are from regional language.  From time to time, film festivals of regional films are organized from NFAI collection at various places in India and abroad for public access. In addition to this paper material like posters, photographs etc are put up on social media for wider outreach.  Exhibition of posters that includes regional films are also organized at various places from time to time across India for dissemination of film culture.  Further Government has launched National Film Heritage Mission, a Central Sector Scheme, to restore, digitize and archive films and filmic material and is being implemented through NFAI.*****
