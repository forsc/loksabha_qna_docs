ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) to (d)   Rivers in the country are polluted mainly due to discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage from cities/towns and industrial effluents in their respective catchments, poor operation and maintenance of sewage/effluent treatment plants, lack of dilution, dumping of solid waste on river banks and other non-point sources of pollution. Rapid urbanization and industrialization have compounded the problems. Cleaning and rejuvenation of rivers are an ongoing activity. It is the responsibility of the States/UTs and local bodies to ensure required treatment of sewage and industrial effluents to the prescribed norms before discharging into river and other water bodies, coastal waters or land to prevent and control of pollution therein. For conservation of rivers, this Ministry has been supplementing efforts of the States/UTs by providing financial and technical assistance for abatement of pollution in identified stretches of rivers in the country through the Central Sector Scheme of Namami Gange for rivers in Ganga basin and the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) for other rivers.            NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches on 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country with the sanctioned cost of projects as Rs.5965.90 crore, and sewage treatment capacity of 2522.03 MLD has been created. Under Namami Gange programme, a total of 346 projects have been sanctioned at a cost of Rs.30235 crore. This includes 158 projects for sewage treatment of 4948 MLD and sewer network of 5213 kms. sanctioned at a cost of Rs.24122.70 crore, against which sewage treatment capacity of 989.50 MLD has been created so far. This has resulted in reduction of pollution load being discharged in various rivers. The output of the initiatives yields improvement in the water quality of the rivers. State/UT-wise details of the financial assistance provided and STP capacity created under NRCP and Namami Gange programmes are given at Annexure. Details of funds allocated and utilized/released for cleaning/rejuvenation of rivers in the country during the last three years are as below: Contd…P/2 //2//  									            	(Rs. in crore) Financial Year	National River Conservation Plan	Namami Gange Programme	Budget Allocated	Funds Released 	Budget Allocated	Funds Released2018-19	150.50	150.32	2370.00	2626.542019-20	196.00	136.66	1553.44	2673.092020-21	100.00	99.87	1300.00	1339.97             Discharge of industrial effluents is monitored by Central Pollution Control Board/ respective State Pollution Control Boards/Pollution control Committees, and in case of non-compliance with the prescribed norms, actions are taken in accordance with the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.                Besides, in compliance of the orders of National Green Tribunal (NGT) in Original Application No.673/2018 regarding rejuvenation of polluted river stretches in the country, States/UTs are required to implement approved action plans for restoration of the polluted stretches in their jurisdiction as identified by CPCB and published in their report of 2018, within the stipulated timelines. As per the orders of NGT, regular review on implementation of action plans is undertaken in the States/UTs and also at Central level. *****  ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. †2954 to be answered on the 05/08/2021 regarding ‘Funds for Cleaning of Rivers’.
