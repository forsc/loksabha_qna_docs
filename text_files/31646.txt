                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL) (a) 	Since August, 2019, Government of India in partnership with States, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) Jal after subsuming erstwhile National Rural Drinking Water Supply (NRDWP) to make provision of tap water supply to every rural household of the country including those in Jalore and Sirohi districts of Rajasthan, by 2024.(b) to (d) Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) monitors the ground water level at periodical interval on a regional scale throughout the country including Rajasthan. In order to monitor the long-term fluctuation of water level, the Decadal mean Water level of November, 2010 – November, 2019 has been compared with November, 2020, which indicates that about 61% wells monitored in Jalore district and about 23% in Sirohi district are showing fall in ground water level.  CGWB has taken up aquifer mapping and management programme for delineation of aquifer disposition and their characterization for preparation of aquifer/ area specific ground water management plans with community participation in Jalore and Sirohi districts of Rajasthan. National Project on Aquifer Management (NAQUIM) studies have also been taken up in these two districts along with High Resolution Aquifer Mapping and Management in Arid Regions of North-Western India (Heli-borne Geophysical Survey) in Jalore.Moreover, interaction programme has been carried out in both Jalore and Sirohi districts to disseminate the principles of the ground water management plans and percolation of message on water conservation and protection down to the grass-root level and to develop community participation management approach in water sector. In 2019, Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) was launched to bring awareness on various aspects of water conservation and promote rainwater harvesting and artificial recharge. In 2021, this campaign has been extended to the whole country. Further, Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has been constituted for regulation and control of ground water development and management in the country under Section 3(3) of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. CGWA has advised States/UTs, including Rajasthan, to take measures to promote/adopt artificial recharge of ground water/ rain water harvesting. The guidelines for control and regulation of groundwater extraction with pan-India applicability has also been notified on 24 September, 2020.Important measures taken by the Central Government for conservation, management of ground water and effective implementation of rain water harvesting in the country are available in public domain at:http://jalshakti-dowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Feb2021.pdf*****
