                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c): 	There is no such proposal under consideration. However, the National Policy for Farmers (NPF), 2007 is already in place, which aims to improve economic viability of farming and increase net income of farmers.  	Further, the Government constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee in April, 2016 to examine issues relating to “Doubling of Farmers Income” and recommend strategies to achieve the same.  The Committee submitted its Report to the Government in September, 2018. To achieve this, the Committee has identified seven sources of income growth viz., improvement in crop productivity, improvement in livestock productivity; resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; increase in the cropping intensity; diversification towards high value crops; improvement in real prices received by farmers; and shift from farm to non-farm occupations. Subsequently an Empowered Body was set up on 23.01.2019 to monitor and review the progress against the recommendations.********
