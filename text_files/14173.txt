                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS,  HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) 	No, Sir.(b)  	To alleviate Right of Way (RoW) related difficulties associated with creation of both underground and over ground infrastructure and to bring a uniform policy on RoW, Government of India had notified the Indian Telegraph Right of Way Rules, 2016 on 15th November, 2016. The salient features of these rules with regard to charges for granting Right of Way (RoW) are as under:i)	Levy of one-time fee to meet administrative expenses for processing applications for Right of Way at the maximum rate of Rs 1,000/- per km for laying Optical Fibre Cable (OFC) and Rs 10,000/- per application for installation of towers.ii)	Levy of only restoration charges in case of laying Optical Fibre Cable (OFC). iii)	Compensation for the value of the immovable property in case of installation of towers.Steps such as consultation with State Governments / Union Territories, holding regional seminars and advocacy workshops have been taken up for facilitating adoption of Indian Telegraph Right of Way Rules, 2016 and roll-out of telecom infrastructure.(c)  	Lakkasamudram and Amagondapalem are the two villages in Anantapur district which do not have mobile and internet coverage. The National Broadband Mission has been launched in December 2019 which inter alia envisages to cover all the villages of the country with telecom infrastructure by 2022 including the villages of Anantapur district.(d)  	An inter- ministerial High level Forum for 5G India 2020 was constituted in September 2017 to articulate the Vision for 5G in India and to recommend policy initiatives and action plans to realize this vision. The High Level Forum submitted its report titled as “Making India 5G Ready” in August 2018. Based on the report, the Government is creating an enabling framework for deployment of 5G services in India. The 5G services are expected to be introduced gradually and advance to a full range of services as ecosystem and demand for services grows. The plan shall inter-alia, include Anantapur District in due course.**********
