                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) Water being a State subject, it is for the State Governments to take up water resources projects, including lift irrigation projects, in their jurisdiction. Role of Government of India is limited to being catalytic, providing technical support and in some cases partial financial assistance in terms with the existing schemes under implementation.  Financial assistance to major and medium irrigation projects, including lift irrigation projects, is being provided by this Ministry under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana- Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (PMKSY-AIBP). Further, financial assistance is also being provided by this Ministry under a special package taken up for financial assistance by Government of India in July, 2018 for completion of 83 surface minor irrigation (SMI) projects and 8 major / medium irrigation projects in drought prone districts in Vidarbha, Marathwada and rest of Maharashtra (Special Package). This Special Package has been taken up by Government of India as a one-time measure, and not a regular scheme. (b) For inclusion of a project for funding under PMKSY-AIBP scheme of this Ministry, it is required to be first appraised by Central Water Commission (CWC), and accepted by the Advisory Committee on Irrigation, Flood Control and Multipurpose Projects of this Ministry. Thereafter, investment clearance is required to be obtained by the State Government. Subsequently, if the project meets the laid down norms for the scheme, and as per availability of funds etc., Government of India may approve inclusion of a project under PMKSY-AIBP.  Similar procedure was followed for inclusion of projects under Special Package at its inception in 2018. The funding pattern for financial assistance being provided by this Ministry under PMKSY-AIBP, is as below: Category	Central : StateA. Projects in 8 North-Eastern, 2 Himalayan States (Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand) and Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh	90:10B. Projects benefitting special area in other General Category States i.e. command under Drought Prone Area Programme (DPAP) & Desert Development Programme (DDP), Tribal Area, Flood Prone Area, Left Wing Extremist Area, Bundelkhand, Vidarbha, Marathwada and KBK (Odisha).	60:40C. Projects in General Category States benefitting areas other than at B. above	25:75 Further, under Special Package, 25% central assistance is being provided on reimbursement basis, on the expenditure being made by the State Government on the on works component of the projects included under the package. (c) Details of the lift irrigation projects appraised by the Central Water Commission (CWC) during last three years, are as below: 1. Poorna Barrage-2 (Ner Dhamana) medium irrigation project, Maharashtra :  2nd revised cost estimate for Rs. 888.43 crore, benefitting 6,954 hectare of cultivable command area (CCA). 2. Seven Pneumatically Operated Gated Weirs in Series on Girna river, Maharashtra: Estimated cost of Rs. 781.32 crore, targeting to benefit CCA of 5,540 hectare. 3. Bodwad Parisar Sinchan Yojana, Maharashtra: Revised cost estimate for Rs. 3,763.60 crore, targeting to benefit CCA of 53,025 hectare. 4. Upper Bhadra Project, Karnataka: Estimated cost of Rs. 16,125.48 crore, targeting to benefit CCA of 2.25 lakh hectare. 5. Extension, renovation and modernization of Loktak Lift Irrigation Project, Phase-I, Manipur: Revised cost estimate of Rs. 81.59 crore, targeting to benefit CCA of 12,600 hectare. However, appraisal of irrigation projects, including lift irrigation projects, is not being undertaken by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB). (d) & (e) Water being a State subject, it is for the State Governments concerned to formulate, plan and implement irrigation projects, including lift irrigation projects. Government of India provides partial financial assistance to some of these projects under its existing schemes.  UT/ State-wise list of lift irrigation projects presently under implementation with financial assistance from Government of India under PMKSY-AIBP and Special Package, including those from Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh, is annexed below.  ****ANNEXUREANNEXURE AS REFERRED TO IN PART (d) & (e) OF REPLY TO UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 4650 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 31.03.2022 REGARDING “ASSISTANCE FOR LIFT IRRIGATION PROJECTS” Details, including central assistance released during each of the last three years and current year, for lift irrigation projects/schemes under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana – Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme and Special Package for drought prone districts in Vidarbha, Marathwada and rest of Maharashtra.(Rs. in crore)S.
