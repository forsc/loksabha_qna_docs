The details of proposals received from the 4 States and action taken thereon are given at Annexure. 	As per the Framework for Implementation of PMAY-G, the identification of beneficiaries under PMAY-G is based on the housing deprivation parameters and exclusion criteria prescribed in the Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011 and after due verification by Gram Sabha.

The proposals under Special Projects include rehabilitation/relocation of families whose houses have been completely/substantially damaged on account of natural disasters including floods, cyclones. The beneficiaries identified under Special Projects are only those households that are listed in the Permanent Wait List (PWL) of PMAY-G.As per the Framework for Implementation of PMAY-G, the cost for implementing the scheme is to be shared between Government of India and State Governments in the ratio of 60:40 except for North-Eastern and Himalayan states where the funding pattern is in the ratio of 90:10. For UT, 100% funds are provided by the Centre.While submitting a proposal under Special Projects of PMAY-G in respect of households affected by floods and Cyclone Fani, by Govt of Kerala and Govt of Odisha respectively, request was made for providing funds in the proportion of 100:0 and 90:10 instead of 60:40. The Ministry has not agreed to the requests of Government of Kerala and Odisha.*****
