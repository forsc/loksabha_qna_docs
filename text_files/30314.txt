                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS (SHRI RAMESWAR TELI) (a):	Prices of petrol and diesel are market-determined with effect from 26.06.2010 and 19.10.2014 respectively. Since then, the Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) have been taking appropriate decision on pricing of petrol and diesel on the basis of international product prices and other market conditions. The OMCs have increased and decreased the prices of petrol and diesel according to changes in international prices and rupee dollar exchange rate. The Average price of Indian Basket of Crude oil has risen approximately 313% from April, 2020 to October, 2021 ($19.90/bbl to $82.11/bbl).Prices of LPG in the country are based on Saudi Contract Price (CP), the benchmark for international prices of LPG. However, for domestic LPG the Government continues to modulate the effective price to consumer to insulate the common man from rise in international prices. Saudi CP has risen approximately 238% from April, 2020 to October, 2021 (236 USD/MT to 797 USD/MT). (b):	The details of the prices of domestic LPG and commercial LPG as on 1st April 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and 1st December 2021, in four metro cities is given as Annexure-I.(c):	Details of State/UT-wise PMUY Customers (enrolled under earlier PMUY scheme) taken refill are given as Annexure-II.x-x-x-x-x
