(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	Government fixes Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for 22 mandated agricultural crops and fair and remunerative price (FRP) for sugarcane on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP), after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned and other relevant factors. These MSP crops account for 99 percent of agricultural production (excluding horticulture production) in the country. The Union Budget for 2018-19 had announced the pre-determined principle to keep MSPs at a level of atleast one and half times of the cost of production. Accordingly, Government had increased MSPs for all mandated crops with a return of at least 50 percent over all India weighted average cost of production for the season 2018-19. Government has recently increased the MSPs for all mandated kharif and rabi crops for 2019-20 season in line with the principle of providing atleast 50 percent return over all India weighted average cost of production. The details of MSP and the returns for last three years are given in Annexure.(b):	Various subsidies are provided to farmers under different schemes inter-alia including Rainfed Area Development, Sub-Mission on Seed and Planting Material, Mission on Integrated Development of Horticulture, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanisation, Fertilisers by Department of Fertilisers, Interest Subvention Scheme, Implementation of Market Intervention Scheme and Price Support Scheme etc. The actual expenditure for agricultural schemes for year 2017-18 and 2018-19 and budgetary estimates for year 2019-20 is Rs. 37,389 crore, Rs. 46,415 crore and                Rs. 1,30,302 crore respectively.
