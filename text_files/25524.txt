                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)\(a) & (b)  Government of India has decided to provide separate budget heads for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes category beneficiaries under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA) from current FY 2021-22 for wage payment. Accordingly, wage payments are released to accounts of wage seekers of all States/UTs under National Electronic Fund Management System (NeFMS) for Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribes and Others category. For better accounting purpose, this change has been made.(c)     Mahatma Gandhi NREGA Act, 2005 is to provide at least 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult member volunteers to do unskilled manual work. State can provide additional man-days of work over and above of 100 days from its own resources. An additional 50 days of wage employment is provided over and above 100 days in the notified drought affected areas or natural calamity areas in the country on recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.  At present, there is no plan to increase days of work under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA.(d)    As per Para 5 of Schedule I of the Act the Works creating individual assets shall be prioritized on land or homestead owned by households belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.*****
