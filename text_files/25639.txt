                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION, MINISTER OF STATE ( INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)  (a)  to (d) A statement is laid down on the table of the House.  STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *128 TO BE ANSWERED ON 28th JULY 2021 (a)   The Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) is governed by a set of guidelines, which are revised from time to time based on the needs of the community with emphasis on creation of durable assets. During the covid-19 pandemic, the Government allowed purchase of testing, screening and other facilities including installation of Oxygen plants in Government hospitals and dispensaries under MPLADS, by relaxing the guidelines. The extant MPLADS guidelines was last issued by the Ministry in June 2016. Subsequent changes made in the guidelines are at Annexure I. (b)    The Government is aware that there has been an emergent need to help people in this pandemic. Accordingly, the Cabinet in its meeting held on 6th April, 2020 decided not to operate MPLADS for the Financial Years 2020-21 and 2021-22; and place the MPLADS funds for these two-years at the disposal of Ministry of Finance to meet the emergent needs of people. The funds saved from the MPLAD Scheme have been utilized to enhance the allocation of funds for improving health infrastructure, provide free ration under PM Garib Kalyan Yojana, and free vaccination for the people. However, on requests made by Members of Parliament, the Government released Rs. 1107.5 crore against the pending instalments of 2019-20 and previous years in 2020-21 to clear the committed liabilities and help the people during the covid-19 pandemic. The Government has also decided to release all pending instalments of 2019-20 in respect of Members of Parliament of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha during 2021-22, subject to the fulfilment of eligibility criteria and submission of eligible documents by district Authorities, as per the MPLADS guidelines. (c) & (d)    There are no proposals under consideration of the Government  for restoration of MPLADS funds for the Financial Years 2020-21 and 2021-22 and to increase the MPLADS allocation from Rs.5 crore to Rs.10 crore.                                               *****
