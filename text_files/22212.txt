                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	The Ministry addresses the issue of migration from villages to cities through a multi-dimensional approach by creating avenues for employment and livelihood living in the villages.  In this regard, the Government is implementing various schemes/ programmes to bring about overall improvement in the quality of life of the people in rural areas through employment generation, strengthening of livelihood opportunities, promoting self-employment, skilling of rural youths, provision of social assistance and other basic amenities. The details of the schemes/programmes implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development are given below:- (i) Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS): The principal objective of the scheme is to provide for the enhancement of livelihood security of the households by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. It stresses on creation of durable and sustainable assets to make the beneficiaries self-dependant.  (ii) Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM):  The Ministry is implementing DAY-NRLM to tackle the problem of unemployment, especially among women, in a mission mode with the objective of organizing the rural poor women into Self Help Groups (SHGs) and continuously nurturing and supporting them to take up economic activities till they attain appreciable increase in income over a period of time to improve their quality of life and come out of abject poverty. Besides, Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Programme (SVEP), the sub-scheme under DAY-NRLM, has the objective of helping Self Help Group (SHG) and their family members to set-up small enterprises in the non-farm sector.  (iii) Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen KaushalyaYojana (DDU-GKY) and Rural Self Employment and Training Institutes (RSETIs):  The Ministry is implementing two Skill development initiatives for rural poor youth under National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) to improve the economic condition of the rural population, namely, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushal Yojana (DDU-GKY), a placement linked skill development scheme for rural poor and Skill development through Rural Self Employment and Training Institutes (RSETI), which provides skilling, thereby enabling the trainee to take bank credit and start his/her own Micro-enterprise. Some of such trainees may also seek regular salaried jobs.  (iv) Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G): PMAY-G aims to provide a pucca house with basic amenities to all rural houseless households and households living in kutcha and dilapidated houses in rural areas. The target under PMAY-G is to construct 2.95 crore houses during the period 2016-17 to 2021-22. (v) Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY): PMGSY was started in the year 2000 with the objective to provide all-weather road connectivity to eligible unconnected habitations. The mandate of the scheme was subsequently widened and new interventions viz. PMGSY-II and PMGSY-III were added for upgradation of the existing rural road network which connect habitations to the various facilities and services. The implementation of the ongoing PMGSY has helped immensely in lifting the socio–economic conditions of rural masses by providing them access to the various services and facilities, market place and employment opportunities in various forms.  (vi) Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Rurban Mission (SPMRM):  The Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM) launched in February 2016, is a scheme with the objective to stimulate local economic development, enhance basic services, and create well planned Rurban clusters. The mission takes cluster as a unit for development. 300 Clusters from all the States/ UTs are selected in the first phase of the Mission in Tribal and Non-Tribal categories. SPMRM provides the Critical Gap Funding to the projects which directly or indirectly bring economic growth. SPMRM aims to provide amenities in four categories viz Basic, Economic, Social and Digital and promotes economic growth through integrated and balanced investments with social inclusion.  (vii) National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP):  It is a social welfare programme for the aged, widows, disabled and in the cases of death of the primary breadwinner belonging to Below Poverty Line (BPL) Households. It is 100% centrally funded Central Sponsored Schemes (CSS) implemented in the entire country including rural and remote areas. Besides the schemes/ programmes of MoRD mentioned above, major schemes of other Ministries for generating employment and skill development of the rural population are given below:(i). Prime Minister’s Employment Generation (PMEGP): The Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises has been implementing a credit-linked subsidy programme named Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) since 2008-09 with Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) as nodal agency at the national level for generating employment in the country by setting up of micro-enterprises in the non-farm sector by helping traditional artisans and unemployed youth. (ii) Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY): The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) had launched Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) in the year 2015. The objective of this Skill Certification Scheme is to enable a large number of Indian Youth to take up industry-relevant skill training that will help them in securing a better livelihood. Individuals with prior learning experience or skills will also be assessed and certified under the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) component of the Scheme. RPL mainly focuses on the individuals engaged in unregulated sectors. All these measures encourage people in rural areas to earn their livelihood and raise their quality of life near their places of residence and hence, act as a deterrent to migration of rural population to cities.(b)	 & (c)   As per the information received from National Statistical Office, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, from the survey on ‘Employment & Unemployment and Migration Particulars’ conducted during 2007-08 (64th round) and ‘Employment & Unemployment’ survey conducted during 1999-2000 (55th round) by National Statistical Office, the estimates of  Migration Rate (per 1000 persons) for urban areas at all India level and Number of persons migrated from rural areas to urban areas per 1000 migrants in urban areas at all India level are given below:Migration Rate (per 1000 persons) for urban areas and number of persons migrated from rural areas to urban areas per 1000 migrants in urban areassurvey period      Migration Rate (per 1000 persons)          Number of persons Migrated (round)	           for urban areas at all India level	    from rural areas to urban areas per 1000                                                                 migrants in urban areasJuly 1999 – June 2000(NSS 55th round)	       334	                              586July 2007 – June 2008(NSS 64th round)	       354	                              592 There is no data post 2008.*****
