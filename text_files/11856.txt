Under the scheme, loan is being provided by all Public Sector Banks, selected Private Sector Banks and Co-operative Banks with margin money subsidy by Ministry of MSME through KVIC.

Beneficiaries belonging to special categories such as Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe/OBC /Minorities/women, ex-serviceman, physically handicapped, NER, Hill and Border areas etc. can avail the margin money subsidy of 35% in rural areas and 25% in urban areas.
