ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) and (b):    National Bureau of Crime Records (NCRB) collates crime data from all the States/ Union Territories and publishes it as “Crime in India” report. Many improvements had been undertaken in Crime in India report for the year 2017 to make it more comprehensive, informative and useful for stakeholders. This required a revision in data collection and compilation software, adequate training of State/Union Territories’ officials on the new software, validation and removal of ambiguities in the data. With persistent follow-ups with the States/Union Territories, final data was received in July 2019, and Crime in India 2017 was released on 21st October 2019. (c):    Advisories have been issued by NCRB to all States/Union Territories to furnish complete data sets in a timely manner for speedy publication.  *******
