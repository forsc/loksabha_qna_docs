This Ministry through various programmatic interventions supplements the efforts of State/ Union Territory (UT) Governments for providing houses to eligibleurban beneficiaries of the country. Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U), being implemented since 25.06.2015, is a demand driven scheme and Government of India has not fixed any target for construction of houses in a State/Union UTs. All State/UTGovernments have undertaken a demand survey to assess housing requirement for the eligible beneficiaries in urban areas and prepared project proposals accordingly. Against validated demand of 112.24 lakh houses, 114.02 lakh houses have been sanctioned so far under PMAY-U. Of the sanctioned houses, nearly 92.40 lakh houses have been grounded for construction; of which 54.40 lakh houses have been completed/delivered.All the projects sanctioned within the scheme period i.e. till March, 2022 are to be completed as per the time schedules mentioned in respective Detailed Project Reports (DPRs). (e):  Government of India has taken slew of regulatory, policy, financial and fiscal reforms to encourage investment by the private developers specially in the affordable housing sector and boost the real estate sector, while implementing PMAY-U. Few of the initiative taken are (i) Reduction in GST from 8% to 1% (with no input tax credit) for Affordable housing and for other housing projects from 12% to 5% (with no input tax credit), (ii) Accordance of Infrastructure Status to Affordable Housing to enable loans at cheaper rate through priority sector lending, (iii) Allowing 100% FDI under automatic route in construction projects, (iv) Income tax exemption under Section 80 IBA of IT Act (v) Introduction of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 to regulate the real estate sector and ensure transparency and accountability etc.(f): Admissible Central assistance in projects was made available in time even during Covid-19 pandemicto States/UTs so as to ensure the momentum of construction work for the houses under PMAY-U.Moreover, in order to encourage healthy competition among States/ UTs/ ULBs and recognize their best performance, PMAY-U Awards 2021 have been strategized through 150-Days Challenge process for performance against pre-defined indicators with emphasis on grounding, completion and occupancy of houses.The Ministry has been reviewing the progress of the scheme on regular basis and all States/UTs have been advised to complete all the sanctioned projects/houses within the stipulated timeline.                               *****
