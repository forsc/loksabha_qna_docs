                                                        (a) to (d): The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is not running any specific scheme to set up Industrial Training Institutes and Vocational Training Institutes to provide employment opportunities to the youths in the tribal dominated areas of the country. However, Ministry of Tribal Affairs was earlier providing funds for running Vocational Training Centres (VTCs) by the State Governments / NGOs including Government of Madhya Pradesh as at Annexure 1. However, with the creation of Ministry of skill Development  as a separate Ministry in 2014 and compulsory requirement of National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF), from 2018-19 onwards, the intervention of Vocational Training Centres was subsumed under the then Scheme of ‘Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS) and Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution.  Now for carrying out Skill Development / Vocational Training programmes, funds are provided to State Governments based on proposals received from them which are appraised and approved by the Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) within the State''s share of allocation. Details of funds provided for skill development and vocational training of tribal persons under the scheme ‘Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS) and Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution during last four years is at Annexure 2. Besides, under Van Dhan Vikas Karyakram,which is targeted at livelihood generation for tribals, traditional knowledge and skill sets of tribals are enhanced by adding technology & IT to help them becoming self-reliant and entrepreneurs. Under this Karyakram, tribal community owned Minor Forest Produce (MFP) centric multi-purpose Van Dhan Vikas Kendra (VDVKs) are set-up in tribal dominated districts. The members are given skill training and provided tool kits for processing of MFP and development of value chain. Details of State-wise No. of VDVKs sanctioned  with beneficiaries are at Annexure 3.
