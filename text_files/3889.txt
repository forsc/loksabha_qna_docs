ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) FOR CULTURE AND TOURISM(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a)	Yes, Sir. Satras are institutional centres associated with the Ekasarana tradition of Vaishnavism. There are several hundreds of these institutions in Assam, and they are independent of each other. Each Satra is under the control of an Adhikara (Satradhikar). 	The Satras were set up by the great Vaishnava saint and reformer of Assam Shrimanta Sankaradeva as a powerful tool for the propagation of Vaishnava faith. He integrated art and bhakti through music, dance and drama. Through his simple dramas in Brajabuli language, he made the audience aware of bhaktirasa and selfless devotion for the Supreme Being. 	Sankaradeva established his first Satra at Bardowa, his birthplace.(b)	Yes, Sir. Barpeta is an administrative district in Assam. The most important centre of attraction at Barpeta is the Satra established by the great Vaishnava saint and chief disciple of Sri Sri Sankaradeva, Madhavadeva. At the Barpeta Satra, Madhavadeva laid down the system of daily prayer service and initiated the system of religious titles.   (c)	There is no proposal under the consideration of Government of India to make Barpeta town into a religious tourist place.
