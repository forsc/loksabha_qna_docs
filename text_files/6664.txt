Some of the steps taken by the Government to counter automotive slowdown can be summarized as under:•	Reduction in Corporate Tax to 22%•	Continuation of registration of ICE and EV in future•	Scrappage policy under consideration•	Proposed increase in registration of new cars deferred till June 2020•	Funds worth Rs. 70,000 crores released  to PSU banks•	Linking of repo rate to interest charged for vehicle purchased			                         *****
