ANSWER




(a) Yes, Sir. Government implements the Swadhar Greh Scheme that caters to primary needs of women in difficult circumstances – women and girls rendered homeless due to family discord, crime, violence, mental stress, social ostracism or are being forced into prostitution and are in moral danger. The scheme provides institutional support for rehabilitation of these women so that they could lead their life with dignity. The Scheme envisages providing shelter, food, clothing, counseling, training, clinical and legal aid along with economic and social security for the women victims of difficult circumstances. (b) The funding pattern for the release of funds is 60:40 between the Central Government and States except for North-Eastern and Himalayan States where the applicable sharing ratio is 90:10. In case of Union Territories, the entire cost is borne by the Central Government. Funds to the States/UTs are released in two installments every year. Allocation is decided considering the number of operational projects, number of new projects likely to be sanctioned in the year and availability of resources. First installment amounting to 50% of allocated grant is released in the beginning of the Financial Year and Second installment is released after 60%of the first installment has been utilized. State/UT-wise details of funds allocated, released and utilized under the said scheme during the last three years are at Annexure-I.(c) The Scheme is open to all the women falling under the Scheme criteria due to any reasons, including Covid-19. Segregated details are not available.(d) The organizations assisting Government in implementation of said Scheme are one of the following: State Government agencies including Women Development Corporations established by the State Governments; Central or State Autonomous Bodies; Municipal Bodies; Cantonment Boards; Panchayati Raj Institutions and Co-operative Institutions; Departments of Women and Child Development/Social Welfare of the State Governments which may construct Swadhar Greh and run them on their own or lease them to organization(s) having requisite experience; Public Trusts registered under any law for the time being in force; Civil Society Organizations such as NGOs etc. having proven track record of working in the fields of women’s welfare/social welfare/ women’s education subject to the condition that such organization is registered under the Indian Societies Registration Act, 1860 or any relevant State Act.The organization stated above should meet the following criteria: (i) It should be either recognized by the State/ UT Administration under existing Scheme/law or should be well known with the experience of working in the field for  at least 3 years and its work should be reported to be satisfactory by the State Government/Union Territory Administration concerned, (ii) It should ordinarily have been engaged in the field of women’s welfare/ social welfare/women’s education for a minimum period of two years prior to the request for grant-in-aid under the scheme, (iii) It should have facilities, resources, personnel and experience to undertake the management of such a project, (iv) Its financial position should be sound to take care of expenditure for a few months in case the grant is delayed, (v) It should run the Swadhar Greh on a no-profit basis, (vi) The organization should have facilities like computers, internet connection etc. at Swadhar Greh.(e) The existing Swadhar Greh Scheme is effective from 01.01.2016 and has benefitted thousands of destitute women in different States/UTs. For proper implementation of the Scheme, monitoring is done at three levels, i.e., District level, State level and Central level. *****Annexure-I Annexure referred to in reply of part (b) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 977 for reply on 03.12.2021 regarding Swadhar Greh Scheme.
