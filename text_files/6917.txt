These Level Crossings (LCs) qualify for their replacement by Road over Bridge (ROB) on cost-sharing basis with State Government as traffic density is more than one lakh Traffic Vehicle Unit (TVU).  Accordingly, State Government has been approached to submit the formal proposal for construction of ROB at these locations alongwith necessary consents for sharing of cost and closure of LC. Despite regular chasing from Zonal Railway at Chief Secretary level, no response has been received from State Government. (e) & (f): Yes, Sir.  However, Railway is not in a position to take any action in the absence of consent from State Government.*****
