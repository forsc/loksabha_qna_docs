The Ministry also allocates funds for the States/ Union Territories (UTs) for development of State Roads, including State Highways (SHs), and Roads of Economic Importance and Inter State Connectivity (EI&ISC) as per the provisions of the Central Road Fund (CRF) Act, 2000 amended by the Finance Act from time to time. However, the Ministry does not conduct any survey for such state roads including SHs.With the amendment of CRF Act, 2000 through Finance Act, 2018 and replacement of the earlier Act by the Central Road and Infrastructure Fund Act (CRIF), 2000, sanction of schemes for State Road is no longer a function of the Central Government.(b) A project of about 16 km length on SH in the State of West Bengal was completed under ISC scheme in February, 2018 for total cost of about Rs.50.27 crore.(c) The Ministry releases funds for the road works under CRF Scheme based on the Utilisation Certificates (UCs) received from State Governments / UTs, duly ensuring that adequate fund is available with States/ UTs at all the times. The Ministry reviews the progress of projects and expenditure incurred while releasing funds based on such UCs.The funds for State Roads under EI & ISC Schemes are allocated keeping in view the committed liabilities, progress of works, inter-se priority, etc. For EI & ISC works, the direct payment procedure applicable for NH works is followed; the funds are released directly to the contractors by the Ministry’s Regional Offices (ROs)/ Engineering Liaisons Offices (ELOs)/ Regional Pay and Accounts Offices (RPAOs) based on the works done and bills received/ processed. The total Accural/Allocation and Release/Expenditure for CRF and EI&ISC works during last three years are as follows: -Amount Rs. in croreYear	CRF	EI&ISC	Accural	Release	Allocation	Expenditure2016-17	7,175.00	5,069.82	805.00	746.352017-18	6,744.07	6,367.11	759.20	676.562018-19	6,927.23	6,784.49	500.00	474.82(d) The year-wise total targeted length of works taken up for the roads linking other states under ISC Scheme and its achievements are as follows: -Length in kmYear	Target	Achievement2016-17	232.54	160.772017-18	442.08	346.102018-19	186.54	137.96*****
