                                                                                   THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE                       MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                         (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a): Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has launched Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHCs) as a sub-scheme of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) to provide dignified living to urban migrants/ poor near their workplace. This scheme is being implemented through two models as under: i.	Model-1: Utilizing existing Government funded vacant houses constructed under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JnNURM) and Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY) to convert into ARHCs through Public Private Partnership (PPP) or by Public Agencies, ii.	Model-2: Construction, Operation & Maintenance of ARHCs by Public/ Private Entities on their own available vacant land. ARHCs scheme is being implemented in all Statutory Towns as per Census 2011 and Towns notified subsequently, Notified Planning Areas and areas of Development/ Special Area Development/ Industrial Development Authorities. Beneficiaries for ARHCs belong to Economically Weaker Section/ Low Income Group who are urban migrants/ poor. They include labour, urban poor (street vendors, rickshaw pullers, other service providers etc.), industrial workers, and migrants working with market/ trade associations, educational/ health institutions, hospitality sector, long term tourists/ visitors, students or any other persons of such category.Further, the details of ARHCs scheme are available in its Operational Guidelines at http://arhc.mohua.gov.in/filesUpload/Operational-Guidelines-of-ARHCs.pdf.(b) to (d):  As per scheme guidelines of ARHCs, all land owning Public/ Private Entities including Central Public Works Department (CPWD), National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) and industrial companies may construct, operate and maintain ARHCs on their own available vacant land for urban migrants/ poor, under Model- 2. Under Model-2 of the scheme, MoHUA has issued the Expression of Interest (EoI) three times to shortlist the Public/ Private Entities for construction of ARHCs for urban migrants/ poor on their own available vacant land. Pursuant to said EoI, proposals for construction of 78,885 new ARHC units have been sanctioned.                             *****
