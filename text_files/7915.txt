                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (f):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (f) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1566 BY SHRI CHIRAG KUMAR PASWAN TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 27.11.2019 REGARDING CONSTRUCTION OF RAILWAY LINE IN NAXAL AFFECTED AREAS(a)  to (d) : Jamui is already on Indian Railways network falling between Kiul and Jhajha on Delhi-Howrah main route. However, to further improve rail connectivity to Jamui region, 3 more railway projects namely (i) Bariarpur-Mananpur (68 Km) new line project costing ?250 Cr., (ii) Nawada-Laxmipur (137 Km) new line project costing ?2629 Cr. and (iii) Jhajha-Batia (20 Km) new line project costing ?496 Cr. falling in close proximity of Jamui  region have been taken up. Details of projects including budget are available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in > Ministry of Railways > Railway Board > About Indian Railways > Railway Board Directorates > Finance (Budget).(e) & (f). The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions  of working agencies/contractors etc. All these factors vary from project to project & site to site and affect the completion time and cost of the project, which is finally worked out at the completion stage. As such no confirmed time line can be given for completion of these projects.*****
