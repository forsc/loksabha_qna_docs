                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS,  HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) 	Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) has reported that it is committed to abiding by and implementing all labour laws. BSNL issues instructions from time to time to its circles for strict compliance of related statutory provisions and also to take suitable action against erring contractors for violation of labour laws.(b) to (d) 	BSNL has reported that it has received complaints related to delay in payment of wages to labourer by the contractors in its circles.  No penal action has been taken against erring contractors as BSNL itself was unable to make timely payment of pending bills of contractors due to current poor financial condition of BSNL.************
