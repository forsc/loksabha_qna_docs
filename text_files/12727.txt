                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a): 	A Statement showing State/UT wise total number of Ration Cards in the country at present is annexed............2/--2-(b) to (d): 	Under the scheme on “Integrated Management of Public Distribution System (IM-PDS)” the Department is implementing nation-wide portability of ration card holders through ''One Nation One Ration Card'' plan, which enables any eligible ration card holder/beneficiary covered under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) to lift their entitled foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) of their choice in the country by using their existing/same ration card after biometric/Aadhaar authentication on electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices installed at the FPSs. So far, the facility of national/inter-State portability under this plan is available in 12 States, namely - Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Kerala, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Telangana and Tripura. Further, integration of remaining States/UTs depends on the readiness of States/UTs to implement the same.	Further, Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and the State/Union Territory (UT) Governments, wherein, inter-alia the operational responsibilities for identification of eligible households/beneficiaries under NFSA, issuance of ration cards to them rest with the concerned State/UT Governments. However, to ensure that the benefits of NFSA are reaching to all vulnerable and economically weakest sections of the society through TPDS, the Department has advised all States/UTs to take pro-active approach for reaching out to such sections of the population through special drives from time-to-time to identify and issue ration cards to them under NFSA. (e): 	Under NFSA ration cards, at present beneficiaries can only lift foodgrains namely Rice, Wheat and Coarse-grains from the Fair Price Shops (FPSs).****AnnexureANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.1534 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 11.02.2020 IN THE LOK SABHAStatus of End-to-End Computerization of PDS Operations Scheme Sl.
