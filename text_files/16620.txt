ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) to (c):   Agricultural marketing is a state subject and wholesale markets are set up under the provisions of respective State Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act. However, in order to improve  farmers’   accessibility to the markets  as per standard norm prescribed in the Report of National Commission on Farmers (2006), Government has taken several steps  like  promoting development of private mandis, direct marketing, declaring  warehouses/ silos/ cold storages as deemed markets and also developing Village Haats into Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs).           Further, the Government is supporting the development of infrastructure for market development and warehousuing facilities through schemes like Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana-Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied Sector Rejuvenation (RKVY-RAFTAAR) Scheme and Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) sub-scheme of Integrated Scheme for Agricultural Marketing (ISAM).           Further, in pursuance to the announcement of Atmnirbhar Bharat Abhiyan Package, the Government has approved a new central sector scheme for Financial Facility under Agriculture Infrastructure Fund of Rs. 1,00,000 Crore to provide a medium-long term debt financing facility for investment in viable projects for post-harvest market infrastructure including warehousing facility and community farming assets through incentives and financial support.           In addition to the above, in order to provide additional channels to farmers for marketing of their produce and promote barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade and commerce, the Government has notified “The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020” on 5th June, 2020. The Ordinance is intended to make better farmer- market linkages.          Further, The Government has promulgated “The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020” to protect and empower farmers to engage with agri-business firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters or big retailers for farm services and sale of future farming produce at a mutually agreed remunerative price framework in a fair and transparent manner.
