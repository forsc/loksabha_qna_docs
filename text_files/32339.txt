ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI AJAY KUMAR MISHRA)(a) to (c): National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) compiles prison statistics reported to it by States and Union Territories (UTs) and publishes the same in its annual publication “Prison Statistics India”. The latest published report is of the year 2019. State/UT-wise total available capacity of prisons, total number of prisoners lodged in them and occupancy rate of prisons as on 31st December, 2019 are given in Annexure-I.(d): Country-wise number of foreigner prisoners lodged in prisons across the country as on 31st December, 2019 are given in Annexure-II.(e):	‘Prisons’/‘persons detained therein’ is a State subject under Entry 4 of List II of   the   Seventh  Schedule   to   the  Constitution  of  India.  Administration   and management of prisons is the responsibility of State Governments who are competent to ensure that prisons in their jurisdictions are not overcrowded. However, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has taken several initiatives to address the issue of overcrowding in prisons. The Government of India has inserted Section 436A in the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), which provides for release of an under-trial prisoner on bail on undergoing detention for a period extending up to one half of the maximum period of imprisonment specified for an offence under any law. The concept of plea bargaining was also introduced by inserting a new “Chapter XXIA” on “Plea Bargaining” (Sections 265A to 265L of CrPC) which enables pre-trial negotiation between the defendant and the prosecution. E-prisons Software, which is a Prison Management Application integrated with Interoperable Criminal Justice System provides facility to State Jail authorities to access the data of inmates and helps them in identifying inmates whose cases are due for consideration by the Under Trial Review Committee. State Legal Services Authorities have established Legal Service Clinics in Jails and have deployed Para Legal Volunteers to provide free legal assistance to persons in need. The Model Prison Manual 2016, prepared and circulated to States and UTs by MHA, has a dedicated Chapter on ‘Legal Aid’ which provides the details of facilities that are to be provided to undertrials, viz. legal  defence,  interview  with  lawyer,  signing  of  Vakaltatnama,  application to Courts for legal aid at Government cost etc. MHA has also issued various advisories to the States & UTs for adopting appropriate measures to address the issue of overcrowding in prisons. These advisories are available on MHA’s website at: https://mha.gov.in . *****
