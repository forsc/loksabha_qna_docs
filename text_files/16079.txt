ANSWER




ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a):  	The Government is inter alia implementing  the following Centrally Sponsored  Schemes under Ministry of Women and Child Development for empowerment of women and children, through NGOs, across the country including  Maharashtra:   (i) 	The Swadhar Greh Scheme which targets women living in difficult circumstances without social and economic support like deserted women and women survivors of natural disaster who have been rendered homeless, trafficked women/girls, women victims of terrorist violence, mentally challenged women/girls who are without support and women with HIV/AIDS deserted by family. These women are in need of institutional support for rehabilitation so that they could lead their life with dignity. The Scheme envisages providing shelter, food, clothing and health services as well as economic and social security for them along with facilitating their emotional and economic rehabilitation into the society. (ii) 	Ujjawala Scheme  for combating trafficking of women and children for commercial sexual exploitation, with five specific components – Prevention, Rescue, Rehabilitation, Re-Integration and Repatriation of victims of trafficking. The scheme has been conceived primarily for the purpose of preventing trafficking on the one hand and rescue and rehabilitation of victims on the other. The scheme provides for rehabilitation of victims by providing food, shelter, counseling, medical care, legal aid and vocational training as well as their reintegration into society. (iii)  	Working Women’s Hostel Scheme (WWH)  is  implemented through Govt. bodies as well as NGOs to  promote availability of  safe  and  conveniently located  accommodation  for  working  women,  with  day  care  facility  for  their  children, wherever possible, in urban, semi urban, and even rural areas where employment opportunity for women exist. The scheme is assisting projects for construction of new hostel buildings, expansion of existing hostel buildings and also for running hostel buildings in rented premises.  The scheme is implemented across the country including Maharashtra. (iv)  	The scheme of Family Counselling Centre (FCC) is implemented by Central Social Welfare Board (CSWB) across the country including Maharashtra. FCCs are providing professional counseling, referral and rehabilitative services to women who are victims of atrocities, marital discord, dowry problems, family maladjustment, alcoholism, social ostracism as well as in cases of crisis intervention and trauma counseling. The centers are functioning in close collaboration with local government, police, family courts, legal aids cells and allied agencies. Backward & Forward linkages of these Centres are with Women Helpline (WHL), One Stop Centre (OSC) etc. (b) : 	For effective implementation of these schemes, the Ministry of WCD has issued detailed guidelines for monitoring mechanism. The schemes have inbuilt monitoring mechanism.  Swadhar Greh scheme is monitored at three levels i.e. District level, State level and Central level and monitoring of Ujjawala scheme is at  Panchayat/Block/ District level, State level and Central level. As per the Scheme Guidelines, regular monitoring of the functioning of the hostels under this scheme is the responsibility of the District Administration. Half-Yearly report on the implementation of the scheme as prescribed in the scheme should be sent to the Ministry of Women & Child Development, New Delhi by the District Administration, with a copy to the State Government . Under FCC of ICT (Information-Communication-Technology) monitoring is done through Web/App based Daily Reporting System (Portal). The Portal was developed for indentifying and establishing data collection. All Implementing Agencies running the Centres and their Counsellor have been registered in the Portal and details of cases and other documents such as Half Yearly Progress Report (HYPR), Audited Accounts etc. are uploaded. Inspection Reports are also being uploaded in the Portal. Regular monitoring, guidance, support is provided through Govt. Officials in the field. Each Centre is visited at least twice in a year or more, if required. A sub-committee constituted with social workers, representative of local administration, police, state-free legal aid cells, other Voluntary Organizations etc. is reviewing each centre at least once in three months. Half Yearly Progress Reports, Utilization Certificates and Audited Accounts in the form of Receipt & Payments, Income & Expenditure and Balance Sheet are submitted by Voluntary Organizations. (c) & (d) : 	The  Schemes have proven effective in improving the living standard of beneficiaries by providing  shelter, food, clothing and health services as well as economic and social security for them along with facilitating their emotional and economic rehabilitation into the society under Swadhar scheme;  by  providing rehabilitation of victims by providing food, shelter, counseling, medical care, legal aid and vocational training as well as their reintegration into society under Ujjawala  scheme; and by  providing safe and conveniently located accommodation to the working women under WWH scheme.  	The scheme of FCC of CSWB is helpful in dealing with wide range of problems faced by women and families through its counseling, referral and rehabilitative services. The FCCs also create awareness and mobilize public opinion on social issues affecting the status of women like female foeticide, domestic violence, sexual abuse, dowry etc. Apart from that women and their families are being sensitize about the laws related to crime against women and children. The outcome of scheme is assessed through Web based portal, Half Yearly Progress Reports submitted by the VOs and inputs given by Officers of CSWB and State Government. Assessment of success achieved is made on the bases of no. of cases being dealt by centres, cases settled and no. of women rehabilitated in the family or mainstream.
