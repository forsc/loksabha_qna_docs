ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS (SHRI DEVUSINH CHAUHAN)(a) to (c)	BharatNet project is being implemented in a phased manner to provide broadband connectivity to all Gram Panchayats (GPs) in the country. The infrastructure created under BharatNet project is a national asset, accessible on a non-discriminatory basis to the Service Providers. The Phase-I has been implemented by laying incremental underground Optical Fibre Cable (OFC) in linear topology with Gigabyte Passive Optical Network (GPON) technology. The implementation of Phase-II is by connecting GPs through an optimal mix of media (i.e. OFC, radio and satellite) and by laying new OFC  from Block to GPs.On 30.06.2021, Union Cabinet accorded approval for a revised strategy for implementation of BharatNet through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model in 16 States of the country covering about 3.61 lakh villages including GPs. The Tamil Nadu State Government signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) and Bharat Broadband Network Limited (BBNL) on 31.03.2017 for implementation of BharatNet project. Phase-I of BharatNet was accordingly not taken up in Tamil Nadu. Therefore, all the Gram Panchayats of Tamil Nadu State are being taken up in Phase-II of BharatNet. Further, this is being implemented under the State-led model.The BharatNet Phase-II is being implemented in Tamil Nadu by the State Government under 4 Packages (namely A, B, C and D).The actual implementation work is yet to commence. Letters of Acceptance (LoA) have been issued for all the 4 Packages. However, 2 Packages are in litigation and the matter is pending for disposal. The timeline for project completion is 360 days from the date of issuance of Award of Work.Bharat Broadband Network Limited (BBNL), the Executing Agency for BharatNet Project under Department of Telecommunications, has released funds for implementation of the project in Tamil Nadu during each of the last three years and the current year as given below:<pre>Year	Funds released (in Rs. crore)2018-19	02019-20	0.012020-21	36.982021-22 (till date)	0Total	36.99</pre>(d) & (e)	The implementation of BharatNet upto GPs in Tamil Nadu is being done for about 12,524 GPs through State-led Model. The present approval for PPP model for BharatNet does not include Tamil Nadu State. However, the Union Cabinet on 30.06.2021 has accorded in-principle approval for extending broadband to all inhabited villages of the remaining States and Union Territories (UTs), including Tamil Nadu and the targeted date for completion upto each inhabited village is August, 2023.******
