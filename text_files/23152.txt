MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (f):National Education Policy (NEP), 2020 envisages imparting programmes in higher education, using mother tongue/local language as a medium of instruction, and/or offer programmes bilingually, in order to increase access and Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) and also to promote the strength, usage, and vibrancy of all Indian languages.

Further, SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds) is a Govt. of India’s own Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform, which has been offering online courses in disciplines such as Science, Engineering & Technology, Humanities & Social Sciences, Law, Management etc. The current status of translation of SWAYAM courses is as below:Sl.No.	Language	Number of courses translated1.
