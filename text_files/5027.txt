ANSWER




                                                                   ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE      (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) to (e): Considering the dominant view of the States that a majority of the resources should flow in the form of tax devolution and the suggestion of an overwhelming majority of States for reducing the number of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) as well as outlays on them, the 14th Finance Commission recommended a jump of 10% in the States’ share in the net proceeds of the Union tax revenues from 32% to 42%.  In view of the substantial increase in devolution of taxes to States and higher revenue deficit grants recommended by the 14th Finance Commission, the Central Government on 9th March, 2015 constituted a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on rationalization of Centrally Sponsored Schemes. Based on the recommendation of the Sub Group of Chief Ministers and in consultation with various Ministries/ Departments and other Stakeholders, GoI has rationalized the existing 66 Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSSs) into 28 schemes and revised the funding pattern for CSSs which was communicated by NITI Aayog vide it’s O.M. dated 17.08.2016. The  existing 66 Centrally Sponsored Schemes have been rationalized into 28 schemes, broadly divided into two categories, namely, (i) Core of the Core Schemes (6), (ii) Core Schemes (22). The funding pattern of the restructured Centrally Sponsored Schemes is  (i) Core of the Core schemes (6 in nos): No change in the erstwhile funding pattern, (ii) Core schemes (22 in nos): For the 8 North Eastern States and Himalayan States of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir, 90% of expenditure is borne by Centre, and remaining 10% by States. For the rest of the States - sharing ratio between Centre and State is 60:40.  Further, the level of flexi fund available in each CSS has been raised from 10% to 25% after revising the funding pattern of CSS. This was done to enable the States to satisfy the local needs and undertake innovations.  The trend in outlays in the Expenditure Budget of GoI for 28 CSSs for the last four years shown below reflects an increase of around 37.42% in 2019-20 BE (Final) compared to actual of 2016-17.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    (Rs. in Crore)Actual 2016-17	Actual  2017-18	RE  2018-19	BE (Final) 2019-202,41,296	2,85,448	3,04,849	3,31,610The Terms of Reference (ToR) for the 15th Finance Commission, mandates that while making its recommendations, the Commission shall have regard, among other considerations, to the impact on the fiscal situation of the Union Government of substantially enhanced tax devolution to States following recommendations of the 14th  Finance Commission, coupled with the continuing imperative of the national development programme including New India –2022; and the Commission may consider proposing measurable performance - based incentives for States, inter alia, in the area of achievements in the implementation of flagship schemes of Government of India, disaster resilient infrastructure, sustainable development goals, and quality of expenditure.******
