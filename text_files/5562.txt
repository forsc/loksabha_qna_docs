ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 5125 BY SHRI JASWANT SINGH BHABHOR TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 24.07.2019 REGARDING LAYING NEW RAIL LINE BETWEEN DAHOD-INDORE(a) to (d): Dahod–Indore (200.45 Km) new line project has been included in the Budget 2007-08. The latest anticipated cost of the project is `1640 crore. An expenditure of `638.31 crore has been incurred upto 31.03.2019 and an outlay of `175 crore has been provided for the year 2019-20.Indore-Rau-Tihi (21 Km) section has been commissioned and work has been taken up in balance section, wherever land is available.Dahod–Indore new railway line project has been delayed due to inadequate fund allotment till 2013-14. From 2014-15 onwards, the project has been getting enhanced fund allotment and work on this project has been speeded up. The timely Completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, cyclones, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions of working agencies/contractors etc.. All these factors affect the completion time and cost of the project, which is finally worked out at the completion stage.	In the overall interest of the Nation and to ensure that projects are completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, Divisional level, Zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues that are obstructing the progress of projects.To ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects.        Since complete encumbrance free land has still not been handed over by the Government of Madhya Pradesh to the Railways, therefore, no confirmed time frame can be fixed for completion of this project at this stage. *****
