                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c):    Yes, the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare administers a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for ‘Establishment of new Medical Colleges attached with existing district/referral hospitals’. Under this Scheme, three phases have been launched so far. Contd……..-2-Under Phase I, 58 districts in 20 States/UT, having no medical college and district Hospitals/referral hospital with bed strength of 200 or more were identified and approved for establishment of new medical college at a cost of Rs.189 crores each. Funds to the tune of Rs.7507.70 crore have been released to the State/UT Governments for the approved medical colleges. 42 medical colleges have become functional. Details are at Annexure-I. Under Phase II of this Scheme, 24 new medical colleges in 8 States have been identified with the objective to ensure the availability of one medical college in every 3 Parliamentary Constituencies and one Government medical college in each State.             The total cost of establishment of one   Medical College under this Phase is Rs.250 crore. Out of 24 medical colleges identified, 22 have been approved till date and funds to the tune of Rs.2254.59 crore have been released to the State Governments. Details are at              Annexure-II.          Phase-III of the Scheme has been approved by the Cabinet on 28.8.2019. Under this phase, 75 new medical colleges have been proposed to be established in districts where there are no medical colleges and 57 medical colleges have been approved till date.          The total cost of establishment of one Medical College under this Phase is Rs. 325 crore. Funds to the tune of Rs. 575 crores have been released to the State Governments as central share. Details are at Annexure-III.          The fund sharing between Centre and State under this Scheme is in ratio of 90:10 for NE/Special Category States and 60:40 for other States.          Establishment of medical colleges under this scheme would lead to mitigate the shortage of doctors in the country by increasing the number of undergraduate seats to meet the health care needs of the population, promote affordable medical education in the country, improve tertiary care in the Government sector. Further, the existing infrastructure of district hospitals will be utilized for establishment of medical colleges in a cost effective manner. (d) to (f):      As per the website www.giodirectory.gov.in, as on date, there are 724 districts in the country of which it is estimated that 413 districts do not have Government Medical colleges. Under Phase III of the Scheme, the Government is establishing 75 new medical colleges in the districts where there is no medical college, government or private by 2022-23. The State/UT governments have been requested to send proposals for consideration in the Ministry.  As on date, 89 proposals have been received under this Scheme, of which, 57 have been approved. Details are at Annexure IV.…………………
