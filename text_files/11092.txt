ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TOURISM (INDEPENDENT CHARGE)(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) to (e):	Development of Pilgrimage Centres/Tourist centres is the responsibility of respective State Governments/Union Territories. Ministry of Tourism, under the schemes viz. “Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual, Heritage Augmentation Drive (PRASHAD)” provides Central Financial Assistance for infrastructure development and beautification of pilgrim places on receipt of suitable proposals submitted by State Governments/Union Territories, subject to availability of funds, liquidation of pending utilisation certificate against the fund released earlier and adherence to the relevant scheme guidelines.Based on the proposal received from the State Government of Karnataka Ministry of Tourism identified “Chamundeshwari Devi Temple, District Mysuru” for pilgrimage infrastructure development under the scheme. Concept Presentation for the project was held on 18.09.2019. However, during the site visit conducted by the team from the Ministry of Tourism to access the requirement of the developments, it was observed that a project for creation of infrastructure facilities covering almost all the required for pilgrimage, is being implemented at Chamundeshwari Devi temple by the state Government of Karnataka. Thus at present no proposal from the state Government of Karnataka is under consideration under PRASHAD Scheme of Ministry of Tourism.********
