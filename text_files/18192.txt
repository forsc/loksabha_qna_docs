ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) It is true that India is one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world. ;;To meet the growing demand, the steps being undertaken include, inter alia:   1.	Operationalisation of over 100 new airports during the period 2019-2024.   2. 	Promotion of private investments in existing and new airports through the PPP route. The revenue received from PPP concessionaires at AAI airports will result in further investment by AAI at Tier-II and Tier-III cities and economic development in these areas in terms of job creation and infrastructure growth.   3.	Route rationalisation in the Indian airspace in coordination with Indian Air Force for efficient airspace management, shorter routes and reduced fuel consumption.    4.	Expansion of the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) infrastructure by way of reduction in GST to 5% with effect from 01 Apr 2020.    5.	Expansion of cargo infrastructure by way of simplification of procedures, greater digitalisation and lower dwell times.    6.	Development of skilled professionals through the Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi (IGRUA), Rajiv Gandhi National Aviation University (RGNAU), Aerospace and Aviation Skill Sector Council (AASSC) and other skills development entities in the private sector.   7.	Effective regulation of the aviation sector by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) and Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (AERA).  Effective implementation of safety standards has resulted in DGCA receiving the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) President''s Award in September 2019 at ICAO''s 40th Assembly Session at Montreal, Canada.;(b) Yes Sir, the Government proposes to operationalise over 100 new airports during the period 2019-2024, including many locations where there is no airfield. The list of proposed new airports is attached herewith as Annexure.(c) & (d) CAPA had submitted a report on "Strengthening and financing manpower and skills at the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)" on 20 March 2019 to Ministry of Civil Aviation. The report looked at global bench-marking related to, inter-alia, governance and regulatory structure, funding mechanism, training programs and automation of key activities etc.
