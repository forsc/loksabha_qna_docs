                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS[RAO INDERJIT SINGH](a) to (c):- Ministry of Corporate Affairs has taken various measures to reduce the compliance burden considering the impact of COVID-19 pandemic:- (i) 	The Companies Fresh Start Scheme, 2020 was launched to make a fresh start for companies to become fully compliant by allowing them to file belated documents in MCA 21 registry without any additional fees from 1st April to 31st December, 2020. The said scheme had also given immunity from prosecutions and proceedings for imposition of penalty which might arise on account of such delayed filing of documents. (ii) 	LLP Settlement Scheme, 2020 was introduced to provide a one-time relaxation in additional fees to the defaulting Limited Liability Partnerships (‘LLPs’) to make good their defaults by filing pending documents with the Registrar of Companies (‘ROC’ or ‘Registrar’).  The said scheme was initially rolled out from 16.03.2020 to 31.03.2020 for certain filings by LLPs.  However, due to the COVID 19 pandemic, the modified further expanded scheme to cover all e-forms was rolled out from 01.04.2020 to 31.12.2020. Under the said scheme, the defaulting LLPs were permitted to file belated documents. (iii)  Keeping in view the second COVID wave and considering the difficulties arisen due to resurgence of COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry had granted relaxation on levy of additional fees for companies / LLPs in filing certain forms (other than a CHG-1 Form, CHG-4 Form and CHG-9 Form). Accordingly, no additional fees was levied upto 31st August, 2021 for the delayed filing of forms (other than charge related forms referred above) which were due for filing during 1st April, 2021 to 31st July, 2021. For such delayed filings upto 31st August, 2021 only normal fees was payable.  (iv) In the wake of COVID 19 and in order to provide relief to law abiding companies, a scheme was launched for relaxation of time for filing forms related to creation or modification of charges under the Companies Act, 2013 during the period from 01st March to 31st December, 2020.  (v)  Considering the difficulties arisen due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the Ministry vide General Circular No. 7/2021 dated 03.05.2021 and General Circular No. 12/2021 dated 30.06.2021 had granted relaxation of timelines and waived off fees/additional fees/advalorem fees as the case may be in filing of forms relating to creation/modification of charges (CHG-1 form CHG-9 form) by any company or charge holder. In terms of section 77 of Companies Act a charge or modification thereof is required to be filed mandatorily within a maximum period of 120 days from the date of its creation or modification with fees/additional fees/advalorem fees as applicable. By the aforesaid circular, where filing of charge or modification thereof was due before 1st April 2020-21 and period of 120 days were not lapsed from its creation or modification, fees/additional fees/ advalorem fees were waived off and further rigid time line of 120 days for filing of  charge related form were relaxed by not counting certain period for the purpose of reckoning the period of 120 days for filing of charge or modification thereof.(vi) Condonation of Delay Scheme was launched for Companies restored by NCLT between 1st December, 2020 to 31st December, 2020 under section 252 of the Companies Act, 2013.
