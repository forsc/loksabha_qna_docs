ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)   Under Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM) a total of 300 Rurban clusters with thematic economic growth points are to be developed across the country. Out of 300 Rurban clusters, 100 clusters each were allocated to States/UTs in three phases in Financial Year (FY) 2015-2016, 2016-2017 and 2017-18 respectively.  As per the provisions of Clause 12 of Framework of Implementation (FOI) of SPMRM, the cluster selection process is done by the Ministry and the States. There are two categories of clusters under SPMRM – (i) Non-Tribal and (ii) Tribal, and the process of selection varies for each of these categories.  The detailed criteria as per the provisions of FOI is given at Annexure-I.  (b)  No Sir. No other cluster apart from Mandir Hasaud under Raipur Parliamentary Constituency of Chhattisgarh State is proposed.*****Annexure-INon-Tribal Clusters: For selection of Non- Tribal clusters, the Ministry has provided a list of leading sub districts to each State, within which the clusters could be identified. The selection of these sub districts by the Ministry is based on parameters such as (i) Decadal Growth in Rural Population (ii) Decadal Growth in Non-Farm work force participation (iii) Presence of Economic Clusters (iv) Presence of places of Tourism and Pilgrimage significance and (v) Proximity to Transport Corridors Appropriate weightage have been given for each parameter.Thereafter, within these sub districts, so identified by the Ministry, the State Governments could select the clusters and while doing so, could include the following performance parameters:i.	Decadal growth in Rural Population.ii.	Rise in Land Values.iii.	Decadal growth in Non- Farm Work force participation.iv.	Percentage Enrollment of girls in secondary schools.v.	Percentage Households with Bank accounts under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.vi.	Performance in Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen).vii.	Good Governance Initiatives by Gram Panchayats. Any other factor which the States may consider relevant may also be included. However, a total weightage of 80% would be given for the first 4 parameters and the States have the flexibility to choose the last three parameters, subject to a total weightage of 20%.  While selecting the Rurban cluster the State may identify a large village/gram panchayat that are growth centers with resources available in the area that could potentially lead the economic transformation of the region. These growth centers could also be block headquarter villages or census towns. The clusters could then be formed by identifying geographically contiguous villages/ gram panchayats within a radius of 5–10 km (or radius appropriate to the population density and geography of the region) around the identified growth center.  Tribal Clusters: For identification of the tribal clusters, the Ministry selected the leading sub districts falling within the top 100 tribal districts of the country, based on the Scheduled Tribes population. The selection of these sub districts is based on parameters such as: (i) Decadal growth in Tribal Population (ii) Current Tribal Literacy Rate (iii) Decadal growth in Non- Farm Work force participation (iv) Decadal growth in Rural Population and (v) Presence of Economic Clusters.  Appropriate weightages have been given for each of these parameters while selecting the sub districts. Thereafter, within these sub districts so identified by the Ministry, the State Governments selects the clusters and while doing so, could include the following performance parameters: i.	Decadal growth in Tribal Population.ii.	Growth in Tribal Literacy rates.iii.	Decadal growth in Non- Farm Work force participation. Any other factor which the States may consider relevant may be included in addition to the above three parameters, provided the weightage for the above three parameters is not reduced below 80%. While selecting the Rurban cluster, in addition to the quantitative aspects mentioned in section 12.2.2 above, the state lays special emphasis on tribal areas and villages so as to ensure development of tribal areas.*****
