ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E RMINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) to (c): 		Under the Public Distribution System (PDS) reforms, the Department is implementing the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan for nation-wide portability of ration cards under the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), with an objective to empower all around 80 Crore NFSA beneficiaries, particularly migrants (mostly poor and needy) to seamlessly lift their entitled NFSA foodgrains from any electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) enabled Fair Price Shop (FPS) of choice in the country by using their same existing ration card along with biometric authentication. Presently, up to December 2020 the ONORC is enabled in 32 States/UTs covering almost 86% of the total NFSA population (nearly 69 Crore beneficiaries) in the country, enabling them to lift their entitled foodgrains from any FPS nearby to their place of work or stay in these States/UTs, even during the COVID-19 pandemic/ lockdown. Further, the Department is continuously pursuing with remaining 4 States/UT of Assam, Chhattisgarh, Delhi and West Bengal to enable the ONORC at the earliest, depending upon their requisite technical readiness. To implement the ration cards portability under ONORC, the key responsibilities of States/UTs include installation of ePoS devices at the FPSs, seeding of Aadhaar numbers with ration cards and enable biometric authentication of beneficiaries in the FPSs. Further, under NFSA the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and Priority Households (PHH) ration cards are issued to eligible households/beneficiaries by the respective States/UTs including Tamil Nadu up to ceiling coverage under the Act which may also include SC/ST/OBC population. (d): 	As per the data appearing on central portals, an average of more than 75% monthly electronic PDS transactions at the national level are being done through biometric/Aadhaar authentication of beneficiaries.(e): 	No sir. (f): 	The NFSA provides coverage of up to 75% of rural population and up to 50% of urban population – upto a maximum 81.35 Crore beneficiaries in the country (as per the Census of 2011) to receive highly subsidized foodgrains from Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) every month. The coverage under the Act is substantially high to ensure that all the vulnerable and needy sections of the society, including differently-abled, get food security benefits. Further, the responsibility for identification of eligible households/ beneficiaries and issuance of their ration cards rests with the States/UTs. In so far as coverage of eligible disabled persons is concerned, directions have been issued to all the States/UTs under Section-38 of the Act to cover eligible disabled persons under NFSA.***
