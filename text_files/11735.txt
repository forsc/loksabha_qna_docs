ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPNDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a) & (b):  Statistics is under the Concurrent list of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, and the Indian Statistical System is laterally decentralized among the Ministries of the Government of India at central level, and vertically decentralized between the Centre and States. The Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation (MoSPI),  being the nodal agency for planning an integrated development of the statistical system in the country, coordinates the statistical work in respect of the Central Ministries/Departments and State/Union Territory Directorates of Economics & Statistics (DES).  To strengthen the system, the Ministry undertakes periodic assessment of human resource capacities and other requirements including financial resources, and takes appropriate action thereon. The Ministry implements the “Capacity Development (CD) Scheme” for augmentation of infrastructural, technical as well as manpower resources of statistical activities of the Ministry. One of the sub-schemes of the CD Scheme is the ‘Support for Statistical Strengthening (SSS)’ of States which aims at improving the statistical capacity and operations of State Statistical Systems.  (c) & (d):  MoSPI brings out the estimates of macroeconomic indicators namely, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Consumer Price Index (CPI), Index of Industrial Production (IIP), etc on a regular basis. These are released as per the pre-announced advance release calendar. Expert Committees/ Advisory Groups are constituted for guiding the methodology to be used for compiling such aggregates.  As per the international standard practices, these indicators are revised periodically to ensure that they remain relevant and reflect the structural changes in the economy more realistically. The Government also adopted the United Nations Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics (UNFPOS) in May, 2016 to further strengthen the national statistical system in producing reliable data by adhering to internationally agreed professional and scientific standards. The Government also set up the National Statistical Commission as an apex advisory body on statistical matters which periodically reviews the functioning of the statistical system.                                               *****
