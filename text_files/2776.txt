MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (d):  	   A statement is laid on the Table of the House.--2--STATEMENT IN REPLY TO THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *236 FOR 09.07.2019(a):	Based on the statistics during 1891-2017, on an average 5 cyclones develops over north Indian Ocean (NIO) in a year. There is no such trend indicating an increase in number of cyclones during recent years. The forecasting of cyclones is done by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). IMD has developed the appropriate mechanisms and technology for early warning on cyclones. IMD has one of the best forecasting systems using high resolution advanced mathematical models for predicting tropical cyclones crossing both west and east coasts of India and associated adverse weather over India. The cyclone forecast accuracy of IMD has improved significantly in the recent years as demonstrated during cyclones Phailin, Hudhud, Vardah, Titli and Fani. (b):	Damages from Cyclones depends upon its intensity accompanied by destructive wind, storm surges and torrential rainfall. However, with the improved forecasting, better preparedness and mitigation measures, loss of the human lives from Cyclones has been significantly reduced.  (c) & (d):	Central Government is implementing the  National  Cyclone Risk --3--L.S.S.Q.NO. 236 FOR 09.07.2019Mitigation Project (NCRMP) in 8 coastal states with a total outlay of ? 4903 crore to mitigate the sufferings of the coastal community who are generally poor and vulnerable to various types of disasters. Cyclone shelters and early warning system created under this project proved to be of great help during cyclones ‘Phailin’ in 2013, ‘Hud-Hud’ in 2014, ‘Titli’ in 2018 and recent cyclone ‘Fani’. ******
