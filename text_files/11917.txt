                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b)	The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component & 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs).         Under the NPP, four priority links have been identified for preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPR) under the Peninsular Rivers Component viz; Ken-Betwa link project (KBLP), Damanganga-Pinjal link project, Par-Tapi-Narmada link project and Godavari-Cauvery link project. The DPRs of KBLP, Damanganga-Pinjal link project and Par-Tapi-Narmada link project have been sent to the concerned States. Draft DPR of Godavari-Cauvery link project consisting of three links viz; Godavari (Inchampalli/Janampet) – Krishna (Nagarjunasagar), Krishna (Nagarjunasagar) – Pennar (Somasila), Pennar (Somasila)-Cauvery (Grand Anicut) link projects has been completed and circulated to party States in March 2019.        The implementation of river link projects involves various steps such as preparation of Pre Feasibility Reports/ Feasibility Reports of links, negotiation and consensus among concerned States, preparation of DPRs of the projects, clearances from Ministry of Environment and Forests and Climate Change, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, techno-economic clearance by Advisory Committee on Irrigation, Flood control & multipurpose projects of Ministry of Jal Shakti and investment clearance. Contd…P/2//2//        The stage of implementation of a project would be reached after its DPR is prepared with the consensus of concerned States and the requisite statutory clearances are obtained.(c) & (d)	Cleaning of rivers is a continuous process and  Government of India is supplementing the efforts of the State Governments in addressing the challenges of pollution of river Ganga and its tributaries by providing financial and technical assistance.  In May 2015, Government of India launched Namami Gange Programme which is an integrated umbrella programme to ensure effective abatement of pollution and conservation of river Ganga by adopting a river basin approach for comprehensive planning and management. Under Namami Gange Programme, diverse set of interventions like pollution abatement activities including sewage, industrial effluent, Solid Waste etc., River Front Management, Aviral Dhara, Rural Sanitation, Afforestation, Biodiversity Conservation, Public Participation etc, have been taken up for cleaning and rejuvenation of river Ganga. As far as small rivers/tributaries are concerned, based upon the pollution priority and need of pollution abatement, 39 projects have been taken up in 27 tributary towns located along river Yamuna, Kali, Ramganga, Saryu, Gomti, Damodar, Banka, Rispana, Kharkai, Kosi and Burhi Gandak to make them pollution free.So far, Under Namami Gange programme, till December 2019, a total of 310 projects have been sanctioned, out of which 114 projects have been completed. *****
