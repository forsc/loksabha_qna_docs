                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM &NATURAL GAS(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a): The Government has taken various steps towards achieving 20% blending ofethanol in petrol which includes allowing use of sugarcane and food grains (maizeand surplus stocks of rice with Food Corporation of India) for conversion toethanol; administered price mechanism for procurement of ethanol under EBPProgramme including enhanced ex-mill price of ethanol year on year from ethanolsupply year 2017; lowered GST rate to 5% on ethanol for EBP Programme;amendment in Industries (Development & Regulation) Act for freer movement ofethanol; interest subvention scheme for enhancement and augmentation of ethanolproduction capacity in the country. At present average ethanol blending percentagein petrol for the ongoing Ethanol Supply Year 2020-21 is 8% as on 26.07.2021.(b) to (e): The present percentage of blending of biodiesel in diesel is less than 0.1Percent. The National Policy on Biofuels – 2018 prescribes as indicative target of5% blending of biodiesel in diesel by 2030.Availability of biodiesel has been low in the last few years due to increase of priceand non availability of feed stock for biodiesel. Some biodiesel is also beingmarketed by agencies other than Oil Marketing Companies.Further, to increase the supply of Biodiesel in the country, OMCs are regularlyfloating Expression of Interest (EoI) to encourage the production of biodiesel fromUsed Cooking Oil.******
