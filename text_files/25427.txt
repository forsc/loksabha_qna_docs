                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) to (c):  		Under National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013 the Department  allocates foodgrains for around 80 Crore beneficiaries in the country, for monthly distribution through Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) to needy and poor persons. Additionally, during the COVID-19 crisis, the Department under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PM-GKAY) had allocated nearly 322 Lakh Metric Tons (LMT) foodgrain for distribution to all NFSA beneficiaries during the 8 months period in 2020 (April to November 2020) and about 278 LMT foodgrains for distribution during the 7 months period in 2021 (May to November 2021). Under PMGKAY, additional free of cost foodgrains at the scale of 5 Kg per NFSA beneficiary per month are distributed to all 80 Crore beneficiaries over and above their regular NFSA foodgrains. Under NFSA, ration cards are issued by respective State/UT Governments to all eligible beneficiaries / households through own procedures, identification criteria and norms. However, during 2020, the Department under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Scheme (ANBS) had provided foodgrains to all States/UTs for free distribution to all migrants/stranded migrants during the two months of May and June 2020. Through this initiative, nearly 2.74 Crore migrants/stranded migrant persons including those without ration cards were benefited from free foodgrains. In addition to this, the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan in 33 States/UTs is empowering all beneficiaries, particularly migrant NFSA beneficiaries, to lift their quota of entitled foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) of choice in these States/UTs, by using their same existing ration card with biometric authentication.                                            ***
