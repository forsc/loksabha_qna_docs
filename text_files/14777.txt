ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (c):Yes, Sir. Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) has informed that extra classeswere conducted during Autumn Break for students of classes IX to XII of KendriyaVidyalaya, Sector-8, R.K. Puram, New Delhi. However, the students were not forced toattend the classes. It was purely voluntary. Classes were organized with priordiscussions with parents’ and teachers’ during the Parent Teacher Meeting. The classeswere organized under Compensation for Academic Loss Programmes (CALP), in orderto compensate for the academic loss due to various activities during the session. Thiswas also a step towards academic improvement of these classes,keeping in view theCBSE Board Exams which were scheduled in February-2020 and very less time was leftfor completion and revision of syllabus. It was not made mandatory to the students ofclasses IX to XII to attend the classes on 7th October, 2019 (Mahanavami) and 8thOctober, 2019 (Vijayadashmi). Attendance of the students was 45% and 32% on 7thOctober and 8th October 2019 respectively and no action was taken against theabsentee students.*****
