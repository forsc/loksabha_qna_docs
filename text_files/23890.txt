ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                            (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a): Government of India has launched Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U) on 25th June, 2015 for providing assistance to States/ Union Territories (UTs) for addressing the housing requirement of eligible beneficiaries in urban areas. The Mission comprises four components viz. In-Situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR), Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP), Beneficiary Led Construction (BLC) and Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS). ISSR, AHP and BLC components under PMAY (U) are Centrally Sponsored Schemes that are implemented through the States/UTs and their agencies while the CLSS component of PMAY (U) is a Central Sector Scheme.(b) & (c): Central Assistance of ?6,754.49 crore has been sanctioned in Tamil Nadu during the last three years; out of this ?4,545.47 crore has been released to the State Government and ?3,557.64 crore has been utilized. A total of 4,30,033 houses have been sanctioned during the last three years in Tamil Nadu.(d)& (e): Under PMAY-U, State/UT Governments undertake demand assessment and validate the same to determine the actual requirement of houses to be built under PMAY-U. Against the validated demand of around 112 lakh houses under PMAY-U, 111 lakh houses have been sanctioned so far, out of which 75.8 lakh houses have been grounded for construction including 43.5 lakh completed houses. Against the validated demand of 8.3 lakh houses in Tamil Nadu, over 7 lakh houses have been sanctioned so far, out of which 5.7 lakh houses have been grounded for construction that includes 3.8 lakh completed houses.  For successful implementation of the scheme and in order to achieve the vision of ‘Housing for All’ by 2022, this Ministry has taken the following measures:(i)	PMAY-U through its four verticals has adopted a cafeteria approach to suit the needs of individuals based on the geographical conditions, topography, economic conditions, availability of land, infrastructure etc. All houses constructed under the scheme have provision of basic amenities like water supply, electricity, kitchen and toilet. (ii)	The on-ground implementation of the scheme is done by States/UTs through their Urban Local Bodies/Implementing Agencies in the spirit of cooperative federalism. PMAY-U guidelines provide flexibility to States/UTs for assessing the housing demand, appraisal and approval of projects. (iii)	To ensure uninterrupted flow of funds, in addition to budgetary resources, National Urban Housing Fund (NUHF) for ?60,000 crore has been created for raising Extra Budgetary Resources (EBR) in phases for rapid implementation of the scheme. Moreover, an ‘Affordable Housing Fund’ (AHF) with a corpus of ?10,000 crore has been created in National Housing Bank (NHB) using the Priority Sector Lending Shortfall in Banks/Financial Institutions to reduce interest burden on housing loans in Affordable housing segment. This was followed by a further allocation of ?10,000 crore in 2019-20.(iv)	Aadhaar validation of beneficiaries, funds transfer through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode, geo-tagging of projects and houses, social audit, third party quality monitoring, robust centralized Management Information System (MIS) and tools like CLSS Awas Portal (CLAP) and CLSS tracker are provisioned to ensure transparency and accountability. (v)	Alternative and innovative technologies have been promoted under the scheme for rapid delivery of houses. (vi)	PMAY-U Awards 2021 has been strategized through the 100-days Challenge for performance against pre-defined indicators with emphasis on grounding, completion, occupancy of houses and declaration of ‘HFA Achieved Cities/States/UTs’ during the period from 8th March to 20th June 2021.(vii)	This Ministry regularly monitors the progress of implementation of the scheme through periodic review meetings/video-conferencing with States/UTs and field visits.                                                     *****
