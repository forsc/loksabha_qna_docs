ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER FOR CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D.V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a)	Yes Sir.(b)	Before the commencement of each cropping season, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), in consultation with all the State Governments, assesses the requirement of fertilizers including Urea. After assessment of requirement, DAC&FW projects month-wise requirement of fertilizers including Urea to DoF. Depending upon the requirement projected by the DAC&FW and keeping in view the Urea production capacity of the country, DoF decides the quantum of Import of Urea for each cropping season to ensure adequate availability of Urea in the country. The same planning is being followed for the next cropping seasons too.(c)	The following steps are being taken by the Government to meet the demand of Urea/fertilizer in the country: - i.	Before the commencement of each cropping season, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), in consultation with all the State Governments, assesses the requirement of fertilizers. After assessment of requirement, DAC&FW projects month-wise requirement of fertilizers. ii.	On the basis of month-wise & State-wise projection given by DAC&FW, Department of Fertilizers allocates sufficient/ adequate quantities of fertilizers to States by issuing monthly supply plan and continuously monitors the availability.iii.	 The movement of all major subsidized fertilizers is being monitored throughout the country by an on-line web based monitoring system called integrated Fertilizer Monitoring System (iFMS);iv.	The State Governments are regularly advised to coordinate with manufacturers and importers of fertilizers for streamlining the supplies through timely placement of indents for railway rakes through their state institutional agencies like Markfed etc.v.	Regular Weekly Video Conference is conducted jointly by Department of Agriculture & Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) and Department of Fertilizers (DoF) with State Agriculture Officials and corrective actions are taken to dispatch fertilizer as indicated by the State Governments. vi.	The gap between demand (requirement) and production is met through imports. The import for the season is also finalized well in advance to ensure timely availability.    Thus, with the steps as indicated above, Department of Fertilizers ensures availability of fertilizers including Urea at the State level and the distribution to the farmers within the State is the responsibility of the respective State Government. ********
