                                                        MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI. BHUPENDER YADAV)(a) to (e) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 306TO BE ANSWERED ON MONDAY, 20.12.2021 REGARDING ‘CONSERVATION OF FORESTS’ RAISED BY SHRI RAKESH SINGH.(a) to (c):Yes, Sir. Several steps have been taken to reduce dependency on conventional sources of energy for environmental protection as well combating the climate change in the country. India as a party to the Paris Agreement submitted its ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) for combating climate change. India’s NDC is a significant contribution towards achievement of goals under the Paris Agreement and inter-alia includes the contributions, namely;  to reduce the emissions intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level, to achieve about 40% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, and to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2eq through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.India’s emission intensity of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has reduced by 24 per cent between 2005 and 2016. Installed capacity of solar energy in India has increased by more than 18 times from 2.63 GW in March 2014 to 48.56 GW in November 2021. India’s current share of non-fossil sources based installed capacity of electricity generation is more than 40%. The Hon’ble Prime Minister of India,recently at 26th session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP-26), announced India’s vision to address challenge of climate change by presenting to the world the following five nectar elements (Panchamrit) of climate action by India. The vision provides for the pathway to further reduce dependency on conventional sources of energy.The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), which provides an overarching framework for all climate actions in the country, comprises of missions in specific areas of solar energy and energy efficiency. Thirty-three States and Union Territories have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) in line with NAPCC. These SAPCCs outline sector-specific and cross- sectoral priority actions. The Government has set a target for installing 175 GW of Renewable Energy capacity (excluding large hydro) by the year 2022 which includes 100 GW from solar, 60 GW from wind, 10 GW from Biomass and 5 GW from Small Hydro by the year 2022. As on 30.11.2021, India’s renewable energy capacity, including large hydro, is about 150.54 GW. For the world, India has created and continued to nurture International Solar Alliance (ISA). So far, 101 countries have signed the Framework Agreement of ISA with 80 of them ratifying it. To make available the clean cooking fuel such as Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) to the rural and deprived households which were otherwise using traditional cooking fuels such as firewood, coal, cow-dung cakes etc. the Government is implementing  Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY). Substitution of traditional cooking fuels under the PMUY mitigates impacts on the health of rural women as well as on the environment. Ason 15.12.2021, total 89,186,076 LPG connections have been provided.India’s Transformative Mobility paradigm is shifting towards; shared, connected and electric, to have positive effects on environment and reduce high import dependency on oil. To give an impetus to manufacturing and adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in India, Government of India is supporting the ecosystem through following national flagship schemes:i.	Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India II (FAME India II) scheme with an outlay of Rs.10,000 crore to incentivize demand for EVs in different segments by providing upfront subsidies and creating EV charging infrastructure. As on 15.12.2021, total 1,83,780vehicles sold under FAME India II.ii.	National Programme on Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) with an outlay of Rs.18,100 crore to incentivize setting up of giga scale manufacturing facilities in the country for 50 Giga Watt Hour of ACC. iii.	Productivity Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for Automobile and Auto Components with an outlay of Rs.25,938 crore to incentivise manufacturing of high technology automobiles and automotive components with a focus on electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.Indian Railways, the third largest rail network globally, has voluntarily taken targets to become carbon neutral by 2030. The Net Zero target by 2030 by India Railways alone will lead to a reduction of emissions by 60 million tonnes annually. More than 367 million LED bulbs have been distributed under ‘Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LED for All (UJALA)’ scheme, which has led to energy saving of more than 47 billion units of electricity per year and reduction of 38.6 million tonnes of CO2 per year.The ambitious target, which brings forward the 20% blending target from 2030 to 2025, is a key element of the economy-wide energy transformation.  It will also help, inter-alia, in lowering carbon emissions, improving air quality, promoting productive use of damaged food grains and waste, etc.As of September 2021, the country has already reached 8.5% of ethanol blending and is on track to achieve the 20% target by 2025.(d) and (e):For protecting, restoring and enhancing India’s forest cover and responding to Climate Change by means of plantation activities in the forest and non-forest areas, afforestation and tree plantation activities are undertaken by States and Union Territories Governments under various State schemes. The Ministry provides financial assistance to States and Union Territories Governments under various schemes and programmes including, inter alia, National Afforestation Programme, Green India Mission to support and supplement the efforts of States and Union Territories. Afforestation activities are also taken up under various programmes/schemes such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Compensatory Afforestation Funds under Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA).  These initiatives also help in conservation of very dense forests and moderately dense forests as well as to increase forest and tree cover. The National Mission for a Green India (GIM) under NAPCC aims at protecting, restoring, and enhancing India’s forest cover by means of plantation activities in the forest and non-forest areas. So far, a sum of Rs. 492.20 crores have been released to fifteen States namely Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Manipur, Mizoram, Odisha, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Sikkim, West Bengal, and one Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir for undertaking the afforestation activities over 1,84,161 ha of forest and non-forest area.The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare is implementing the National Agroforestry Policy (NAP) since 2014. Further, the 15th Finance Commission has assigned 10% weight to forest and ecology in its criterion for devolution.   The multi-departmental efforts have yielded good results in conserving and developing forest and tree cover as evident from the fact that Forest and tree cover has increased by 1.3 million ha between the 2015 and 2019 as per assessments of the Forest Survey of India. India’s Land use, land-use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sink (CO2 removal) is on the rise by 3.4 per cent between 2014 and 2016 and by approximately 40 per cent between 2000 and 2016. ***
