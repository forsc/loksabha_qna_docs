ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR TEXTILES  (SMT. DARSHANA JARDOSH)(a):	Based on the periodical statistical returns submitted by textile entities to the Office of Textile Commissioner, Ministry of Textiles, Mumbai, the number of working and closed spinning mills in the State of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra are as follows:Sr. No.	State	Working Mills	Closed Mills (Since 1976 till date)	Total Mills1	Maharashtra	135	64	1992	Tamil Nadu	744	241	985(b):	Ministry of Textiles does not have any information regarding private textile mills which are lying inoperative/closed due to Covid-19 pandemic.  However, production activity in 23 working mills of National Textile Corporation were suspended due to Covid-19 pandemic and nationwide lockdown imposed by the various State Governments from March, 2020.  From January, 2021 onwards, normal operations were resumed in some of the NTC mills but could not be continued due to unavailability of working capital and other financial constraints. In light of continued poor economic viability of NTC mills, Ministry of Textiles is preparing an action plan for way forward in this matter in consultation with NITI Aayog and Department of Public Enterprises under Ministry of Finance. (c) to (e):	There is no specific scheme for the revival of the closed and sick spinning mills across the country. Government is focusing on fresh investment by industry in this sector for expansion of competitive manufacturing capacity.  To this objective Govt. is implementing Amended Technology Up-gradation Scheme (ATUFS), Integrated Processing Development Scheme (IPDS), Scheme for Integrated Textile Park (SITP) and other Schemes like National Technical Textile Mission (NTTM). Government has launched Production Linked Incentive Scheme for textiles (PLI for Textiles) for Man Made Fibre, Apparel, Fabrics and Technical Textiles. It is expected to attract investment of Rs. 19000 Crore. Government has also launched PM- MITRA Park Scheme to set up 7 Mega Textiles Manufacturing Parks in the country. This will reduce logistics cost and will improve Competitiveness of Indian textile manufacturing. Once completed one such park is expected to provide employment to 1 lakh persons directly and 2 lakh persons indirectly.***
