                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) & (b): Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Deshka Aam Nagrik) on 21-10-2016 to stimulate regional air connectivity and making air travel affordable to the masses. UDAN is market driven scheme. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under UDAN from time to time. An airport which is included in the awarded routes of UDAN and requires upgradation / development for commencement of RCS operations, is developed under "Revival of unserved and underserved airports" scheme.  ;(c) to (e): Jhansi & Lalitpur Airports are available in UDAN scheme document. The routes, Jhansi-Lucknow-Jhansi, identified for operation of RCS flights, were terminated due to non-compliance of contractual obligations by Selected Airline Operator. Terminated routes were offered in special round of bidding 4.1 under UDAN conducted recently. However, no bid has been received for operation of flight from Jhansi. No airline has submitted valid bid for operation of RCS flights from Lalitpur Airport till 4th round of bidding.
