                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a):	Since public health is a State subject, initiating various steps for promotion of Naturopathy in their respective domains fall under the purview of the respective State/ UT governments.	At the Central level, the Ministry of AYUSH also strives to promote the system and to create awareness for the benefit of the people. Ministry of AYUSH through its two autonomous bodies namely Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopathy (CCRYN), New Delhi and National Institute of Naturopathy (NIN) promote activities related to Naturopathy.	Also, an Information Education and Communication (IEC) Scheme, has been devised by the Ministry, activities under which include steps to reach out to people to promote awareness about Naturopathy. IEC activities include public events, conferences, exhibitions, camps and programs on TV, Radio, Print-media etc. 	Further to mark 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, 150 Naturopathy camps are being organised across the country from 2nd October, 2019 to 2nd October, 2020, under the theme “NisargopcharMahotsav”. 	In addition to the above, under National AYUSH Mission (NAM), financial assistance is provided to States and Union Territories for setting up AYUSH Wellness Centres. Naturopathy form important element of such Wellness Centres, subject to the choice of the concerned State/UT governments.(b):	Provisions for regulation and quality control of Ayurvedic and Unani medicines being manufactured for sale in the country are prescribed in the Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 & Rules 1945.  These provisions are enforced by the Licensing Authorities & Drug Control Officers appointed by the respective State Governments.  As the spurious Ayurvedic and Unani medicines are defined in Section 33-I of the Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 along with the penalty provisions, accordingly the defaulters can be punished with monitory fine and imprisonment for a term up to three years as determined by the court. State-wise number of samples tested by Drug Testing Laboratories and action by the State Government on  failed/sub-standard samples is shown in Annexure.
