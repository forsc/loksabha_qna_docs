The National Institute of Food Technology Entrepreneurship and Management (NIFTEM) was setup in 2012 as an apex world-class institute, which would be a pioneer in creating a centre for integrated research, education, enterprise incubation and outreach in the area of food service and food technology. The functioning of the NIFTEM has been reviewed from time to time by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). Besides, a peer review of the NIFTEM was carried out on 21.12.2016 by a Committee setup by Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI), which was headed by the Chief Scientist, Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI).  The Committee in its report has indicated that the objectives for which NIFTEM has been set up are being met by NIFTEM. NIFTEM has strived hard to fulfill the mandate and did exceedingly well in the farmer outreach programme which is crucial for the economic upliftment of farmers & their income and food industry as a whole. (c) & (d): Yes, Sir. The Standing Committee has made recommendations inter alia capping of the fee structure for technical courses, implementation of tuition fee waiver scheme for economically weaker sections. Those recommendations have been broadly accepted and are being implemented. (e):	With a view to provide human resource development in food processing industry in the country, the two autonomous institutions under the administrative control of MoFPI namely; NIFTEM, Kundli, Haryana and the Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology (IIFPT)  at  Thanjavur,  Tamil  Nadu offers degrees such as B.Tech, M.Tech, Ph.D and M.B.A (only in NIFTEM) in the field of food technology and allied sectors.Besides, MoFPI is also running a scheme called Scheme for Human Resources and Institution - Skill Development (SHRISD) with allocation of Rs.  27.50 crore from year 2017-18 to 2019-20.
