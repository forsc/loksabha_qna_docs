                                                        MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a) to (c): A statement is laid on the Table of the House.*** Statement referred to in reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 227 due for reply on 06.03.2020 regarding ‘Environmental Clearance for Gas Exploratory Projects’ by SHRI A. GANESHAMURTHI and SHRI UTTAM KUMAR REDDY NALAMADA, Hon''ble Members of Parliament(a) The Government has re-categorized the on-shore and off-shore oil and gas exploration projects or activities from Category ‘A’ to Category ‘B2’ vide notification number S.O. 236(E) dated the 16th January, 2020. Any Project Proponent will, in the present scheme of things, have to apply to State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), which is an organ of the State Government and SEIAA will take a final call in the matter.  Therefore, the final decision as to whether to allow any particular project in any particular region would continue to vest with the State Government. Further, such projects are also required to obtain consent under Air and Water Acts from State Pollution Control Boards. (b)	The Government has re-categorized the on-shore and off-shore oil and gas exploration projects or activities from Category ‘A’ to Category ‘B2’ on the following grounds:-i.	Exploratory drilling is a temporary activity and will be completed in three to four months without having any permanent establishment or setup at the exploratory site.ii.	The exploratory wells are drilled only for appraisal without taking out any commercial production at this stage. It is in fact, a prospecting activity for ascertaining the presence of Hydrocarbons.iii.	Exploratory drilling involves a small piece of land admeasuring 110X110 sq.m. which has limited scope of waste generation along with minimal environmental impacts for a short span.iv.	There is no requirement of prior-environmental clearance even in case of exploration of coal and other major or minor minerals,.v.	Consent to establish and operate shall still be required from the respective State Pollution Control Board or Union Territory Pollution control Committees, as the case may be, to ensure the environmental safeguards.(c)	Eighteen Prior Environmental Clearances were issued during the year 2015 to 2019. The details of projects issued Prior Environmental Clearance is given in the Annexure.******
