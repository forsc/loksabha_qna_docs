                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ?? ????? ?????? ??????		          (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (f):	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.******* STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF PARTS (a) to (f) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 136 TO BE ANSWERED ON 11/02/2020 REGARDING “VISION DOCUMENT FOR AGRICULTURE”(a) & (b): 	To keep pace with the changing technological requirements in agriculture and dissemination of appropriate futuristic agricultural technologies, ICAR has been updating the vision and strategies of research for the holistic development of Indian Agriculture. ICAR has developed perspective plans and vision for 2030 and 2050. These documents provide the strategic framework for innovation-led inclusive and sustainable agricultural growth in the country. The ICAR Institutes under the Council have also prepared their vision documents which feed into the ICAR vision. The vision documents focus on targeted outputs of research for increased productivity, improvement in quality of life and creation of wealth for the society at large, and small farmers in particular. Gene revolution for lowering the production costs, raising the yields and net farm incomes, reducing the use of pesticides and herbicides, and lowering the consumer prices, development of sustainable and appropriate models for commercialization of agriculture through value chains and market linkages have been duly included. (c) & (d): i) 	Steps taken to increase agricultural production: Since Green Revolution in 60s, the hallmark of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research has been its high yielding varieties, hybrids along with improved breeds/varieties of livestock, poultry and fish along with production and protection technologies for different agro-climatic situations. As a result, the country is not only self-sufficient in food grains, major food items and other agricultural commodities but also a net exporter in many commodities. Research and technology developments enabled overall increase of 5.5 times in food-grains production, 10.1 times in horticultural crops, 9.7 times in milk, 15.2 times in fish and 48.1 times in egg during the period 1950-51 to 2017-18.During 2014-2019, ICAR developed and notified 1020 high yielding varieties of various crops having multiple stress tolerance/resistance. Similarly, 339 high yielding varieties of fruits vegetables and other horticultural crops were developed to augment horticultural production. To address the problem of malnutrition through natural food system, 53 bio-fortified varieties have been developed during the last 5 years. Creation of 150 seed hubs of pulse crops, together with policy support has enabled the country to attain near self-sufficiency in pulse crops. A total 41 new cattle breeds have been registered and notified, 6 new varieties of pigs and 5 new high producing back yard poultry varieties have been developed besides 10 vaccines and 43 diagnostic kits against major animal diseases. As part of National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA), climate resilient technologies are being demonstrated in 151 climatically vulnerability districts of the country. The district level agricultural contingency plans for 650 rural districts have been prepared to support the district administrations in rolling out contingency measures against a matrix of weather and rainfall aberrations.  During 2014-19, ICAR developed 23197 prototypes of improved agriculture machinery besides establishing 126 agro-processing centres and 45 Food Processing Laboratories in various parts of the country.  These efforts are helping the farming community of the country by increasing production, improving efficiency, reducing production loss, reducing cost of production and improving income. ii)	Validation & Promotion of Zero Budget Natural Farming: Validation of Zero Budget Natural Farming is being carried out in Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) through ICAR-Indian Institute of Farming Systems Research, Modipuram, Uttar Pradesh. The Institute has initiated a study on “Evaluation of zero budget farming practices in basmati / coarse rice-wheat system” from rabi 2017 at 4 locations namely Modipuram (Uttar Pradesh), Pantnagar (Uttarakhand), Ludhiana (Punjab) and Kurukshetra (Haryana) under All India Network Programme on Organic Farming and All India Coordinated Research Project on Integrated Farming Systems. The number of locations has now increased to 20. (e) & (f): 	Ministry of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, Government of India has launched Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) in December 2014 for development and conservation of indigenous breeds through selective breeding and genetic upgradation of nondescript bovine population. ICAR through All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on Utilization of Animal Energy is engaged in Research and Development on utilization of animal energy for enhanced system efficiencies with special focus on hilly, tribal and low mechanization regions of the country. Under this scheme, improved animal drawn implements/tools for tillage & sowing, tool for intercultural operations, straw collector farm yard manure spreader and animal drawn dung collector etc. have been developed which are being popularized among farmers through training and front line demonstrations by 8 cooperating centres of the AICRP. Under AICRP on Energy in Agriculture and Agro-industries also, ICAR has developed technologies for the production of biogas and bio-compost from cow dung. Different sizes and designs of the biogas plants developed under the scheme have been popularized under this Scheme. Besides these, ICAR has developed 51 integrated farming systems (IFS) models and 45 organic farming models for promotion in different agro-ecologies of the country and a majority of which are cow/livestock based. * * * * * * * *
