Assuming 80% availability, it is estimated that around 9.26 lakh doctors may be actually available for active service. It gives a doctor-population ratio of 1:1457 as per current population estimate of 1.35 billion, which is lower than the WHO norm of 1:1000. Besides, there are 7.88 lakh Ayurveda, Unani and Homeopathy (AUH) doctors in the country. Assuming 80% availability, it is estimated that around 6.30 lakh Ayurveda, Unani and Homeopathy (AUH) doctors may be actually available for service and considered together with allopathic doctors, it gives a doctor population ratio of 1:868. Further, the details of number of allopathic doctors registered with the State Medical Councils / MCI is at Annexure - II.(d) and (e): Health being a State subject, it is primarily the responsibility of the State Government to make efforts for increasing the bed strength in their Hospitals in accordance with requirement and fund availability.

As far as three Central  Government Hospitals located in Delhi viz. Safdarjung Hospital, Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital and Lady Hardinge Medical College (LHMC) & Associated Hospitals are concerned, Government has approved redevelopment of LHMC with additional 570 beds and Dr. RML Hospital with additional 509 beds.
