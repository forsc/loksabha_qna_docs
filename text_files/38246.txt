The Government has sanctioned the first High Speed Rail Corridor between Mumbai and Ahmedabad in December, 2015 with technical & financial assistance from Government of Japan and the same is presently under execution. The current status of Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR) Project is as under:•	All Statutory Clearances relating to wildlife, Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) and Forest clearance have been obtained.•	Out of total land requirement of approx. 1396 ha., about 1248 ha. Land has been acquired so far.•	The entire project has been divided into 27 Contract packages including Training Institute at Vadodara. At present, 13 packages have been awarded, 3 are under evaluation and Notice Inviting Tender (NIT) has been invited for 2 packages.•	Out of total 352 Km length of project located in Gujarat and Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Civil works in 352 Km length have started in different phases from December, 2020 onwards.(c): The land acquisition and Rehabilitation activities for the MAHSR Project is being done in accordance with the “Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (RFCTLARR) Act, 2013” and relevant amendment and Government Resolutions (GR) of the respective State Governments.(d)	to (f): The cost of MAHSR Project is ? 1,08,000 crore as in 2015. Delay in land acquisition especially in the State of Maharashtra        and consequent delays  in finalization  of contracts as  well as adverse impact of COVID-19 have delayed the execution of MAHSR Project. The anticipated increase in cost and time can be fully ascertained only after completion of Land Acquisition, finalization of all contracts and associated timelines.As per the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), Government of Japan will provide a loan of 81% at maximum of the project cost. Finalization of actual cost and the quantum of loan shall be amended accordingly if required.        *****
