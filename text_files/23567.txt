ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (c)  The scheme of Rajiv Gandhi Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (RGPSA) launched in 2012-13, had been implemented till 2015-16. Thereafter, the scheme of Capacity Building Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (CB-PSA) had been implemented during 2016-17 and 2017-18 and presently the restructured Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) is being implemented w.e.f 2018-19. No funds for construction and repair of Gram Panchayat Bhawan were provided under CB-PSA. Panchayat being a State subject, providing infrastructure facilities to Gram Panchayat (GPs) is primarily the responsibility of concerned State Government. Under the restructured scheme of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA), this Ministry has been supplementing the efforts of State governments by providing financial support to States for certain infrastructural facilities like Panchayat Ghars/Bhawans on a limited scale on demand from the states. The scheme involves multi-dimensional activities, some of which may require longer time to actualize. Further, the capacity to absorb funds also varies from State to State and the implementation of the approved activities is also impacted due to several reasons viz. unspent balance of previous year/s, elections, court cases etc. The details of funds released to States / UTs including those for construction and repair of Gram Panchayat Bhawan during 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 (till date) and unspent balance as on 31st March, 2020 is given in Annexure. (d)        No case of irregularities in implementation of the scheme of RGSA has come to the notice. (e)        Under CSS of RGSA, funds released to States / UTs are utilized by them for undertaking the activities sanctioned / permitted under their Annual Plans as recommended by Central Empowered Committee (CEC) and finally approved by the Competent Authority. The progress of implementation of the scheme, including utilization of funds, is closely monitored through meetings, video-conferences etc. with the States. For further release of funds to the States, the status of utilization of funds released earlier is also taken into account. In addition to this, an online Monitoring and Reporting System (MIS) for RGSA has been developed and operationalised. Moreover, transaction based Public Financial Management System (PFMS) has been introduced for released and tracking of funds under RGSA.*****
