As per the report received from the Government of Madhya Pradesh the following steps have been taken by the State Government to prevent illegal felling of trees:-(a)	The forest area of Madhya Pradesh are well demarcated with concrete/stone masonry pillars.(b)	Regular beat inspections are being carried out in accordance with the approved roster.(c)	15228 Joint Forest Management Committees are actively involved in the protection of forests.(d)	329 Forest Chowkies have been established (e)	Mobiles, wireless systems, binocular and Personal Digital Assistants are being used for communication to control forest offences.(f)	Every forest circle and important divisions have flying squads, equipped with arms and vehicles, for rapid action and control of forest offences.(g)	The state of Madhya Pradesh has three companies of special armed forces on deputation which have been deployed in very sensitive areas to assist in controlling encroachments and other forest crimes.(h)	Felling of trees is done in the forest area as part of silvicultural operations as per working plans approved by the Government of India with regeneration operations.
