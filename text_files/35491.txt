                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) to (f):   The Government posts are regularly filled up in accordance with the recruitment rules. However, keeping in view the administrative exigency of work, economy of operations and unavoidable circumstances, outsourcing through contract is also sometimes resorted to.Contd..2/-:: 2 ::		There are detailed procedures laid down for procurement of such non-consulting or outsourced services, including through e-procurement, in the “General Financial Rules 2017” (GFR 2017), and the “Manual for Procurement of Consultancy & Other Services, 2017”. Any deviation or violation can be dealt by the concerned Ministry or Department appropriately. The wages for the persons engaged on contract/outsourcing cannot be less than the minimum wage fixed/notified by the concerned State Government.		Ministries/Departments engage contractual services directly and they only are responsible for appointment of regular employees against vacant posts after completing all necessary procedural formalities. No centralized data is maintained in this regard.The Ministry of Labour and Employment maintains the consolidated records/data of contract labourers/workers/employees, based on the licences and registration certificate issued under the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 in the central sphere. No such bifurcated data like Ministry/Department-wise and gender-wise of contract labourers/workers/employees is maintained centrally. Based on the licences and registration certificate issued under the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970,  details of contract employees/workers/ labourers during the last three years in the Central Sphere establishments are as under: -  Year	Total No. of Contract Labourers/workers/employees working under Central Sphere2019	13643772020	13248742021	2430989The ratio of male to female employees is 6:1 (approx).*******
