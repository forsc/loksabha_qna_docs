ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS (SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a): The combined Budget Estimates (BE)of 2021-22 for eight educational empowerment schemes for minorities being implemented by the Government namely, Pre-Matric Scholarship Scheme, Post Matric Scholarship Scheme, Merit-cum-Means based Scholarship Scheme, Maulana Azad Education Foundation (to implement Begum Hazrat Mahal National Scholarship and other schemes), Maulana Azad National Fellowship Scheme, Padho Pardesh - Scheme of Interest Subsidy on Educational Loans for Overseas Studies, Naya Savera- Free Coaching and Allied Schemeand Nai Udaan Scheme is Rs. 2,471 Crore. (b) & (c): The Budget Estimates (BE) for 3 Scholarship Schemes namely, Pre-Matric Scholarship Scheme, Post Matric Scholarship Scheme and Merit-cum-Means based Scholarship Scheme is Rs. 2,171 crore. The 3 Scholarship Schemes are implemented through the National Scholarship Portal (NSP) which is a common Portal for implementing various Scholarship Schemes of the Central Government as well as the State Governments. The Portal maintains uniform dates for student registration, verification and payment. In the current financial year due to the Pandemic the dates for registration of applications had to be extended up to 15th January 2022 to enable maximum number of students to apply. Similarly the verification dates for the applications also had to be extended up to 15th February 2022. Hence, disbursement against Fresh Scholarships started only in the last week of February 2022. The expenditure under these 8 schemes as on 23.03.2022 is Rs. 1,484.17crore which is 61.45% against the Revised Estimates of Rs. 2,415.35 crore. Disbursement of remaining Scholarship is ongoing. (d): The number of students benefitted under the 8 educational empowerment schemes in Telangana between 2014-15 and 2021-22 is 16,57,973.(e): The utilization of funds as on 23.03.2022 is 61.45%. The physical target for the 8 schemes for 2021-22 is 35,66,140 and so far the achievement is60,12,268, which includes renewal scholarships. The total allocation of funds for 2022-23 in respect to the 8 educational empowerment schemes is Rs. 2,515.01 Crore.*****
