                                                        THE MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a) to (e)   A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTs (a) TO (e) OF STARRED QUESTION   NO. †*68 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 06.02.2020 REGARDING “DEPLETION OF GROUND WATER LEVEL” ASKED BY SHRI UDAY PRATAP SINGH.(a) Drinking water is a State subject and Government of India supplements the efforts of States by providing financial and technical assistance to States/UTs including Madhya Pradesh. It is the States that plan, design, approve, implement, operate and maintain water supply schemes.The National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) was launched with the aim to provide minimum 40 litre per capita per day (lpcd) of potable drinking water. NRDWP has now been subsumed into Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM). Fund allocated under NRDWP to the State of Madhya Pradesh in the last three years and under JJM in the current FY is as under: (Rs. in Crore)2016-17under NRDWP	2017-18under NRDWP	2018-19under NRDWP	2019-20 (as on 31.01.2020)under JJMAlloc.

The total State Annual Action Plans (SAAPs) approved for the entire Mission period is Rs.77,640 crore out of which Rs.39,011 crore (around 50%) has been allocated to water supply.In the State of Madhya Pradesh, total water supply projects worth Rs.2,238 crore have been approved, of which projects worth Rs. 257.00 crore are completed and balance projects worth Rs.1,981.00 crore are under implementation.The state-wise details on funds allocated, central funds released and utilization certificates received so far under AMRUT from 2016-17 are given at Annexure-I.(b)   Ground water levels in various parts of the Country are declining because of continuous withdrawal due to reasons such as increased demand of fresh water for various uses, vagaries of rainfall, increased population, industrialization & urbanization etc.          Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) is periodically monitoring the ground water levels throughout the Country on a regional scale, through a network of monitoring wells. In order to assess the decline in water level on a long-term basis, Pre-monsoon water level data collected by CGWB during Pre-monsoon 2019 has been compared with the decadal average (2009-2018). Analysis of water level data indicates that about 61% of the wells monitored have registered decline in ground water levels.Contd...P/2//2//(c) to (e)   Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management including conservation and water harvesting in the Country is primarily States’ responsibility.  However, the important measures taken by the Central Government for conservation, management of ground water and effective implementation of rain water harvesting in the country are at the following URL: http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf.Further, to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes.In addition, a number of States have done notable work in the field of water conservation/harvesting.  Of these, mention can be made of ‘Mukhyamantri Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan’ in Rajasthan, ‘Jalyukt Shibar’ in Maharashtra, ‘Sujalam Sufalam Abhiyan’ in Gujarat, ‘Mission Kakatiya’ in Telangana, Neeru Chettu’ in Andhra Pradesh, Jal Jeevan Hariyali in Bihar among others.Government of India launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan, a time bound campaign with a mission mode approach intended to improve water availability including ground water conditions in the water stressed blocks of 256 districts in India. In this regard, teams of officers from Central Government along-with technical officers from Ministry of Jal Shakti were deputed to visit water stressed districts and to work in close collaboration with district level officials to undertake suitable interventions.Central Government supports construction of water harvesting and conservation works primarily through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana – Watershed Development Component (PMKSY-WDC).The details of works taken up for Water Conservation and Water Harvesting structures under MGNREGS in various States/UTs including Madhya Pradesh  during the years 2016-17 to 2019-20 are given at Annexure II.The Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies Scheme under PMKSY aims at restoring irrigation potential by improvement and restoration of water bodies along with other multiple objectives such as enhancing the tank storage capacity, ground water recharge, increased availability of drinking water, improvement of catchment of tank commands etc. Under the RRR scheme, 2219 water-bodies with an estimated cost of Rs. 1910 crore have been taken up since 12th plan onwards. Central Assistance (CA) of Rs. 369 crore has been released to States upto March, 2019. One cluster of 125 water bodies has been taken up in the state of Madhya Pradesh with an estimated cost of Rs 183.24 Cr; CA of Rs 37.70 Cr has been released in this regard.Contd…P/3//3//As per Ministry of Rural Development, Department of Land Resources, they have sanctioned 8214 watershed development projects in States/UTs from 2009-10 to 2014-15 under Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP)/PMKSY-WDC. The activities being undertaken through these projects inter alia include ridge area treatment, drainage line treatment, soil and moisture conservation, rain water harvesting, nursery raising, afforestation, horticulture, pasture development, livelihoods for assetless persons, etc. The State wise details of projects sanctioned, area covered by the projects and funds released as Central share to States under WDC-PMKSY are given at Annexure-III.Government of India has approved Atal Bhujal Yojana (Atal Jal), a Rs. 6000 Crore Central Sector Scheme, for sustainable management of ground water resources with community participation in water stressed blocks of Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The scheme is being implemented with the financial assistance of World Bank with a sharing pattern of 50:50 between Government of India and World Bank. Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has been constituted under Section 3(3) of the ‘Environment (Protection) Act, 1986’ for the purpose of regulation and control of ground water development and management in the Country. CGWA is regulating ground water withdrawal by industries / infrastructure/ mining projects in the country for which guidelines/ criteria have been framed, which are modified from time to time. The current guidelines, effective from 15.11.2015 are available on the website http://cgwa-noc.gov.in. *****ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) of Starred Question No. †*68 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 06.02.2020 regarding “Depletion of groundwater level”.Statement Showing State- wise Allocation, year-wise Central Assistance Released and Utilisation certificate received from 2016-17  to till date for projects under AMRUT Mission.
