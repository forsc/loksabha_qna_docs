The work on this road stretch started in September, 2010 with scheduled completion period of 30 months. The project was delayed due to land acquisition and financial constraint faced by the Concessionaire. The Provisional Commercial Operation Date (PCOD) for Chengapalli - Neelambur stretch was issued on 09.10.2015, whereas four lane work on main carriageway and service road on the stretch of Madukkarai-Walayar was completed on 31.07.2017.	As regards construction of side drain in RE wall portion in Madukkarai-Walayar stretch, the Concessionaire had requested for Change of Scope which was not accepted as the same was under original scope of work as per the Concession Agreement. After various review meetings, the work for construction of drain in RE wall portion and toilet in Truck lay bye portion has been started by Concessionaire.(d) & (e)	As this is a DBFOT (Toll) project, the issue of cost escalation and delay in funding does not arise.*****
