Government has instituted several schemes/programmes aimed at encouraging young scientists to engage themselves with scientific activities / undertake research work. Some of the notable programmes of the Ministry of Science and Technology targeted at young scientists include: Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE) of Department of Science and Technology (DST), National Postdoctoral Fellowship (N-PDF) and Start-up Research Grant (SRG) of Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Research Fellowship Schemes of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Research Associateship, R&D project based Project Associates, Innovative Young Biotechnologist Award of DBT etc.In addition to above dedicated schemes, participation of young scientists in main stream research support schemes of SERB is as high as 37% in case of scientists below the age of 40 and 65% for scientists below age of 45 years, which demonstrates their vibrancy, competitiveness and contribution to Indian Science. Ease of funding, speed of delivery, attractive fellowships, access to best research infrastructure and knowledge resource pool, recognition and mentoring in some schemes are some of the characteristics of the young scientist research programmes. The schemes are designed to identify promising young researchers and providing them with training and research opportunities in areas of science, engineering and mathematics. The schemes also provide them a platform to develop as independent researchers for taking up challenging research problems for the benefit of the country. Funds allocated exclusively for young scientist research programmes during 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 and the current year by the Ministry of Science and Technology are Rs. 1178.3 crore, Rs. 1200.6 crore, Rs. 1293.5 crore and Rs. 1205 crore, respectively.(c)	The age criteria for availing benefits of various young scientist schemes are given below:Scheme / Programme(Department / Agency)	Upper age limit INSPIRE Faculty Fellow (DST)	32 years with relaxation of three years to applicants belonging to SC/ST categoriesSwarnajayanti Fellowship (DST / SERB)	40 yearsNational Postdoctoral Fellowship (SERB)	35 years with relaxation of five years to applicants belonging to SC/ST/OBC/ Physically Challenged/Women categoriesStart-up Research Grant (SERB)	42 years with relaxation of five years to applicants belonging to SC/ST/OBC/ Physically Challenged/Women categoriesRamanujan Fellowship (SERB)	40 yearsTeacher Associateship for Research Excellence (SERB)	45 years with relaxation of five years to applicants belonging to SC/ST/OBC/ Physically Challenged/Women categoriesFellowship / Associateship (CSIR)	28-40 yearsRamalingaswami Re-entry Fellowship (DBT)	45 yearsInnovative Young Biotechnologist Award  (DBT)	35 years of age with relaxation of 5 years to applicants belonging to SC/ST/OBC/ Physically Challenged/Women categoriesNational Women Bioscientist Award (DBT)	45 years	A number of quality publications in high impact journals and patents have emanated from the Young Scientist’s projects.  The schemes have helped many young researchers in the progress of their career in S&T, regular placement in academic / research institutions and industry. They also received recognitions in the form of awards, membership in science and engineering academies and have continued to contribute significantly towards India science and technology.(d)	The fellowships, awards as mentioned above offer liberal financial support in the form of fellowship ranging from Rs. 31,000/- to Rs. 1,35,000/- per month to scientists who are not in regular service, depending upon their qualification and nature of the scheme.
