ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b) 	Major ports are administered by the Central Government while Non-major ports are under the jurisdiction of respective State Maritime Boards/State Government. The installed capacity of major ports is considered to be sufficient to handle their cargo. Therefore, Government has no proposal for setting up new small major port, at present. 111 inland waterways (including existing 5 National Waterways) have been declared as ‘National Waterways’ (NWs) under the National Waterways Act, 2016 with the purpose of creating a network of national waterways to optimize the full potential of waterways mode of transport.   Development of the NWs for shipping and navigation which includes construction/ development of jetties, navigational aids, fairway etc. has been taken up in a phased manner.   A budgetary allocation of Rs. 614.56 crore has been made in 2019-20 for development of waterways.(c)	About 400 km stretch of NW-1 (River Ganga) passes through Bihar (from Manihari to Buxar).  Under the Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) various developmental activities for capacity augmentation of NW-1 have been taken up including setting up of an intermodal terminal at Kalughat in Saran district in Bihar to facilitate cargo movement on NW-1 to Northern Bihar as well as Nepal.  The land acquisition process for the Kalughat intermodal terminal has been initiated with the Government of Bihar.(d)	The details of the traffic handled at Non-Major ports in the country during the last three years is at Annex-I.(e) 	No, Sir.  The details of capacity utilization at Major Ports and Non-Major Ports (State wise) during 2018-19 is at Annex-I.(f)    The installed capacity of the Major Ports as on 31.03.2019 is 1514.09 MTPA which is sufficient to handle the existing cargo traffic at the Major Ports.    The traffic handled by the Major Ports during 2018-19 was 699.05 MT.    	Expansion and modernization of Major Ports in the country is an on-going process to keep the ports abreast with new technologies and also to meet trade (traffic) requirements.   The process inter-alia involves construction of new berths and terminals, mechanization of existing berths and terminals, capital dredging for deepening of drafts for attracting large vessels in port channels, development of road and rail connectivity etc. Annex-ITraffic handled at Non-Major Ports during 2015-16 to 2018-19 and Capacity utilization at Major Ports and Non-Major Ports (State-wise) during 2018-19Traffic at Non-Major Ports during 2015-16 to 2018-19<pre>Sl.
