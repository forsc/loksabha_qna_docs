ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b) The India Climate Collaborative (ICC) is a private sector / civil society initiative to support climate action in India. India’s Nationally Determined Contributions(NDCs) for 2021-2030 is anchored in eight National Missions under National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) and schemes & programmes therein. India’s effort on climate change are recognized globally and it is one of few countries whose actions are compliant with Paris Agreement goals. Voluntary efforts of various stakeholders in climate action will enhance our achievements.(c) India has launched eight missions under NAPCC in specific areas of solar energy, energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan eco-system, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. Climate actions at the state level are based on the State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCC). Thirty-three States/Union Territories have prepared their SAPCC in line with NAPCC taking into account State’s specific issues relating to climate change. These SAPCCs inter-alia outline sector specific and cross sectoral priority climate actions. The Government is also implementing National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC) to support adaptation measures of States/UTs in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Under NAFCC, 30 projects have been sanctioned in 27 States to tackle the issues related to adaptation in agriculture, water, forestry, etc. Government of India has also embarked upon ambitious actions in the areas of renewable energy, afforestation, energy efficiency, and urban development. As a result of these efforts India has achieved 21% reduction in emission intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) between 2005 and 2014, thereby achieving its pre-2020 voluntary goal of reducing emission intensity of its GDP by 20 to 25 % from 2005 levels by 2020.  ***
