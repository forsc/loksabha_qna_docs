Also, the Implementing Agencies conduct field surveys for assessment of needs of community, identifying location of the crèches and also eligible children.The Norms for registration, establishment and maintenance of the creches especially in matters of hygiene, first-aid, breastfeeding and nutrition have been stipulated under National Creche Scheme guidelines. *******
