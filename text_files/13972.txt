ANSWER




ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (e):  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act)  is the primary law for children in the country. As per Section 2 (14) (vi) of the JJ Act, a child  who does not have parents and no one is willing to take care of, or whose parents have abandoned or surrendered him is included as a “child in need of care and protection.” The Act provides a security net of service delivery structures including measures for institutional and non-institutional care to ensure comprehensive well being of children in distress situations. The primary responsibility of execution of the Act lies with the States/UTs.The Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing a centrally sponsored Child Protection Services (CPS) Scheme (erstwhile Integrated Child Protection Scheme) for supporting the children in difficult circumstances.The primary responsibility of implementation of the scheme lies with the State Governments/UT Administrations. Under the scheme institutional care is provided through Child Care Institutes (CCIs), as a rehabilitative measure. The programmes and activities in Homes inter-alia include age-appropriate education, access to vocational training, recreation, health care, counselling etc. Under the non-institutional care component, support is extended for adoption, foster care and sponsorship. Further CPS also provides for “After care” services after the age of 18 years to help sustain them during the transition from institutional to independent life. Further, under Section 41 of the Act, registration of institutions including Homes for CNCP has been made mandatory with penalty in case of non-compliance. As per Section 54 of the JJ Act, the State Governments/UT Administrations are required to conduct regular inspections and monitor the CCIs to ensure that the institutions are run as per the provisions of the Act and the Model Rules, 2016 framed there-under. The details of CCIs alongwith the children residing in them under CPS scheme as informed by the States/UTs during 2019-20 is Annexed.*** Annexure(As on Feb, 2020)S.
