MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (e): The Fifteenth Finance Commission, inter-alia, recommends development of professional courses in regional languages. This is in line with the National Education Policy 2020 which envisages imparting programmes in higher education, using mother tongue/local language as a medium of instruction, and/or offer programmes bilingually, in order to increase access and Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) and also to promote the strength, usage, and vibrancy of all Indian languages.  Drawing upon the National Education Policy (2020), the Government of India has constituted a Task Force for suggesting modalities for imparting technical education in regional languages. (f) and (g): The government is working towards translating reference materials for  courses of engineering in major regional languages. Further, SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds) is a Govt. of India’s own Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform, which has been offering online courses in disciplines such as Science, Engineering & Technology, Humanities & Social Sciences, Law, Management etc. The current status of translation of SWAYAM courses is as below:Sl.No.	Language	Number of courses translated1.
