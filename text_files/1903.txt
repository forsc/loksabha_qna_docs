ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) to (c): ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The State Governments are competent to take measures for expeditious investigation of cases of atrocities against women including by deputing special police officers. However, Government had enacted the Criminal Law (Amendment), Act 2013 for effective legal deterrence against sexual offences, which inter-alia provided for mandatory filing of FIR in cases of sexual offences. Further, the recently enacted Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018 makes it mandatory for completion of investigation within 2 months. In order to facilitate States/UTs, MHA has launched an online analytic tool for police on 19th February 2019 called “Investigation Tracking System for Sexual Offences” to monitor and track time-bound investigation in sexual assault cases in accordance with Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2018. -2/…-2-LS.US.Q.NO.1704 FOR 02.07.2019To improve investigations, MHA has taken steps to strengthen DNA analysis units in Central and State Forensic Science Laboratories. This includes setting up of a State-of-the-Art DNA Analysis Unit inCentral Forensic Science Laboratory, Chandigarh. MHA has also sanctioned setting-up and upgrading of DNA Analysis units in State Forensic Science Laboratories in 13 States/ UTs.MHA has also notified guidelines for collection of forensic evidence in sexual assault cases and the standard composition in a sexual assault evidence collection kit. To facilitate adequate capacity in manpower, training and skill building programs for Investigation Officers, Prosecution Officers and Medical Officers have commenced. 3221 Officers have already been trained by Bureau of Police Research and Development(BPR&D) and LokNayakJayaprakash Narayan National Institute of Criminology and Forensic Science in collection, handling and transportation of forensic evidence as on 28.06.2019. BPR&D has distributed 3,120 Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kits to States/ UTs as orientation kit as part of training.MHA has also issued advisories to all State Governments/UTs, advising them to ensure thorough investigation, conducting of medical examination of rape victims without delay and for increasing gender sensitivity in Police.
