ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE (SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a)	:  No Sir.  There is no provision in the election laws to monitor promises by the Political Parties.(b)	 and (c):   The Election Commission of India (ECI) has informed that there is no such proposal under its consideration.  However, the Supreme Court in its judgement/order dated the 05th July, 2013 in SLP (C) No. 21455 of 2008 had inter alia directed the Election Commission of India to frame guidelines on election manifesto to be included as part of the Model Code of Conduct with the observation that ‘the reality cannot be ruled out that distribution of freebies of any kind, undoubtedly, influences all people. It shakes the root of free and fair elections to a large degree’.Having due regard to the above directions of the Supreme Court and after consultation with the Political Parties, the ECI in the interest of free and fair election, included Part VIII in the Model Code of Conduct, which provided that Political Parties and Candidates while releasing election manifestos for any election to the Parliament or State Legislatures, shall adhere to the following guidelines:(i)	The election manifesto shall not contain anything repugnant to the ideals and principals enshrined in the Constitution and further that it shall be consistent with the letter and spirit of Model Code of Conduct.(ii)	The Directive Principals of State Policy enshrined in the Constitution enjoin upon the State to frame various welfare measures for the Citizens and therefore, there can be no objection to the promise of such welfare measures in election manifestos.  However, Political Parties should avoid making those promises, which are likely to vitiate the purity of the election process or exert undue influence on the voters in exercising their franchise.(iii)	In the interest of transparency, level playing field and credibility of the promises, it is expected that manifestos also reflect the rationale for the promises and broadly indicate the ways and means to meet the financial requirement for it.  Trust of voters should be sought only on those promises which are possible to be fulfilled. *******
