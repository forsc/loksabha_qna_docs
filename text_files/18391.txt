                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	The Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change is implementing Environment Education, Awareness and Training Scheme with the objective to promote environmental awareness among all sections of the society, especially school and college level students and to mobilize people’s participation for conservation of environment. A network of about 1.6 lakh ‘Ecoclubs’ have been established in schools and colleges across the country under the National Green Corps programme of this Scheme. About 40 lakh students are actively participating in the programme and have been involved in conducting environment protection related activities. Besides, under the National Nature Camping Programme of this Scheme, nature camps are organized for school students in protected areas (Wildlife Sanctuaries, National Parks, etc.). Trainings are also provided to teachers and students on various environmental issues, viz., biodiversity conservation, pollution, waste management, etc. through capacity building programmes. The Green Good Deeds (GGDs), a social movement, is one of the components of the Scheme aimed to inculcate green good habits and behaviour among all sections of the society to take green social responsibility. The GGDs initiative is about simple, practical steps that students/teachers/citizens can perform in their day to day life towards protection of environment. Cleanliness drives as part of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, plantation drives, awareness on waste management, minimizing the use of single-use plastic, celebrating Green Diwali, etc. are some of the activities undertaken by the school and college level students under the initiative. A total amount of Rs. 49.65 crore, Rs. 39.49 crore and Rs. 53.18 crore have been spent for implementing this Scheme during financial years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 respectively.(b) & (c) Under the World Bank aided Project titled ‘Capacity Building for Industrial Pollution Management (CBIPM)’ implemented by this Ministry, Rs. 24 crore was spent in Andhra Pradesh State, Rs. 2.28 crore was spent in Telangana State and Rs. 35.88 crore was spent in West Bengal State during 2017-18.*****
