NCS portal launched an online Job Fair module with enhancements where the complete cycle of job posting to selection of candidate can be completed on the portal.II.	A Special link for Work from Home Jobs and Online Trainings was created on NCS portal Home page to give direct access to Jobseekers to these jobs.III.	NCS portal launched the functionality of creation of video profiles for the Jobseekers. Jobseekers can create short video profile in the form of three video clips of 20 seconds each on "Self, Skills and Areas of Interest". This will enable the employer to shortlist the suitable candidate.IV.	National Career Service (NCS) also offers its registered jobseekers a free, self-paced Online Training Programme on “Career Skills”, which will equip the learners with an array of soft skills.V.	NCS Portal is providing links to public disclosure of scores and ranking of candidates in government recruitment examinations, so that those candidates who have not qualified in the final merit list have a second chance or option for a job in the Public or Private Sector. The employers can access the publically available data through NCS Portal.	******
