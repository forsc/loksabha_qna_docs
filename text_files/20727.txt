ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, MINISTER OF EARTH SCIENCES AND MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????, ??????? ?? ???????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ??????? ??????(??. ???? ?????) (a) & (b) Yes, Sir. The details are as under: -1.	Ministry of Science & Technology (S&T) has taken the initiative to launch a National Program on “Scientific Utilization through Research Augmentation-Prime Products from Indigenous Cow: SUTRA-PIC India Program”.  This is a collaborative program of Department of Science & Technology (DST), Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and Ministry of AYUSH.2.	Under this coordinated program, project proposals have been invited through Open call from scientists and academicians of Indian Research Institutions, Academia, S&T capable voluntary organizations (NGO’s) to carry out Scientific Research and Development in the following thematic areas:  •	Uniqueness of Indigenous Cow.•	Prime-products from indigenous cow for medicine and health; agricultural applications; food and nutrition & for utility items.3.	The proposals received in response to the above call have been pre-screened involving Expert Group comprising subject experts and officials from relevant Ministries.  (c), (d) & (e).   Earlier some Indian scientists had opposed funding of research under proposed SUTRA-PIC program.  The major concerns raised may be seen at Annexure I.  India is endowed with the largest cattle population in the world, with a huge biodiversity of 43 indigenous cattle breeds. Indian cattle breed is unique to exotic cattle breed genetically and its adaptation in the concerned local environment. However, the understanding of their uniqueness and the effective use of cow-derived products are confined to traditional knowledge passed on through generations based on their experiences. Now, the Government is making concerted efforts through this program to scientifically investigate the traditional practices, by using modern methodology and tools.  This knowledge will also help in scientifically appropriate utilization of this huge national resource for socio-economic development.In another area concerning the ancient science, an interdisciplinary programme in scientific exploration of practices of yoga and meditation was launched in 2015.  This programme is called Science and Technology of Yoga and Meditation (SATYAM).
