                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) to (c) : National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) compiles and publishes statistical data on accidents and suicides in its publication “Accidental Deaths & Suicides in India (ADSI)”, which is available on the website of NCRB, viz. https://ncrb.gov.in. The report is available upto the year 2020. The said report also contains details of the number of cases of suicide by women in the country. State-wise and year-wise details of number of suicides of women, and out of these, by house-wives for the year 2019 and 2020 is at Annexure.  The comparative data of suicide by women in India with respect to global suicides is not available. The data published by the NCRB shows that the main two causes behind suicide of women are ''family problem'' followed by ''illness''.  (d) & (e) : ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibility to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens including investigation and prosecution of crime against women and children rests primarily with the respective State Governments. The State Governments are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provisions of laws.  Nevertheless, the Central Government gives high priority to ensuring safety and security of women and has undertaken various legislative and schematic interventions in this regard. These include legislations such as ‘The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018’, ‘The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013’, ‘The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005’, ‘The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961’, etc. The schemes/ projects include One Stop Centres (OSCs); Universalisation of Women Helplines (WHL), Emergency Response Support System (ERSS) which is a pan-India single number (112)/ mobile app based system for emergencies; a cyber-crime reporting portal to report obscene content; safe city projects in 8 cities (Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow and Mumbai) including infrastructure, technology adoption and capacity building in community through awareness programmes, training and skill development programs for Investigation Officers, Prosecution Officers and Medical Officers; distribution of Sexual Assault Evidence Collection (SAEC) Kits to States/ UTs; establishment of state of the art DNA Laboratory at CFSL, Chandigarh; assistance to 24 States/ UTs to strengthen Forensic Science Laboratories; setting up of 1023 Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) for speedy disposal of cases of rape and cases under POCSO Act; setting up/ strengthening of Anti Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs) in all districts of the country; setting up/ strengthening of Women Help Desks (WHDs) at Police Stations etc. The Government has also put in place Investigation Tracking System for Sexual Offences, an online analytic tool for tracking and monitoring of investigation. A National Database on Sexual Offenders (NDSO) has also been created. As such, sufficient legal and schematic framework are available to safeguard women from the menace of domestic violence.  In addition, Ministry of Women and Child Development and Ministry of Home Affairs have issued advisories to States/ UTs from time to time on various issues pertaining to safety and security of women and children. *****    ANNEXURE ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) TO THE LOK SABHA UN-STARRED QUESTION NO. 3890 FOR ANSWER ON 25.03.2022 ASKED BY SHRI MOHAMMED FAIZAL P.P.
