ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  to (c): Department of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, Ministry of Jal Shakti does not implement any water audit scheme.  However, water being a State subject, State Governments take several measures for efficient utilization of water within the States, including water audit, implementation of laws and penal action against those violating the rules/regulations etc. in the matter. The Central Government supplements the measures and efforts being taken up by the State Governments.Central Water Commission had brought out "General Guidelines for Water Audit & Water Conservation" with the objectives introducing, standardizing and popularizing the water audit system for conservation of water in all sectors of water use and improve the water use efficiency.   The National Water Policy, 2012 also stipulates a system to evolve benchmarking for water uses for different purposes, i.e., water foot- prints, and water auditing should be developed to promote and incentivize efficient use of water. Contd…P/2//2//Government of India has launched the National Water Mission with the objective of “conservation of water, minimizing wastage and ensuring its more equitable distribution both across and within States through integrated water resources development and management”. Promoting mandatory water audit including those for drinking water purposes is one of the strategies for achieving the goals of National Water Mission.(d) & (e)   No, Sir. However, works related to water resources development & management are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priorities.  In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes such as scheme for Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of water bodies, Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI) etc. under PMKSY.The SMI and RRR of water bodies schemes have multiple objectives like expanding cultivable area under assured irrigation, improving water use efficiency, ground water recharge, improvement and restoration of water bodies thereby increasing the tank storage capacity and revival of lost irrigation potential, increased availability of drinking water, improvement of catchment of tank commands etc.*****
