                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (f):	Ministry of Health & Family Welfare monitors cases of COVID-19 and its management as per the details provided by the States. A first surge in COVID-19 cases was  noted during September 2020 and the second surge was seen in May 2021. A cumulative number of 4,18,987 deaths due to COVID-19 have been reported so far in the country. The case fatality rate is 1.34%.Health is a state subject. MoHFW has conveyed to States/UTs, WHO and ICMR guidelines on correct recording of COVID-19 related deaths in accordance with globally accepted ICD-10 classification. In addition, the issue of correct and timely reporting of deaths has also been stressed to all States/UTs through video conferences and formal communication. Accordingly, the details are obtained from states/UTs. It has been noted that some of states based on reconciliation of mortality data have also revised the reported COVID-19 deaths. All states have also been advised that while reconciling the data, the details of deaths shall be indicated date wise & district wise to get correct picture of the pandemic. States have also been regularly advised to undertake death audit to ascertain the cause of deaths and undertake measures for improving quality of healthcare services.Union Government has provided the required technical support and has also supported the states through logistic and financial support to further strengthen the existing health infrastructure. Some of the ongoing initiatives include:•	Government of India, to supplement the hospital facilities has roped in tertiary care hospitals under ESIC, Defence, Railways, paramilitary forces, Steel Ministry etc. Further, many large temporary treatment facilities were established by DRDO to manage surge in COVID-19 cases in the country.•	Due to concerted actions of Central and State Governments, the isolation bed capacity and ICU bed capacity which was only 10,180 and 2,168 before the first lockdown (as on 23rd March 2020) in being enhanced continuously and is currently at 18,21,845 isolation beds and 1,22,035 ICU beds (as on 20th July 2021).•	The daily liquid medical oxygen (LMO) production, which was about 5700 MTs per day in August 2020 increased to a high of 9690 MTs as on 13th May 2021. This was done by enhancement of LMO production in steel plants as well as in other LMO plants. •	A system for real-time monitoring of oxygen production in steel plants and distribution of oxygen to States/UTs was also put in place. •	Restrictions were imposed on industrial use of oxygen.  •	A dynamic and transparent framework for allocation of medical oxygen in consultation with States/UTs and all the stakeholders such as relevant Ministries, manufacturers/suppliers of liquid oxygen etc. has been prepared. •	Online digital solutions viz. Oxygen Demand Aggregation system (ODAS) and Oxygen Digital Tracking System (ODTS) have been developed to ascertain the demand for medical oxygen from all medical facilities and to track their transportation. •	To avoid wastage of medical oxygen, guidelines on rational use of oxygen were issued on 25th September 2020, and further revised and disseminated to States on 25th April 2021.•	1,02,400 oxygen cylinders were procured in April and May of 2020 and distributed to States.

In addition, around 4962 B-type and 1895 D-type cylinders are in-transit.•	To generate oxygen at the health facility level, PSA plants are being established in hospitals, especially in far flung areas enabling the hospitals to become self-sufficient in generation of oxygen for their needs and thereby, reduce the burden on the medical oxygen supply grid across the country.•	Further, to fast-track the availability of Medical Oxygen in rural and peri-urban areas, more than 18,000 Oxygen Concentrators have been allocated to various States. •	Remdesivir is a patented drug, manufactured in India under voluntary licenses granted by Gilead Life Sciences USA (the patent holder) to 7 Indian pharmaceutical companies. Manufacturing capacity was augmented from 38 lakh vials per month to nearly 122 lakh vials per month. In addition, 40 additional manufacturing sites were approved by the CDSCO, thus increasing the manufacturing sites from 22 to 62.•	All States/UT and State Drugs Controllers have been requested to verify stock of the drug and check other malpractices and take effective steps to curb hoarding and black marketing of Remdesivir.  •	Ministry of Health & Family Welfare also continues to provide technical guidance for managing various aspects of COVID-19.
