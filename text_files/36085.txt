                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL) (a)	& (b) A statement is laid on the Table of the House. Statement referred to in the reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No.311 due for reply on 24.03.2022.(a) & (b) In the operational guidelines of Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) [SBM(G)] Phase-II, the States have been advised to release the Central share and proportionate State share funds from the State Treasury to the State level implementing agency, within 15 days from transfer of Central share to the State Governments.  Under the programme, in order to ensure timely release of States’ share, Central share funds are released only after release of proportionate State share against the previous instalment of Central share.  In this regard, a letter has also been written to the States on 14thMay, 2020 stating that funds would not be released to the States without confirmation, inter alia, that proportionate State share has been released from the State Treasury against the previous instalment.  State Governments have also to confirm that necessary provision of State share has been made in the State’s Budget.  Further, under SBM(G), all the States have also been on boarded on Public Financial Management System (PFMS) of Government of India so that effective monitoring of funds release (including State share) and its utilisation can be done.  The status of States’ share release is also included in every review meeting with the States.*****
