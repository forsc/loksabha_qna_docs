All out sincere and focused approach is being adopted by Railway for quick execution of these projects.In the overall interest of the Nation and to ensure that, projects are completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is being done in Railways at various levels (field level, divisional level, zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned Authorities to resolve the pending issues that are obstructing the progress of projects.To ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the  contractor in  the  form  of  bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects.  For capacity enhancement projects, institutional financing has been arranged, which has increased Railways’ capacity for committed fund provision for essential projects. The completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government,   forest   clearance   by   officials   of forest  department,  shifting  of  infringing   utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions of working agencies/contractors etc. All these factors vary from project to project and site to site and affect the completion time and cost of the project.
