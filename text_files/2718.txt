ANSWER




MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D. V. SADANANDA GOWDA)                               (a):	The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) fixes the ceiling prices of Scheduled medicines and retail prices of new drugs as per the provisions of the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO).(b) & (c) 	The NPPA also monitors the prices of medicines and initiates action againstsuch manufacturers which have overcharged patients. The details of demand notices issued by NPPA are as follows:Year	Number of cases	Demanded Amount (RsCrores)upto March, 2013	926	3021.62013-2014	90	405.382014-2015	128	600.312015-2016	263	931.632016-2017	137	333.972017-2018	221	704.122018-2019	226	288.002019-20 (upto 31 May, 2019)	42	85.22Total	2033	6370.23The detailed list of overcharging cases where demand notices have been issued is available on NPPA’s website www.nppaindia.nic.in.(d) & (e)	Drug manufacturers are required to upload the price data of their medicines in Form V of DPCO, 2013 through Integrated Pharmaceutical Database Management System (IPDMS) to NPPA. Further, the Maximum Retail Price of medicines is also reflected in PharmaSahi Dam App / Web version on the basis of market based database referred by NPPA.	Under DPCO, 2013, there is no provision to direct the drug manufacturing companies to update their price list in their respective websites. Accordingly, NPPA has not given any such directions.(f)	In order to have transparency, a draft version of the Price Calculation Sheets for the proposed revised price notifications, including wherever applicable, the Price to Retailer (PTR) and Moving Annual Turnover (MAT) values adopted for calculations, is uploaded on the website of NPPA for 10 clear working days to invite comments from the pharmaceutical firms. Only after taking into account the comments or any additional data thus received within the given time period, the NPPA finalizes the ceiling and the retail Prices. Thus the entire procedure of price fixation is available in the public domain which ensures transparency and accountability of the whole process.*******
