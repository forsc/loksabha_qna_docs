A provision has been  made in the Revised Operational Guidelines of Pradhan  Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) that 12% interest rate per annum to be paid by the Insurance Company to farmers for delay in settlement claims beyond 10 days of prescribed cut off date for payment of claims provided the yield data/crop loss information and applicable premium subsidy is paid on time by the concerned State Government. The defaulting insurance companies have been asked to pay calculated penalty amount at Rs. 383.78 lakh pertaining to crop seasons upto Rabi 2017-18.  Further, as the all data is available with the concerned Sates, they used to submit the data to Central Government and then aforesaid data was examined and penalty was enforced. Therefore, to reduce the time in calculation and payment of penalty, State Governments have been advised to calculate and ensure payment of penal interest on account of delay in settlement of claims by concerned Insurance Companies to the affected farmers along with pending claims amount.*******
