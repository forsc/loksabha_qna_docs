                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c):	The Government is actively collaborating with different Government Departments and stakeholders for creating opportunities to donate safe blood and raise public awareness on the need for safe blood. Public Health, being a State subject, it is the primary responsibility of the State Government to ensure the establishment of Blood Banks as per their need and meet their blood requirements. However, the Government supports various activities like conducting blood donation camps, organizing youth groups in coordination with agencies like Nehru Yuva Kendra Sansthan, National Service Scheme, Red Ribbon Clubs in various Universities and Colleges, as well as through Red Cross Societies, etc. These activities are coordinated by State AIDS Control Society and State Blood Transfusion Council set up in all States and Union Territories across the country to enable safe blood collection from non remunerated voluntary blood donors. Additionally, awareness generation amongst the healthy eligible population on the importance of Voluntary Blood Donation is reiterated through observance of special days like National Youth Day, World Thallasemia Day, World Blood Donor Day, National Voluntary Blood Donor Day, etc. Many Pan India multi state Blood Donation Drives are also organized in collaboration with various Voluntary Organizations as well as private sector entities. Government also partners with various professional associations and blood donor organizations towards creating an enabling environment for voluntary blood donation amongst all medical staff and communities. The Government has also made a provision of two special casual leaves per year that can be availed by Central Government employees for donating blood.
