                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c):   Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) does not have any Population Based Cancer Registry (PBCR) in Coimbatore, Kancheepuram and Thoothukudi districts in Tamil Nadu. Thus, information on cancer incidence in these districts is not available separately. The only PBCR under National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP) in Tamil Nadu is situated in Chennai. As per NCRP report, all sites showed an increase in Age Adjusted Incidence Rate for Chennai PBCR.Health is a State subject. The Central Government, however, supplements the efforts of the State Governments to prevent and control cancer and to provide affordable and accessible care. The Government is implementing National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), with focus on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, health promotion & awareness generation, early diagnosis, management and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. To tackle the challenge of Non Communicable Diseases (NCD), including cancer, 616 NCD Clinics at District level and 3,827 NCD Clinics at Community Health Centre level have been set up in the country under NPCDCS, including 32 NCD Clinics at District level and 663 NCD Clinics at Community Health Centre level in Tamil Nadu. Population level initiative for prevention, control and screening for common NCDs (diabetes, hypertension and common cancers viz. oral, breast and cervical cancer) has also been rolled out under the National Health Mission (NHM) in over 215 districts. Screening of common NCDs including three common cancers i.e. oral, breast and cervical is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres. Under NHM support is provided to States/UTs to provide free essential medicines and diagnostic services for primary and secondary health care needs.
