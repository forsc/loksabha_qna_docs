                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (c): 	  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2688 BY SHRI SANJAY KAKA PATIL TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 04.08.2021 REGARDING DOUBLING OF PUNE-MIRAJ-LONDA RAILWAY LINE(a) to (c):	Pune – Miraj - Londa (466 km) Doubling project was sanctioned in 2015-16. The latest anticipated cost of the project is `4,795 crore. An expenditure of `1,345 crore has been incurred upto March, 2021 and an outlay of `555 crore has been provided for 2021-22.  102 km doubling has been completed and work has been taken up in available landProject involves acquisition of total 103.02 Ha land (Maharashtra 83.13 Ha and Karnataka 19.89 Ha), out of which 4.69 Ha land in Maharashtra and 2.74 Ha in Karnataka has been acquired. Acquisition of balance land has been taken up.In Maharashtra, Railway and Revenue authorities are making every effort for early acquisition of land.  However, there was issue of non-updating of land records and revenue maps of the land which were acquired by Railways in 1941 and 1968 in Satara district.  The matter has been resolved now and 100% mutation of land records has been done.  Now, the process of land acquisition has been expedited and compensation to the farmers, who have agreed to the joint measurement, is being paid expeditiously.  But, the Railways and Revenue Authorities are facing resistance from most of the farmers during the joint measurement of land as they are not agreeing with base line.  This is causing delay in land acquisition in Satara district.In Karnataka, land acquisition has been taken up. However, State Government has given working permission for execution of work.Land is being acquired by Maharashtra Government.*****
