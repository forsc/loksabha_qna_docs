Details related to unauthorized colonies, illegal construction and management of complaints rest with the respective State/UT Governments.    However, for the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCTD), whose land matters are under the jurisdiction of the Central Government, Pradhan Mantri Unauthorised Colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojana (PM-UDAY) was launched in October 2019, for conferring/ recognizing ownership or mortgage/ transfer rights to the residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies of Delhi.       Further, a Special Task Force (STF) constituted under the chairmanship of Vice-Chairman, Delhi Development Authority (DDA), receives complaints regarding unauthorized constructions and acts through concerned Urban Local Bodies and Police to remove them.                            *****
