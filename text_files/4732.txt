                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b) In India, there is a well-established regulatory framework for approval of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) as per “Rules for the Manufacture / Use / Import/ Export and Storage of Hazardous Microorganisms, Genetically Engineered Organisms or Cells”, 1989 (Rules 1989) established under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. Evaluation of each application of GMO is done on a case-to-case basis after a thorough examination of health, environment, food and feed safety assessment studies undertaken in a systematic and scientific manner as per prescribed guidelines, manuals and standard operating procedures stipulated by various regulatory agencies from time to time. The data generated by the applicants is reviewed at every step in the development process of Genetically Modified (GM) crops by various statutory committees, such as Institutional Biosafety Committee, Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation and Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC).Similarly, each of the nearly 70 countries which either grow or import and consume GMOs, have specific polices/ regulations to govern these activities. Several developed countries which do not grow GMOs, allow their import and consumption. (c)	GEAC has approved over one hundred confined field trials of GM crops.(d)	The composition of GEAC has been defined in Section 4 of Rules 1989. The GEAC is chaired by Additional Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and co-chaired by a nominee of the Department of Biotechnology. The Co-chair has always been a renowned scientist. The members of GEAC include ex-officio experts, as well as many independent experts.(e)	The application related to environmental release of transgenic Mustard was recommended by Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) in its 133rd meeting held on May 11, 2017. However, pursuant to receipt of various representations from different stakeholders, further studies regarding impact on environment have been proposed.***
