(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	Agricultural marketing is a state subject and Government of India provides support and assistance for promoting agriculture marketing.

The quality parameters also play an important role in the price of a commodity. The price of agricultural produce is usually low immediately after its harvest due to increased supply in the market, which gradually picks up thereafter.   The Government is promoting scientific storage facilities for the farmers in the country to improve the holding capacity through the scheme of “Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI)”, which is a sub-scheme of Integrated Scheme for Agricultural Marketing (ISAM). Assistance under the AMI Scheme is available to Individual farmers, Group of farmers/growers, registered Farmer Produce Organizations (FPOs) etc. Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) provides assistance for development of post harvest management and marketing infrastructure such as cold storages, ripening chamber, pack houses, reefer vehicles to farmers to improve marketability of their produce.Contd….2/-- 2 –In order to develop the marketing infrastructure including storages and cold storage etc., the Government is implementing Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana-Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied Sector Rejuvenation (RKVY-RAFTAAR) Scheme.(c):	There are various government schemes under which assistance is available for reefer transportation facilities to help farmers carry their produce including milk and vegetables to the cities and other remote areas. Some of the schemes under which assistance is available are as under:  (i)	Assistance for reefer van is available under the scheme of Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH).  (ii)	Under National Programme for Dairy Development (NPDD), marketing infrastructure for preserving/maintaining quality of milk i.e. insulated/refrigerated tanks/vans, deep freezers are provided.(iii)	Under Dairy Entrepreneurship Development Scheme (DEDS), assistance is provided for the activities such as enhancement of milk production, preservation, transportation, processing and marketing of milk.  (iv)	Under Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI), sub scheme of Integrated Scheme for Agricultural Marketing (ISAM), mobile infrastructure for post-harvest operations including grading, packaging, quality testing, reefer vans etc. are permissible for assistance.*******
