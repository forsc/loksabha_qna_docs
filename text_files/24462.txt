However, the details of implementing agency of the State Government of Maharashtra and the activities proposed to be carried out along with requirement of funds were not received. The State Government of Maharashtra was requested to provide the specific proposals and pending utilizations certificates vide letter No. K-2/2/2021 dated 2nd March 2021. Therefore, for want of specific proposal and pending utilization certificates for the funds released earlier, no funds under the Consumer Awareness Scheme could be released to the Government of Maharashtra from the year 2017 till date.*****
