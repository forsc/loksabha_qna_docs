                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SMT. MEENAKASHI LEKHI](a)	Around 22500 Indian nationals, mostly students, have returned from Ukraine to India safely since 1 February 2022 till date. Our Embassy in Ukraine continues to be in touch with the remaining Indian nationals in Ukraine who have registered with the Embassy. It is estimated that there may be around 50 Indian nationals still in Ukraine, including 15-20 who may be willing to return to India. The Embassy is facilitating their return where possible. 	One Indian national, Harjot Singh, suffered bullet injuries but was evacuated safely to India under medical supervision. 	Naveen Shekarappa Gyanagaudar, a final year medical student of Kharkiv Medical University, unfortunately lost his life on 2 March 2022.  (b)	In view of the continued build-up of tensions in February, the Embassy of India in Kyiv issued an advisory on 15 February, 2022 advising Indian nationals in Ukraine, whose stay is not essential, to leave the country temporarily. Further advisories were also given on 20 February and 22 February pressing students to leave Ukraine. Air-bubble restrictions then in force were immediately lifted in consultation with Ukrainian side to increase the number of direct flights. As a result, around 4000 Indian nationals departed from Ukraine by direct and indirect flights till 23 February 2022.	Following the closure of airspace of Ukraine due to the outbreak of conflict on 24 February 2022, Government of India facilitated the evacuation of around 18500 Indian nationals after 24 February till date.
