                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare is implementing Sugarcane development programme under National Food Security Mission (NFSM) in 13 major sugarcane  growing states from 2014-15 with the aim to increase production and productivity. Further, the Central Government fixes the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane before the commencement of every sugar season. The FRP is a benchmark guaranteed price of sugarcane, determined by the Government below which no sugar mill can purchase sugarcane from cane growers. The Central Government also takes appropriate measures from time to time to stabilize sugar prices at reasonable level and to improve the liquidity position of the mills.     (b) & (c):	The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs compiles and disseminates information on suicides in its publication titled Accidental Death and Suicide in India (ADSI).  However, specific information with respect to suicides by sugarcane farmers is not available with the Bureau.*******
