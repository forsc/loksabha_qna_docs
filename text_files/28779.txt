                                                        MINISTER OF LAW & JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 100 FOR THE 3rd DECEMBER, 2021 REGARDING ‘FAST TRACK COURTS’(a) to (d): Setting up of Fast Track Courts (FTCs) and allocation of funds lies within the domain of the State Governments who set up such courts as per their need and resources, in consultation with the respective High Courts.  FTCs were created during 11th Finance Commission for disposal of long pending cases based on the findings of a study that one such court disposes up to 168 cases in a year.  Central funding has been discontinued after 31.03.2015.  Subsequently, 14th Finance Commission had recommended that the number of FTCs to be established should be 10% of the sanctioned strength of Judicial Officers of the State.  The 14th Finance Commission had recommended the setting up of 1800 FTCs during 2015-2020 and had urged State Governments to utilize enhanced fiscal space available through tax devolution (32% to 42%) for this purpose. As per information received from High Courts the number of functional FTCs, State/UT-wise as on 31st October 2021, is given in Annexure.      Information on funds allocated by the States for functioning of FTCs is not maintained centrally. Since central funding stands discontinued for FTCs, the question of allocation of more funds by the centre to the States does not arise.
