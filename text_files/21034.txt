ANSWER




                                                        (a) &(b)Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) now called as Scheduled Tribe Component (STC) is a dedicated source of fund for tribal development. STC is a multi-pronged strategy which includes support for education, health, sanitation, water supply, livelihood etc. Major part of infrastructure development in tribal dominated areas and provision of basic amenities to tribal people in the country is carried out through various schemes / programmes of concerned Central Ministries/Departments and the State Governments concerned, while the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) provides additive to these initiatives by way of plugging gaps. NITI Aayog from time to time issues guidelines for earmarking of funds by Central Ministries/Departments under STC. Besides, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, 40 Central Ministries / Departments have been mandated to earmark STC funds in the range of 4.3 to 17.5 percent of their total Scheme allocation every year for tribal development. The Central Ministries/Departments earmark STC funds under specific schemes and plans for the expenditure under the schemes for welfare of STs. MoTA monitors allocation, expenditure, etc. of STC funds through STC-MIS portal http://stcmis.gov.in and meetings with nodal officers of the Ministries/Departments. Details of funds allocated and spent by different Central Ministries / Departments under their schemes during 2019-20 to 2020-21 is at Annexure I.For most of the schemes of Ministry of Tribal Affairs like Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS), Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution, Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)etc. funds are released to States/UTs based on the proposals received and sanctioned by Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) of the Ministry. Under the scheme Grant-in-Aid to Voluntary Organizations working for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes, grants are provided to the eligible Non Governmental Organizations / Autonomous Societies for the categories of projects duly recommended by the multi-disciplinary State Level Committee of the concerned State Government / UT Administration in accordance with the procedure/ guidelines as laid down by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs from time to time. Utilization certificates and progress reports are insisted upon as a pre-requisite for further release of funds as per the norms of GFR.  Meetings/ Conferences are convened at the Central level with State officials for ensuring timely submission of proposals, speeding up of implementation of the schemes/ programmes and reviewing the physical and financial progress.Further, State Governments are also supposed to earmark Schedule Tribe component funds in proportion to ST population (Census, 2011) in the State with respect to total State Plan. Details of funds allocated and spent by State Government/UT under their Schemes under STC for welfare and development of STs during 2019-20 to 2020-21 is at Annexure II.
