                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (SMT. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) and (b) Health is a state subject. The Department of Health & Family Welfare, however, provides technical and financial support to the States/UTs under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), as part of National Health Mission (NHM), based on the proposals received from the States/UTs. The programme focusses on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, health promotion & awareness generation for Cancer prevention, early diagnosis, management and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. A population level initiative for prevention, control and screening for common Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) i.e. diabetes, hypertension and common cancers viz. Oral, breast and cervical cancer, has been rolled out in over 697 districts of the country under NHM and also  as a part of comprehensive primary healthcare under Ayushman Bharat-Health & Wellness Centres Scheme(AB-HWC). Under the initiative, persons more than 30 years of age are targeted for  screening for common NCDs. Screening of common NCDs including three common cancers i.e oral, breast and cervical is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres.  Preventive and Promotive aspects of health are taken care of   through a focus on wellness activities and appropriate measures for community awareness.To enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer, the Central Government is implementing Strengthening of Tertiary Care for Cancer Scheme, under which setting up of 19 State Cancer Institutes (SCIs) and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres (TCCCs) have been approved. There is also focus on Oncology in its various aspects in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojna (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar (Haryana) and second campus of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata are also steps in this direction. All these will enhance the capacity for treatment of cancer in the country.Cancer is diagnosed and treated at various levels in the health care facilities. The treatment in Government Hospitals is provided free of cost. The treatment for in-patient care is also available under Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) for 10.74 crore families eligible under AB-PMJAY as per Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) database.Several awareness initiatives have been undertaken by the Government including observation of National Cancer Awareness Day and use of print, electronic and social media. In addition, NPCDCS supports awareness generation activities to be undertaken by the states.
