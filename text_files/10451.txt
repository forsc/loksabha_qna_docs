(a) to (d):  On 16.11.2019,  a MiG 29 KUB (trainer) aircraft encountered a flock of birds after takeoff from Naval Air Station at Dabolim, Goa and caught fire.  Attempts to recover the aircraft were unsuccessful due to damage and low height.  There was no loss of life or damage to property on ground.     13 fighter aircrafts have crashed during the period from 2017-18 to         November, 2019.     Every accident is followed by an investigation by Board of Inquiry/Court of Inquiry which gives causes of accident and suggests remedial measures to avoid similar accident in future.  These  recommendations are circulated to all the operating units for implementation.*****
