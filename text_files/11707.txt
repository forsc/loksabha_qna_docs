There are also separate cooperation programmes with individual countries  depending on specific bilateral requirements. Grant assistance also includes the programs aimed at Capacity Building and High Impact Community Development Projects.

About 454 participants have been trained in various training programmes/workshops so far. India is also a part of SAARC Food Bank which has been established to supplement national efforts to provide food security to the people of the region.
