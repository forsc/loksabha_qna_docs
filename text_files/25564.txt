                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RAMDAS ATHAWALE)(a) & (b):   The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) {PoA} Act, 1989, is an Act to prevent the commission of offenses of atrocities against members of Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs). Since ''Police'' and ''Public Order'' are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule (List-II) to the Constitution of India, the State Governments and UT Administrations are primarily responsible for prevention, detection, registration, investigation and prosecution of all crimes within their jurisdiction including crimes against members of SCs and STs as also for implementation of provisions of the PCR Act and the PoA Act. However, Government of India reviews the implementation of the Act from time to time and also issue advisories from time to time to the States/UTs for implementing the provisions of the Act in letter and spirit.(c)  : No such data is maintained by this Department.(d) : Manual scavenging is prohibited under Section 5 of the “Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (MS Act 2013)” in all the States and Union Territories with effect from 06.12.2013, the date of coming into force of the Act. Further, Section 3(1) (j) of the PoA Act  describes as follows: “Whoever, not being a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe,-…makes a member of a SC or a ST to do manual scavenging or employs or permits the employment of such member for such purpose…shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months but which may extend to five years and with fine.”*****
