Data for waste generated as a result of such failures is not being maintained separately. (b) to (e) A Committee was constituted by NITI Aayog under the chairmanship of Secretary, MNRE with the mandate inter-alia to propose an action plan to evolve a circular economy in solar panel through reuse/recycling of the waste generated. The draft report of the Committee has been submitted to NITI Aayog.*****
