ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (e): At present, 491 Railway projects including 54 projects in West Bengal of  length  4427  km  costing  `42734  crores,  79  projects  falling fully/partly in Uttar Pradesh of length 6604 km costing `88213 crores, 35 projects falling fully/partly in Odisha of length 4537 km costing `47912 crores, 22 projects falling fully/partly in Tamil Nadu of length 2519 km costing `21829 crores, 35 projects falling fully/partly in Karnataka of length 4417 km costing `41746 crores and 40 projects falling fully/partly in Gujarat of length 3600 km costing `24786 crores are in different stages of planning/approval/execution. The total length of 491 Railway projects is 48861 km costing `6.48 Lakh Crore. The total expenditure on these projects up to March, 2019 is `1.43 Lakh Crore and length commissioned is 9113 km. However, the details of all works in progress and new works including funds spent on each project, allotment of funds and expenditure are made available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in >Ministry of Railways >Railway Board >About Indian Railways >Railway Board Directorates >Finance(Budget) >2019-20_List_of_Works. The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions of working agencies/contractors etc. and all these factors affect the completion cost of the project, which is finally worked out at the completion stage.In the overall interest of the nation and to ensure that projects are completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, divisional level, zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues that are obstructing the progress of projects.To ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects.        For important projects, capacity enhancement projects, last mile connectivity etc. institutional financing has been done by arranging loan of `1.5 lakh crore, which has increased Railways’ capacity for committed fund provision for essential projects.*****
