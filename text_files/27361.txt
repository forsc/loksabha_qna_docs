                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR) (a)	to (e) From 1st May to 20th June 2021, “The Liberalized Pricing and Accelerated National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy” was implemented to incentivize production by vaccine manufacturers and encourage new COVID-19 vaccines. Under this strategy, States/UTs and private hospitals were allowed to procure COVID-19 vaccine directly from manufacturers. Government of India procured 50% of monthly vaccine production by the domestic manufacturers, the State Government and private hospitals procured remaining 50% doses. “The Revised Guidelines for Implementation of National COVID Vaccination Program” came in effect from 21st June 2021, under which Government of India procures 75% and private hospitals can procure upto 25% of monthly vaccine production. Accordingly, the details of Covishield and Covaxin vaccines supplied to State/UT Government (as GoI supply and State procurement) and private hospitals during May, June and July 2021, State/UT-wise is at Annexure-1. In order to ensure maximum utilization of the vaccines, a 15 days advance visibility of vaccine availability to States/UTs is provided by the Central Government with an advice to prepare and publicize in advance District-wise & CVC-wise plan for accelerating the coverage of COVID-19 vaccination and for maximizing the convenience of citizens. The demand of COVID-19 vaccines from private hospitals is aggregated on Co-WIN portal and Government of India, through CoWIN platform, facilitates the sourcing of these vaccines by private hospitals in coordination with State Governments and vaccine manufacturers. The private hospitals, accordingly, prepare and publish the schedule of vaccination on Co-WIN portal as per the availability of vaccines with them.As of 2nd August 2021, a total of 3.56 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been procured by private hospitals.The COVID-19 vaccines once procured by private hospitals is not re-allocated to Government vaccination centres. COVID-19 vaccination is an ongoing and dynamic process, which is being guided by National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) on the basis of concurrent scientific evidence. It is expected that eligible beneficiaries aged 18 years and above will be vaccinated by December 2021.****
