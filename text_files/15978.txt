ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) As per ‘World Population Prospects 2019’ report, India’s population reached 1.36 billion (136 crore) in mid 2019, which makes it the second most populous country in the world. As per Census of India, India''s population was 121.02 crore in 2011. State/ UT-wise Decadal Growth Rate is placed in Annexure I; 3-yearly data on population growth is not available. -2-(b):      24 States/ UTs have achieved replacement level of fertility or below.(c) & (d):     Steps taken to create awareness and ensure better availability of family planning methods are placed at Annexure II. Success achieved:•	The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) has declined from 2.9 (SRS 2005) to 2.2 (SRS 2017) •	The Decadal growth rate has declined from 21.54% in 1991-2001 to 17.64% during 2001-11. •	The Crude birth rate (CBR) has declined from 23.8 (SRS 2005) to 20.2 (SRS 2017) •	The Teenage birth rate has halved from 16% in 2005-06 (NFHS III) to 8% in 2015-16 (NFHS IV).(e):      Rs. 904045.10 lakh was allocated to States/ UTs to promote family planning during last three years. (f):       The Government does not have such a proposal at present since India is signatory to the ICPD declaration of 1994 held in Cairo (International Conference on Population and Development) which unequivocally advocates voluntary informed choice and honouring reproductive rights of couples to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children.…………………….
