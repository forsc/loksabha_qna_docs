                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)Under the Integrated Skill Development Scheme (ISDS), a total number of 61383 persons were trained in the state of West Bengal out of which 47039 persons were given employment. The state-wise detail of candidates trained under Integrated Skill Development Scheme (ISDS) across the country is at Annexure-I. Further, under the ‘Samarth-Scheme for Capacity Building in Textiles Sector’, Ministry of Textiles had requested the Textiles Industries located in West Bengal as well as the State Government to participate in the Scheme for conducting training in West Bengal. So far 6 training Centers in West Bengal have been registered for training under Samarth scheme.With a view to create robust human resources for the textiles sector, particularly the need for trained and skilled workforce in all segment of the textile sector, Ministry of Textiles has been implementing various skill development schemes and programmes since the financial year 2010-11.Under the Comprehensive Integrated Skill Development Scheme (ISDS), a total of 11.14 lakh persons have been trained during FY 2010-11 to 2017-18, in various diverse segments of textile sector covering textiles and apparel, jute, spinning, weaving, technical textiles, sericulture, handloom and handicrafts. The training in ISDS also covered 33 States and Union Territories of the country, widely covering all sections of the society such as women(71.27%), Scheduled Caste(20.82%), Schedule Tribes (6.9%) and Divyang Jan(0.28%). Out of the 11.14 lakh persons trained, 8.43 lakh persons have been employed.In further continuation, Ministry of Textiles has expanded the skill development programme, called Samarth- Scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector, for the entire value chain of the textiles sector (except spinning and weaving in organized sector which are being trained under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana) with a target of 10 lakh persons at a total outlay of Rs.1300 crore. The training programme and course curriculum have been rationalized keeping in view the technological and market demand status of the domestic and international economies. Ministry of Textiles has already partnered with 21 Government Agencies from 18 States and Sectoral Organizations covering nearly 4 lakh persons, for entry level training and job creation in both traditional and organized segments of textile value chain.       Further, a training target of approximately 1.5 Lakh persons has been allocated to Industry/Industry associations for undertaking training. Special emphasis is also laid on upskilling in apparel and garmenting segment for increasing the competitiveness of the industry in global market.
