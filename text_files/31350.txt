VIRENDRA KUMAR)(a): “The Persons in Destitution (Protection, Care and Rehabilitation) Model Bill of 2016” was considered and dropped by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.(b):  As per information available, as many as 19 States and 3 UTs have either enacted their own Anti Beggary Legislation or adopted the legislation enacted by other States.
