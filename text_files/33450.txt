Subsequently, the Government of Rajasthan decided to execute the project with the funds made available by the Govt. of India under Jal Jeevan Mission (Urban) and the State Government, and, therefore, requested to drop the proposal for external funding from JICA. Accordingly, the project proposal has been dropped from the JICA Rolling Plan on 12.07.2021.****
