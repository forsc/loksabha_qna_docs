(a) to (d) The Biological Diversity Act, 2002 enacted in pursuance to the Convention on Biological Diversity to which India is a Party, is aimed at conservation of biodiversity, sustainable use of its components, and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of these resources, also known as access and benefit sharing (ABS).  The Act extends to the whole of India, including the North East region.  Further, the Act provides for State Governments to make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act.The Act is implemented through a three-tiered institutional mechanism, namely National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) at the national level, State Biodiversity Boards at the State level, and Biodiversity Management Committees at the local body level. 	Under the Act, Biological Diversity Rules were notified in 2004, and Guidelines on Access and Benefit Sharing notified by NBA in 2014.  The ABS Guidelines are in the process of revision by NBA, based on the experience gained so far and consultations with stakeholders.  The draft of the revised ABS Guidelines prepared by a Committee constituted for this purpose was posted on NBA’s website on 24.4.2019 for public comments. The next steps inter alia include : examination of the comments received, consultations with stakeholders, and requisite approvals.  The revised Guidelines on ABS are expected to be notified within a year.********
