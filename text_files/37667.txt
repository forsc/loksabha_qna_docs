                                                        Minister of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Jyotiraditya M. Scindia)(a) & (b):  A statement is laid on the Table of the House.;STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 408 REGARDING "OPERATION OF FLIGHTS ON NEW ROUTES" TO BE ANSWERED ON 31.03.2022;  (a) & (b): Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)- UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21-10-2016 to enhance regional air connectivity from unserved and underserved airports in the country and making air travel affordable to the masses. UDAN is a market driven scheme. Interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes, submit their proposals at the time of bidding under UDAN. Airports Authority of India(AAI), the Implementing Agency, has awarded 948 valid routes to Selected Airline Operators(SAOs) across the length and breadth of the country.  SAOs have operationalized 415 RCS routes under the Scheme as on 27.03.2022.; ; The airlines have filed a schedule to commence 135 new domestic routes (including UDAN and other routes) in the Summer Schedule 2022 w.e.f. 27.03.2022. Further, with the repeal of the Air Corporation Act,1953, in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation market was deregulated. Consequently, airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type for selecting whatever markets and networks they wish to service and operate across the country. Thus, it is up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and their commercial viability, in compliance with the relevant guidelines in this matter.
