RAM SHANKAR KATHERIA TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 04.12.2019 REGARDING HIGH FARE IN RAILWAYS(a): Yes, Sir. Certain representations comparing airfare with railway fare have been received. It is informed that Railways and Airlines are different modes of transport, which are not comparable in the terms of volume, connectivity as well as convenience. There is no fixed maximum limit of fare in Airlines whereas Railways have fixed maximum fare throughout the year. Airline fare varies significantly depending on time of operation, stoppages, travel duration, Origin – Destination pair, carrier etc. Railways’ fare may or may not be higher than the air fare depending upon the class of travel as well as factors like peak/lean periods. (b) & (c): In accordance with the Ministry of Finance’ instructions on Travelling Allowance/Daily Allowance, as adopted by the Ministry of Railways, Railway officers of the pay level 14 and above in the 7th CPC Pay Matrix are already entitled to travel by Air on duty. Railway Officers below pay level 14 are also allowed to travel by air on duty, in certain exigencies and with prior finance concurrence. Further, in terms of instructions issued post 7th CPC based on acceptance of recommendations of the 7th CPC by the Government and as per entitlement to Air Travel laid down by the Ministry of Railways, Railway Officers of pay level 9 and above have also been allowed to travel by air while availing LTC once in a block of 04 years on surrender of all Privilege Passes for that year.(d): The revenue from Passenger Services during the last three financial years is as under:                                                                                  (? in Crore)Year  	                                     2016-17	    2017-18	 2018-19Passenger service	                      46280.46	    48643.14	 51066.65*****
