ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION (SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’) (a)	to (c): The National Education Policy (NEP) envisages that the nutrition and health (including mental health) of children will be addressed, through healthy meals and the introduction of well-trained social workers, counsellors, and community involvement into the schooling system. Furthermore, research shows that the morning hours after a nutritious breakfast can be particularly productive for the study of cognitively more demanding subjects and hence these hours may be leveraged by providing a simple but energizing breakfast in addition to midday meals.  In locations where hot meals are not possible, a simple but nutritious meal, e.g., groundnuts/ chana mixed with jaggery and/or local fruits may be provided.(d): Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDMS) is implemented all over the country successfully.  During 2019-20, 11.80 crore children are enrolled in 11.20 lakh schools under the scheme.  *****
