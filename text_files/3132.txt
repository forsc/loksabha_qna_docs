ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a)	At present, there are 36 Passport Offices in the country as on 04 July, 2019 including three in Maharashtra. The list is at Annexure-I. There are 505 Passport Kendras functioning in the country as on 04 July, 2019 as extended arms of these 36 Passport Offices. The list is at Annexure-II.(b)	The number of passport and passport related applications received in these 36 Passport Offices during the period January-May, 2019 is at Annexure-III.(c) & (d) 	In its Citizens’ Charter, the Ministry is committed to issue a fresh passport in ‘Normal’ Category within 30 working days (excluding PV). In case of re-issue of an ordinary passport, the Ministry is committed to issue it within 7 working days in cases where pre-police verification is not required and within 30 working days (excluding PV) in cases where PV is required. 	The average time taken to issue a passport during January-June 2019 is 11 days (excluding PV) in ‘Normal’ Category. It can thus be seen that there is no delay in issuing passports. However, at times, the process of issuance of passports gets delayed due to the following reasons:i. Late receipt of police verification reports;ii. Receipt of incomplete police reports; andiii. Late submission of requisite documents by the applicants.
