ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a): Due to increased demand of power, less power generation by imported coal based power plants and some interruption in supply of coal due to heavy rains, the coal stock at the power plants depleted to 7.2 Million Tonne (MT) (sufficient for 4 days) as on 8th October, 2021.  Subsequently with increased coal supplies,  the coal stock has started increasing and has now reached 16.74 MT (sufficient for 9 days) as on 25.11.2021.  Coal India Limited (CIL) has dispatched around 54 Million Tonnes (MT)  more coal during April - October’21 in comparison to the same period of last year. CIL has dispatched 291.72 MT coal during this period, against 237.75 MT during the same period of last fiscal.The month-wise gap between Energy Requirement and Energy Supplied in the country has varied from 0.3% to 1.1%  only during the year 2021-22 (April-October). However, even this gap is generally on account of factors other than inadequacy of coal availability in the country e.g. constraints in distribution network, financial constraints, commercial reasons, forced outage of generating units etc. (b):  The state-wise details of coal receipt and consumption in the power plants during 2020-21 (Apr-Sep) is as under:-  	Figs. in Thousand TonnesApril-Sep, 2021Name of the State	Coal Receipt 	Coal Consumption Haryana	5170	6811Punjab	6852	7656Rajasthan	9055	9553Uttar Pradesh	41178	44589Chhattisgarh	50596	53695Gujarat	13916	13282Madhya Pradesh	37942	40289Maharashtra	35163	36771Andhra Pradesh	17561	18028Karnataka	7348	7730Tamil Nadu	15854	15816Telangana	15173	15424Bihar	13412	14466Jharkhand	8025	9137Odisha	21565	22432West Bengal	24314	26764Assam	1076	1208TOTAL	324200	343651 (c) & (d): In order to maintain adequate coal stock with power plants, various steps have been taken by the Government which are as under:i. In order to address the issues of coal supplies to power sector, an Inter-Ministerial Sub-Group comprising of representatives from Ministry of Power, Ministry of Coal, Ministry of Railways, Central Electricity Authority (CEA), CIL and SCCL meet regularly to take various operational decisions to enhance supply of coal to thermal power plants as well as for meeting any contingent situations relating to power sector including critical coal stock position in power plants. ii. CIL had offered about 5.2 MT of additional coal from its various subsidiaries to States, Central Gencos for lifting through RCR/ Road Mode. iii. In addition to Annual Contracted Quantity (ACQ), coal has been offered under RCR mode on ‘as is where basis’ to build up stock at Power house end is. iv.  The Ministry of Coal has amended Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 with a view to encourage domestic coal production enhancement from captive mines by allowing sale of coal or lignite, on payment of additional amount, by the lessee of a captive mine up to 50 percent of the total coal or lignite produced in a financial year, after meeting the requirement of the end use plant linked with the mine. Earlier this year, the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation)  Act had been amended to this effect. This is applicable for both the private and public sector captive mines. With this amendment, the Government has paved the way for releasing of additional coal in the market by greater utilization of mining capacities of captive coal and lignite blocks,which were being only partly utilized owing to limited production of coal for meeting their captive needs.*****
