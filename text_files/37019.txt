                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI GIRIRAJ SINGH)(a) to (e): A statement is laid on the Table of the House.  Statement referred in reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question  No.378*  on ‘Status of SAGY’ scheduled for answer on 29 March 2022(a) to (d): No, there is continuous and progressive development of the identified Gram Panchayats (GPs) under Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY). The GPs prepare Village Development Plan (VDP) in which the proposed activities are implemented through convergence of various schemes of Government of India and State schemes. As per latest data on scheme portal (https://saanjhi.gov.in), Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) Gram Panchayats have been  successful in completing the implementation of 58,228 projects (60%) out of the 96,996 projects planned under Village Development Plans (VDP).As per the data available on the scheme portal, the major schemes that have contributed to the VDP activities are given in Annexure-I. The State, district, village and year-wise progress, including Andhra Pradesh and Telangana progress of VDP can be seen at www.saanjhi.gov.in. Information on expenditure incurred to carry out the activities proposed under VDP under different State and Central schemes are not maintained centrally in the MIS of the portal since no funds are  released for this programme from the Centre. The resource envelope available for GPs includes schemes of Government of India, State schemes, partnership with private, voluntary and cooperative (PVC) sectors, Gram Panchayats’ own revenue, resources mobilized in kind and labour and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds. (e) : Yes, States/UTs send their suggestions to the Union Government time to time. These suggestions are discussed in the National Level Committee on SAGY headed by the Secretary, Rural Development, with representatives of line Ministries/Departments periodically to initiate remedial action where necessary including changes in the guidelines of respective schemes/ programmes. Accordingly, 17 Ministries/Departments have amended and/ or have issued advisories to  States/ UTs to accord priority to SAGY GPs. The details of these ministries/departments along with the list of schemes is given in Annexure II ******
