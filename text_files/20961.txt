Codification of the Labour Laws will inter alia reduce multiplicity of definitions & authorities facilitate implementation & use of technology in enforcement of labour laws and bring transparency & accountability in enforcement which would promote setting up of more enterprises, thus catalysing the creation of employment opportunities in the country.  It will also promote setting up of industries by reducing rigidity of labour market and facilitate hassle free compliance. (b): No such data is maintained centrally. However, number of contract labour covered through licensed contractors under Contract Labour (Regulation & Abolition) Act, 1970 in the year 2019 is 22,54,732 in Central Sphere establishments in private and public sector.(c): Government has taken a number of initiatives under Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan to support the MSME Sector to create direct/ indirect employment in the country especially in the situation after  Covid-19 pandemic.

VI.	No global tenders for procurement up to Rs. 200 crores, this will help MSME. RBI has also announced several measures to reduce financial stress of MSMEs.Ministry of MSME is implementing Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), which is a major credit-linked subsidy programme aimed at generating self-employment opportunities through establishment of micro-enterprises in the non-farm sector by helping traditional artisans and unemployed youth.Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rozgar Yojana (ABRY) Scheme has been launched by the Government to incentivize creation of new employment along with social security benefits and restoration of loss of employment during COVID-19 pandemic. This scheme being implemented through the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), reduces the financial burden of the employers of various sectors/industries including MSMEs and encourages them to hire more workers. Under ABRY, Government of India is crediting for a period of two years,  both the employees’ share (12% of wages) and employers’ share (12% of wages) of contribution payable or only the employees’ share, depending on employment strength of the EPFO registered establishments.(d): The total number of persons employed in Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) for the last three years, as per data available, is given below:Year	Employment in CPSEs2017	15,03,0932018	15,54,9672019	15,14,064*****
