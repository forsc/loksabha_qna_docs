ANSWER




                                                        a) and (b): Yes, Sir. The government is very focussed on its important objective of building the overall semiconductor ecosystem and ensure that, it in-turn catalyses India’s rapidly expanding electronics manufacturing and innovation ecosystem. This vision of AtmaNirbharta in electronics & semiconductors was given further momentum by the Union Cabinet chaired by the Hon’ble Prime Minister approving the Semicon India programme with a total outlay of INR 76,000 crore for the development of semiconductor and display manufacturing ecosystem in our country. The programme aims to provide financial support to companies investing in semiconductors, display manufacturing and design ecosystem. This will serve to pave the way for India’s growing presence in the global electronics value chains.Following four schemes have been introduced under the aforesaid programme: i.	Scheme for setting up of Semiconductor Fabs in India provides fiscal support to eligible applicants for setting up of Semiconductor Fabs which is aimed at attracting large investments for setting up semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities in the country. Following fiscal support has been approved under the scheme: •	28nm or Lower - Up to 50% of the Project Cost•	Above 28 nm to 45nm - Up to 40% of the Project Cost•	Above 45 nm to 65nm - Up to 30% of the Project Costii.	Scheme for setting up of Display Fabs in India provides fiscal support to eligible applicants for setting up of Display Fabs which is aimed at attracting large investments for setting up TFT LCD / AMOLED based display fabrication facilities in the country. The Scheme provides fiscal support of up to 50% of Project Cost subject to a ceiling of INR 12,000 crore per Fab.iii.	Scheme for setting up of Compound Semiconductors / Silicon Photonics / Sensors Fab and Semiconductor Assembly, Testing, Marking and Packaging (ATMP) / OSAT facilities in India: The Scheme provides a fiscal support of 30% of the Capital Expenditure to the eligible applicants for setting up of Compound Semiconductors / Silicon Photonics (SiPh) / Sensors (including MEMS) Fab and Semiconductor ATMP / OSAT facilities in India. iv.	Design Linked Incentive (DLI) Scheme offers financial incentives, design infrastructure support across various stages of development and deployment of semiconductor design for Integrated Circuits (ICs), Chipsets, System on Chips (SoCs), Systems & IP Cores and semiconductor linked design. The scheme provides “Product Design Linked Incentive” of up to 50% of the eligible expenditure subject to a ceiling of ?15 Crore per application and “Deployment Linked Incentive” of 6% to 4% of net sales turnover over 5 years subject to a ceiling of ?30 Crore per application.In addition to the above schemes, Government has also approved modernisation of Semi-Conductor Laboratory, Mohali as a brownfield Fab.(c) and (d): Yes, Sir. Cabinet approval is also granted for setting up of India Semiconductor Mission (ISM) as an Independent Business Division within Digital India Corporation having administrative and financial autonomy to drive India’s strategies for developing semiconductors and display manufacturing ecosystem. Envisioned to be led by global experts in the Semiconductor and Display industry, ISM will serve as the nodal agency for efficient, coherent and smooth implementation of the schemes. (e) and (f): Yes Sir. The Semicon India program is expected to usher a new era in electronics manufacturing by providing a globally competitive incentive package to companies engaged in semiconductors and display manufacturing. Semiconductors are key to the ''must-win'' technologies of the future, including artificial intelligence and 5G, which will be essential to achieving the goal of a ''dynamic, inclusive and innovative economy'' identified as a critical national advantage. In addition, the advanced autonomous systems, cyber security, space and hypersonics, and directed energy are also dependent on semiconductor technologies.The Semicon India programme provides fiscal support for all the major stages of semiconductor production: design, semiconductor fabs, display fabs, specialisedfabs for compound semiconductors, silicon photonics and sensors, Assembly, Testing, Marking and Packaging (ATMP) units etc.(g): Steps taken by the Government for making India a global hub for Electronics System Design & Manufacturing (ESDM):1.	National Policy on Electronics 2019: The National Policy on Electronics 2019 (NPE 2019) has been notified on 25.02.2019. The vision of NPE 2019 is to position India as a global hub for Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) by encouraging and driving capabilities in the country for developing core components, including chipsets, and creating an enabling environment for the industry to compete globally.2.	100% FDI: As per extant Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy, FDI up-to 100% under the automatic route is permitted for electronics manufacturing (except from countries sharing land border with India), subject to applicable laws / regulations; security and other conditions.3.	Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC) Scheme: Electronics Manufacturing Clusters Scheme was notified on 22nd October, 2012 to provide support for creation of world-class infrastructure along with common facilities and amenities for attracting investment. Under the Scheme, 19 Greenfield EMCs and 3 Common Facility Centres (CFCs) measuring an area of 3,464 acres with total project cost of INR 3,762 crore including Government Grant-in-Aid of INR 1,538 crore have been approved.4.	Electronics Development Fund (EDF): Electronics Development Fund (EDF) has been set up as a “Fund of Funds” to participate in professionally managed “Daughter Funds” which in turn will provide risk capital to startups and companies developing new technologies in the area of electronics and Information Technology (IT). This fund is expected to foster R&D and innovation in these technology sectors. INR 409 crore has been committed through EDF to 9 Daughter Funds with a targeted corpus of INR 2,626 crore.5.	Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP) has been notified to promote domestic value addition in mobile phones and their sub-assemblies / parts manufacturing. As a result, India has rapidly started attracting investments into this sector and significant manufacturing capacities have been set up in the country. The manufacturing of mobile phones has been steadily moving from Semi Knocked Down (SKD) to Completely Knocked Down (CKD) level, thereby progressively increasing the domestic value addition. 6.
