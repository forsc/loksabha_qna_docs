ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) The total number of the members of registered and functional Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) in various parts of the country as on date is approximately 31 lakhs.(b) and (c) The subject “Local Government”, of which the PRIs are part of, is the subject-matter of States’ power to legislate under the Constitution.  The role and powers of PRIs in the State depend on the devolution made by the States/ Union Territories to the PRIs. Accordingly the functions of Panchayats pertaining to planning and implementation of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) vary from State to State. Among the major CSSs, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pradhan Manti Awaas Yojana and National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), Swatch Bharat Abhiyan, Panchayats have significant roles and responsibilities.(d) The Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) has been taking steps through its Schemes and Programmes to strengthen the PRIs in the States and Union Territories, through provisioning of financial and technical assistance. The measures taken by MoPR include advocacy and advisories to the States to devolve more functions, funds and functionaries to Panchayats, providing financial and technical assistance for capacity building of Panchayats to enable them to perform effectively and efficiently, strengthening systems of budgeting, accounting and auditing, assist in deployment of Information Technology applications for enhancing transparency, accountability and efficiency of PRIs. Further a modality of Incentivisation to PRIs has been put in place to reward good performance in PRIs, as well as tools are provided to the States to formulate, bring about convergence  in the Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDP). (e) and (f) Presently, no such proposal is under Consideration. However, FFC grants are being distributed directly to Gram Panchayats by Govt. of India.(g) Government of India has put in place a Public Finance Management System (PFMS) for efficient fund flow and expenditure management network.  The Fourteenth Finance Commission (FFC) grants for Gram Panchayats (GPs) are released to the State Governments through Public Finance Management System (PFMS) for onward digital transfer to the accounts of GPs within 15 days of its receipt. In case of delay beyond 15 days, the State Government has to pay penal interest from its own funds at the Reserve Bank of India rate to the GPs. ********
