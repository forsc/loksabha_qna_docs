Selection of RO dealer is done through public advertisement released by Public Sector OMCs followed by online process of draw of lots from eligible applicants maintaining full transparency and minimum human interference. The applications so received against the advertisement are processed in line with laid down procedures. Detailed Norms/Criteria for allotment of RO dealerships in the country are available at www.petrolpumpdealerchayan.in. Complaints received with regard to corruption in allocation of petrol pumps against officials of Public Sector OMCs, if any, are investigated and if found established suitable action is taken against concerned as per policy of the Public Sector OMCs. As on 1.3.2022, there are 82176 ROs operational by both Public and private sector across the length & breadth of the country. Expansion of ROs sales network by Public Sector OMCs throughout the country is a continuous process to ensure adequate availability of fuels like petrol and diesel. State-wise number of PSU OMCs’ petrol pumps operational in the country as on 1.3.2022 is given at Annexure.  ****
