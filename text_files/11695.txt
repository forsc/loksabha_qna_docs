ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (d)	According to latest publicly available statistics of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), 168,600 initial or new H-1B petitions were processed and completed in Fiscal Year 2019, out of which 35,633 petitions accounting for about 21.1% were denied. The share of Indian nationals in total H-1B visas has, however, remained stable at around 70% between Fiscal Years 2015 and 2018.The H-1B visa application process has become more complex for employers worldwide, due to certain recent administrative changes in the H-1B programme which have increased documentation requirements on the petitioners. These changes have impacted the processing of H-1B petitions in general, entailing a higher level of scrutiny.(e)	Government of India has closely consulted all stakeholders and engaged with the U.S. Administration and Congress on issues related to the movement of Indian professionals, including those pertaining to the H-1B programme. These issues were raised by External Affairs Minister with his U.S. counterpart in New Delhi in June 2019 and with U.S. interlocutors in Washington D.C. in September/October 2019 and December 2019. In our engagements, we have emphasized that this has been a mutually-beneficial partnership which should be nurtured.
