ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) and (b)  Government is aware of the issue of emissions from in-use diesel generator sets. Upgradation of in-use diesel generator for emission control requires installation of Retro-fit Emission Control Devices (RECD). For this purpose, RECD must be type approved from Certification Agencies as per System & Procedure.  As on date, there is no type approved RECD.Government has taken following steps to ensure speedy up gradation: i.	MoEFCC notified emission norms for diesel generator set engines vide GSR 771E dated 11.12.2013 under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.ii.	Central pollution Control Board (CPCB) is the Nodal Agency for coordination and implementation of provision of said GSR related to control of emissions from DG sets of capacity less than 800 KWs at manufacturing stage.iii.	Central pollution Control Board (CPCB) has constituted a Standing Committee comprising of national level experts and stake-holders to look into matters pertaining to enforcement of Diesel Generator (DG) set emission rules.iv.	A dedicated Sub-Committee has been constituted for development of Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for RECD. This Sub-Committee is headed by Head of R&D Division of Indian Oil Corporation, Faridabad and members from Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), International Centre for Automotive Technology (ICAT), Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP), Indian Diesel Engine Manufacturers Association (IDEMA), Maharashtra SPCB, Tamil Nadu SPCB, Uttar Pradesh SPCB and CPCB. v.	The System & Procedure for Testing of RECD had been put up on CPCB web site for inviting suggestion(s). The suggestions received so far have been examined by the Sub-committee for finalization of System & Procedure.Government has awarded a pilot study to ICAT to assess baseline emissions from in-use DG sets having capacity less than 800 KW and to also assess the efficacy of RECD.*****
