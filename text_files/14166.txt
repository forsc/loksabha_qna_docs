                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c)	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2935 BY SHRI UDAY PRATAP SINGH TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 11.03.2020 REGARDING ROBs/RUBs IN MADHYA PRADESH(a) 	Railway Electrification projects are not confined to District/State/Union Territories (UT).  However, Total 11 Railway Electrification projects falling fully/partly in the state of Madhya Pradesh covering length of 1,500 km & costing `1,195 crore have been sanctioned during last three years i.e. 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19.  45 Road Over Bridges (ROBs) and 75 Road Under Bridges (RUBs) have been sanctioned during last three years.(b) 	As per Pink Book, 94 ROBs and 289 RUBs sanctioned in the State of Madhya Pradesh. Out of 94 ROBs, 10 ROBs have been fully completed and 7 ROBs in Railway portion has been completed, and remaining ROBs are various stages of planning, estimation & execution. Out of 289 RUBs, 211 RUBs completed. For remaining 78, effort is being made to expedite these works as far as possible.(c)	Normally, Railway undertakes construction of ROBs in Railway portion whereas approaches are being constructed by State Government.  Generally, there is no problem of construction of ROBs in Railway portion.  However, it is difficult to construct ROBs on approaches on non Railway land as it depends upon many factors such as availability of land, removal of encroachments, fixing the alignment of approaches, allocation of requisite funds etc.  Therefore, it is not possible to fix the time schedule for construction of ROB projects. The following steps have been taken by Railways to expedite the commencement and execution of such project:•	Joint survey with all concerned including State Government to finalise the tentative General Arrangement Drawing (GAD).•	Standardization of drawings for various spans to avoid delay.•	Nomination of nodal officer for each State for single window clearance of GAD from Railway side.•	Commissioned a web-based application with user-friendly features for online submission and approval of various plans and drawings related to ROBs/RUBs of State/National Highways Authority of India (NHAI)/Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH). *****
