                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TRIBAL AFFAIRS(SMT. RENUKA SINGH SARUTA)   (a) & (b):         Tribes constitute a distinct social category.

It enables Autonomous District Councils and Regional Councils to be constituted in those areas with a fair amount of legislative and executive powers.•	To ensure effective participation of the tribals in the process of planning and decision- making, the 73rd Amendment of the Constitution have been extended to the Scheduled Areas through the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996.(ii)        Important Acts related to Scheduled Tribes•	Forest Rights Act 2006 [with Rules (Including 2012 Amendment) and Guidelines] administered by Ministry of Tribal Affairs.•	Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 administered by Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.•	Protection of Civil Right Rules, 1977 administered by Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.•	The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995 as amended from time to time administered by Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.•	The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 administered by Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.•	.

There are many other Acts and guidelines administered by various Central Ministries and Departments which have specific provisions to safeguard the interest of STs in the country including reservation in admission, protection of habitat, development of tribal region etc. Ministry of Tribal Affairs holds meeting with sectoral Ministries from time to time.  Further, a “Joint Communication” has been signed by Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Tribal Affairs addressed to all Chief Secretaries of States/UTs, pertaining to more effective implementation of the Forest Rights Act(FRA), 2006 and for harnessing the potential for livelihood improvement of the Forest Dwelling Scheduled Tribes (FDSTs) and other Traditional Forest Dwellers (OTFDs). Funds are provided to States based on their demand for awareness generation regarding effective implementation of Forest Rights Act, 2006. MoTA is implementing a scheme ‘Mechanism for Marketing of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) through Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Development of Value Chain for MFP’, which is aimed at elimination of middleman through providing MSP to MFPs. Further, under the Scheme, the concept of establishment of Vandhan Vikas Kendra has been conceived to tap into the traditional knowledge and skill sets of tribal people by adding technology and Information Technology for upgradation of output at each stage and protecting the gains of their labour and knowledge which are otherwise reaped by the long chain of middlemen.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), constituted under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) remain vigilant against any such possibility in violation of existing safeguards as per constitutional and legal framework in the country.(c):       Yes, sir.   Minor Forest Produce (MFP) is a significant source of livelihood for tribals living in forest areas. Forest dwellers depend on MFPs for food, shelter, medicines and cash income. It provides them critical subsistence during the lean seasons, particularly for primitive tribal groups such as hunter gatherers, and the landless. Van Dhan Vikas Karyakram, an initiative under the Scheme ‘Mechanism for Marketing of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) through Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Development of Value Chain for MFP’, targets livelihood generation for tribals by harnessing the wealth of forest i.e. Van Dhan. Under this programme, tribal community owned Minor Forest Produce centric multi-purpose Kendras are set up through Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India (TRIFED) in the districts with significant tribal population. The Kendras acts as common facility centres for procurement cum value addition to locally available Minor Forest Produce. Value addition of raw produce helps increasing the value of the MFP considerably and consequently the income of the gatherers. State-wise details of Van Dhan Vikas Kendras established in the country is given at Annexure I. Moreover, the Scheduled Tribes And Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition Of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) recognizes the rights of the forest dwelling tribal communities and other traditional forest dwellers to forest resources, on which these communities were dependent for a variety of needs, including livelihood, habitation and other socio-cultural needs. The Ministry notifies the implementation report on FRA every month to PMO, Cabinet Secretariat and NITI Aayog and the latest implementation status (Monthly Progress Report) notified by the Ministry (ending February, 2021) is given at Annexure 2. A list showing latest position of receipt of Monthly Progress Reports (MPR) on implementation of FRA 2006 furnished by the State Governments as on date i.e. 7.8.2021 is given at Annexure 3.
