                                                        MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. *** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) to (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 292 BY DR. KALANIDHI VEERASWAMY; SHRIMATI APARAJITA SARANGI REGARDING “CARBON EMISSIONS”. (a)	India has ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which is the primary multilateral treaty governing actions to combat climate change through adaptation and mitigation efforts directed at control of emission of Green House Gases (GHGs) that cause global warming. The Parties under the Convention submit their National Communication and Biennial Update Report (BUR) to the UNFCCC. Based on countries submission, the UNFCCC Secretariat does not undertake any ranking on their carbon emissions. According to India’s second Biennial Update Report (BUR) submitted to UNFCCC in December 2018, the per capita GHG emission in India was 1.8 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent and net GHG emission was 2.306 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The total CO2 emission with Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) was1.69 billion tonnes and per capita emission of CO2 was approximately 1.3 tonnes in 2014. However, India’s share in cumulative historical global greenhouse gas emissions is only about 3 percent and India’s per capita emissions are just about one-third of global average. According to the Global Carbon budgets and Equity in Climate Change, published in 2010, the historical carbon spaces occupied by various countries in 2009 (with 1850 as base year) are: USA: 29%; other Developed countries: 45%; China: 10% and India: 3%. India’s contribution to the problem of climate change is limited but its actions are fair and ambitious.(b) and (c) Under the Paris Agreement, India has submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to UNFCCC to reduce the emission intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level. It has envisaged achieving about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030 with the help of transfer of technology and low cost international finance including from Green Climate Fund (GCF) and create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. (d) The intended actions focus on country’s policies and programs on promotion of renewable energy; enhancement of energy efficiency; development of less carbon intensive, resilient urban centers; promotion of waste to energy; safe, smart and sustainable green transportation network; abatement of pollution; and efforts to enhance carbon sink through creation of forest and tree cover. A reduction in emission intensity of GDP by 21% over 2005-2014 has already been achieved. Further, Government is implementing National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which provides an overarching policy framework for climate actionsin the country with eight Missions-(i) National Solar Mission (ii) National Mission on Enhanced Energy Efficiency (iii) National Water Mission (iv) National Mission on Sustainable Habitat (v) National Mission on Sustaining Himalayan Ecosystem (vi) National Green India Mission (vii) National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture and (viii) National Mission on Strategic Knowledge on Climate Change. To support the objectives of NAPCC, 33 States and Union Territories have already prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) to address State specific actions. In addition, the Government has also established the National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC) to support climate adaptation actions of States and Union Territories in the country.		****
