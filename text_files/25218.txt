ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) to (b): The data on employment/ unemployment is being collected through Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) conducted by National Statistical Office (NSO), Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation (MOSPI) since 2017-18. The survey provides indicators for the employment/ unemployment scenario in the country including for women.  As per the results of PLFS conducted during 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20, the estimated Female Worker Population Ratio (WPR) on usual status (ps+ss) for 15 years and above is 22%, 23.3% and 28.7%, respectively.Government has taken various steps to improve women’s participation in the labour force and quality of their employment. A number of protective provisions have been incorporated in the labour laws for equal opportunity and congenial work environment for women workers. These includes enhancement in paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks, provision for mandatory crèche facility in the establishments having 50 or more employees, permitting women workers in the night shifts with adequate safety measures, etc. Employment of women in the aboveground mines including opencast workings has been allowed between 7 pm and 6 am, and in below ground working between 6 am and 7 pm in technical, supervisory and managerial work where continuous presence may not be required. The Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 now subsumed in the Code on Wages, 2019 provides that there shall be no discrimination in an establishment or any unit thereof among employees on the ground of gender in matters relating to wages by the same employer, in respect of the same work or work of similar nature done by any employee. Further, no employer shall make any discrimination on the ground of sex while recruiting any employee for the same work or work of similar nature in the conditions of employment, except where the employment of women in such work is prohibited or restricted by or under any law for the time being in force. To enhance the employability of female workers, the Government is providing training to them through a network of Women Industrial Training institutes, National Vocational Training Institutes and Regional Vocational Training Institutes. National Career Service (NCS) Project provides a variety of employment related services like job search, job matching, career counseling, vocational guidance, information on skill development courses etc. on a common platform with efficient use of information technology.   In order to promote women empowerment and to encourage skilling and employment amongst females, NCS provides various opportunities and features specifically focused for women candidates.All these provisions/ initiatives help in fulfilling objectives under the G20 Brisbane Goal and the G20 Roadmap Towards and Beyond the Brisbane Target as well.*****
