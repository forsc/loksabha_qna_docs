The Government has taken appropriate action by way of tariff and non-tariff measures to regulate import of goods to protect human, animal and plant health and uphold other national interests. Appropriate use of trade remedies by way of safeguard, countervailing and anti-dumping duties have been used to protect our industry from unfair trade practices adopted by trading partners. Government has made certain changes in the FDI policy and public procurement policy to safeguard the national interest. To support and expand domestic capacities, Government has implemented policies to promote domestic manufacturing through ease of doing business in line with the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat.The full impact of these promotional measures on the industry will be discernible as the global economy recovers. ******
