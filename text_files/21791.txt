A programme to support development of Poshan Vatikas at Anganwadi centres to meet dietary diversity gap by leveraging traditional knowledge in nutritional practices has also been taken up. Local affordable recipes are given to beneficiaries. Therapeutic food is not allowed. Reviews by Chief Medical Officer especially with regards to severely malnourished children (SAM) for their identification and treatment have brought down SAM numbers.
