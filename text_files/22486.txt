ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND PENSIONS AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a) to (c):  Citizen Satisfaction is paramount to the Government as far as grievance redressal system is concerned.  To evaluate quality of disposal a feedback mechanism is available in CPGRAMS.  The citizen gets an intimation on email/SMS as soon as his grievance is disposed of.  The citizen has the option of feedback in the portal regarding quality of grievance redressal.  Sometimes random phone calls are also made to the citizen to find out status of their grievances and their satisfaction with disposal.  An appeal facility has also been created in CPGRAMS where citizen can make an appeal to the next higher authority if he/she is not satisfied with the reply of the grievance officer.  DARPG also engaged BSNL to measure citizen satisfaction on the grievances disposed of during 30/3/2020 to 30/5/2020 under COVID-19 category in CPGRAMS.  The Directorate of Public Grievances in the Cabinet Secretariat has a mechanism to entertain representation from public who are not satisfied with the responses received from the Ministries/Departments in the Government of India.*****
