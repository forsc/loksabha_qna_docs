                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)&(b)	Methyl Isocyanate is ‘regulated’ under the provisions of Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals Rules, 1989 (MSIHC Rules, 1989) and the Chemical Accident (Emergency Planning, Preparedness and Response) Rules, 1996 (CAEPPR Rules, 1996). Therefore, no proposal to ban the chemical is under consideration of the Central Government.(c) Based on the information provided by the Chief Inspector of Factories (CIFs) of various State Governments/ Union Territories, 119 major/ minor chemical accidents had occurred in past 3 years.(d) To address the environmental pollution and safety related aspects, the establishment and operation of chemicals industries is regulated under the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986; the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974; the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991. Further, in order to ensure proper management of chemicals in the country, Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals (DCPC) has decided to draft Chemical (Safety and Management) Rules under the Environment Protection Act, 1986. A Technical Committee has been constituted under the Chairmanship of Joint Secretary (Chemicals) to finalise the outline, scope, coverage and extent of proposed rules. (e) The DCPC has formulated a ‘Vision Document 2024’. The initiatives included in this document and proposed actions are in line with the objectives of National Chemical Policy. The DCPC has also formulated the ‘National Petrochemical Policy 2007’. DCPC has, accordingly, decided that there is no need for a separate National Chemical Policy.*****
