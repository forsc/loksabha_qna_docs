ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c) Survey for new railway line from Mahasamund to Bargarh via Pithora-Saraipali(180.12km) has been completed in 2016-17. As per the survey report, cost assessed was approx. ?1904 crore with negative rate of return of 2.74%. The project being financially unviable, could not be taken forward. However, both Mahasamund and Bargarh stations are connected via Titlagarh. Also in the vicinity of the proposed alignment, the doubling works of Sambalpur-Bargarh-Titlagarh and Titlagarh-Mahasamund-Raipur have been taken up  which can take care of additional traffic of the area.  *****
