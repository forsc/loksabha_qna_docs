                                                    (a) the number of spinning mills across the country, State-wise including Maharashtra; (b) the number of such spinning mills set up/ operational that have been shut down along with the reasons for closure;(c) the details of the schemes of Government to revive the closed and sick spinning mills across the country and the impact of such schemes along with the status of revival of such mills; and(d) the total number of skilled and unskilled labourers retrenched due to closure of spinning mills and the steps taken by the concerned State Governments and the Union Government in this regard? 






ANSWER




MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) & (b):	As on 31.10.2020, there are 1241 operational and 563 inoperative/closed spinning mills in the country. The details of State-wise number of operational and closed mills are at Annexure- I.  Closure of most of the mills took place before 2015.(c):	There is no specific scheme for revival of closed spinning mills.  Some of the mills are closed due to poor obsolete technology which cannot compete with modern spinning mills.  There is surplus modernized spinning capacity in the country and Govt. is now focusing on creating similar modern weaving, processing and garment production capacity in the country, which has more employment creation potential.  To this objective Govt. is implementing Amended Technology Up-gradation Scheme (ATUFS), Integrated Processing Development Scheme (IPDS), Scheme for Integrated Textile Park (SITP) and other Schemes like Technology Mission on Technical Textile (TMTT). (d): 	As informed by M/o Labour & Employment, the Labour Bureau is not collecting information on skilled & unskilled workers for such textiles mills.
