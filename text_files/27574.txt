ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF TEXTILES  (SMT. DARSHANA JARDOSH)(a) & (b):	The Government has promulgated the Handlooms (Reservation of Articles for Production) Act, 1985 with a view to protect the interest of handlooms weavers and rich cultural heritage of the country from the encroachment of the powerloom and mill sector on their livelihood.    11 textiles articles with certain technical specifications are exclusively reserved for production on handlooms. Whenever violation of the Act comes to the notice of the Government, appropriate action as per the provisions of the Act is taken. Central and State Government Implementing Agencies conduct inspections of powerlooms units all over India to ensure that no items reserved for production on handlooms are produced by powerlooms. Any violation is reported for action under the provisions of the Act. During the last three years implementing agencies have inspected 971163 powerlooms and lodged 166 FIRs.In addition, scope of the Scheme for implementation of the Handlooms (Reservation of Articles for Production) Act’ 1985 has been expanded to include identification of genuine handloom product, capacity building of Sate Govt. Enforcement Machinery; conduct of awareness programmes etc. in order to curb sale of fake handloom products in markets/expos. ***
