                                                    (a) the nodal district-wise details of availability of non-utilization of MPLAD funds by sitting as well as former MPs; (b) whether a huge difference between the amount according to the Central Government and the amount available in different districts has come to light particularly in Jharkhand and Karnataka; and (c) if so, the reasons therefor and the steps taken by the Government in this regard? 






ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING (RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a)  The details of MPLADS fund available in 418 nodal districts of Lok Sabha and 176 Nodal Districts of Rajya Sabha in respect of both sitting members as well as ex- MPs of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, as collected by the Ministry in November - December, 2020 is at annexure I & II respectively.     (b) and (c) There is a provisional difference between the amount of funds available in the accounts of Nodal Districts as per MPLADS web portal and the data collected by the Ministry directly from Nodal Districts / State Authorities including States of Jharkhand and Karnataka, and it is due to delayed updation of data by Nodal Districts on web portal. This provisional difference is reconciled as and when Nodal Districts update the data on the web portal. Further, in terms of Para 4.18 of the MPLADS Guidelines incorporated vide the Ministry’s Circular dated 03.01.2018, all District Authorities and Implementing Agencies have to mandatorily carry out expenditure under MPLAD Scheme using Expenditure, Advance and Transfer (EAT) module of Public Financial Management System (PFMS). Ministry has been pursuing for implementation of PFMS- EAT module and timely updation of data on the web portal with the nodal districts, so that there may not be likelihood of any difference in the details of the funds available in the district and PFMS report.                                                  ***
