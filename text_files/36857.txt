                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS                                                                   [RAO INDERJIT SINGH](a) to (c):  The broad framework for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been provided under Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act’), Schedule VII of the Act and Companies (CSR Policy) Rules, 2014. Section 135 of the Act mandates every company having net worth of Rs. 500 crore or more, or turnover of Rs. 1000 crore or more, or net profit of Rs. 5 crore or more during the immediately preceding financial year, to spend at least two per cent of the average net profits of the company made over immediately preceding three financial years towards CSR as per the CSR Policy of the Company. Schedule VII of the Act indicates the activities that can be undertaken as CSR. Under the Act, CSR is a Board driven process and the Board of the company is empowered to plan, decide, execute and monitor CSR activities based on the recommendations of its CSR Committee.Cond…2/- 2 –The CSR framework is disclosure based and CSR mandated companies are required to file details of CSR activities annually in the MCA21 registry. The corporate governance framework along with the existing legal provisions such as mandatory disclosures, accountability of the CSR Committee and the Board, provisions for statutory audit of accounts of the company etc. provide safeguards in this regard. As per the legal framework, in case a company spends less than the amount required to be spent under their CSR obligation, the Board is required to specify the reasons for not spending in the Board’s report and to treat the unspent CSR amount in the manner as prescribed in Section 135 (5) and (6) of the Act. The non-compliance of CSR provisions is a civil wrong w. e. f. 22nd January 2021. Whenever any violation of CSR provisions is reported, action against such non-compliant Companies is initiated as per provisions of the Act after due examination of records and following due process of law. All data related to CSR filed by companies in MCA21 registry, including data on expenditure incurred by Companies on CSR, is available in public domain at www.csr.gov.in. On the basis of the filings made by the companies in the MCA 21 registry, Development Sector-wise details of CSR funds spent by all the companies during the Financial Year (FY) 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 are at Annexure. The data for FY 2020-21 is subject to change as the levy of additional fees for the late filing has been relaxed till 15.03.2022. Further, filings for FY 2021-22 are required to be made only after the end of current financial year.******AnnexureANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3930 FOR 28.03.2022   (Data upto 31.12.2021) [Source: National CSR Data Portal]Development Sector-wise CSR Expenditure (in Rs.
