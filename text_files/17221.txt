ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a):  Yes Sir, the names of profit making and loss making mines under Coal India Limited in the State of Jharkhand are shown in Annexure-A & Annexure-B respectively.(b): List of mines of Coal India Limited closed due to completion of the extraction work in Jharkhand are as under:Sl. No.	Name of the Mine1	New Selected Dhori UG2	Ray Bachra UGList of mines of Coal India Limited likely to be closed down after completion of the extraction work in Jharkhand are as follows:Sl. No.	Name of the Mine1	Piparwar OCP2	Dakra OCP (c) Losses in production due to the abandoning/ closing down of above coal mines shall be compensated either by opening of new projects or increasing production capacity of running projects.  As such there will be no losses due to the abandoning/ closing down of these coal mines.(d)	The Ministry of Coal, Government of India formulated two scheme for the exploration i.e. (i) Promotional (Regional) Exploration (ii) Detailed Drilling in Non-CIL blocks. Further, 12 discontinued mines have also been identified by Coal India Limited for operationalization through Mine Operator cum Developer(MDO) model.(e)	A major ‘Transformative Idea’ taken up by CIL on a ‘Mission Mode’ is to engage Mine Operators with state-of-the-art-technology through global open tender for CIL mines”. This model is termed as MDO  for Development & Operation of CIL mines. 12 discontinued mines have been identified for operationalization through MDO model. CIL has also identified 15 new Projects to offer for operationalization through MDO model. CIL hasformulated and finalised 1 Bt coal production plan by the year 2023-24 in order to reduce demand supply gap and also to reduce non-essential import of coal in the country. In order to achieve the targeted production of 1 Bt coal, CIL has taken the following steps: •	Action is being taken to implement on-going projects in time bound manner to achieve targeted production as per schedule. Further the implementation of ongoing project is also expedited through regular meeting at highest levels at MoEF, MoR, State Governments and other regulatory bodies. The performances of these projects are being regularly monitored through MDMS Portal at CIL level.•	15 Greenfield Projects are identified with a Capacity of about 160 Mty to be operated by Mine Developer cum Operator mode. MDO will assist in faster mining operations, improving in operational efficiency, assist in continued supply of cheaper coal to power and reduction in import dependency.•	Surface Miners have been introduced in opencast mines in a big way to improve operational efficiency & to cater environmental needs. During FY 19-20, in CIL, around 45% of total coal production was through Surface miners and is likely to further increase in subsequent years.•	49 First Mile Connectivity projects are being planned in two phases. Out of these, 35 Projects in Phase-I are to be implemented by FY 2023-24 with a capacity of 406 Mt.•	CIL has planned to introduce State-of-the-Art technology in its mines. In UG mines, 15 CMs and 2 PSLW are currently in operation in 11 & 2 mines respectively. Another 26 nos. of CMs & 2 PSLW faces are envisaged to be introduced within 2023-24 as per draft PRs in 2019-20 of which 3 CMs are already deployed and set to induct 3 more CMs in the current FY. In OC mines, high capacity equipment like 240 Te dumper, 42 Cu. M shovel and Surface Miners have already been introduced in a few mega mines. Another 28 Surface Miners and 6 nos. 42 Cu. M shovel & 106 nos. 240 Te dumpers are to be introduced in the mines within 2023-24.•	Apart from the above initiatives, with sincere effort by coal producing companies manual loading method has been eliminated in all ug mines of CIL (except one mine of CCL) by introducing SDL/LHD loading in conjunction with belt conveyors.•	CIL has its stake in 7 Railway Infrastructure projects wherein investment is being done on Deposit basis and JVs. Two major Deposit work for single line viz. Tori-Shivpur and Jharsuguda-Barpali are complete and one viz. Lingraj connectivity is under final stages of construction. Work has already been taken up in four JVs namely CERL, CEWRL, MCRL and JCRL. Coal transportation has started on Tori-Shivpur and Jharsuguda-Barpali lineFurther, the following steps are taken by the Government to enhance domestic production/minimise imports from other countries: 1.         Constitution of an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) by Ministry of Coal on 29.05.2020 for the purpose of coal import substitution. The IMC is in continuous engagement with the member Ministries to suggest ways and means to reduce import of coal. 2.         Development of an Import Data System by Ministry of Coal to enable the Ministry to track the imports of coal. 3.         An online portal by Coal India Limited to register the requests of coal consumers willing for import substitution of coal. 4.         Administrative Ministries holding one to one meeting with coal consumers to resolve the issues faced by the consumers. Ministry of Power / CEA has conducted three meetings with the power producers and Ministry of Steel, Department of Promotion of Industry & Internal Trade (DPIIT) and Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) have also conducted one meeting each with the coal consumers. 5.                The Government has also initiated the process of auctioning coal blocks for commercial mining, wherein private sector can also participate, for enhancing the domestic coal production. * * * * 			Annexure AProfit making Coal of mines in 2019-20 in the state of Jharkhand  S.N.
