ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) to(c):	The National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) that came into effect from July 5, 2013 aims to provide food and nutritional security in human life cycle approach, by ensuring access to adequate quantity of quality food at affordable prices to people to live a life with dignity. The Act provides for coverage of upto 75% of rural population and upto 50% of urban population for receiving highly subsidized foodgrains under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), thus covering about two-thirds of the total population.  The Act is operational in a seamless manner across all States/ Union Territories, covering about 79.37 crore persons across the country. Section 12 of the NFSA provides for reforms in the Targeted Public Distribution System through use of technology to make it more targeted and transparent and to address the implementation gaps. Accordingly, ration cards database has been completely digitized, 90.7% ration cards have been seeded with Aadhaar and 91.8% of the fair price shops are automated through electronic point of sale devices. No State/UT has reported any difficulty or challenges in implementation of the NFSA...........2/--2-To make food more accessible, Government of India in association with all States/Union Territories has started the implementation of nation-wide portability of the benefits under the NFSA i.e. the distribution of subsidized foodgrains to eligible households/ beneficiaries covered under NFSA, anywhere in the country through “One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC)” System by using the same/ existing ration card. At present, the facility for portability of ration cards under ONORC System has been seamlessly enabled in 32 States/Union Territories covering about 69 Crore beneficiaries (86% of NFSA population) allowing the beneficiaries to access their NFSA foodgrains/ benefit anywhere in these States/Union Territories. This initiative would largely benefit numerous migratory beneficiaries such as labourers, daily wagers, blue-collar workers etc. who frequently change their place of dwelling across the country in search of employment or for other reasons. Under ONORC System, part lifting of monthly entitlement of foodgrains is also feasible at any fair price shop across 32 States/Union Territories.****
