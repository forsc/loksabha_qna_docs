ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b): 	At present, the timeline given to States/UTs for linking of Aadhaar numbers of beneficiaries with their ration cards under the Notification of this Department dated 08/02/2017 (as amended from time to time)has been extended up to 30/09/2021. Until then, as per extant instructions of this Department, vide letters dated 24/10/2017 and 08/11/2018, all States/UTs are advised that no ration card / beneficiary shall be deleted only for want of Aadhaar and no genuine beneficiary/household shall be denied from receiving their entitled quota of subsidised foodgrains for not possessing an Aadhaar number or failure of biometric/Aadhaar authentication due to network/ connectivity/ linking related issues, poor biometrics of the beneficiary or any other technical reasons. .......2/--2-However, under TPDS which is governed by the provisions of the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), the addition and deletion of ration cards / beneficiaries is a continuous process and States/UTs regularly review their lists to identify and weed out ineligible ration cards and to include other left out and genuinely eligible households/beneficiaries under NFSA, up to their respective ceiling limits of population coverage under the Act. This activity is assisted by the use of technology in TPDS operations i.e. de-duplication due to digitization of ration cards data, Aadhaar seeding, detection of ineligible, duplicate, bogus ration cards, migration, death of beneficiaries, etc. The States/UTs follow their own procedures to verify the eligibility of the suspected/identified cases before taking appropriate action. Accordingly, as per the information available about 61.3 Lakh, 71.4 Lakh, 55.6 Lakh and 17.7 Lakh ration cards have been cancelled by States/UTs during 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively.(c) & (d): 	The TPDS under NFSA, is operated in joint responsibilities of the Central and State/UT Governments, wherein inter-alia the operational responsibilities pertaining to the inclusion and exclusion of beneficiaries under NFSA and grievance redressal of beneficiaries rests with the respective State/UT Government. Accordingly, the States/UTs have been advised to undertake proper verification, which may also include field verification of each identified/suspected case to ensure that ration cards of genuine beneficiaries are not deleted/ suspended. However, a grievance redressal mechanism under NFSA comprising of District Grievance Redressal Officer (DGRO) and Independent State Food Commission (SFC) at different levels are available in all States/UTs for the beneficiaries to register their complaints and grievances. Besides, the beneficiaries can also make use of the online grievance redressal mechanism and toll-free helpline numbers to register their complaints/grievances with concerned State/UT Government. ****
