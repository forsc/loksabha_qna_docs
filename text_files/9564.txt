These include: Children’s Science Congress organised across the country, outreach and demonstration programmes under Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Medicine (STEMM); scientific awareness through one hour programme on DD Science Channel and a 24X7 Internet-based science Over-The-Top (OTT) Channel. To promote research and  foster a culture of innovation among school children in the age group of 10 to 15 years and studying in Classes 6 to 10, a programme called INSPIRE Award-MANAK (Million Minds Augmenting National Aspiration and Knowledge) has been launched. The Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) in partnership with Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) has launched a programme ‘Jigyasa’ to develop ‘Scientific Temper’ in the young minds. The National Council of Science Museums (NCSM), under the Ministry of Culture, is engaged in popularizing Science and Technology through a network of Science Centres and Mobile Science Exhibition (MSE) units.(b)    	Children’s Science Congress reaches out to about 2.50 lakh school students across the country covering all the States and Union Territories utilizing Rs 8.79 crore during 2019-20.
