ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ?????? 	(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (g) : As per provisions of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), the final/season end claims are calculated and paid on the basis of percentage shortfall in yield - if ‘Actual Yield’ per hectare of insured crop for the insurance unit (calculated on the basis of yield data from requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments-CCEs) in insured season, falls short of ‘Threshold Yield’, all insured farmers growing that crop in the defined area are deemed to have suffered shortfall of similar magnitude in yield and claims per hectare are worked out as per following formula :  Threshold Yield (TY) – Actual Yield (AY)----------------------------------------------------  X  Sum Insured            Threshold Yield (TY)(Threshold Yield (TY) is calculated by taking moving average of best 5 years out of 7 years) Further, immediate relief is also provided to insured farmers in case of adverse seasonal conditions (mid-season adversity) during the crop season, if the expected yield during the season is likely to be less than 50% of the Threshold Yield in the concerned insurance unit.   Amount payable is 25% of the likely claims subject to adjustment against final claims based on yield assessment data arrived through CCEs.However, losses due to localized risks of hailstorm, landslide, inundation, cloud burst & natural fire and post-harvest losses due to cyclone, cyclonic/unseasonal rains and hailstorm for a specified period of 14 days after harvest are calculated on individual insured farm basis on inspection by a Committee constituted by the concerned State Government comprising State officials and officials from insurance companies and loss assessors.  Also, there  is a provision to pay claims towards prevented sowing/failed germination and adhoc claims in case of mid season adversity.  Revisions/improvements in the crop insurance schemes is a continuous process.  Based on the experience gained, views of various stakeholders and with a view to ensure better transparency, accountability, timely payment of claims to the farmers and to make the scheme more farmer friendly, Government has comprehensively revised and revamped the Operational Guidelines of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) with effect from Rabi 2018 and Kharif 2020 respectively to ensure the targeted delivery of benefits of the scheme to the farmers adequately and timely.   Rationalization of methodology for calculation of Threshold Yield (TY) to calculate Threshold Yield by taking moving average of best 5 out of 7 years instead removing two calamities hit years out of 7 years yield earlier had been made in Revised Operational Guidelines w.e.f. from Rabi 2018-19.District-wise details of number of farmer applications enrolled, hence eligible for benefit of premium subsidy in Andhra Pradesh during last three years i.e. 2018-19 to 2020-21 are given in Annexure.
