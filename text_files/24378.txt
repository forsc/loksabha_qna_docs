Allocation was done for following four drugs: Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, Amphotericin B (Liposomal) and Amphotericin B (Conventional). Allocation of Remdesivir started on 21.4.2021, Tocilizumab on 30.4.2021, Amphotericin B-Liposomal on 11.5.2021, and Amphotericin B – Conventional on 14.6.2021 respectively.
