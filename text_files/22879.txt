                                                        MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a) to (f) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (A) TO (F) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 342 DUE TO THE REPLY ON 19.03.2021 RAISED BY SHRI P.V. MIDHUN REDDY AND SHRI POCHA BRAHMANANDA REDDY ON PARIS AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE CHANGE (a)Climate Change is a global environmental challenge and there are studies projecting varied impacts including, inter alia, changes in patterns of temperature and precipitation and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The Government has taken cognizance of the matter and has been assessing climate change over the years through various Ministries and Agencies.India Meteorological Department (IMD) brings out the publication ‘Annual Climate Summary’ at the end of every year that features highlights of climate patterns including temperature and rainfall over the country, long term changes since the year 1901 in all India temperature and rainfall in annual and seasonal scales. As per the report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the average global temperature for 2015-2019 is currently estimated to be 1.1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial (1850-1900) levels. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences, the surface air temperature over India has risen by about 0.7 °C during 1901–2018 which is accompanied with an increase in atmospheric moisture content. The sea surface temperatures in the tropical Indian Ocean have also increased by about 1 °C during 1951–2015.On an average, at present, the sea level along the Indian coast is estimated to be rising at about 1.7 mm/year.(b) to (f)	India is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), its Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement. Under the Paris Agreement, India has submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) outlining eight targets for 2021-2030, including (i) to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030 from 2005 level, (ii) to achieve about 40 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030 with help of the transfer of technology and low-cost international finance, (iii) to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.The other targets pertain to sustainable lifestyles; climate friendly growth path; climate change adaptation; climate change finance; and capacity building and technology. These goals have to be achieved between 2021 and 2030.The Government of India stands committed to combating climate change through its several programmes and schemes. National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) provides an overarching framework for all climate actions. NAPCC comprises of eight Missions in specific areas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, habitat, water, sustaining Himalayan ecosystems, forestry, agriculture and strategic knowledge for climate change. These Missions address issues relating to mitigation of greenhouse gases, and adaptation to the adverse impacts of climate change in various sectors such as forests, water resources, agriculture etc. Thirty-three states and Union Territories have prepared State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCC) consistent with the objectives of NAPCC for specific actions as per their vulnerabilities and sectoral priorities. The Government is also implementing projects under the National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC) to support adaptation measures in States/UTs in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. The Government has constituted a high-level inter-ministerial ‘Apex Committee for Implementation of Paris Agreement’ (AIPA)to oversee the progress in implementation of India’s NDC and to monitor, review and revisit climate goals to fulfil the requirements of the Paris Agreement. Implementation of the NAPCC and other measures has led to a reduction in emission intensity of GDP by about 24% between 2005 and 2016. 24.56% of geographic area in the country is under forest and tree cover and carbon sink in India’s forests is increasing. Cumulative electric installed capacity from non-fossil fuel sources stands at 38.5%.India is on track to achieve its targets under the Paris Agreement for combating climate change.***
