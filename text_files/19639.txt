ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a)	Opening of new Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) is a continuous process. KVs are opened primarily to cater to the educational needs of the wards of transferable Central Government Employees including Defence & Para-Military personnel, Central Autonomous Bodies, Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and Central Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) by providing a common programme of education. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations and committing resources for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities for opening of new KVs have to compete with other proposals under the “Challenge Method”.  	Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan has informed that during last year and current year 60 requests have been received from Members of Parliament to set up new KVs.(b)	Yes, Sir.  (c)	In view of the reply to part (a) above, no definite time frame can be given in this regard.*****
