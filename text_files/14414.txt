                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                            (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a)	The Government of India launched Smart Cities Mission (SCM) on 25 June 2015 for developing 100 cities as Smart Cities.  Inclusiveness is built into SCM to ensure that all citizens, including women and children, benefit from the urban transformation taking place in the Smart Cities. The different projects being implemented by Smart Cities will provide more liveable and safer conditions to all sections of the society including the vulnerable and homeless, elderly, women, children and people with disabilities.(b) Manual scavenging is prohibited under Section 5 of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (MS Act 2013) in all the States and Union Territories with effect from 06.12.2013. The persons who were engaged in manual scavenging on this date are identified for their rehabilitation. The Act provides for survey of manual scavengers by Municipality in urban areas and Gram Panchayat in rural areas, if they have reasons to believe, existence of manual scavengers in the areas under their jurisdiction. (c) The objective of Smart Cities Mission is to promote cities that provide core infrastructure and give a decent quality of life to its citizens, a clean and sustainable environment with application of ‘Smart Solutions’.  Various transformational projects such as Smart Integrated Command & Control Centres, Smart Roads, Smart Solar and Smart Water projects etc. have been implemented in this direction. In addition, SCM  conducts survey in 114 cities to assess the Ease of Living of citizens across three pillars of Quality of Life, Economic Ability and Sustainability.                                                *****
