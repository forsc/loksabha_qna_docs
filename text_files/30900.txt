                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (d) Ambient air quality data in 96 cities showed a decreasing trend of PM10 whereas 36 cities showed an increasing trend of PM10 concentration in 2020-2021 as compared to 2019-2020. 18 cities were found to be within the prescribed National Ambient Air Quality Standard (PM10 less than 60 µg/m3) in 2019-20 which has increased to 27 in year 2020-21. In the year 2020, in Delhi, the number of ‘Good’, ‘Satisfactory’ and ‘Moderate’ days increased to 227 against 108 in 2016.Government of India has launched National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) as a national level strategy to reduce air pollution levels across the country. City Specific Action Plans have been prepared for the identified 132 non-attainment and million plus cities and have rolled out for implementation. These action plans focus on city specific short/ medium/ long term actions to control air pollution from sources such as vehicular emissions, road dust, burning of biomass/ municipal solid waste, construction activities, industrial emissions, etc.Climate Change is a global collective action problem and requires the cooperation of all nations based on the principle of ‘Equity’ and in accordance with ‘Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities’. India is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), its Kyoto Protocol (KP) and the Paris Agreement (PA). India submitted its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to UNFCCC in 2015 which inter-alia includes reducing the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level; to achieve about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030 with the help of the transfer of technology and low-cost international finance including from Green Climate Fund (GCF); and to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.The National Knowledge Network (NKN) has been constituted under NCAP with a vision to build local technical capacities.Major universities such as IITs,NITs andother academic institutions are an integral part of this network.Institutes of Reputes (IoRs) have been identified for every state with non-attainment cities to carry out air quality management research and provide technical support to States for improving air quality. States (State Pollution Control Boards/ Committees and Urban Local Bodies) have signed Memorandum of Understanding with identified IoRs for implementation of various air quality management activities. Further, government has taken several other steps to control air pollution across the country that will have larger impact on the people irrespective of their socio-economic status and details are at Annexure I***
