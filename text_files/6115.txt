So far, an amount of Rs. 969.90 crore has been released to the State Governments for various conservation and management activities in wetlands including lakes. State-wise details of funds released during last three years and the current financial year under the NPCA are annexed.(b) & (c)  Under the National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS) programme, the Ministry had sanctioned a research project to Space Applications Centre (SAC) Ahmedabad, under which ISRO has carried out National Wetland Inventory and Assessment (NWIA) at 1:50,000 scale using Indian Remote Sensing Satellite during 2006-2011. The details were brought out as national and state level wetland inventory Atlases.  A total of 7, 57,060 wetlands have been mapped in the Country.
