ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) to (d)  Rivers in the country are polluted mainly due to discharge of untreated and partially treated sewage from cities/towns and industrial effluents.		According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), there are 2836 Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) in the country which are discharging their effluents in various water bodies. Out of total 2836 industries, 2180 industries are operational and 656 industries are self-closed. The number of complying and non-complying units are 2053 and 127 respectively. Action taken against the non-complying units includes issue of show-cause notices to 52 units, issue of closure directions to 56 units and filing of legal cases against 2 units. State/Union Territory (UT) wise status of GPI units in the country is attached as Annexure.		As per the Provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution), Act 1974, industrial units are required to install effluent treatment plants (ETPs) and treat their effluents to comply with stipulated environmental standards before discharging into river and water bodies. Accordingly, CPCB, State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) and Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) monitor industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under provisions of these Acts.		Steps taken by the Government to stop discharge of industrial effluents into rivers, inter-alia include issuance of notification of specific discharge standards, revision of the criteria for categorization of industries and issuing directions to all  SPCBs/PCCs to adopt the same, issuance of consent to establish/consent to operate by the SPCBs/PCCs, regular and surprise inspections of GPIs for compliance verification against stipulated environmental norms, installation of Online Continuous Effluent Monitoring System (OCEMS) for assessment of effluent quality and compliance status. In addition, the industries are encouraged to reduce their waste water generation by technological advancement, reuse/recycle of wastewater and maintain Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) where ever possible.		Besides, in compliance of the orders of National Green Tribunal (NGT) in Original Application No.673/2018 regarding rejuvenation of polluted river stretches in the country, States/UTs are required to implement approved action plans for restoration of the polluted stretches in their jurisdiction as identified by CPCB and published in their report of 2018, within the stipulated timelines. As per the orders of NGT, regular review on implementation of action plans is undertaken in the States/UTs and also at Central level.***** ANNEXURE ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. †3165 TO BE ANSWERED ON 16.12.2021 REGARDING ‘RELEASE OF WASTES INTO RIVERS’State/Union Territory (UT) status of Grossly Polluting Industries (GPI) units in the country State/UT	Total no. of industries	No. of industries closed  by their own	No. of industries operational	No. of industries complying with Environmental standards	No. of industries non-complying with Environmental standards	No. of industries against which action is  taken for non-complying with environmental standards						Show cause notice issued	Closure directions issued	Legal cases filed	Action under processAndaman & Nicobar	2	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	0Andhra Pradesh	66	11	55	50	5	2	1	0	2Arunachal Pradesh	97	8	89	63	26	3	23	0	0Assam	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Bihar	84	34	50	50	0	0	0	0	0Chandigarh	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Chhattisgarh	2	0	2	1	1	0	1	0	0Daman & Diu and Dadra & Nagar Haveli	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Delhi	3	0	3	3	0	0	0	0	0Goa	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Gujarat	22	4	18	18	0	0	0	0	0Haryana	627	27	600	594	6	0	6	0	0Himachal Pradesh	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Jammu & Kashmir	69	0	69	66	3	3	0	0	0Jharkhand	45	6	39	5	34	14	10	2	8Karnataka	4	0	4	4	0	0	0	0	0Kerala	29	1	28	27	1	0	1	0	0Lakshadweep	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Madhya Pradesh	2	0	2	2	0	0	0	0	0Maharashtra	4	1	3	3	0	0	0	0	0Manipur	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Meghalaya	2	0	2	2	0	0	0	0	0Mizoram	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Nagaland	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Odisha	6	0	6	6	0	0	0	0	0Puducherry	3	0	3	3	0	0	0	0	0Punjab	5	0	5	4	1	1	0	0	0Rajasthan	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0Sikkim	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Tamil Nadu	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Telangana	3	1	2	2	0	0	0	0	0Tripura	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0Uttar Pradesh	1648	560	1088	1047	41	22	13	0	6Uttarakhand	64	0	64	60	4	4	0	0	0West Bengal	48	3	45	41	4	3	0	0	1Total	2836	656	2180	2053	127	52	56	2	17*****
