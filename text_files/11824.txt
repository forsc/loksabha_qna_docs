Energy efficiency is one of the Reforms being pursued by the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). The objective of this reform is to reduce the amount of energy required to provide civic services through replacement of conventional streetlights and water pumps with energy efficient LED lights and energy efficientpumps respectively in AMRUT Mission 500 cities. Further, all buildings/infrastructure constructed by the Central Public Works Department(CPWD) are designed as green Buildings by utilizing energy efficient equipment, LED lights fittings, installation of solar panels and measures for water efficiency i.e. Rain water Harvesting(RWH), conservation of water, recycling of waste water, use of water efficient sanitary fittings etc. So far, about 67 lakh conventional streetlights have been replaced by energy efficient LED/ solar lights in AMRUT cities.(b) CPWD uses Integrated Building Management System (IBMS) to keep track and control the systems in new buildings. For existing buildings, to prevent wastage, misuse of energy and water etc buildings are checked manually by the field staff on regular basis.(c) Yes, Sir. States/UTs have been directed to incorporate water conservation measures through Rain Water Harvesting structures and energy efficient practices like use of energy efficient fixtures and LED lights in multi-storeyed buildings being constructed under PMAY-U.                              *****
