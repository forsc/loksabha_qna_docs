ANSWER




MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D.V. SADANANADA GOWDA)(a) Government has decided in December, 2016 to close Indian Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Limited (IDPL), a Central Public Sector Enterprise under the aegis of the Department of Pharmaceuticals, after meeting its liabilities and implementing Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) from proceeds of sale of its surplus land to Government agencies through open competitive bidding. As the land could not be sold, the Government has recently decided to sell the land as per latest Department of Public Enterprises’ (DPE) guidelines dated 14.06.2018. Government has further decided to sanction Rs. 6.50 cr. for implementation of VRS to employees of the company. (b) to (d) IDPL Management decides on polices relating to employees’ service conditions etc. as per DPE’s guidelines. The Company has informed that the Board in 253rd meeting held on 22.03.2006 enhanced the ceiling for accumulation of earned leave from 240 days to 300 days w.e.f. 01.04.2006 and it is giving leave encashment of 300 days to employees w.e.f. 01.04.2006. *****
