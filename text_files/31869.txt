As per the Quarterly Bulleting of the Periodic Labour Force Survey for the period January – March 2021 released on 30th November 2021 by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) on the Current Weekly Status (CWS) for females of age 15 years and above in urabn areas was 21.9% in the Quarter January – March 2020, which owing to the Covid-19 pandemic induced lockdown in the country, dropped to 19.6% in the Quarter April – June 2020.

District level estimates are not available. Government has taken following steps to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 pandemic induced job losses, including women:•	To prevent disruption in the employment of the wage-earners below Rs 15,000/- per month in organized sector businesses having less than 100 workers, government paid 24 percent of their monthly wages into their PF accounts for three months, April to June 2020. •	MNREGA wages were increased by Rs 20/- with effect from 1 April 2020 to provide an additional Rs 2,000/- benefit annually to a worker to benefit approximately 13.62 Crore families. •	The first instalment of Rs 2,000/- due in 2020-21 was front-loaded and paid in April 2020 itself under the PM KISAN Yojana to benefit 8.7 Crore farmers. •	A total of 20.4 Crore Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna women account-holders were given ex-gratia of Rs. 500/- per month for three months, April to June 2020. •	Limit of collateral free lending was increased from Rs 10 to Rs 20 Lakhs for women organised through 63 Lakh Self Help Groups (SHGs) supporting 6.85 Crore (68.5 million) households. •	Government gave Rs 1,000/- per month from April to June 2020 to 3 Crore aged widows and people in Divyang category who are vulnerable due to economic disruption caused by COVID-19 to tide over difficulties. Government has launched the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rojgar Yojana (ABRY) with effect from 1st  October 2020 as part of Atmanirbhar Bharat package 3.0 to incentivize employers for creation of new employment along with social security benefits and restoration of loss of employment during Covid-19 pandemic. This scheme is being implemented through Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) and seeks to reduce the financial burden of the employers and encourages them to hire more workers. The salient features of the scheme are summarized below: • An employee drawing monthly wage of less than Rs. 15000/- who was not working in any establishment registered with the Employees’ Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) before 1st October 2020 is eligible for the benefit. The employees who lost their job during Covid-19 pandemic and did not join in any EPF covered establishment upto 30.09.2020 are also eligible for the benefit. • Government of India is crediting for a period of two years, both the employee’s share (12% of wages) and employer’s share (12% of wages) of contribution payable or only the employee’s share, depending on employment strength of the EPFO registered establishments. • The scheme has commenced from 1st October 2020 and shall remain open for registration of eligible employers and new employees upto 31st March 2022. Government is paying the subsidy for two years from the date of registration.
