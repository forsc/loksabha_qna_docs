ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE OF MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) to (d): The Department of Financial Services (DFS), inter-alia, deals with issues relating to Banking, Insurance, Pension Reforms which are very technical in nature and therefore often require expertise and experience from the practitioners in the banking system.  Considering this, the services of staff including female staff of various Public Sector Banks are utilized, as and when required. The Department is implementing a large number of important schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY), Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY), Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), Atal Pension Yojana (APY), Stand Up India etc. The Department is also coordinating MSME Support and Outreach campaign. All such schemes require continuous and close coordination with banks/financial institutions for which the services of some officials from Banks are utilized from time to time to resolve technical matters.*****
