ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (b): The National Covid-19 Vaccination Programme is built on scientific & epidemiological evidence, WHO Guidelines and Global Best Practices. The National Covid-19 Vaccination Programme commenced with vaccination of Health Care Workers, free of cost. The Programme was expanded with time to include vaccination of Front Line Workers, citizens more than 60 years of age, citizens more than 45 years of age and eventually, citizens more than 18 years of age.  Government of India procures and provides vaccine free of cost to the States/UTs. In addition, 25% of the monthly production of vaccine manufactured is available for procurement by private hospitals. It is expected that beneficiaries aged 18 and above will be vaccinated by December 2021.  (c)  and (d) Government of India has made pro-active arrangements to augment the production capacities of domestic vaccine manufacturers by facilitating technology transfer, providing financial assistance, providing advance payment against supply orders and by streamlining the Regulatory pathway for approval of vaccines. Government of India has further placed procurement orders to ensure adequate supply of vaccines to facilitate vaccination of eligible adult citizens.  States/UTs are provided advance visibility of vaccine doses that would be supplied to them 15 days in advance to enable them to plan vaccination in accordance with availability of doses and to maximize the convenience of the beneficiaries.
