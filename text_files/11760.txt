There is a shortage of General Pool Residential Accommodation (GPRA) in Delhi and Chandigarh.  Details are at Annexure I and Annexure II.  The shortage of General Pool Residential Accommodation (GPRA) is due to non-availability of land at central locations in Metropolitan Cities and the fact that House Rent Allowance (HRA) admissible at the Metropolitan Cities is not commensurate with the actual rent in these cities.b)	The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had approved the proposal of redevelopment of East Kidwai Nagar Government Colony in March 2012.  The project started by NBCC(India) Ltd. in May 2013.  This redevelopment of East Kidwai Nagar will provide 4,608 Dwelling Units so far.  The agency has provided 2,758 Dwelling units so far.  Further the Union Cabinet in July 2016 approved the proposal of redevelopment of the seven (07) Government colonies at Mohammadpur, Nauroji Nagar, Netaji Nagar,   Sarojini Nagar, Thyagraj Nagar, Kasturba Nagar and Srinivaspuri.  The project envisaged replacement of existing 12,970 dwelling units in these colonies with 24,917 dwelling units.  In Chandigarh, CPWD is constructing 42 new flats.c)	Government has taken various steps to augment the General Pool Residential Accommodation by way of construction of new residential units, outright purchase of ready-built flats or redevelopment of existing government colonies.  The details of the same is enclosed at Annexure-III.****
