ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) to (c) As reported by Rajasthan State, 11 habitations of Banswara district and 1 habitation of Chittaurgarh district under Udaipur division have fluoride contamination in drinking water sources.To make provision of potable tap water supply in adequate quantity, of prescribed quality and on regular & long-term basis to every rural household in the country by 2024, since August, 2019, Government of India in partnership with States/ UTs, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) – Har Ghar Jal. Under JJM, while allocating the funds to States/ UTs, 10% weightage is given to the population residing in habitations affected by chemical contaminants including Fluoride.Under JJM, States/ UTs have been advised to plan schemes for bulk water transfer from long distance in villages with water quality issues and non-availability of suitable surface water source in nearby areas.Under JJM, while planning for potable water supply to household through tap water connection, priority is given to quality-affected habitations. Since, planning, implementation and commissioning of piped water supply scheme based on a safe water source is likely to take time, purely as an interim measure, States/ UTs have been advised to install community water purification plants (CWPPs) especially in Arsenic and Fluoride affected habitations to provide potable water to every household at the rate of 8–10 litre per capita per day (lpcd) to meet their drinking and cooking requirements.Rural drinking water supply is a State subject. Powers to plan, approve, and implement rural water supply schemes is vested with States.*****
