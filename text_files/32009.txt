BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) & (b) As per Rural Health Statistics 2019-20 (as on 31st March 2020) publication, brought out by this Ministry, based on the information provided by State/UTs, the State/UT wise vacancy of healthcare workers (including doctors, nurses and lab technicians) in Rural and Urban areas of the country is placed at Annexure – I.(c) & (d) Public Health is a State Subject and all the administrative and personnel matters, including that of recruitment of doctors and other health workforce in public health facilities lie with the respective State Governments. The shortage of health human resource in public health facilities varies from State to State depending upon their policies and context. However, under National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical supports are provided to the State/UTs to strengthen their healthcare systems including support for recruitment of human resources (Doctors and other health workers), based on the requirements posed by them in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) within their overall resource envelope.

The details of doctors, nurses and paramedics who have retired from Central Govt. services in last 5 years was collected at central level and shared with the States so that State Governments could use their services on need basis.•	A detailed SOP was released by MoHFW regarding deployment of residents/ PG students and nursing students as part of hospital management for COVID-19.•	In case of requirement for additional Human Resources for COVID management, additional resources through ECRP I package was provided to the states to engage temporary HR as per need.Further, many provisions have been made under NHM for improving availability health resources, which includes:•	Provision for additional allowance to staff posted in rural and remote areas•	Higher remuneration for staff posted in rural areas compared to those posted in urban areas•	Provision for paying performance-based team incentives to staff after achieving over and above defined threshold of performance•	Flexibility to attract and retain specialists:•	Lucrative flexible salary: “You quote We pay” scheme•	Fixed tenure posting in difficult areas •	Insourcing of specialist as per requirement•	Providing scope for professional growth and continuous professional learning•	Starting DNB and CPS courses in the district hospitals•	Implementation of Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric (EmOC) Certificate Program
