Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS): Rs. 945 Crore has been sanctioned under the SISF Scheme for period of 4 years starting from 2021-22.  As of 25th November 2021, Rs. 163.30 crore has been allocated (committed) to 41 incubators selected so far under the Scheme; of which Rs.15 crore has been allocated for incubators from Maharashtra. 40% of total approved commitment is released as part of first installment to a selected incubator. Subsequent installments are released based on submission of proof of achievement of milestones.  As on 25th November, 2021, Rs. 2.10 crore has been disbursed to the selected incubators from the State of Maharashtra under the Scheme.

As Startup India is a national initiative, all it’s programs are aimed at fostering innovation and entrepreneurship at a national level. The steps taken under Startup India Initiative to promote women entrepreneurship all over India which are also available for the women entrepreneurs in the State of Maharashtra are at Annexure-III. ********
