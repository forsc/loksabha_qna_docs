(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	The Department has commenced the work for creating Agristack in the country. A federated farmers’ database is being built by the Department and once completed, this would serve as the core of the Agristack. Leading Technology/Agri-tech/StartUp companies were identified and invited to collaborate with the Government of India to develop Proof of Concepts (PoC) based on the federated Farmers’ database. The PoCs will help in understanding solutions that can be built using available data and some of them, if found beneficial to the farmers will be scaled up at National level. The Government has recently signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on pro bono basis with same companies for working on Proof of Concept (PoC) in the select Districts/Villages and develop a model for creation/development of digital services and innovation in the agricultural value chain. As of now, the federated farmers’ database is being built by taking the publicly available data as existing in the Department and in various data silos in Government and linking them with the digitised land records. This Department in consultation with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is in the process of bringing out a data policy for the agriculture sector.(b):	No confidential information of Farmer’s data or information subject to protection under the Non-Disclosure Agreements being shared under the MOUs.(c):	Government of India has requested States/UTs for using this opportunity and utilize these initiatives in the interest of farmers for improving agriculture sector’s efficiency. *******
