                                                        MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR) (a) to (d): Advertisements telecast on private satellite TV channels are required to be in conformity with the Advertising Code prescribed under Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 and the rules framed thereunder.  Rule 7(11) thereof provides that “no programme shall carry advertisements exceeding twelve minutes per hour, which may include up to ten minutes per hour of commercial advertisements, and up to two minutes per hour of the channel’s self-promotional programmes.” Further ‘Standards of Quality of Service (Duration of Advertisements in Television Channels) (Amendment) Regulations 2013’ issued by TRAI inter-alia provides that “No broadcaster shall, in its broadcast of a programme, carry advertisements exceeding twelve minutes in a clock hour.” Some broadcasters have approached the Hon’ble High Court, Delhi against the regulations of 2013. The matter is presently sub-judice. *********
