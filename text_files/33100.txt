                                                        MINISTER OF STATE					(SHRI AJAY BHATT)      IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE(a)  Location of various Headquarters of Army from Command to the Brigades are driven primarily by operational logic and other important aspects like availability of land to accommodate the forces, support infrastructure around the location, aspirations of the men in uniforms etc. Headquarters Southern Command is located in Pune since its operational area is in states of Rajasthan and Gujarat. However, one of its subordinate formations is located in Hyderabad-Secunderabad in Telangana State. Pune also facilitates tri-service synergy with Indian Navy Command Headquarters located at Mumbai and Indian Air Force Headquarters located at Gandhinagar. (b) & (c):  There is no plan to relocate Headquarters Southern Command to any Sothern State.(d) & (e):  Yes, Sir. A representation of the Hon’ble MP regarding “Need to shift Headquarters of Indian Army’s Southern Command to Secunderabad”  was received in February, 2020.*****
