 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a)- (b):   As per Draft India Energy Security Scenarios (IESS) -2047 developed by NITI Aayog the share of coal in overall energy supply will be in the range of 38.5% (Ambitious) to 43% (in Business as Usual) Scenario. (b)    This is unlikely to have any adverse effect on India’s Commitment under Paris Agreement. (c)     Coal companies have taken some initiatives under clean coal initiatives such as construction of coal washeries, extraction of coal mine methane and surface coal gassification. Coal India Limited (CIL) has planned to set up eighteen (18) nos. of new coal washeries with a total throughput capacity of 97.1 Million tonnes per year.  Further, a Methanol Plant has been taken up by CIL at Dankuni Coal Complex to produce 0.68 MMTPA Methanol through Surface Coal Gasification route.  ****
