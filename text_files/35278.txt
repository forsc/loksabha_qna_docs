Eligible beneficiaries can avail the benefit of PMAY-U through four verticals, i.e., Beneficiary-led Construction or enhancement (BLC); Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP); ‘In-Situ’ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) and Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS).  In the State of Maharashtra,  13.94 lakh houses have been sanctioned under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U). So far, out of sanctioned houses,  6.07 lakh houses have been completed/delivered to beneficiaries and the remaining are at various stages of construction / grounding.The number of beneficiary households provided houses in Maharashtra under PMAY-U since the launch of the scheme, district-wise particularly in Aurangabad district is annexed as Annexure-I.(b)	The number of beneficiary households provided houses under “In-Situ” Slum Redevelopment (ISSR), Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS), Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP) and Beneficiary-led Construction (BLC) under PMAY-U are annexed as Annexure-II.(c)&(d)Under PMAY-U, the State/ UT Governments,while proposing the project to the Union Government for central assistance, are responsible to appraise, approve the project proposals, including identifying encumbrance free land. Besides, the identification of beneficiaries under PMAY-U is done by respective State/ UT Governments. The houses under the scheme are sanctioned in phases as per proposal received from the respective States/UTs. There are no year-wise fixed targets under PMAY-U.                                       *****
