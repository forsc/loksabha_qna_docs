ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a):	The Government has many ongoing Social Security and Welfare Schemes for unorganized workers. For example,  Life and disability cover is provided through Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Surksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) launched in 2015.  The health and maternity benefits are addressed through Ayushman Bharat Scheme which is a universal health scheme launched in 2018. Old age protection is provided through a pension scheme namely Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM) Yojana launched in March, 2019. Contd..2/-:: 2 ::           Apart from these schemes, few more schemes such as Public Distribution System through One Nation One Ration Card under National Food Security Act, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gramin Kaushal Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, Gareeb Kalyan Rojgar Yojana, Mahatma Gandhi Bunkar Bima Yojana, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Antyodaya Yojana, PMSVANidhi, Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan-dhan Yojana etc. are also available for the unorganised workers depending upon their eligibility criteria. (b):	The Minimum Wages Act, 1948, safeguards the interests of employees, including unskilled employees in the unorganized sector, engaged in the Scheduled employments as it binds the employers to pay the minimum wages to the employees as fixed under the statute for the work performed during a given period, which cannot be reduced by collective agreement or an individual contract. The Central Government and the State Governments are mandated to revise the Minimum Rates of Wages payable to the employees engaged in the scheduled employment in their respective jurisdictions at intervals not exceeding five years. Accordingly, the minimum rates of wages in the scheduled employments including agriculture in the Central sphere were last revised by the Central Government with effect from 19.01.2017. Further, in order to take care of the rising prices, the Central Government revises the Variable Dearness Allowance (V.D.A) on basic rates of minimum wages every six months effective from 1st April and 1st October every year on the basis of Consumer Price Index for Industrial workers. V.D.A. was last revised w.e.f. 01.04.2021. The Minimum Wages Act, 1948 has been subsumed in the Code on Wages 2019. The code on Wages, 2019, makes minimum wages universal for all employments and provides for floor wage. Under the provisions of the Code the minimum rates of wages fixed by the Central Government and the State Governments shall not be less than the floor wage so fixed. (c):	In reference to the scheme of the Unorganised Workers, there is no reserve fund. However, in the Code on Social Security 2020, recently notified by the Central Government, provisions have been made under Section 141 to create a Social Security Fund to fund the social security scheme for the welfare of unorganised workers, Gig workers and platform workers.******
