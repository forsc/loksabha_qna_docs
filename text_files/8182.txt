ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) FOR NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY,  POWER and MoS for  SKILL DEVELOPMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP(SHRI R. K. SINGH)(a) The Government has set a target of installing 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by the year 2022 which includes 100 GW from solar, 60 GW from wind, 10 GW from Biomass and 5 GW from Small Hydro. So far, as on 31/10/2019, a total of 83.38 GW of renewable energy capacity has been installed in the country. Further, an additional capacity of 30.06 GW is under various stages of implementation and 39.67 GW under various stages of bidding. Hence, the targets are not unrealistic and would be achieved by 2022. (b) Yes Sir. Andhra Pradesh utilities (DISCOMs) are not  making payments to Renewable Energy (Wind and Solar) generators for over one year. The State Government has also sought to reopen the power purchase agreements and renegotiate the tariffs. The violation of the sanctity of the contracts has led to grave disquiet amongst the developers and investors and the climate for investments has suffered, leading to apprehension of a slowdown in the sector. (c) A total of 83.38 GW of renewable energy capacity has been installed in the country as on 31/10/2019 which includes 37.09 GW from wind, 31.70 GW from solar, 9.95 GW from bio-energy and 4.64 GW from small hydro power.(d) As per Power System Operation Corporation (POSOCO) report titled “Greening the Grid: Pathways to integrate 175 GW of RE’’, power system balancing with 100 GW of solar and 60 GW of wind is achievable with minimal RE curtailment of 1.4% which is in line with experiences in other countries with significant RE penetration. *****
