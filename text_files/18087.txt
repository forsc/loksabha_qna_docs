                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a)	Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has been monitoring the performance of Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) against the benchmarks for various Quality of Service parameters laid down by TRAI by way of Quality of Service regulations issued from time to time, through Quarterly Performance Monitoring Reports (PMRs). The performance is assessed for a License Service Area (LSA) as a whole. Hence, no separate information regarding network issues in rural areas/ villages is available in TRAI. As per PMR for the quarter ending March 2020, for Cellular Mobile Telephone Services all TSPs are complying with benchmarks for all the parameters in Tamil Nadu service area. As per data collected from Department of Telecommunications (DoT) field unit, Tamil Nadu LSA, 49 villages out of 15049 inhabited villages in Tamil Nadu are not covered by mobile services.(b)	TRAI has laid down the standards of Quality of Service for Basic Telephone Service (Wireline) and Cellular Mobile Telephone Service Regulations, 2009 dated 20th March 2009 and amended from time to time for mobile network service providers to improve the mobile connectivity. Wherever the standard/benchmark is not met, the explanation of the service providers is called for by TRAI and after considering the explanation submitted by service providers in this regard, TRAI imposes financial disincentives for non-compliance with the benchmark.(c) 		Mobile coverage in the uncovered villages is being provided by Government and TSPs in a phased manner. In the last three financial years, 24,657 number of additional Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) have been installed in rural areas/villages of Tamil Nadu. TSPs have also planned for additional 542 BTSs in rural areas/villages of Tamil Nadu during the year 2020-21. Further, new mobile towers/ BTSs are being installed by Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) on continuous basis to improve coverage and/or capacity of their networks based on techno-commercial assessments.(d)  	Tamil Nadu LSA in coordination with the various stakeholders viz. State Government, local authorities and TSPs etc., facilitate for the growth of telecom infrastructure in the LSA. State Government of Tamil Nadu has been requested to expedite the issue of Permits for installation of mobile towers. TSPs have also been requested to augment the existing capacity of their network in order to improve mobile connectivity, wherever feasible.	The Government has also taken several policy initiatives to facilitate infrastructure growth in the country which include permitting trading/sharing/liberalization of spectrum, permitting passive & active infrastructure sharing, notification of Right of Way Rules 2016, carrying out Electro Magnetic Field (EMF) awareness campaign to dispel the misgivings to the public regarding EMF radiations emission from mobile towers through print and electronic media etc.(e) 	TSPs undertake Radio Frequency (RF) Optimization process on a continuous basis to improve network connectivity. Further, TSPs have also been requested to augment the existing capacity of their network in order to improve mobile connectivity, wherever feasible.(f) 	TSPs have planned for additional 542 BTSs in rural areas/villages of Tamil Nadu during the year 2020-21.************
