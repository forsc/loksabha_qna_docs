Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) in India are required to ensure that the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters remain within the benchmarks laid down by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). The performance on these parameters is monitored quarterly through Performance Monitoring Reports (PMR) submitted by service providers for the service area as a whole.							Wherever the benchmark is not met, the explanation of the Service Providers is called for and after considering the explanation submitted by service providers in this regard, TRAI imposes financial disincentives for non-compliance with the benchmark.DoT has taken several policy initiatives to facilitate infrastructure growth for delivery of quality services. These include permitting trading/sharing/ liberalisation of spectrum, permitting passive & active infrastructure sharing, notification of Right of Way Rules 2016, making available government land/buildings for installations of towers etc.
