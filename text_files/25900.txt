ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI  R.K. SINGH)(a) to (d) : 	Yes, Sir.  A number of different schemes were running for promoting energy conservation and energy efficiencies.  As the overall objective of these schemes was common, these were merged into one consolidated scheme.  The details of the schemes which have been merged into the consolidated scheme are given at Annexure.  		The consolidation of the various schemes into one has resulted in channelizing the efforts towards promotion of energy conservation activities in a more effective and flexible manner. This has also led to simplification of the operational issues including better monitoring of the physical and financial progress along with smooth implementation. The flexible approach has also enabled better allocation of resources among the activities on need basis.*************
