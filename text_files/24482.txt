These advisories are available on MHA’s website at:https://www.mha.gov.in/Division_of_MHA/Women_Safety_Division/prison-reforms   Model Prison Manual 2016 was also a step in the direction of bringing in prison reforms as the Manual strives to serve as a benchmark that all States should emulate and seek guidance from. The Manual was forwarded to all States and UTs in May 2016. The Manual, inter-alia, provides detailed guidance on all aspects of prison and correctional administration, including after care and rehabilitation of inmates.  States and UTs have been advised to adopt the guidance provided in the Manual for bringing uniformity in basic principles governing prisons across the country, with due flexibility in the suggested provisions to allow adaptation as per local conditions.  -3-L.S.S.Q.NO.*29 FOR 20.07.2021(d) & (e):	The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) compiles prison statistics reported to it by States and UTs and publishes the same in its annual publication “Prison Statistics India”.
