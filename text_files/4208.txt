ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES & PUBLIC ENTERPRISES                   (SHRI ARVIND GANPAT SAWANT)(a) to (d): Yes, Sir. Government has approved the proposal for implementation of Phase-II of Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India [FAME India] Scheme for promotion of Electric Mobility. Accordingly, Department of Heavy Industry notified the Phase-II of FAME India Scheme on 8th March 2019, which is for a period of three years commencing from 1st April 2019 with a total budgetary support of Rs. 10,000 crore. This phase will mainly focus on supporting electrification of public & shared transportation, and aims to support through subsidies 7000 e-Buses, 5 lakh e-3 Wheelers, 55000 e-4 Wheeler Passenger Cars and 10 lakh e-2 Wheelers. In addition, creation of charging infrastructure will be supported in selected cities and along major highways to address range anxiety among users of electric vehicles. With greater emphasis on providing affordable & environment friendly public transportation options for the masses, the scheme will be applicable mainly to vehicles used for public transport or those registered for commercial purposes in e-3W, e-4W and e-bus segments. However, privately owned registered e-2W will also be covered under the scheme as a mass segment. The detailed notification of the Phase-II of FAME India Scheme is available in the website of Department of Heavy Industry [www.dhi.nic.in].(e): Phase-II of FAME-India Scheme, envisages support for setting up of adequate public charging infrastructure to instill confidence amongst EV users, through active participation and involvement of various stakeholders including Government agencies, industries, and Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs). An allocation of budget of Rs. 1000 Crore for a period of 3 years w.e.f. 01st April, 2019 has been earmarked for establishment charging infrastructure under this phase.(f): Yes, Sir, NITI Aayog along with Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) released a technical report titled “India’s Electric Mobility Transformation: Progress to Date and Future Opportunities”, it quantifies the direct oil and carbon savings that the vehicles incentivized under FAME II will deliver. The key highlights of this report as informed by NITI Aayog are –•	Effects of FAME II will go beyond the vehicles that are eligible under the FAME II.•	There is considerable energy and CO2 savings associated with the two, three, and four-wheeled vehicles and buses covered by FAME II over their lifetime, as well as the potential savings associated with greater adoption levels by 2030.•	The electric buses covered under FAME II will account for 3.8 billion vehicle kilometers travelled [e-vkt] over their lifetime.•	In order to capture the potential opportunity in 2030, batteries must remain a key focal point as they will continue to be the key cost driver of EVs.The detailed report may be viewed on http://niti.gov.in/writereaddata/files/document_ publication/NITI-RMI-Report.pdf .                                         *****
