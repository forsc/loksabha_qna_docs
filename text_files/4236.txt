                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d):   A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. 342 BY SHRI MOHAMMAD SADIQUE TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 17.07.2019 REGARDING DOUBLING/ ELECTRIFICATION OF RAILWAY LINES. (a) to (d) Doubling/3rd Line/4th Line projects are sanctioned on the basis of operational requirement of Railways including capacity constraints in existing single line. Accordingly, Engineering-cum-Traffic Survey for doubling of Bhatinda and Ferozepur was conducted in  2015-16.   As per Data of Survey report, capacity of single line is not fully utilized. Capacity utilization of Ferozepur Cantt. – Kotkapura section was only 65% and Kotkapura-Bhatinda section was only 90% with maintenance block in 2017-18.Electrification of existing single line of Bhatinda–Ferozepur has been sanctioned at a cost of  223.93 crore in September, 2018.  The work is planned for completion by March, 2022.With completion of electrification, section capacity will further increase.  Therefore, doubling of Bhatinda to Ferozepur was not carried forward. However, Railways have its main focus on capacity enhancement projects i.e. Doubling/3rd Line/4th Line. During last four years (2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18 & 2018-19), 158 projects totaling 14,540 km have been included in the Budget which are in various stages of planning/ approval/execution.*****
