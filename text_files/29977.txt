ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES & PENSIONS AND PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR.JITENDRA SINGH):  (a)&(b) Yes, Sir. India follows closed cycle for nuclear fuel. The spent fuel from Atomic Power Stations is subjected to reprocessing. This helps in separation of useful radio isotopes and also reduces the overall nuclear waste volume.  DAE has evolved plans for short/long term storage of radioactive wastes in safe and secure manner.  All the activities related to waste management are carried out in accordance with regulatory guidelines.(c) 	The design of all Nuclear Power Plants, including at Kalpakkam & Kudankulam is such that the radiation dose to members of the public is well within the limit stipulated by AERB. The radiation dose at nuclear power plant site boundary derived from monitoring of environmental matrices like, air, water, vegetation, crops, seafood, etc around the site is a negligible fraction of the stipulated limit and the natural background. Thus, there is no adverse impact of the wastes generated during operation of nuclear power plants on the environment and the public. The environment (land, water, air) around the power plants are being regularly monitored.******
