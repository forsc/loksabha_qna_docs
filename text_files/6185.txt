In the Mega Handloom Cluster at Sivasagar in the State of Assam, private investments are encouraged in projects which are sanctioned in the PPP mode in 80:20 ratio, wherein Govt. provides 80% funding and 20% funding is done by the investor, i.e. Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which also provides the land for the project. Since 2017, Govt. of India has released Rs. 6.91 crores for such projects in Assam with the investor participation at Rs. 1.91 Crores.
