Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES), Market Access Initiatives (MAI) Scheme etc. In addition, assistance to the exporters of agricultural products is also available under the Export Promotion Schemes of Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), Tobacco Board, Tea Board, Coffee Board, Rubber Board and Spices Board.(c) :   To promote agricultural exports, the Government has taken several steps at State/ District levels. State specific Action Plans have been prepared and State Level Monitoring Committees (SLMCs), Nodal Agencies for agricultural exports and Cluster Level Committees have been formed in a number of States. Country and product-specific action plans have also been formulated to promote exports. A Farmer Connect Portal has been set up for providing a platform for farmers, Farmer-Producer Organizations (FPOs) and cooperatives to interact with exporters. Buyer-seller Meets (BSMs) have been organized in the clusters to provide export-market linkages. Regular interactions, through videoconferences, have been held with the Indian Missions abroad, to assess and exploit export opportunities. Country specific BSMs, through Indian Missions, have also been organized.(d) to (f) :  The Department of Commerce is engaged in export promotion of all agriculture products including plantation and marine products. Constant efforts, on the part of various Ministries/ Departments of Government of India, State Governments and various export agencies, are required for promotion of export of agriculture products. As such it is not possible to put a time frame and fund requirements for such efforts.*****
