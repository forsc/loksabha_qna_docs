ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (e): Ministry of Civil Aviation launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21-10-2016 to stimulate regional air connectivity and making air travel affordable to the masses. The primary objective of RCS is to facilitate / stimulate regional air connectivity by connecting unserved/underserved airports/heliports/water aerodromes. Basirhat (West Bengal) does not figure in the tentative list of unserved / underserved airports attached to the scheme document version4.0. However, UDAN is a market driven scheme. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN from time to time. If the Government of West Bengal requests the Ministry of Civil Aviation for inclusion of Basirhat in RCS document, the same could be included for bidding by prospective airlines in future rounds. If any bid is received, the same shall be considered as per the provisions of Scheme Document.
