ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (SHRI PANKAJ CHAUDHARY)(a) to (f) Different domestic and global private agencies have estimated inequality in India through various types of Surveys based on their own methodology and set of assumptions. However, statistics relating to wealth and income inequality is not compiled by the Central Government. Household consumption expenditure data collected by National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) could be used as a proxy to capture the income inequality in terms of consumption expenditure. However, the latest data of large sample survey on household consumer expenditure collected by NSSO in its 68th round is for 2011-12. Due to the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic situation, no fresh Household Consumption Expenditure Survey could be taken up in recent years. However, Government has initiated several targeted schemes that aim to reduce poverty and inequality, provide social security, income generation and livelihood options, and improve the quality of life of the vulnerable sections of the population in the country. *****
