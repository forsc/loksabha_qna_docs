ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d): As per  Pink Book 2019-20, work of construction of 66 Road over Bridges (ROBs) are sanctioned in Rajasthan, out of which 10 ROBs have been fully completed and 56 ROBs are in progress.Normally, Railway undertakes construction of ROBs in Railway portion whereas approaches are being constructed by State Government.  Generally, there is no problem of construction of ROBs in Railway portion. However,  it  is  difficult  to  construct  ROBs  on  approaches  because  it depends upon many factors such as availability of land, removal of encroachments, fixing the alignment of approaches, allocation of requisite funds etc. Therefore, it is not possible to fix the time schedule for construction of ROBs projects.    *****
