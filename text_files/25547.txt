ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL) (a) & (b): The Ministry of Food Processing industries (MoFPI) has been implementing Central Sector Umbrella Scheme - Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA Yojana (PMKSY) since 2016-17 for overall growth and development of food processing sector, including processing of agro- products and thus increasing the income of the farmers. The component schemes of PMKSY are - (i) Mega Food Park, (ii) Integrated Cold Chain and Value Addition Infrastructure, (iii) Creation /Expansion of Food Processing & Preservation Capacities, (iv) Infrastructure for Agro-Processing Clusters, (v) Creation of Backward & Forward linkages, (vi) Food Safety and Quality Assurance Infrastructure, (vii) Human Resource and Institutions, (viii) Operation Greens. Under component schemes of PMKSY, MoFPI provides mostly credit linked financial assistance (capital subsidy) in the form of grants-in-aid to entrepreneurs for setting up of food processing / preservation industries. So far, Ministry has approved 41 Mega food Parks, 353 Cold Chain projects, 63 Agro Processing Clusters, 292 Food Processing Units, 63 Creation of Backward & Forward Linkages Projects & 6 Operation Green projects across the country under corresponding component schemes of PMKSY. These sanctioned projects are estimated to benefit about 34 lakh famers on completion. (c) : PMKSY is not region or state specific but demand driven with no state-wise fund allocation. The budgetary allocation and expenditure incurred under relevant component schemes of PMKSY during last three financial years is placed at Annexure. (d) :  Ministry has conducted evaluation study of the relevant component schemes of PMKSY. In the evaluation study of Integrated Cold Chain and Value Addition Infrastructure Scheme conducted by M/s NABARD Consultancy Limited (NABCONS) in Year 2020, it has been estimated that captive projects under the scheme have resulted in increase in farm-gate prices by 12.38 % and each project is estimated to benefit more than 9500 farmers. (e) :  Securing various statutory clearances and utility provisions for Food Processing Industry takes significant time adversely affecting its implementation schedule and Ministry coordinates with all stakeholders for removal of these bottlenecks.  Ministry has resolved many logistical and manpower related issues during covid pandemic, through interventions.  (g) : Sanctioned projects under component schemes of PMKSY are estimated to benefit about 34 lakh famers on completion.  *****
