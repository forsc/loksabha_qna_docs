ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)  Panchayat is a State subject and  as set out in Article 243G of the Constitution, it is the State Legislatures who may by law endow `the Panchayats with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as institutions of self-government`. Accordingly, States have enacted Panchayati Raj Acts for functioning of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI). It is primarily the responsibility of State Governments to monitor the implementation of works, the delivery of services and there are provisions for appropriate action in case of complaints pertaining to PRIs under respective States. (b) Panchayat is a State subject, accordingly the responsibility to take steps towards strengthening Panchayati Raj primarily lies with the State Governments/ Union Territory Administrations. However, the Ministry of Panchayati Raj is implementing the scheme of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) to support State Governments/ Union Territory Administrations in this effort. The activities permissible under RGSA for strengthening the Panchayati Raj System include providing capacity building and training of Elected Representatives and Panchayat functionaries.(c) The views and feedback from the State Governments is continuously taken towards formulation or modification of implementation guidelines of RGSA.(d) The Ministry of Panchayati Raj had been carrying out an annual study in the form of ‘Panchayat Devolution Index’ (PDI) from 2006 onwards, through independent institutions, to assess and rank each State in the matters of devolution of Funds, Functions and Functionaries to Panchayats. Twenty six States and six Union Territories (UTs) participated in the Panchayat Devolution Index (PDI) study for the year 2015-16. The following States ranked higher on PDI were conferred citation awards on the National Panchayati Raj Day held on  24th April, 2016.Cumulative Devolution Index Awards Name of State	       RankKerala	              FirstMaharashtra 	      SecondKarnataka	      ThirdSikkim	First among NE States and over all rank Sixth Incremental Devolution Index Awards Name of State	      RankAndhra Pradesh	      FirstSikkim 	              SecondOdisha	              ThirdRanking of States having Fifth Scheduled Areas Name of State	      RankGujarat 	      FirstMadhya Pradesh	      First **********
