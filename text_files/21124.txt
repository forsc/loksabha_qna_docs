                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ?????? 		(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	:	The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) is implementing Crop Diversification Programme (CDP), a sub-scheme of Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) in the Original Green Revolution States viz; Haryana, Punjab & Western Uttar Pradesh since 2013-14 to divert the area of water intensive paddy crop to alternative crops like pulses, oilseeds, coarse cereals, nutri cereals, cotton etc.			DAC&FW is also supplementing the efforts of state governments to encourage diversified production of crops such as pulses, coarse cereals, nutri cereals, cotton & oilseeds under National Food Security Mission (NFSM) and horticultural crops under Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH). Government of India also provide flexibility to the states for state specific needs/priorities under RKVY. The state can promote crop diversification under RKVY with the approval of State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC) headed by Chief Secretary of the State.(b)	:	Under CDP, the farmers are encouraged to undertake alternative crops to paddy which have less water requirement. No such provision exists to devote land to dairy farming under CDP.(c)	:	The crops like paddy and sugarcane are water intensive. The surplus production of rice including basmati rice and sugar are exported. In view of higher water use by these crops, the Government has launched CDP for replacing paddy in select States and popularizing of water saving technology viz; System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and Directed Seeded Rice (DSR) in paddy, incentives on water saving devices like drip and sprinkler etc. under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), RKVY and various other schemes which provide support to the states for efficient water use technologies.(d)	& (e): Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India (BGREI), a sub scheme of Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) is being implemented in Eastern India comprising seven States namely Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Eastern Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal to harness the water potential for enhancing rice production in Eastern India which was hitherto underutilized. Besides, National Food Security Mission (NFSM) is also being implemented in these Eastern States for increasing production and productivity of wheat and rice in the districts which are not included under BGREI.*********
