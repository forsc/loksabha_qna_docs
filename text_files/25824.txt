ANSWER




                                                        Minister of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Jyotiraditya Scindia)(a) to (c) : A statement is laid on the Table of the House.******STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 150 REGARDING ''HIGH AIRFARE'' TO BE ANSWERED ON 29.07.2021  (a) to (c) The Ministry of Civil Aviation has received a representation dated 29.09.2020 from Shri P.K. Kunhalikutty, the  then Hon''ble MP(LS) and a letter dated 30.10.2020 from the Government of Kerala regarding high airfare on the Kerala-Bahrain sector.  As on date there are severe restrictions on categories of passengers eligible to travel from India to the Gulf countries. In addition the COVID situation has added to the cost of operations towards PPE kits, sanitizers, etc. However, the airfares on Gulf-Kerala routes under the air bubble are generally comparable with the fares charged by the airlines in pre-Covid times (Summer 2019 schedule). Details of sector-wise average fares charged by foreign carriers and Indian carriers on the Gulf-Kerala sector are attached at Annexure.  Fares in the air bubbles are dependent on market forces. With the repeal of the Air Corporations Act in March 1994, the tariff fixation has been deregulated and airlines are free to fix reasonable tariffs under the provisions of sub-rule (1) of rule 135 of the Aircraft Rules, 1937. Therefore, no action is called for on the part of the Government in this regard.
