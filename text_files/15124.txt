The responsibilities to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens including investigation and prosecution of crime against children rest with the respective State Governments. The State Governments are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provisions of laws.However, the Ministry of Home Affairs has issued detailed advisory to the States and UTs, inter-alia emphasizing that in case of complaint with regard to any missing children made in a police station, the same should be reduced into a First Information Report and appropriate steps should be taken to see that follow up investigation is taken up immediately thereafter. This advisory is available at www.mha.gov.in.The Ministry of Women & Child Development in order to provide outreach services to the missing children or needy children, operates Child helpline No. 1098 which is operational 24x7. The Ministry of Women & Child Development also supports Railway Childlines on major Railway Stations for providing assistance to any needy child. Further, the Ministry of Women & Child Development has developed a national tracking system for missing and vulnerable children i.e. TrackChild Portal  which  has  been implemented across --3--L.S.US.Q.NO. 3708 FOR 17.03.2020the country. The URL of the TrackChild is www.trackthemissingchild.gov.in.

Details of children who have been found, can also be reported on this platform. Khoya-Paya has been integrated as a module under TrackChild. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for tracing missing children has also been circulated to all the States and UTs for their further dissemination to all other stakeholders such as Police, Child Welfare Committees, Juvenile Justice Boards etc. The SOP lays down uniform guidelines for expediting the search and rehabilitation of missing children all over the country.****
