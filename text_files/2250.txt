Providing electricity to all the consumers including in the industrial sector is the primary responsibility of concerned State Governments/Power Distribution Companies (DISCOMs).  At present the installed generation capacity in the country is around 357 GW which is sufficient to meet the demand of electricity in the country including the industrial sector.(c) to (e) : 	As per the clause (g) and (n) of Section 14 of the Energy Conservation Act, 2001 the Government prescribed energy performance norms for efficient use of energy by high energy consuming industries in 8 sectors under National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE) through Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) initiative.  PAT cycle – I started from April 2012 under which targets were notified to reduce the Specific Energy Consumption (SEC) of 478 Designated Consumers (DCs) from 8 sectors viz. Aluminum, Cement, Chlor- Alkali, Fertilizer, Iron & Steel, Paper & Pulp, Thermal Power Plant and Textile. The overall SEC reduction targets aimed to secure total energy saving of 6.686 Million Tonne of Oil Equivalent (MTOE) in 3 years. PAT Cycle-I was completed on 31st March, 2015. The total energy savings achieved in PAT Cycle–I was 8.67 MTOE which exceeded the target by about 30 percent. This energy saving translates into avoiding of about 31 million tonne of CO2 emissions. The State/UT- wise details of achievements under the PAT Cycle-I are given at Annexure.Subsequent to PAT cycle–I, PAT cycles–II, III, IV & V have been initiated with total 956 Designated Consumers (DCs) from 13 sectors being given targets. The total targeted saving from cycles–II, III, IV and V is about 11.14 MTOE for the country. *************
