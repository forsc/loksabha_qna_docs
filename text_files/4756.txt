ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) & (b) Water bodies including rivers in the country are mainly polluted due to discharge of untreated and partially treated sewage from cities/towns and industrial effluents. Non-point sources of pollution like agricultural runoff, open defecation, runoff from solid waste dump sites, etc. also contribute to pollution. To assess the pollution levels, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in association with the State Pollution Control Board (SPCBs) monitors the water quality of rivers and lakes on a regular basis across a country through a network of 2077 monitoring stations. As per a report published by CPCB in September, 2018, 351 rivers stretches are identified as polluted. Out of these, 20 polluted stretches of rivers have been identified in Gujarat and 01 stretch in Daman Diu and Dadra Nagar Haveli, based on Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), a key indicator of organic pollution. State wise details of polluted river stretches is annexed. For lakes Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC) is currently implementing a centrally sponsored scheme namely, National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-systems (NPCA) for conservation and management of wetlands (including lakes) in the country on cost sharing basis between Central Government and respective State Governments. The scheme covers various activities such as interception, diversion and treatment of wastewater, shoreline protection, lake front development, in-situ cleaning i.e. desilting & deweeding, storm water management, bioremediation, catchment area treatment, Lake Beautification, survey & demarcation, biofencing, fisheries development, weed control, biodiversity conservation, education and awareness creation, community participation, etc. Total 65 lakes spreading in15 states have been taken up under NPCA scheme.(c) & (d) Pollution abatement of rivers is a continuous and ongoing process. It is the responsibility of the State Governments/ concerned local bodies to set up facilities for collection, transportation and treatment of sewage for abatement of pollution of rivers. The Ministry supplements the efforts of the State Governments by providing financial assistance for taking up works relating to  interception & diversion of raw sewage, laying of sewer lines, setting up of sewage treatment plants, low cost sanitation facilities, improved wood crematoria, river front/bathing ghat development, etc. Project proposals are received from the State Governments from time to time for taking up pollution abatement works in towns along various rivers, and are considered for financial assistance under the NRCP subject to their conformity with the scheme guidelines, pollution status, prioritization, appraisal by independent institutions and availability of Plan funds. For more effective conservation and management of wetlands in the country, the Central Government in consultation with the States, Union Territories, Central line Ministries and other stakeholders, have notified the Wetlands (Conservation & Management) Rules, 2017 superseding the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2010. As per the Wetlands Rules, 2017 certain activities are prohibited under the provision 4(2), which are applicable to wetlands notified by the Central Government, State Government and Union Territory Administration and to wetlands categorized as ''wetlands of international importance'' under the Ramsar Convention.
