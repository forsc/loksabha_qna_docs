ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) No, Sir. The commitment made by India in the Paris Accord, 2015 is not specific to civil aviation sector. (b) to (d): As per  the National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP) 2016, Ministry of Civil Aviation has laid down the roadmap to develop a sustainable Indian aviation industry.;    For international flights, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has formulated a scheme called CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), which envisages carbon neutral growth for international aviation after 2020.    The scheme is being implemented in two phases viz. Voluntary Phase (2021-2026) and Mandatory Phase (2027-2035).  India has decided not to join the scheme in the Voluntary phase. India has raised its voice at the ICAO Assembly Session against the design elements of CORSIA stating that they are not fair to the airlines of developing states who have potential to grow much more after 2020 compared to the airlines of developed states. India has also filed reservations with ICAO in this regard in 2016 and 2019.;      However, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has issued CAR, Section-10, Series-B, Part-I on "Climate Change Initiatives and Local Air Quality Monitoring in Civil Aviation" which stipulates the general requirements, procedures and practices to be adhered to by all stakeholders that are engaged in activities that directly or indirectly impact climate change in order to manage the adverse impact of aviation activities on the atmosphere leading to sustainable growth of the industry.
