ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) to (c) Erosion and deposition of silt is a natural process in alluvial rivers. Rivers pickup, carry and drop silt load as per their regime conditions i.e. discharge in the river, river slope, morphology, nature of silt etc. A Committee headed by Dr. B.K. Mittal, Former Chairman, Central Water Commission has opined that large scale desilting or dredging of rivers in general is not feasible technically due to several reasons like non-sustainability, non-availability of vast land required for the disposal of dredged material etc.  Cost effective measures for removal of drainage congestion in specific reaches of rivers for channel capacity improvement and navigation purposes are formulated and implemented by concerned States / agencies as per requirement. The Union Government renders assistance to States which is technical, advisory, catalytic and promotional in nature.As informed by Uttar Pradesh Government, sectorial dredging has been carried out for relieving the pressure on the banks due to flooding. Dredging has been carried out at Assi Ghat (Varanasi), Dubey Chhapra (Ballia), Katri Bichhuiya (Hardoi) and at Shuklaganj (Unnao) for varying lengths.  (d) & (e)  As informed by Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI), a project for undertaking dredging in two selected stretches Sirajganj-Daikhowa (175 km) stretch of Jamuna River and Ashuganj-Zakiganj (295 km) stretch of Khusiyara River of Bangladesh inland waterways and its maintenance, with a view to provide regular connectivity between NW-1 and NW-2 through Indo - Bangladesh Protocol route is being implemented at a cost of Rs.305 crore with India and Bangladesh sharing the cost in the ratio on 80:20 basis. Project is funded by Ministry of External Affairs on behalf of India.*****
