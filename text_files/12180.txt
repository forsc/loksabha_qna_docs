Non Communicable Disease (NCD), Overweight and Obesity and Chronic Kidney diseases5. Early Childhood Development, Anthropometry and      hand grip strength and adolescent nutrition.In addition the Government of India has launched POSHAN (Prime Minister Overarching Scheme for Holistic Nourishment) Abhiyaan, to address malnutrition in India through convergence, behaviour change, IEC advocacy, training and capacity building, innovations and demand generation. POSHAN Abhiyaan focuses on educating families on the need for nutrition and motivating them on adopting these into their behaviour. The promotion of locally available nutritious food through various community based events (CBEs), exhibitions, rallies, workshops and meetings is one of the strategies under the POSHAN Abhiyaan. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) is an important stakeholder of the POSHAN Abhiyaan. Anaemia Mukt Bharat (AMB) strategy, Defeat Diarrhea (D-2) initiative and Home Based Care of Young Children (HBYC) are the important components of the POSHAN Abhiyaan implemented by MoHFW. Ministry of Health and family Welfare has also initiated various advocacy and awareness campaigns including the “Eat Right India” Campaign, which is built on the two broad pillars of ''Eat Healthy'' and ''Eat Safe''. This aims to engage, excite and enable citizens to improve their health and wellbeing. Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Day (VHSND) platform is being used for creating community awareness on importance of balanced and healthy diet, and bringing desired changes in the dietary practices through group counselling sessions. The Government is also promoting use of fortified wheat flour, fortified rice, fortified oil and double fortified salt in public funded supplementary nutrition programmes. In order to prevent and control major Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) the National Programme for Prevention of Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke is being implemented in all the States/UTs. Under NPCDCS, NCD cell have been established at National, State and District levels for programme management, and NCD clinics are being set up at District and block levels, to provide services for early diagnosis, treatment and follow-up for common NCDs. Health promotion through behavior change with involvement of community, civil society, community based organization, schools and media etc is an important activity. The role of physical activities in health promotion and prevention of NCDs is also being adopted as key strategy. The MoHFW is implementing RMNCAH+N strategy under National Health Mission (NHM) to reduce malnutrition across the life cycle. The various intervention are micronutrients supplementation program including Anemia Mukt Bharat (AMB) and biannual Vitamin-A supplementation, management of sick children with severe acute malnutrition in Nutrition Rehabilitation Centres (NRCs), improvement of appropriate Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) Practices under Mothers Absolute Affection (MAA) programme,  National Deworming Day, Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK), Rastriya Bal Swasthya Karyakaram (RBSK) and Home Based Newborn Care.All these programs address one or other aspects related to nutrition and have the potential to improve nutritional outcomes in the country.
