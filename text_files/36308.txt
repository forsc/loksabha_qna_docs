ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) & (b) :	‘One Nation One Grid’ has already been achieved by integrating all the five regional electricity grids into one interconnected and synchronous National electricity grid in December, 2013.  Further, inter-regional links have been augmented from 35950 MW as on 31.12.2013 to 1,12,250 MW as on 28.02.2022.Synchronisation and strengthening of all regional grids have helped in optimal utilization of scarce natural resources by transfer of Power from resource centric regions to load centric regions. Further, this has led to establishment of vibrant Electricity market facilitating trading of power across regions.(c) :		Details of the inter-regional power transfer capacity of National Grid during the last three years are given below:Year	Cumulative Inter-Regional Transfer Capacity (MW)2019-20 (as on 31.03.2020)	102,0502020-21 (as on 31.03.2021)	105,0502021-22 (as on 28.02.2022)	112,250(d) & (e) : 	There is no proposal of the Government for having uniform electricity tariff for all sectors of power in country.   As per provision of the Electricity Act, 2003, the responsibility for fixing retail supply tariff of electricity falls under the purview of respective State Electricity Regulatory Commissions. Retail Supply tariff of electricity depends upon various factors like power purchase cost and other operational and financial parameters of Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) and it varies across the DISCOMs throughout the country. (f) & (g) :	As per the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003, the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions while determining the tariffs are guided by the Tariff Policy. Tariff Policy, 2016 provides that the State Government can provide subsidy to the extent they can consider appropriate as per provision of section 65 of the Act by adopting the following broad principles:i.	Consumers below poverty line who consume power below a specified level, as prescribed in the National Electricity Policy may receive a special support through cross subsidy. Tariffs for such designated group of consumers will be at least 50% of the average cost of supply.ii.	For achieving the objective that the tariff progressively reflects the cost of supply of electricity, the Appropriate Commission would notify a roadmap in such a manner that tariffs are brought within ±20% of the average cost of supply. The roadmap would also have intermediate milestones, based on the approach of a gradual reduction in cross subsidy.**********
