ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                                 (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) As per Census 2001 and 2011, the difference between Rural and Urban Population is as under: 	                            2001	                                 2011Urban Population	28,61,19,689	                                    37,71,06,125Rural Population	74,26,17,747	                                    83,37,48,852Difference between Rural and Urban population 45,64,98,058	45,66,42,727(b) Estimates of Urban Population according to census 2021 are not yet available. However, as per report of the Technical Group on population projections for India and States, 2011-2036, based on Census 2011, published by the National Commission on Population (NCP), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt. of India, the projected urban population  for India as on 1st March 2021 will be 46,93,44,000 out of total projected population of 1,36,30,06,000.  Thus, estimated urban population in 2021 will mean an increase of 24.46 percent in comparison to urban population as per census 2011. (c) ‘Land’ and ‘Colonisation’ are State subjects and therefore, it is the responsibility of the State/Union Territory (UT) Governments to frame policies and implement schemes for providing facilities to the cities. However, Government of India through various programmatic interventions viz. Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U), Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHCs) Scheme,  Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Smart Cities Mission, Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U), Metro Rail Development Policy, Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana National Urban livelihood Mission (DAY-NULM) and PM Street Vendor’s AtmaNirbhar Nidhi  (PM SVANidhi) have been making overarching efforts by assisting States/UTs both technically and financially to provide facilities viz. housing shortage, urban infrastructure in the sectors of water supply, sewerage and septage management, storm water drainage, green spaces & parks, non-motorised urban transport, sanitation services, metro rail development and assisting urban migrants/poor to improve skills and uplift economically.                                                *****
