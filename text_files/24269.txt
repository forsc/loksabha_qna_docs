                                                        MINISTER OF LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI BHUPENDER YADAV)(a) & (b):	Section 9(1) of the Code on Wages, 2019, provides that the Central Government shall fix floor wage taking into account minimum living standards of a worker in such manner as may be prescribed; provided that different floor wage may be fixed for different geographical areas. It is stated that the provisions of the Code on Wages, 2019, have not come into force. (c):		Under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, the fixation of minimum wages for the tea garden labourers, falls under the purview of State Government which is the appropriate Government to fix/revise the minimum wages. The tea plantation workers are paid wages as per the negotiated agreement reached through a process of collective bargaining between the Producer Associations and Workers Unions under the aegis of the respective State Governments.******
