                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a):  	As per the information made available by High Courts on the MIS web-portal of the Department of Justice, the sanctioned strength, working strength and vacancies of Judicial Officers in District and Subordinate Courts, State/UT-wise, including the State of Tamil Nadu, as on 05.02.2019, is given in Annexure I. A statement showing vacancies in the Supreme Court and High Courts, including the Madras High Court, as on 01.12.2019 is given in Annexure II.(b): 	As per the Memorandum of Procedure for appointment and transfer of Chief Justices and Judges of High Court, the Chief Justice of the High Court is required to initiate the proposals for filling up of vacancies of Judges in the High Court six months prior to the occurrence of vacancies. However, this timeline is rarely adhered to. Filling up of vacancies in High Courts is a continuous, integrated and collaborative process between the Executive and the Judiciary. It requires consultation and approval from various Constitutional Authorities both at the State and Centre level. While every effort is made to fill up the existing vacancies expeditiously, vacancies do keep on arising on account of retirement, resignation or elevation of Judges and increase in Judge Strength. Due to combined efforts of Government  and Judiciary, 126 Judges in 2016, 115 Judges in 2017, 108  Judges in 2018 and 72 Judges in 2019 (as on 05.12.2019) have been appointed in High Courts.		As per the Constitutional framework, the selection and appointment of judges in subordinate courts is the responsibility of the High Courts and State Governments concerned. However, the Union Government, on its part, has been taking up the matter of filling up of vacant positions in District & Subordinate Courts with the States and High Courts. In August, 2018, Union Minister of Law & Justice has written to all Chief Justices of High Courts to monitor status of vacancies regularly and to ensure proper coordination with State Public Service Commission to fill up vacant posts stipulated by Supreme Court in Malik Mazhar Sultan case. In addition, series of meetings were held with Registrars General of all High Courts and Law Secretaries of all State Governments / UTs through Video Conferencing in January, 2018, July, 2018, November, 2018 and September, 2019 to follow up on filling up posts of Judicial Officers in District and Subordinate Courts. Department of Justice has hosted a MIS web-portal on its website for reporting and monitoring of sanctioned and working strength, and vacancies of Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Courts on monthly basis. Sanctioned and working strength of Judicial Officers in District and Subordinate Courts has been increased as follows:As on	Sanctioned Strength	Working Strength31.12.2013	19,518	15,11505.12.2019	23,597	18,144 (c): 	The Supreme Court of India with an objective to revisit and implement the recommendations of Law Commission of India in its various reports to promote Court Management, Case Management and improve Administration of Justice, established the scheme of National Court Management Systems (NCMS) in 2012 for enhancing timely justice under overall control of Chief Justice of India.  A National Court Management System Committee(NCMS Committee) was constituted by the Supreme Court to facilitate development of policy initiative in order to reform and strengthen the judicial system and enhance quality, responsiveness and timely of judicial administration. The Policy and Action Plan of the NCMS provides for proposals to be developed by the NCMS Committee on setting measurable performance standards for courts, adoption of case management systems, standardization of judicial data and statistics and adoption of human resource plan for courts.  The plan, inter-alia, outlines a broad framework for case management, which includes settling issues, encouraging parties to resort to Alternate Dispute Resolution, extensive use of Order X of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in civil matters and fixing a time schedule for resolution of cases.  However, it was left open to High Courts to implement the recommendations relating to case management. All High Courts have constituted State Court Management System (SCMS) Committee to do similar exercise at the State Level. Similarly, District Court Management System Committee has been constituted at the District level.(d): 	Appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts is made under Article 124 and 217 of the Constitution which does not provide for reservation for any caste or class of persons. Therefore, no caste or class wise data of Judges is maintained. However, the Government been requesting the Chief Justices of the High Courts that while sending proposals for appointment of Judges, due consideration be given to suitable candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, women and  Minorities. The number of women Judges working in the Supreme Court is three (3). High Court wise position in respect of Women Judges is given in Annexure III.*****Annexure - ISanctioned Strength / Working Strength and vacancies in District & Subordinate Courts as on 05.12.2019Sr. No.	Name of State / UT	Total Sanctioned  Strength	Total Working Strength	Total Vacancy 1	Andaman and Nicobar	0	13	-132	Andhra Pradesh	597	529	683	Arunachal Pradesh	41	27	144	Assam	441	412	295	Bihar	1847	1152	6956	Chandigarh	30	29	17	Chhattisgarh	468	394	748	D & N Haveli	3	3	09	Daman & Diu	4	3	110	Delhi	799	680	11911	Goa	50	43	712	Gujarat	1506	1185	32113	Haryana	772	475	29714	Himachal Pradesh	175	152	2315	Jammu and Kashmir	290	232	5816	Jharkhand	677	462	21517	Karnataka	1345	1106	23918	Kerala	536	461	7519	Lakshadweep	3	3	020	Madhya Pradesh	2021	1504	51721	Maharashtra	2189	1942	24722	Manipur	55	39	1623	Meghalaya	97	49	4824	Mizoram	64	46	1825	Nagaland	33	25	826	Odisha	919	771	14827	Puducherry	26	11	1528	Punjab	675	579	9629	Rajasthan	1428	1121	30730	Sikkim	25	19	631	Tamil Nadu	1224	1087	13732	Telangana	413	334	7933	Tripura	120	96	2434	Uttar Pradesh	3416	2012	140435	Uttarakhand	294	228	6636	West Bengal	1014	920	94	TOTAL	23597	18144	5453Annexure - IISanctioned strength, Working Strength and Vacancies of Judges in the Supreme Court of India and High Courts (As on 01.12.2019)Sl.
