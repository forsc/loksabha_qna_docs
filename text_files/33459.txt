These inter alia may be on account of mismatch between PAN and Aadhaar details in respect of information regarding name, date/year of birth, mobile number for receipt of OTP for linking of PAN, etc. If the mismatch is on account of Aadhaar Card details, the taxpayer may get the Aadhaar details corrected by concerned authority. Wherever the mismatch or difficulty regarding PAN card itself is brought to notice, action is taken and resolution is provided to the taxpayer.*****
