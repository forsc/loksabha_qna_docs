ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): No, Sir. No security lapses have been noticed by Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in the apron and ground handling services during security checks conducted at airports as DGCA is the safety regulator. However, a total of 39 cases of security lapses at the airports have been noticed by the security regulator, Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) during last 3 years.(c): BCAS is the regulatory authority for civil aviation security which brings  security lapses to the notice of the concerned agencies for taking appropriate corrective/remedial action. BCAS also issues technical guidelines/instructions from time to time to avoid such lapses. Some of the steps taken to strengthen security arrangements include deployment of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) at airports, deployment of Quick Reaction Teams (QRTs) at major airports and regular monitoring of security arrangements through inspections and dummy checks. Based on the observations, corrective actions are taken as per the appropriate regulation.
