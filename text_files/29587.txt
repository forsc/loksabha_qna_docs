As per the latest India State of Forest Report (ISFR)-2019 published by Forest Survey of India, Dehradun, the total Forest and Tree Cover (FTC) of the country is 8,07,276 Square Kilometres, which is 24.56% of the geographical area of the country. There is an increase of 5,188 Square Kilometresas compared to that of FTC in ISFR-2017, and 13,209Square Kilometresas compared to FTC in ISFR, 2015. The Forest Cover of the country as per ISFR-2019 is 7,12,249 Square Kilometers which is 21.67% of the geographical area of the country whereas the Forest Cover of the country as per ISFR-1989after the adoption of National Forest Policy, 1988 was6,38,804Square Kilometres constituting 19.43% of the geographical area of the country. There has been an increase of 2.24% in the forest cover of the country since 1989.

One of the goals under NDC is to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030 and the Government of India has taken several initiatives for fulfilling its commitment to meet this target.  Afforestation and tree plantation activities are carried out by the States and Union Territories (UTs) with people’s participation. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change provides financial assistance to States/UTs under various Centrally Sponsored Schemes including, inter alia, National Afforestation Programme, Development of Wildlife Habitat and Forest Fire Prevention and Management Scheme for supporting such efforts. Compensatory afforestation is also undertaken by the States/UTs for compensating the diverted forest lands.Further, the Government of India is implementing National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), comprising of eight Missions, which provides an overarching policy framework for all climate actions in the country. Under NAPCC, the National Mission for a Green India (GIM) aims at protecting, restoring and enhancing India’s forest cover and responding to climate change by means of plantation activities in forest and non-forest areas. GIM was launched in 2015-16 and a total sum of Rs. 492.20 crores has been released under the scheme to fifteen States and one Union Territory for undertaking afforestation activities over an area of 1,84,161 hectares including restoration of wetlands which contribute to achievingIndia’sNationally Determined Contributions (NDC)target.*****
