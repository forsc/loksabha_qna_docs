ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) and (b)	The National Highways (NHs) in the country was numbered as NH-1 to NH-236 series with some of the NHs having suffixes such as A, B, C and so on. This system of numbering of NHs did not enable appreciation of relative locations of the NHs or their orientations. Accordingly, the Government revised the numbering system of NHs duly considering the best practices followed World-wide. The modified numbering system of NHs enables a better appreciation of the relative locations of the NHs as well as their broad orientations as a systematic pattern of their numbering has been adopted.As per the modified numbering system of NHs, the NHs predominantly along the North-South direction and along the East-West direction are considered as Primary Routes. The Primary Routes along the North-South direction are numbered in increasing order from east to west direction as even numbers in 2 digits and the Primary Routes along the East-West direction are numbered in increasing order from north to south direction as odd numbers in 2 digits. The Secondary Routes as those routes which are either circumferential routes around a Primary Route or a Spur Route originating from a Primary Route. The Secondary Routes are numbered in 3 digits, with 2 digits as same as that of the Primary Route Number and the third digit prefixing the 2 digits as either even number or odd number depending upon whether it is a circumferential route around the Primary Route or it is a spur route originating from the Primary Route. Suffixes, such as A, B, C, D, etc. are also used for Secondary Routes with gap numbering in order to accommodate present as well as future such routes.The Ministry had, accordingly, revised the numbering of NHs in a comprehensive manner vide Gazette notification dated 05.03.2010, subsequently amended vide Gazette notification dated 04.04.2011.(c) and (d)	The Ministry has issued Standard Operating Procedure for installation of kilometer stones for the NHs as per the rationalized numbering system of NHs.*****
