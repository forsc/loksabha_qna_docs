                                                        A N S W E RMINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a):      As per information available 353 Gram Nyayalayas have been notified so far by eleven States, out of which 221 are operational. The State-wise details of number of Gram Nyayalayas notified and operational, including State of Rajasthan, are given as under:Sl. No.	Name of the State	Gram Nyayalyas Notified	Gram Nyayalayas operational	 1	Madhya Pradesh	89	87	2	Rajasthan	45	45	3	Karnataka	2	0	4	Orissa	22	16	5	Maharashtra	39	24	6	Jharkhand	6	1	7	Goa	2	0	8	Punjab	2	2	9	Haryana	3	2	10	Uttar Pradesh	113	14	11	Kerala	30	30	Total	353	221	 No Gram Nyayalaya has been notified or operational in the State of Tripura.(b):      Section 3 (3) of the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008 provides that Gram Nyayalayas shall be in addition to the ordinary courts established under any other law for the time being in force.  For every Gram Nyayalaya, the State Government shall in consultation with the High Court appoint a Nyayadhikari in terms of Section 3(5) of the above Act. The provisions of appeals from any judgment, sentence or order of a Gram Nyayalaya in criminal cases and civil cases is laid down in Sections 33 and 34 of the said Act which is placed at Annexure.  Gram Nyayalayas shall deemed to be a Court of Judicial Magistrate of the First Class and exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction to the extent provided under the Act. The Nyayadhikari periodically visit the villages under his jurisdiction to hold mobile courts and conduct proceedings.  (c):   As per Section 3(1) of the Act, the State Government, after consultation with the respective High Court may, by notification, establish one or more Gram Nyayalayas for every Panchayat at intermediate level or a group of contiguous Panchayats at intermediate level in a district or where there is no Panchayat at intermediate level in any State, for group of contiguous Gram Panchayats. The Central Government has no role in establishment of the Gram Nyayalayas. However,    the issues affecting operationalization of the Gram Nyayalayas were discussed in the Conference of Chief Justices of High Courts and Chief Ministers of the States on 7th April, 2013. It was decided in the Conference that the State Governments and High Courts should decide the question of setting up of  Gram Nyayalayas wherever feasible, taking into account the local issues and situation. It is, therefore, upto State Governments and High Courts to set up Gram Nyayalayas accordingly.********** AnnexureExtract of Gram Nyayalaya Act, 2008 referred to Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. †2770 for Reply on 11.03.202033.
