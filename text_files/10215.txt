                                                        (a) : Yes, Sir. The details of proposal received from Karnataka State is as under: (i) The State Government of Karnataka had sent a proposal under the scheme of Special Central Assistance to Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan (SCA to SCSP) for release of Rs. 50.00 Crore during the year 2019-20. However, the grants could not be released due to non submission of fund Utilization Certificates for the funds released during 2017-18 and 2018-19, by the State Government of Karnataka.   (ii) National Safai Karamchairs Finance and Development Corporation (NSKFDC) received a proposal from “Navajoythi Seva Sangha (R)”, Gopalpura, Bangalore-560023 regarding release of funds during current F.Y. 2019-20. The proposal has been rejected by NSKFDC, because NSKFDC provides financial assistance at concessional rates of interest for various income generating activities to its target group (Safai Karamchairs (including waste)/Manual Scavengers and their dependants) through its Channelizing Agencies under various loan schemes.  In addition to above, the Government through National Backward Classes Finance and Development Corporation (NBCFDC) facilitates Skill Development Training under Skill Development Training Programme (SDTP) schemes to target group in broad conformance to the Common Norms for Up-gradation of technical and entrepreneurial skills through Government Training Institutes (TIs) and Sector Skill council (SSCs) who are in turn allotting the Training Programme to various training partners affiliated to them which includes NGOs/VOs as well.(b) &(c): The number of beneficiaries benefited by National Backward Classes Finance and Development Corporation (NBCFDC) in State of Karnataka and training institutes facilitating training programme year wise are given below:S.No.	Year	Number of beneficiaries1.	2014-15	2702.	2015-16	5003.	2016-17	7064.	2017-18	3395.	2019-20	559*****
