The Central Government supplements the efforts of the State Governments and provides requisite logistics and financial support.  For providing relief to the affected people in case of 12 notified natural disasters, State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) is placed at the disposal of the State Governments.  Additional financial assistance is provided from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) in case of disaster of ‘severe nature’.  -2/…-2-LS.USQ. NO.3665 FOR 10.08.2021The allocation of SDRF to States is based on the recommendations of successive Finance Commissions, set up under Article 280 of the Constitution, from time to time. Further, the disbursal of assistance is governed by the Guidelines and Items and Norms of assistance from SDRF and NDRF, which are framed in consultation with all Stakeholders, including States and which are available on Ministry of Home Affairs website at https://ndmindia.mha.gov.in/images/NDRFSDRF_06042017.pdf and https://ndmindia.mha.gov.in/images/pdf/SDRF-NDRFNorms-dated8april2015.pdf, respectively.   As per laid down procedure, a three tier system is followed for calculation of the additional financial assistance from NDRF. Firstly, an on-the-spot assessment is made by an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT), comprising of representatives of sectoral Ministries/Departments, alongwith officials of the State concerned. The report of IMCT is then considered by the Sub-Committee of National Executive Committee (SC-NEC) chaired by Union Home Secretary and consisting of representatives of various Ministries concerned.  Subsequently, the recommendations of SC-NEC are considered and approved by the High Level Committee (HLC) chaired by Hon’ble Union Home Minister and consisting of  Union Finance Minister, Union Agriculture Minister and Vice-Chairman, NITI Aayog as Members.  Quantum of funds is released from   NDRF   after   approval   of   HLC.  Further,   the  financial   assistance     under -3/…-3-LS.USQ.
