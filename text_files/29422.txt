                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) and (b): Health is a state subject. The Department of Health & Family Welfare, however, provides technical and financial support to the States/UTs under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), as part of National Health Mission (NHM), based on the proposals received from the States/UTs and subject to the resource envelope. Cancer is an integral part of NPCDCS. The State/UT wise details of approvals and utilisation under NPCDCS under Flexible Pool for Non-Communicable Diseases programme (NCD) under NHM during the last three years i.e. from the FY 20l8-19 to 2020-21 is given at Annexure. Bijnor District in Uttar Pradesh has received Rs. 126.15 lakh, Rs. 182 lakhs, and Rs. 121.66 lakhs in the Financial Year of 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 respectively under NPCDCS Program.Cancer patients are getting treatment at various health facilities in the health care delivery system including Medical Colleges, Central Institutes like AIIMS and private sector hospitals. Relevant data related to patients, including cancer patients, registered and under treatment, is maintained by the Institutions and Hospitals concerned at their own level.(c) and (d): “Public Health & Hospitals” being a State subject, the primary responsibility for strengthening public healthcare system and provision of quality healthcare services at the public healthcare facilities, including up gradation / modernization of public healthcare facilities, lies with respective State Governments.  To address the healthcare challenges, particularly in rural areas, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in 2005 to supplement the efforts of the State/UT governments to provide accessible, affordable and quality healthcare to all those who access public health facilities. Currently, NRHM is a sub-mission of National Health Mission (NHM).NHM support is provided to States/ UTs for setting up of new facilities as per norms and upgradation of existing facilities for bridging the infrastructure gaps based on the requirement posed by them in the State PIP. District NCD Clinic at Bijnor is established under NPCDCS Program. Under Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission, there is a provision of development of critical care hospital blocks in district with population more than 5 lakhs and integrated public health labs in every district.
