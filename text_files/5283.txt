(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	Focused attention on increasing awareness about the schemes among all stakeholders and appropriate provisioning of resources for the same has been envisaged in the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY).   Therefore, to enhance the awareness about the scheme among all the stakeholders Government regularly undertakes comprehensive publicity and awareness programme to educate the farmers about the benefit of crop insurance schemes.   After launch of PMFBY during 2016, 525 one day seminar/kisan fairs were organized at various Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) throughout the country.   Further, under the Central Sector Scheme of “Mass Media Support to Agriculture Extension Scheme (MMSAE)”, Government undertaking publicity and creates awareness about schemes of the Department including PMFBY.   Audio Visual spot on PMFBY is telecast/broadcast through DD, DD Kisan and AIR under sponsored programme of Mass Media Scheme from time to time.PMFBY was also one of the focused area for Krishi Kalyan Abhiyan, implemented in two phases during Kharif 2018 and Rabi 2018-19 in the selected aspirational districts.   The campaign focused on disseminating information through group meetings of farmers, training of functionaries and leveraging the potential of Gram Sabhas in respective Gram Panchayats.Contd….2/-- 2 -In addition, several communications have also been sent to the public representatives including Members of Parliament, representatives of Panchayti Raj Institutions etc.  to encourage farmers to take benefit of the scheme. Thereafter, in addition to above Government has also taken several initiatives including active involvement of all stakeholders especially States and implementing insurance companies for conduct of publicity campaign/awareness programmes including organization of camps in the rural areas to build farmer awareness about crop insurance schemes.    Insurance companies have been asked to utilize 0.5% of gross premium collected by them for publicity and awareness generation.

For non-loanee farmers since crop insurance is optional, the Common Service Centres (CSCs) and online enrolment have been activated to provide the services besides traditional modes like banks and insurance intermediaries.   Due to the efforts made by the Government coverage of non-loanee, for whom the coverage is voluntary, has increased from 5% under erstwhile schemes to 34%, which shows the acceptability of the scheme on voluntary basis.
