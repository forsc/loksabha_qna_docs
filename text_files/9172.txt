Under the Scheme, as on 29.11.2019, more than 3.00 crore beneficiaries have been enrolled, 2.37 crore beneficiaries have been trained, out of which 1.74 crore beneficiaries have been certified by duly certified by 3rd party Certifying Agencies.(d):	No separate fund is allocated in PMGDISHA Scheme for setting up of basic computer infrastructure in the villages.
