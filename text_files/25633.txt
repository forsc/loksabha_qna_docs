It is a forum where the disputes/cases pending in the court of law or at pre-litigation stage are settled/compromised amicably. Under the Legal Services Authorities (LSA) Act, 1987, an award made by a Lok Adalat is deemed to be a decree of a civil court and is final and binding on all parties and no appeal lies against thereto before any court. In order to reduce the pendency of cases in courts and also to settle the disputes at pre-litigation stage, Lok Adalats are organized by Legal Services Institutions at such intervals as it deems fit. Lok Adalat is not a permanent establishment. However, as per Section 19 of the LSA Act, Lok Adalats are organized by Legal Services Institutions as per requirement. National Lok Adalats are organized simultaneously in all Taluks, Districts and High Courts on a pre-fixed date.	In addition, Section 22B of the LSA Act also provides for establishment of Permanent Lok Adalat by every State Authority to deal with cases of public utility services at pre-litigation stage. 356 Permanent Lok Adalats are functioning in various States & UTs. State-wise Permanent Lok Adalats and cases settled is at Annexure-A. State-wise cases settled (both at pre-litigative stage and pending cases) by State Lok Adalats and National Lok Adalats during the last three years is at Annexure B and C respectively.	To facilitate access to justice during COVID times, the Legal Services Authorities have ingeniously integrated technology into conventional methods of justice delivery and moved Lok Adalat to the Virtual Platform on 27.06.2020. From June, 2020 to May, 2021, more than 4.42 lakh cases have been disposed of by these E-Lok Adalats.(d) State-wise details of cases disposed of (both Pre-litigative and pending cases of High Courts and Lower courts) in State Lok Adalats and National Lok Adalats are at Annexure B and C respectively.************ 						Annexure-AStatement as referred to in reply to the Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 122 for 28.07.2021 raised by Dr. Sanjay Jaiswal - Lok Adalats A Statement containing the information of cases settled by Permanent Lok Adalats (Public Utility Services) during the last three calendar years viz. 2018 to 2020 and the current year 2021 (upto May)S.
