ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (c)  Yes Sir. The drafting of the proposed legislation called “The Emigration Bill, 2019” has been completed after extensive inter Ministerial consultations as well as separate consultations with relevant stakeholders and Governments of States and Union Territories. Three rounds of comprehensive sectoral consultations were held with concerned stakeholders as per the following:i)	 Inter-Ministerial discussions with concerned Ministries on September 26,2018 under chairmanship of General (Dr) V.K. Singh, the then Minister of State for External Affairs;ii)	  Discussions with Federations of Recruitment Agents, International Organizations, Think-tanks, Business organizations and Academia under chairmanship of Shri Dnyaneshwar M. Mulay, the then Secretary (OIA/CPV) on November 20, 2018.; and -2/…-2-LS.US.Q.NO.3736 FOR 16.07.2019iii)	Discussions with State Governments and Union Territories under chairmanship of General (Dr) V.K. Singh (Retd), the then Minister of State for External Affairs on November, 30th, 2018.		The feedback received from these consultations has been duly incorporated in the proposed Bill. 	Subsequent to this, the Bill had been placed in public domain through MEA’s website and social media platforms. Several suggestions/comments were received which have been suitably incorporated in the Bill.	The proposed legislation seeks to establish a robust, transparent and comprehensive emigration management framework that facilitates safe and orderly migration, harnesses our demographic dividend, empowers our migrants proceeding for overseas employment and strengthen their welfare and protection during all stages of migration. Regulatory mechanisms with well-defined roles and responsibilities proposed under the Bill involve active participation by State Governments that will ensure greater transparency, necessary coordination and higher efficiency amongst all stakeholders.*****
