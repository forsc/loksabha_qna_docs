ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (d) Opening of Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) is a continuous process. KVs are opened primarily to cater to the educational needs of the wards of transferable Central Government Employees including Defence & Para-Military personnel, Central Autonomous Bodies, Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and Central Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL) by providing a common programme of education. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations and committing resources for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities for opening of new KVs have to compete with other proposals under the “Challenge Method”. There are 122 KVs, including one KV at Barabanki, functional in the State of Uttar Pradesh. Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan has informed that no proposal in the prescribed proforma has been received for opening of another KV in Barabanki and there is no proposal under consideration of the Government to introduce second shift in the KV, Barabanki.*****
