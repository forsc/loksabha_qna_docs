Administration and management of prisons is the responsibility of State Governments.  However, the Ministry of Home Affairs has issued advisories to States & UTs for steps to be taken by them for providing free legal aid to undertrials and for setting up Lok Adalats/ Special courts in prisons for expediting the review of cases of undertrials. MHA has also circulated the Model Prison Manual 2016 to all States and Union Territories, which has a chapter on ‘Legal Aid’ which provides  for  facilities   which   may   be   provided  to  undertrials  viz.  legal  defence, -3-L.S.US.Q.NO.3816 FOR 16.07.2019interview with lawyers, signing of Vakalatnama, application to Courts for legal aid at Government cost etc.  The National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) provides free legal service to all under trial prisoners through its legal service clinics running in jails all over India.  NALSA had recently prepared guidelines in the form of “Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Under-Trial Review Committees”.  The SOP has been circulated by the Ministry of Home Affairs to all States and UTs on 18.2.2019.  In the year 2016, 929 undertrial prisoners were released by the States and UTs under Section 436 A of Cr.P.C.*******
