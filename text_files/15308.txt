ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF MINES, COAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a): As per the information available with Indian Bureau of Mines, 111 mines in public sector and 1034 mines in private sector were functional / working as on 01.04.2019.(b): The safety of workers employed in the mines is dealt with as per the Mines Act, 1952 and Rules & Regulations made thereunder. Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS) under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, Government of India administers this Act for ensuring safety of the persons employed in mines. To ensure that the mine workers are provided with adequate safety measures while working in the mines, DGMS undertakes inspections of mines and takes measures such as pointing out contraventions, withdrawal of permission, issue of improvement notices, prohibition of employment, informal stoppages and prosecution in the court of law, so as to enforce safety norms and standards. (c): It is mandatory for mining lessees to follow stipulated rules and regulations in regard to carrying out mining operations. Mining activities can be undertaken only after obtaining all statutory clearances from respective departments.(d): Yes, Sir. During last five years, the Government has introduced important reforms to open up the mineral sector to ensure its contribution in achieving the national policy goals. Major reforms included enactment of the Mines and Mineral (Development & Regulations) (MMDR) (Amendment) Act 2015 which made the process of allocation of mineral concession completely open and transparent by introducing mineral auctions with active participation of the State Governments. Section 10C (2) of MMDR Act, 1957 has been amended through the Mineral Laws (Amendment) Act, 2020, to provide for incentives to Non Exclusive Reconnaissance Permit (NERP) holders. This will pave the way for exploration of deep-seated and other notified minerals and their auction. *****
