ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (d) GAIL has informed that in September 2012, GAIL engaged a consultant to undertake a feasibility study for exploring the possibility of setting-up Floating Storage & Re-gasification Unit (FSRU) project(s) in upper part of the east coast of India which would facilitatedevelopment of natural gas market in eastern part of India. The consultant undertook the site screening study and shortlisted two locations, one falling near Dhamra Port and the other close to Paradip Port.Before finalizing the location, it was decided to have consultations with Indian Ports Association and Govt. of Odhisha. Meanwhile, Paradip Port Trust also approached GAIL and expressed their interest in establishment of the LNG regasification terminal in the Paradip Port waters. Accordingly, GAIL entered into an MoU with Paradip Port Trust on 26.10.2013 for a period of three years. However, during the meeting held in March, 2015, it was discussed that as gas demand in the eastern part of the country would take some time to mature, setting up of two competing LNG terminals at round the same time in such close proximity would not be commercially viable on standalone basis.A non-binding MoU between Adani Petroleum Terminal Private Limited (APTPL) and Dhamra LNG Terminal Pvt. Ltd (DLTPL) – a subsidiary of APTPL, IOCL and GAIL was signed on 21.09.2016 under which the equity structure of DLTPL has been agreed as APTPL: 50%, IOCL: 39%, GAIL: 11% subject to management approvals of IOCL and GAIL and successful negotiation of the respective Regasification Agreements. The MoU has expired on 20.09.2018. Further GAIL and IOCL have informed that no capital expenditure has been made by them on this Project.
