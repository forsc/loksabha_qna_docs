ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  Water being a State subject, initiatives on sustainable water management including conservation and water harvesting in the Country is primarily States’ responsibility.  However, the important measures taken by the Central Government for conservation, management of ground water and effective implementation of rain water harvesting in the country are at the following URL: http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf.In addition, a number of States have done notable work in the field of water conservation/harvesting.  Of these, mention can be made of ‘Mukhyamantri Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan’ in Rajasthan, ‘Jalyukt Shibar’ in Maharashtra, ‘Sujalam Sufalam Abhiyan’ in Gujarat, ‘Mission Kakatiya’ in Telangana, Neeru Chettu’ in Andhra Pradesh, Jal Jeevan Hariyali in Bihar, ‘Jal Hi Jeevan’ in Haryana among others.Government of India launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan, a time bound campaign with a mission mode approach intended to improve water availability including ground water conditions in the water stressed blocks of 256 districts in India. In this regard, teams of officers from Central Government along-with technical officers from Ministry of Jal Shakti were deputed to visit water stressed districts and to work in close collaboration with district level officials to undertake suitable interventions.Contd…P/2//2//Central Government supports construction of water harvesting and conservation works primarily through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and Pradhan mantra Krishi Sinchayee Yojana- Watershed Development Component (PMKSY-WDC).(b) Drinking water is a State subject and Government of India supplements the efforts of States by providing financial and technical assistance to States/UTs including Madhya Pradesh. It is the States that plan, design, approve, implement, operate and maintain water supply schemes.			To enable every rural household to have Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC) by 2024, Department of Drinking Water & Sanitation, Ministry of Jal Shakti has launched Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM). The funds provided to the States under JJM can be utilized for providing safe drinking water to water quality affected areas on priority.Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, through “Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT)”, supplements the efforts of the States/ Union Territories (UTs) in providing water supply, sewerage & septage management, storm water drainage etc in 500 cities/towns across India (covering about 22.50 Crore population) with a total outlay of Rs. 1,00,000 crore including Central Assistance of Rs. 35,990 crore during FY 2015-2016 to FY 2019-2020. The total State Annual Action Plans (SAAPs) approved for the entire Mission period is Rs.77,640 crore out of which Rs.39,011 crore (around 50%) has been allocated to water supply.(c)  Ground water levels in various parts of the Country are declining because of continuous withdrawal due to reasons such as increased demand of fresh water for various uses, vagaries of rainfall, increased population, industrialization & urbanization etc.  Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) is periodically monitoring the ground water levels throughout the Country on a regional scale, through a network of monitoring wells. In order to assess the decline in water level on a long-term basis, Pre-monsoon water level data collected by CGWB during Pre-monsoon 2019 has been compared with the decadal average (2009-2018). Analysis of water level data indicates that about 61% of the wells monitored have registered decline in ground water levels. (d) & (e)  The expenditure made on water related works taken up under MGNREGS  during last three years and current year as uploaded by the States (including Madhya Pradesh) is at Annexure.***** ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to part (d) & (e) of Unstarred Q.
