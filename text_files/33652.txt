                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI FAGGAN SINGH KULASTE)(a)    ‘Rural Roads’ is a State subject and   Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana-I (PMGSY-I) was a one-time special intervention to provide rural connectivity, by way of a single all-weather road, to the eligible unconnected habitations in the core network. PMGSY-II was launched in the year 2013, with a target to upgrade 50,000 Kms of the existing rural road network to improve its overall efficiency as a provider of transportation services for people, goods and services. All States have already been sanctioned their allocation under PMGSY-II. Under PMGSY-II, 49,885 km road length has been sanctioned for Rs. 31,802.39 crore, out of which, as on 03.02.2022, 46,136 km has been completed by incurring expenditure of Rs. 25,243.04 crore including state share. PMGSY-II is targeted for completion by September 2022. The details of road length sanctioned, completed and expenditure incurred under PMGSY-II are given in Annexure. (b)     Under PMGSY-II, in the State of Maharashtra, total 2,619 km road length was sanctioned for Rs. 1,572.58 crore. Out of which, as on 03.02.2022, 2,585.41 km has been constructed by incurring expenditure of Rs.1,502.31 crore including state share.(c & d) The status of progress of roads under other verticals of PMGSY in the State of Maharashtra is given below: -Vertical	   Sanctioned	               Completed	                     Balance*	       Roads 	Length  Bridges    Roads  Length    Bridges      Roads   Length   Bridges              (Nos.)

The target date for completion of PMGSY-I work is September 2022. Also 509 km of road length and 94 bridges under Road Connectivity Project for Left Wing Extremism Affected Area (RCPLWEA) are pending for completion. The target date for completion of RCPLWEA is March 2023. The State has submitted proposal of 4 Long Span Bridges (LSBs) under Road Connectivity Project for Left Wing Extremism Affected Area (RCPLWEA). Pre-Empowered (Pre-EC) meeting has been held to consider the above proposal. Compliance report on the observations of Pre-EC is still awaited from the State.  The state of Maharashtra has been allocated 6,550 km road length under PMGSY-III, out of which the State has been sanctioned 2925.92 km of roads. The State has submitted another proposal of 2952 km road length under PMGSY-III. The State is required to modify the project reports based on the technical observations of the State Technical Agencies (STAs), Principal Technical Agency (PTA) and National Rural Infrastructure Development Agency (NRIDA) before they can be put before the Empowered Committee for sanction.                                    ******
