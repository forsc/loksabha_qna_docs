However, the situation improved with time and production and exports looked up.  At the same time, covid pandemic also opened new window of opportunities. A new industry with production valued at approx. Rs.7000 Crore has been developed wherein over 1100 indigenous manufactures all over the country are now producing a peak of 4.5 lakh units of PPE Body Coveralls per day. India has become Atma Nirbhar –self reliant and also the second largest PPE manufacturer in the world.(b):	Details of textiles exports to China from the country during last three years are given as under:                                                                                                                                (Figure in USD million)         #	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21China	2194.89 	1138.73	1567.94(c):	The Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Government of India had fixed Minimum Support Prices for medium staple cotton at Rs. 5515 per quintal and long staple cotton at Rs. 5825 per quintal, respectively for the current cotton season 2020-21 by raising Rs. 260 per quintal in case of Medium Staple Cotton and Rs. 275 per quintal in case of Long Staple Cotton.

During cotton season 2020-21 (up to 23.07.2021), CCI has procured seed cotton equivalent to around 91.893 lakh bales under MSP Operations.
