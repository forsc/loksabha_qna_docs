                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):	As per National Cancer Registry Programme of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the estimated incidence of cancer cases in India and Odisha during 2014 to 2018 is given below:Estimated incidence of cancer casesYear	India	Odisha2014	13,28,229	45,7362015	13,88,397	47,6662016	14,51,417	49,6742017	15,17,426	51,7632018	15,86,571	53,936Specific information about incidence of cancer in Bargarh is not available.(b) to (d): 	Public Health and Hospitals is a State subject. The Central Government, however, supplements the efforts of the State Governments. The objectives of National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), being implemented by Central Government under the  National Health Mission (NHM) for interventions upto the district level, includes awareness generation for cancer prevention, screening, early detection and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. The focus is on three cancers, namely breast, cervical and oral. A population level initiative for prevention, control and screening for common Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) i.e. diabetes, hypertension and common cancers viz. oral, breast and cervical cancer, has been rolled out in over 215 districts of the country, as a part of comprehensive primary healthcare. Screening of common NCDs including three common cancers i.e. oral, breast and cervical is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres. To tackle the challenge of NCDs, including cancers, 616 NCD Clinics at District level and 3,827 NCD Clinics at Community Health Centre level have been set up under NPCDCS.  Under NHM, support is provided to States/UTs to provide free essential medicines and diagnostic services for primary and secondary health care needs. To enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer, the Central Government is implementing Strengthening of Tertiary Care for Cancer Scheme, under which setting up of 19 State Cancer Institutes and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres have been approved. Further, Oncology is also one of the focus areas in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar in Haryana and strengthening of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, are also steps in the same direction. Awareness campaigns on common risk factors for NCDs, including cancer, and for promotion of healthy lifestyle are also carried out through print, electronic and social media. Camps for awareness generation and screening for common NCDs including cancer are also organized at Pragati Maidan, New Delhi, during the India International Trade Fair each year.  Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research (NICPR), Noida, has launched www.cancerindia.org with the theme “India Against Cancer”, a portal that provides information on the leading cancers in India with a major focus on awareness, prevention and treatment of these cancers. Cancer is a multifactorial disease, the risk factor of which interalia, include ageing population, sedentary life styles, use of tobacco products, unhealthy diet and air pollution. Cancer is diagnosed and treated at various levels in the health care system. In Government hospitals, treatment is either free or highly subsidized. Treatment of cancers is also available under Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY). Besides this, Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment (AMRIT) Deendayal outlets have been opened at 203 Institutions/Hospitals with an objective to make available drugs and implants at discounted prices to the patients. Under the umbrella scheme of Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi, financial assistance is provided to families living below threshold poverty line for their treatment, including treatment of cancer, in Government hospitals.
