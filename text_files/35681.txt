                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)   The Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan (GKRA) was launched on 20th June 2020, for a period of 125 days, with resource envelop of Rs. 50,000 crore. The State-wise detail of expenditure incurred out of resource envelop of Rs.50,000 crore under the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan is as below: S. No.	State	       Expenditure (Rs. in crore)1	BIHAR	              10,9922	JHARKHAND	       1,3963	MADHYA PRADESH	       6,8194	ODISHA	               2,0425	RAJASTHAN	       8,7156	UTTAR PRADESH	       9,330 	Total	              39,293 (b) & (c)       Under the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan, 116 districts were selected across 6 States of Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The district-wise details of employment provided (in persondays generated) during the GKRA are given at Annexure. (d)    The Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan (GKRA) was launched on 20th June 2020, for a period of 125 days, with resource envelop of Rs. 50,000 Crore to boost employment and livelihood opportunities for migrant workers returning to villages and similarly affected citizens in rural area. The Abhiyaan adopted a multipronged strategy of providing immediate employment & livelihood opportunities to the distressed, to saturate the villages with public infrastructure and creation of livelihood assets to boost the income generation activities and enhance long term livelihood opportunities by giving focus on 25 works (including works under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) in 116 selected districts across 6 States namely Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The GKRA ended on 22nd October, 2020 and a total of 50.78 crore person-days employment were generated with a total expenditure of Rs. 39,293 crore during the Abhiyaan. Public employment schemes supplement employment opprtunities available in economy. Schemes like Deendayal Antyodaya Yoajna-National Rural Livelihoods Mission encourage creation of new livelihood opportunities while Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) is a demand driven wage employment programme which provide for the enhancement of livelihood security of the households in rural areas of the country by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. The rural unemployment rate has been generally steady over last 3 years, which includes pre-covid year of 2019, which attests to effectiveness of the existing schemes in addressing the issue of migrant workers.  *****
