                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND PENSIONS AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a) & (b):  Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) collects data on filling of backlog reserved vacancies for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) from ten Ministries/Departments, having more than 90% of the employees in Central Government.  These Ministries/Departments collect such data from their attached/subordinate offices, Central Public Sector Undertakings, Financial Institutions, Nationalized Banks, etc. and, thereafter, furnish consolidated data to DoPT. Ministry/Department-wise and category-wise (i.e. SCs, STs and OBCs) details of backlog reserved vacancies, as on 01.01.2020, as per information received from various Ministries/Departments, is enclosed as Annexure-I.(c) & (d):   To ensure that the guidelines of DoPT regarding reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs in the posts and services of the Central Government are implemented in letter and spirit, instructions have been issued to each Ministry/Department/Attached and Subordinate office, for nomination of Deputy Secretary in charge of administration (or any other officer at least of the rank of Deputy Secretary) as Liaison Officer. If Liaison Officers of Ministries/Departments notice that there is flouting of reservation instructions by any officers or complaint against any officer of harassment or deliberately manipulating things to damage the interests of the weaker sections, they should report such lapses to the Secretary/Additional Secretary of the Ministry/Department concerned or to the Head of Department in respect of offices under the Head of Department, as the case may be. The concerned Secretary/Additional Secretary/ Head of the Department shall pass necessary orders on such reports to ensure strict compliance of the reservation orders by the appointing authority concerned.Contd.P.-2/--2-(e):    Filling of vacancies, along with backlog reserved vacancies, is a continuous process. All the Ministries/Departments have been requested from time to time to ensure that all backlog vacancies for SCs, STs and OBCs are filled up in a time bound manner, including by undertaking Special Recruitment Drive, with the latest letter having been issued on 03.11.2021.*****
