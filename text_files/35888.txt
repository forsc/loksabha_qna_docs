(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a): Central Sector Scheme of financing facility under ‘Agriculture Infrastructure Fund’ was launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister of India on 9th August 2020 under Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Package.

Thereafter, the drive was made part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Package with the objective to cover 2.5 crore farmers, including Fishermen and Dairy farmers with a credit boost of Rs. 2 lakh crore.
