                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????      (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b): 	State-wise details of crop area affected due to hydro-meteorological calamities/hazards during 2020-21, as reported by the affected State Governments, are given at Annexure. The State Governments undertake relief measures in the wake of natural disasters from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) already placed at their disposal in accordance with Government of India approved items and norms. Additional assistance is extended from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) as per established procedure, upon receipt of Memorandum from the State. Thereafter, an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) is constituted and deputed for an on-the-spot assessment of damage and requirement of funds for relief operations, as per the extant items and norms.  The report of the IMCT is considered by the Sub Committee of National Executive Committee (SC-NEC). Thereafter, the High Level Committee (HLC) approves the final quantum of financial assistance.(c) & (d): Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare is implementing ‘Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana’ since Kharif 2016, along with ‘Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme’ to provide comprehensive risk cover in the event of crop damage due to natural calamities and preventable risks and provide financial support to the insured farmers against their notified insurance coverage. However, these Insurance Schemes are voluntary in nature. Major part of the Scheme is being implemented on Area Approach Basis and season-end claims are worked out on the basis of yield data submitted by the concerned State Government.  Risk/peril –wise details of claims are not maintained for wide spread calamities/season-end claims under the Scheme.The State Government of Uttar Pradesh is implementing the Scheme since its inception in 2016-17. During five years of implementation of the Scheme in Uttar Pradesh, over 229.42 lakh hectares of land have been insured with a sum insured of nearly Rs.1.06 lakh crore. Till Kharif 2020, claims of Rs.2810.62 crore have been paid to around 37.38 lakh farmers.
