                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) & (b):	“Police” is a State subject falling in List-II (State List) of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. It is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments/UT Administrations to make the police force efficient & capable and its functioning more effective, transparent and accountable.   Any  specific  nexus of certain sections -2-L.S.US.Q.NO.1538 FOR 20.09.2020of society or criminal and police is an outcome of investigation by agencies of the State subject to verdict of appropriate courts.The Model Police Act, 2006, which was circulated to all State governments has the provision of constituting Police Accountability Commission & District Accountability Authority for ensuring accountability of the police.  Further, one of the direction of the Supreme Court of India in Prakash Singh case on police reforms was to constitute Police Complaints Authorities at the State and District levels for looking into complaints against police officers. These directions were forwarded to the States/UTs for its implementation. (c) to (e):	Police reforms is an ongoing process. The Centre also issues advisories to the States to bring in the requisite reforms in the Police to meet the expectations of the people.In order to improve the functioning of the police, the Union Government has set up various Commissions/Committees i.e. National Police Commission (1977), Ribeiro Committee (1998), Padmanabhaiah Committee (2000), Malimath Committee on Criminal Justice (2002). Further, the Government constituted a Review Committee headed by Shri R.S.  Mooshahary  to review  the recommendations of the previous -3-L.S.US.Q.NO.1538 FOR 20.09.2020Commissions and Committees on Police Reforms in December 2004. The Committee submitted its report in March 2005. The Committee shortlisted 49 recommendations. These are annexed. The recommendations of the Review Committee have been sent to State Governments and Union Territory Administrations for taking appropriate action.A component of “incentives for police reforms” has been included in the implementation structure of the scheme of “Assistance to States for Modernisation of Police”. It has been decided to keep certain amount each year for providing incentive/grants to State Government for implementation of Police Reforms.  To incentivize the implementation of police reforms as recommended by various committees, originally a provision of keeping up to 10% of the total annual allocation of the scheme was made.  This incentive component has been increased to ‘up to 20%’ of the total allocation from the year 2019-20.Ministry of Home Affairs has introduced a system for ranking of Police stations in 2018. It is a two stage process where 3 Police Stations from States having more than 750 police stations, 2 each from all other States and Delhi and 1 each from Union Territories  are  selected -4-L.S.US.Q.NO.1538 FOR 20.09.2020from more than 15,000 Police Stations in the country on the basis of rate of conviction in cases of crimes against women, crimes against SCs/STs and property offences. In the second stage, performance measurement is done based on parameters like crime prevention and proactive measures, disposal of cases, maintenance of public order, infrastructure assessment and citizens feedback. Personal visits are made by the surveying team to the selected police stations for this purpose.The guidelines provide for awarding two sets of awards i.e. one for the top 3 best police stations in the country and another for the best police station in each State/Union Territory. In the last DsGP/IsGP Conference held in December 2019 at Pune, Maharashtra, the best 3 police stations in the country were awarded Shields. Certificates have been provided to the top police stations of the State/UT.  This initiative has worked as a demonstration effect for Police Stations in the country to raise their standard of performance.********
