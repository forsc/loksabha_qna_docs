ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d)    	National Waterway-1 (NW)-1 (Ganga - Bhagirathi-Hooghly river system from Allahabad to Haldia), NW-2 (River Brahmaputra from Dhubri to Sadiya), NW-3 (West Coast Canal from Kottapuram to Kollam along with Udyogmandal and Champakara Canals) have already been developed with fairway, navigational aids, jetties and terminals with mechanized equipment handling facilities for loading and unloading of cargo.  These are operational and vessels are plying on these National Waterways.  In addition, NW-10 (river Amba), NW-27 (Cumberjua), NW- 68 (river Mandovi), NW-73 (river Narmada), NW-83 (Rajpuri Creek), NW-85 (Revadanda Creek - Kundalika River System), NW-91 (Shastri river-Jaigad creek system), NW- 97 (Sunderbans Waterways), NW-100 (river Tapi) and NW-111 (river Zuari) are also operational.   72.31 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) of cargo was transported on the operational NWs during 2018-19. 	The navigability of the waterway is monitored through regular hydrographic surveys and channel inspection by Inland Waterways Authority of India’s Regional Directorates supported by Sub–Regional Offices located along the NWs.  Fortnightly hydrographic surveys are conducted to determine the available depth and possible shoal formations in the channels to determine safe navigability throughout the year.  A constant vigil is kept on the river regime behavior and accordingly appropriate river conservancy measures are taken to ensure fairways for safe movement of vessels. Based on the observation during channel inspection and hydrographic surveys, River Notices are issued and placed on Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) website with details of Least Available Depth (LAD), clearances at bridge structures etc. along with any specific information to be conveyed to shippers to assist them for safe transportation of cargo on the National Waterways.River Information System (RIS) which aims to streamline the exchange of information between waterway operators and users to optimize traffic and transport processes in inland navigation, has been commissioned and is operational between Haldia to Farakka (Phase-I) and Farakka to Patna (Phase-II) stretches of NW-1 (Ganga).                                             *****
