ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE					(SHRI SHRIPAD NAIK)IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE   (a) & (b):  Sainik School Gopalganj is running in a rented accommodation at Hathwa since 2003 because the basic minimum infrastructure required to shift to its permanent location at Sipaya (Gopalganj) has not yet been constructed by the State Government of Bihar.  Only the Academic Block with classrooms, Administrative Block with offices, one Cadet Hostel with a designed capacity of 230 cadets and the Cadet Mess has been built till now.  Even these buildings have not been provided with the water supply, sewage system or electricity.  Infrastructure for the rest of the approximately 220 Cadets, staff accommodation and campus roads are yet to be constructed.  Hence, in its present state with only approximately 25% of the infrastructure created, it is not possible for the School to shift and function from its permanent location at Sipaya (Gopalganj).(c)  The total amount paid in the last seven years as the consolidated rent is Rs. 50,40,000.(d)  A total of Rs. 32.72 crores has been expended by the State Government of Bihar for construction of 1st Phase of infrastructure at Sipaya (Gopalganj).(e)  Funds for the construction of the 2nd Phase has been allotted by the State Government of Bihar to Bihar State Educational Infrastructure Corporation in February, 2021.  Construction is yet to commence.*****
