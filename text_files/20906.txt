Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) and Deendayal Antodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM) run by Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, Ministry of Rural Development and Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, respectively. The State/UT-wise details of the schemes/ programmes are at Annexure.Government is implementing Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY) in the country since 2016 with the objective to incentivise employers for creation of new employment with social security benefits.
