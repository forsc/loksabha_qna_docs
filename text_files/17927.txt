ANSWER




                                                        	THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) to (d):  The Indian pharma industry has been constantly striving to add new products and new markets, including in USA and China, subject to regulatory approvals and market authorisations from the respective regulatory authorities of the respective countries.  The USFDA conducts audit of manufacturers on a regular basis as per the criteria set by them. The authorities conducting audit provide inspection reports, based on which, warning letters are issued in case of non-conformities, for the manufacturers to comply with the actions necessitated by the non-conformities. In such cases, the approval process is stalled until the manufacturer is able to comply with the requirements.               The approval and introduction of new products is an on-going process. Pharma exports from India to USA have recorded 15.79% growth rate in 2019-20. Indian pharma companies have secured 31% of the market authorizations granted by USFDA in 2019-20, which shows that Indian companies continue to be able to introduce new products. *******
