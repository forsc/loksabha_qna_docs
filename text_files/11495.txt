                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) & (b): The Central Government has been administering a Centrally Sponsored Scheme  (CSS) for the Development of Infrastructure Facilities for Judiciary since 1993-94. A sum of Rs.7,453 crore has so far been released to State Governments / UTs under the Scheme since its inception. The State-wise release is at Annexure-I. As per the information made available by the High Courts / State Governments, 19,632 Court Halls are available in the country for Judges/Judicial Officer of District and Subordinate courts.  Further, 2,713 Court Halls are under construction. The State-wise availability of court halls and under construction court halls is at Annexure-II. (c)&(d):	 In  order  to  evolve  a  transparent  criteria  for  inter-state  distribution  of  funds  under  Centrally  Sponsored  Scheme  (CSS)  for  Development  of  Infrastructure  Facilities  for  the  Judiciary,  a  scientific  formula  has  been  adopted  from  the  year  2018-19  on  the  basis  of  4  parameters,  namely,  (i)  number  of  court  halls  left  for  construction  with  reference  to  sanctioned  strength  of  judicial  officers  in  the  State/UT  (ii)  number  of  residential  units  left  for  construction  with  reference  to  sanctioned  strength  of  judicial  officers  in  the  State/UT  (iii)  working  strength  of  judicial  officers  with  reference  to  sanctioned  strength  of  judicial  officers  in  the  State/UT,  and  (iv)  pendency  of  10  years  and  more  old  cases  in  subordinate  judiciary. These 4 parameters have the weightage criteria in the ratio of 40:40:10:10. Based  on  such  criteria  the  tentative  allocation  of  funds  to  States/UTs  is  informed  to  the  State  Governments  and  UT  administration  in  advance  in  the  beginning  of  the  financial  year  to  enable  them  to  submit  their  proposals  accordingly. Pending submission of utilisation certificates and unspent balance of already allocated funds to a particular State / UT is also taken into consideration while releasing grants under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme.(e):	The Scheme aims to match the available infrastructure of court halls and the residential units of district and subordinate courts with the sanctioned strength of District and Subordinate Courts of Judges and Judicial Officers. However, setting up of Courts in subordinate judiciary is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments.  The Central Government has been assisting the State Governments by providing funds for infrastructure development of the subordinate judiciary.******** Annexure-IStatement referred to Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 483 for Reply on 05.02.2020Statement showing State-wise release of Grants under Centrally Sponsored Scheme for development of Infrastructure facilities for subordinate judiciary.
