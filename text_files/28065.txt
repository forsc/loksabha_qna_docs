An Expert Group was set up for the purpose of proposing the structure of the Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM) including examining both the pilot phases of implementation of the PURA scheme, studying various non-government PURA initiatives and Rurban Mission of Gujarat, holding consultations with concerned parties, examining the PPP framework etc. The Expert Group has submitted its report on 31-10-2014.   The key recommendations of the Expert Group is annexed as Annexure-I. (b) to (d)  On the basis of the recommendations of the said Expert Committee, the Ministry has been implementing the Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM) since 2015-16.  Under the Mission, there is no provision for year-wise, allocation of funds.  However, the funds are being released based on fulfillment of certain progress achieved as defined in the guidelines of the Mission.  The details of the physical and financial status of the Mission till today are annexed as Annexure-II.  The details of steps taken by the Government for effective implementation of the scheme is annexed at Annexure-III. ***********ANNEXURE-IThe key recommendations of the Expert Group that have influenced the design of the Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM) are:(i)	ln order to bring in sustainability of any developmental effort in rural areas, a means of providing mentorship or constant guidance by an agency or institution is necessary.(ii)	Provision of infrastructure should be integrated and provided in a time bound manner in a project mode with equal focus on skill development and economic empowerment. (iii)	While the approach should be Panchayat centric, District Administration and State Governments should lead the effort. (iv)	The Mission should be sufficiently large to ensure that there is sufficient focus by the stakeholders****** Annexure-IIStatewise Physical Progress under SPMRMState-wise Financial Progress under SPMRM                                                                                Annexure-III 1)	The State Level Empowered Committee (SLEC) has been designated as the final authority to approve the DPRs of cluster for assisting the States.  A sub-committee thereof has been empowered to sanction DPRs in between the meetings of the SLEC.  2)	States/UTs have been permitted to modify projects/works proposed in ICAP of cluster and include more economic activities in order to reboot the rural economy.3)	A major step of de-linking of planning notification and spatial planning condition from the fund release conditions, which helped in faster and effective implementation of the Mission.4)	RurbanSoft MIS portal has been developed to track the progress on real time basis. PFMS integration with Rurbansoft MIS portal for payment to vendors has simplified the fund flow mechanism and ensured transparency, efficiency and effectiveness in payments. 5)	Geo-Rurban mobile application has been developed and launched for physical monitoring and geo-tagging of the assets developed under SPMRM. 6)	Ranking of Rurban clusters initiated on the basis of performance based indicators on RurbanSoft portal.   This will enhance the spirit of competition among the States/Clusters.7)	Social Audit framework has been extended to SPMRM. Pilot projects are now being undertaken by eight States.8)	Towards more efficient fund utilization, the fund pooling mechanism has been introduced at the State level for purpose of release of funds to the States/UTs.9)	Initiatives taken to institutionalize Spatial Planning in Rurban cluster areas in collaborating with relevant institutions and stakeholders, and undertaking pilots / proof of concept. 10)	Spatial Planning Portal has been developed in collaboration with BISAG (N). This portal integrates the satellite imagery, various datasets to enable the Spatial Planning exercise in the Cluster. The platform will serve as a digital interface for getting baseline data and cluster land suitability; land use, economic activity planning etc. Spatial Planning Platform is in testing stage and pilot spatial plan for three Rurban clusters is under progress.11)	Nomination of Mentor Institutions: Spatial plan preparation requires experts from various fields like rural & regional planners, Rural Management experts, GIS specialist, Convergence specialist etc. Hence ''Mentor Institutes'' like IITs, NITs, Institutes of National repute etc having expertise in planning, architecture, engineering etc. are being on boarded for each State. ******
