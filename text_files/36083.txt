However, in pursuance of the Government’s vision of “Housing for All”, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) is implementing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U) since 25.06.2015 for giving Central assistance to States/ Union Territories (UTs) including the State of Assam for providing all-weather pucca houses to all eligible urban households. State/UT-wise details of number of houses sanctioned across the country during last five years are at Annexure.(b): PMAY-U addresses affordable housing requirement in urban areas through four verticals: (i) Beneficiary-led individual house construction or enhancement (BLC) (ii) Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP) (iii) Credit-Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) and (iv) “In-Situ” Slum Redevelopment (ISSR).  States/ UTs formulate project proposals as per their assessed demand of houses under the Scheme in a phased manner based on their resources and get them approved by State Level Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee (SLSMC). After approval from concerned SLSMC, States/ UTs submit the proposal to this Ministry for approval of Central assistance by Central Sanctioning & Monitoring Committee (CSMC). Completion of projects generally takes 12-18 months under BLC vertical and 24-36 months under AHP vertical of the Scheme. Based on the project proposals submitted by States/ UTs, more than 115 lakh houses have been sanctioned across the country. Out of total sanctioned houses, 94.79 lakh have been grounded for construction; of which, 56.20 lakh have been completed/ delivered to beneficiaries.States/ UTs have been advised to expedite the construction of sanctioned houses so that all houses are completed within the stipulated timeline as per Detailed Project Reports.(c) & (d): Identification and selection of beneficiaries under PMAY-U comes under the purview of concerned State/UT Government. Based on the project proposals submitted by State of Assam, a total of 1,67,946 houses have been sanctioned in the State. Out of total sanctioned houses, 1,20,134 have been grounded for construction; of which, 44,036 have been completed/ delivered to beneficiaries. Ministry is open to sanction additional houses based on project proposals submitted by the States/ UTs under the Scheme during the Mission period. This Ministry does not maintain data related to people who were not allotted house under the Scheme.                                        *****
