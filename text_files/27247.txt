ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) to (f) 	Sports is a State Subject and development of Sports, including running of sports stadiums for training of sportspersons, creation of sports infrastructure, and promotion of sports, is the primary responsibility of the State Government and National Sports Federations (NSFs). However, the Government of India supplements and complements the efforts of State Governments and NSFs in this regard though various Sports Promotional Schemes.The Sports Authority of India (SAI) is responsible for maintenance and operation of only five stadia in Delhi, viz., the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium Complex, Indira Gandhi Sports Complex, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Swimming Pool Complex, Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium and Dr. Karni Singh Shooting Range. The other centres of SAI are operational on sites made available by the respective State/UT Governments, including the State of Maharashtra. 	There is no proposal in this Ministry to privatize any stadiums being operated and maintained by SAI. Though proposals for construction of stadiums are received from various States/UTs, project proposals are sanctioned according to the parameters of the relevant Scheme, i.e., the Khelo India Scheme, subject to completeness of the proposals, their technical feasibility, and availability of funds under the Scheme.The Sports promotional schemes being implemented by the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports cater to a number of Indian outdoor sports like Kabaddi and Kho Kho. Further, the “Promotion of rural and indigenous/tribal games” vertical of the Khelo India Scheme and the “Indigenous Games and Martial Arts” sub-component of the National Sports Talent Contest Scheme being implemented by SAI, provide for development of rural and indigenous/tribal games of the country. However, since the objective of the Government is to promote Sports holistically across the country, grants are not allocated State/UT wise, but are released Scheme-wise. *****
