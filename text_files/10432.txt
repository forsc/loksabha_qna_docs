Under the HADP, 40 projects worth of Rs.84.29 crore have been sanctioned for the districts of Tamenglong and Noney so far. All these projects are at their initial stage of implementation.(c)  Yes sir.  As per NER District Infrastructure Index, prepared by Ministry of DoNER in 2009, districts of Tamenglong, Chandel & Churachandpur in Manipur are ranked among the lowest in NER.  Constant efforts have been made to bring them at par with other districts of North Eastern Region through implementation of various schemes of the State Government and Government of India.
