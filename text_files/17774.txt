                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) & (b):	Productivity of major crops, like rice, wheat and pulses has increased by 13.1 per cent, 24.4 per cent and 12.2 per cent respectively during 2014-15 to 2019-20 (4th Advance Estimates). During the same period, production of rice, wheat and pulses has increased from 105.5 million tonnes to 118.4 million tonnes, 86.5 million tonnes to 107.6 million tonnes, and 17.2 million tonnes to 23.2 million tonnes respectively. Poverty is a multidimensional phenomenon which depends on various socio-economic factors. 	There are wide inter-state variations in productivity of major crops on account of difference in the level of irrigation, weather and temperature conditions, resource endowment, farm mechanization, land-holding size, etc.(c) & (d):	Yes Sir, due to limited availability of land, crop productivity becomes a key determinant of gross value added in agriculture sector. Timely availability and correct method of application of farm inputs is vital for improving crop productivity. Government is implementing various schemes for supply of farm inputs, like seeds, fertilizers, agricultural machinery and equipments, irrigation facilities, institutional credit, etc., at subsidized rates to the farmers in the country. 	Further, Government has recently taken several steps for increasing investment in agriculture sector which, inter-alia, include creation of Agriculture Infrastructure Fund, Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF), Micro Irrigation Fund for water use efficiency, promotion of commercial organic farming, etc. 	Moreover, in order to raise agricultural productivity, public investment has been increased through the implementation of schemes, like Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, revamped Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) namely RKVY-RAFTAAR (Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied sector Rejuvenation), Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India, etc.*******
