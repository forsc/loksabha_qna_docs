A proposal from Government of Telangana, requesting Government of India for sanctioning an IISER in Hyderabad, State of Telangana was examined by Ministry of Human Resource and Development.  That Ministry observed that setting up of such premier Institutions requires due consideration of availability of adequate and sustained resources with Government of India as they involve substantial capital and recurring expenditure.
