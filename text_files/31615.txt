However, Smart Cities commenced works after un-lockdown and are doing their best to make up for the time lost due to such unprecedented and unforeseen circumstance. The period of implementation of SCM has also been extended upto June 2023 and all Smart Cities, including those in Tamil Nadu, are expected to complete their projects within the stipulated time.                                              ***
