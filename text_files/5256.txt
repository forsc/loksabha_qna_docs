ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	 As on 17.7.2019, 1st installment to 31,26,691 beneficiaries and 2nd installment to 28,34,272 beneficiaries had been released under the PM-Kisan Scheme in the State of Gujarat. As per the online confirmation received from the Banks through the PM-Kisan portal, in Dahod District of Gujarat, 1st installment to 1,38,540 beneficiaries and 2nd installment to 1,29,778 beneficiaries had been successfully credited in their bank accounts.(b) & (c):    All farmer families whose data have been validated, have been benefitted in Dahod district. However,  PM-Kisan is a continuous and ongoing Scheme, in which, the financial benefits is transferred to the bank accounts of the identified beneficiaries as and when their correct and verified data is uploaded by the concerned States / UTs on PM-Kisan web-portal.   The financial benefit under the Scheme is provided in 3 equal  installments of Rs.2000/- each every four months. Uploading of data of beneficiaries on the portal involves several levels of verifications, validations and corrections by different authorities, banks and the concerned State / UT Governments, and hence it takes time to get the final correct data for release of benefits to the concerned beneficiaries. However, the beneficiaries who have not so far received the benefits are eligible to receive the same from the 4-monthly period in which their names are uploaded on the PM-Kisan portal and also subsequent installments thereafter.*****
