ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a) & (b):  The total estimated coal resources in India is 319.02 billion tonnes (Bt) out of which 148.789 Bt is in Proved category as on 1.4.2018 as assessed by the Geological Survey of India. Data on coal resource of China is not maintained in Ministry of Coal. World Coal Association has not shared its views with Ministry of Coal. (c) & (d): As compared in the report of International Energy Agency, raw coal production in India and China during 2017 was 676.479 million tonnes and 3158.630 million tonnes respectively. (e): Despite the efforts made by coal sector, there is a shortfall in coal production due to reasons like problems in land acquisition owing to unclear land records, physical possession of land, rehabilitation and resettlement issues, evacuation and logistics constraints and Law & Order problem in coalfield areas.  *****
