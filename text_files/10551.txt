MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a) to (c)The Ministry of Minority Affairs  implements the Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK) earlier known as Multi-sectoral Development Programme (MsDP), a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, in identified Minority Concentration Areas(MCAs) of the country with the objective of developing socio-economic assets and basic amenities in these areas.

Out of these, 247 units of different projects having Central Share of Rs.1616.13 lakh weresanctioned.  The sanctioned projects include 22 School Buildings, 76 ACRs,12 Hostels, 58 Haat Sheds, 11 Water Supply Schemes and 68 Toilets.  The remaining projects could not be approved due to non-admissibility/suitability of projects as per guidelines of the scheme.  The details of the projects and decision of Empowered Committee are available in the minutes of the meeting uploaded at http://www.minorityaffairs.gov.in/schemesperformance/multi-sectoral-development-programme/ empowered-committee-minutes.(d):  The proposals received from the States/UTs complete with all requisite documents are placed immediately before the Empowered Committee on PMJVK.  The meetings of the Empowered Committee are held on a regular basis and its frequency depends on the proposals received from the States/UTs.  (e) :   No Sir.  As stated in reply to part (d) above, the proposals received from the States are considered by the Empowered Committee on priority.  There is no delay in clearing such proposals.
