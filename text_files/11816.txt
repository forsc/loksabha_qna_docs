ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a): The fourth round of bidding has commenced under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)- UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik).  RCS-UDAN is a market driven mechanism. Under the scheme, airlines assess demand and nature of supply required on particular route and based on their analysis, participate in the bidding process for operations under UDAN. On completion of 4th round of bidding process, route(s) connecting cities/towns will be awarded to Selected Airline Operators (SAOs). ;;The SAOs are obligated to commence RCS flight operations on a RCS route within a period of six months from the issuance of Letter of Award or within two months from the readiness of airport, whichever is later, unless any extension is granted by the Implementing Agency.  ;(b): Under three rounds of bidding of RCS-UDAN, 250 RCS routes have commenced as on 31-01-2020 connecting 44 RCS (25 unserved and 19 underserved) airports. List of commenced routes is at Annexure-A. Some of the reasons for non operationalization of few UDAN routes are:-i) Lack of infrastructure of civil airports due to non-availability of land, delay related to compliance of the regulations by the airport operators, lack of road connectivity to the airports.ii) Non-completion of the process involved in obtaining Scheduled Commuter Operators Permit by the Airlines.
