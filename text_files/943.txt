ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS [SHRI V.MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (c) The Government has consistently raised the issue of  cross border terrorism and placed high emphasis on international cooperation in combating the menace of terrorism including in bilateral, regional and international fora. As a result of Government’s persistent efforts, there is enhanced concern in the international community at terrorism emanating from Pakistan, including the continuing activities of internationally designated terrorist entities and individuals including Jamaat-ud Dawa (JuD), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad, Hizbul Mujahideen. This was manifest in the international support after the cross border terrorist attack in Pulwama on 14 February 2019. Countries have called upon Pakistan to not allow its territory to be used for terrorism in any manner. In the aftermath of the cross-border terror attack in Pulwama, UN Security Council condemned in the strongest term, the heinous and cowardly act. Many terrorist entities and individuals who find shelter in Pakistan and are also engaged in terrorism against India have been proscribed by the United Nations (UN), the European Union and other countries. On 01 May 2019, the United Nations 1267 Sanctions Committee designated Masood Azhar, the leader of Jaish-e-Mohammad as a UN proscribed terrorist. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) at its Plenary  in June 2018, notified Pakistan in the ‘Grey List’ due to continuing terror financing related concerns, including with respect to the UN proscribed terrorist entities like LeT, JuD and Falah-i-Insaniyat Foundation. These vindicate India’s consistent stand that internationally designated terrorist groups and individuals continue to operate from and raise financial resources with impunity in Pakistan, and use territories under its control for carrying out cross-border terrorism in India and elsewhere in South Asia. India’s call to condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestation; zero tolerance to terrorism; rejection of any justification for an act of terror; delinking terror from religion; need for all forces believing in humanity to unite in fight against terrorism has found greater acceptance among the international community, and is reflected in a number of outcome documents issued after bilateral Summit meetings with various countries, and at regional and multilateral fora, such as Shangai Cooperation Organization; G20; BRICS, among others. ***
