ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) Water Resource Department, Government of Bihar has informed that severe erosion occurred on the embankments of River Gandak in Gopalganj District of Bihar due to heavy rainfall in catchment area of River Gandak in Nepal during the monsoon season of year 2020. Several breaches in embankment along River Gandak occurred in Gopalganj District of Bihar at Bhaisahi Purrena Charki, Saran, Bandhauli Shitalpur Faizullahpur Jamindari Bundh and Baikunthpur Retired Line. The flood management and anti-erosion schemes are planned, implemented and maintained by State Governments with their own resources as per their priority. The necessary action for breach closure, raising/strengthening of these embankments is to be taken by State Government of Bihar. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. During XI & XII Plan Flood Management Programme (FMP) was undertaken for providing Central Assistance to States for works related to river management, flood control, anti-erosion, drainage development, anti-sea erosion, etc. which subsequently continued as a component of "Flood Management and Border Areas Programme" (FMBAP) for the period from 2017-18 to 2020-21. So far Central Assistance amounting to Rs.924.41 Crores has been released to State Government of Bihar under this Programme.(b) to (d)  Government of India is having regular dialogue with the Government of Nepal through existing India-Nepal bilateral mechanisms for mutual benefit of water resources of the common rivers between the two countries which includes flood control. A Joint Project through an agreement in the year 1959, later amended in 1964 on River Gandak has been implemented for irrigation and power benefits to both countries. Specific India-Nepal water management issues related with Gandak River are discussed in the India-Nepal Joint Committee on Kosi and Gandak Project (JCKGP) and Joint Committee on Inundation and Flood Management (JCIFM). JCKGP discusses issues related to Gandak Project like water logging, water supplies to canals, maintenance of pond level, etc. Whereas, JCIFM discusses issues of river training works to be taken up on rivers in Nepal, flood inundation issues on India Nepal border, etc. At present Government of India has no plan in discussion with Government of Nepal for construction of new dams or any other new river water management projects on river Gandak.*****
