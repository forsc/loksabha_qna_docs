                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) FOR NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY,  POWER and MoS for  SKILL DEVELOPMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP(SHRI R. K. SINGH)(a) Details of funds sanctioned and utilized by various states for electricity generation through Biomass along with installed capacity during each of the last three years and the current year are  placed at Annexure - I.(b) & (c) Studies conducted by Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in 2010-11 had estimated surplus biomass availability at about 120 -150 million metric tons per annum covering agricultural residues. This corresponds to a potential of about 18,000 MW power. Apart from this, 7000 – 8000 MW additional power can be generated through bagasse based cogeneration in the country’s sugar mills.(d) Few states like Madhya Pradesh & Karnataka have reported that some biomass based electricity generation units are lying idle due to ongoing tariff issues with the respective State Electricity Regulatory Commissions. The fixation of tariff in the states is done by the concerned State Electricity Regulatory Commission.(e)&(f) A target of installing 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by the year 2022 has been set by the Government which includes 100 GW from solar, 60 GW from wind, 10 GW from bio-power and 5 GW from small hydro-power.  Out of 10 GW, 9.8 GW capacity of Biomass Power and Cogeneration Plants, 250 MW capacity of Waste to Energy Plants and 9 MW capacity of Biogas to Power Plants has been installed in the country.The Ministry is implementing the following schemes to boost development and deployment of  Bio-energy :1.	Biomass Scheme to support biomass based cogeneration in sugar mills and other industries (up to March 2020). Under the scheme, biomass cogeneration projects are being provided Central Financial Assistance (CFA) @ Rs 25 Lakhs / MW of surplus exportable capacity and Rs 50 Lakhs / MW of installed capacity depending on the type of fuel used.2.	Programme on Energy from Urban, Industrial and Agricultural Wastes/ Residues for recovery of energy in the form of Biogas or BioCNG or Power from Urban, Industrial and Agricultural Waste / Residues such as municipal solid wastes, vegetable and other market wastes, slaughterhouse waste, agricultural residues and industrial wastes & effluents for meeting certain niche energy demands of urban, industrial and commercial sectors in the country. Central Financial Assistance available under the Programme on Energy from Urban, Industrial and Agricultural Wastes/ Residues for setting up Waste to Energy plant is as follows:a.	Biogas generation	 :  Rs 1.0 crore per 12000cum/day ;b.	BioCNG generation (including setting of Biogas plant) : Rs 4.0 Crore per 4800Kg/day;c.	Power generation based on Biogas (including setting of Biogas plant): Rs 3.0 Crore per MW.d.	Biomass Gasifier: •	Rs. 2,500 per kWe with duel fuel engines  for electrical application•	Rs. 15,000 per kWe with 100% gas engines for electrical application•	Rs. 2 lakh per 300 kWth for thermal applications.3.	Biogas Power (Off-grid) Generation and Thermal Application Programme (BPGTP)The Ministry is implementing biogas based schemes/ Programme for promoting biogas generation for decentralized applications viz. decentralized power generation in the capacity range 3 kW to 250 kW and also for thermal energy applications having biogas generation capacity in the matching size range of 30 m3 to 2500 m3 per day.Central Financial Assistance (CFA) under BPGTP   The CFA under the programme is being provided in the range of Rs.25,000/- per kW to Rs.40,000 per kW for power generation and Rs.12,500 /- per kWe to Rs.20,000/- per kWe for thermal applications respectively. The CFA rates vary depending upon the category of beneficiaries and location /region for the projects installed.4. NEW NATIONAL BIOGAS AND ORGANIC MANURE PROGRAMME (NNBOMP)The New National Biogas and Organic Manure Programme (NNBOMP) is being implemented with the objective to provide clean cooking fuel; meet lighting, thermal and small power needs of farmers/ dairy farmers/users including individual households; and to improve organic manure system based on bio-slurry from biogas plants in rural and semi-urban areas by setting up of biogas plants. Under this scheme Biogas plants of size from 1 m3 to 25 m3 are installed.Central Financial Assistance (CFA) under NNBOMP  Under the programme the CFA is being provided for setting up of biogas plants of size from 1 m3 to 25 m3. The CFA being provided is in the range of Rs.7,500/- per plant of 1 m3 to Rs.35,000/- per plant of 20-25 m3 depending upon the size of plants, location States or regions, category etc. Besides this, financial support is also provided for turnkey job fee for construction, supervision etc. It also provides support for skill development programme for Biogas Mitras and to Biogas Development & Training Centre (BDTCs) for conducting training courses.*****
