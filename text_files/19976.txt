                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a)& (b): 	In pursuance of the pro-poor measures under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package as part of the Economic Response to COVID -19, Govt of India had launched scheme for additional allocation of food-grains from the Central Pool @ 5 kg per person per month free of cost for all the beneficiaries of all the 36 States/UTs covered under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) (AAY & PHH) including those covered under DBT for a period of 8 months i.e April-November, 2020. .........2/--2-Also, under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Package (ANBP), this Department made allocation of about total 8 LMT of additional free of cost food-grain covering all the States/UTs for migrants/stranded migrants, who are neither covered under National Food Security Act (NFSA) nor State Scheme PDS Cards, @ 5 kg per person per month free of cost for a period of two months (May & June, 2020). The allocation of free foodgrains  under PMGKAY and ANBP was in addition to normal allocation done under the NFSA. NFSA is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and the State/UT Govt. Central Govt is responsible for allocation and transportation of foodgrains upto the designated depots of the FCI. The operational responsibilities for allocation of foodgrains within the States/UTs, identification of eligible beneficiaries, issuance of ration cards to them, distribution of foodgrains in all districts to eligible beneficiaries rest with the concerned State/UT Govt. State/UT-wise allocation details under PMGKAY scheme and ANB scheme in all the States/UTs including Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh is placed at Annexure-I.(c) & (d): 	Coarsegrains are already a part of Public Distribution System. Schedule-l of NFSA Act envisages distribution of coarsegrain at highly subsidized rate of Re.1 per kg. 			The distribution of pulses is not done under NFSA at present.		In addition to this, the Act provides that pregnant women and lactating mothers and children in the age group of 6 months to 14 years of age are entitled to meals as per prescribed nutritional norms under Integrated Child Development Services(ICDS) and Mid-Day Meal(MDM) schemes. High nutritional norms are prescribed for malnourished children upto 6 years of age.		Further, to address anaemia and micro-nutrient deficiency in the country, Government of India approved Centrally Sponsored Pilot Scheme on "Fortification of Rice & its Distribution under Public Distribution System (PDS)" for a period of 3 years beginning in 2019-20 with total outlay of Rs 174.64 Cr.  The Pilot Scheme is intended to focus on 15 Districts across 15 states, preferably 1 District per State.
