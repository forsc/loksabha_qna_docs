The 73rd Amendment 1992 added a new Part IX to the constitution titled “The Panchayats” covering provisions from Article 243 to 243(O); and a new Eleventh Schedule covering 29 subjects within the functions of the Panchayats. This is towards the implementation of Article 40 of the Constitution of India which enshrines one of the Directive Principles of State Policy that the State shall take steps to organise village Panchayats and endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self-government. Accordingly, the States/ Union Territories have enacted respective State/ UT Panchayati Raj Acts/ Regulations to implement the constitutional mandate.  Currently, the Panchayati Raj system exists in all States except Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Mizoram; and in all Union Territories, including Dadra and Nagar Haveli, except Delhi and Chandigarh.*****
