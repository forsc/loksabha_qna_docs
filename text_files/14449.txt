MINISTRY OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a) to (d):	Yes, Sir.  The Multi-Sectoral Development Programme (MsDP) has been restructured and implemented as Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK) with effect from May, 2018.   The area covered under the restructured PMJVK are 13000 in total, which include 109 Minority Concentration District Hqs (MCD Hqs), 870 Minority Concentration Blocks (MCBs) and 321 Minority Concentration Towns (MCTs) falling in 308 districts of 32 States/UTs.   The restructuring of MsDP was based on several inputs including recommendation of a evaluation study conducted by Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA) in 2017.  Details of the Minority Concentration Areas (MCAs) covered under PMJVK and study report of IIPA are available on the website of the Ministry – www.minorityaffairs.gov.in.*****
