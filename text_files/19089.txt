ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                            (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)	     Scheme for Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHCs), a sub-scheme under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U), for providing accommodation at affordable rent to urban migrants/ poor has been launched on 31.07.2020. Government of Jharkhand does not have any existing Government funded vacant housing complexes available, therefore no ARHCs are anticipated under Model-1 in the State.      Under Model-2, Expression of Interest (EoI) has been issued to invite applications from Public/Private Entities to construct, operate and maintain ARHCs on their own available vacant land. The number of beneficiaries will be finalised by the Private/Public Entities as per the Operational Guidelines of the scheme, only after construction of ARHCs on their own available vacant land.  (b)	    Initial affordable rent of ARHCs will be fixed by Entity as per local survey. Subsequently, Entity can increase rent biennially at 8% subject to maximum increase of 20% in aggregate over a period of 5 years effective from the date of signing contract. The same mechanism shall be followed over the entire concession period i.e. 25 years.(c)	    As the scheme of ARHCs has been designed specifically for the migrant labourers from Economically Weaker Section (EWS)/Low Income Group (LIG), no special agreement or compensation is provisioned in the scheme guidelines.                                                 *****
