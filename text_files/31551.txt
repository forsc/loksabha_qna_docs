Similarly, a time period of 21-24 months has been allowed for completion of bridge works exceeding 25-meter in length, depending on site conditions. The Status of projects under various verticals of PMGSY for the State of Uttar Pradesh as on 8th December, 2021 are as under:- Vertical	        Sanctioned	           Completed	                Balance*	      Roads   Length  Bridges   Value of   Roads   Length  Bridges  Roads  Length   Bridges             (Nos.)
