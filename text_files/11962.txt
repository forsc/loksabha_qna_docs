ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b)  In addition to the five existing National Waterways (NWs), 106 new NWs were declared under the National Waterways Act, 2016 which was notified on 12.04.2016.   Prior to the declaration of new NWs, under the proposed legislation, inter Ministerial consultations, including with NITI Aayog and Ministry of Finance were held.  The National Waterways Bill, 2015 was also deliberated by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture which presented its recommendations to Parliament in its 223rd Report.   The National Waterways Bill, 2015 was approved by Union Cabinet and passed by Parliament as National Waterways Act, 2016.(c)  National Waterway (NW)-1 (Ganga-Bhagirathi-Hooghly river system from Allahabad to Haldia), NW-2 (River Brahmaputra from Dhubri to Sadiya), NW-3 (West Coast Canal from Kottapuram to Kollam along with Udyogmandal and Champakara Canals) have been developed with fairway navigational aids, jetties and terminals with mechanized equipment handling facilities for loading and unloading of cargo. These NWs are operational and vessels are plying on them.  In addition, NW-10 (River Amba), NW-68 (River Mandovi), NW-73 (River Narmada), NW-83 (Rajpuri Creek), NW-85 (Revadanda Creek-Kundalika River System), NW-91 (Shastri river–Jaigad creek system), NW-97 (Sunderbans Waterways), NW-100 (River Tapi) and NW-111 (River Zuari) are also operational.  Development activities have been initiated on 10 viable NWs viz. NW-9, NW-16, NW-27, NW-37, NW-40, NW-58, NW-68, NW-86, NW-97 and NW-111 as per the Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) completed so far.   Fairway development works on the Vijayawada–Muktyala stretch of river Krishna (Part of NW-4) has commenced at a cost of Rs. 96 crore. The Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) is being implemented at an estimated cost of Rs. 5369.18 crore for capacity augmentation of navigation on the Haldia–Varanasi stretch of NW-1 with the technical and financial assistance of the World Bank.  Projects worth Rs. 1800 crore (approx.) have commenced on ground in a time period of three years after statutory clearances. To develop the NWs, the Government provides funds to the Inland Waterways Authority of India as Grants-in-aid and had permitted IWAI to raise Government of India fully serviced Bonds (Extra Budgetary Resources) of Rs. 1000 crore.   In this regard, the details of Budgetary Estimates, Revised Estimates and Expenditure during the last five years are given below:        (Rs. in crore)<pre>	Year	Budget Estimate	      Revised Estimate	Exp.2015-16	323.19 (Grants)	321.91(Grants)	321.912016-17	BE 391.01 (Grants)+EBRs 340.00	RE 362.31 (Grants)+EBR 340.00	358.41 (Grants)+237.32 (EBR)2017-18	     270.00 (Grants)+660.00 (EBRs)	426.0914 (Grants)+660.00 (EBR)	426.0914 (Grants)+335.2686 (EBR)2018-19	480.00 (Grants)	862.49 (Grants)	862.49 (Grants)+111.94 (EBR)2019-20	750.36 (Grants)	536.27 (Grants)	422.3835 (Grants)+116.25 (EBR) (up to 31.12.2019)                                                                </pre>                                                                                     *****
