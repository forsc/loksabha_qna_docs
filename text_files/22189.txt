                                                        ANSWERMINISTER FOR CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS (SHRI D.V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e): Under the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme theGovernment has taken the following steps : reintroduction of administered pricemechanism for ethanol procurement, allowing ethanol production from multiple feedstockslike C & B heavy molasses, sugarcane juice, sugar, sugar syrup, damaged foodgrains, surplus stocks of rice with Food Corporation of India (FCI) and maize,differentiated ex-mill price of ethanol based on raw materials used for its production,amendment to the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act (IDR Act) – 1951 forfree movement of ethanol in the country, reduction of GST rate to 5% on ethanolprocured under the EBP Programme, formulation of a long term procurement policy forethanol, interest subvention scheme for augmentation and enhancement of ethanolproduction capacities in the country, etc. In addition, Public Sector Oil MarketingCompanies (OMCs) have simplified the ethanol procurement procedure therebyencouraging more vendors to take part in the Expression of Interest (EoI’ s) released bythem.OMCs have informed that in the current Ethanol Supply Year (ESY), against anEoI quantity of 457 Crore litres they have allocated 325.5 Crore litres of ethanol fromvarious feedstock-wise like sugarcane Juice/ sugar syrup / sugar, B & C heavymolasses, damaged food grain, maize and surplus rice available with Food Corporationof India. Further, the OMCs have informed that supplies received by them in crore litreswere 111.4 (2015-16), 66.5 ( 2016-17), 150.5 (2017-18), 118.57 (2018-19), 173.03(2019-20) & 74.89 (2020-21- till 01.03.21).The aim of the EBP Programme is to address environmental concerns, providingremunerative income to farmers, reduce import bill & reduce dependency on importsthereby creating jobs directly / indirectly.Due to remunerative prices of ethanol to be supplied to OMCs, the sugarmills/distilleries could able to generate quick revenue which improves the liquidity ofsugar mills to enable them to clear cane dues of farmers associated with the industry.The installation of distilleries also generates employment for public mainly in the ruralarea.Further, the Government has allowed procurement of ethanol produced fromother non-food feedstock like cellulosic and ligno-cellulosic materials and has directedOil CPSEs to set up Second Generation (2G) Ethanol Bio-refineries in different parts ofthe country using agri-residues and biomass which will be commissioned in 2-3 years oftime. Government has launched a scheme “Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN (JaivIndhan-Vatavaran Anukool fasalawashesh Nivaran) Yojana” to provide financial support forpromotion of 2G ethanol.****
