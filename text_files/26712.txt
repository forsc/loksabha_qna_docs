                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING (SHRI PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a ) Central Government in conjunction with the State Governments and Union Territories is taken necessary steps to increase the quality and quantity of livestock feed and fodder in the country, through various ongoing Centrally Sponsored Schemes viz., National Livestock Mission with a Sub Mission on Fodder and Feed Development and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna.Under these schemes, financial assistance is provided to all the States and Union Territories for various fodder development activities planned by them. In addition, Central Government is also implementing Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund since 2020-21 for incentivizing investments for establishment of animal feed manufacturing units including establishment of Animal Feed Testing Laboratories so as to ensure production of quality feed.(b) There is no such proposal to modernise the quality of fodder for livestock under Rashtriya Gokul Mission because modernisation of the quality of fodder for livestock is already covered under National Livestock Mission. *****
