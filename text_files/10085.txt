                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) & (b) : State/Union Territory (UT) wise status of implementation of E-Prisons project is given in the Annexure. Majority of States/UTs have on-boarded their data on e-prisons portal. However, occasionally a few jails have faced difficulties like network connectivity.(c) & (d) : The Ministry of Home Affairs had shared the recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on ‘Women in Detention and Access to Justice’-2/...-2-LS.US.Q.NO.3567 FOR 10.12.2019with all States and UTs. States/UTs have been requested to take appropriate action to comply with the recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee. Since ‘prisons’ and ‘persons detained therein’ are State subjects under List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India, it is the responsibility of respective States/UTs to take appropriate action in the matter.(e) & (f) : The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had issued advisories to all States and Union Territories that prison inmates be Aadhaar seeded and had suggested that the local Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) unit can be approached for initiating the enrolment drive in all correctional homes. Since ‘prisons’ and ‘persons detained therein’ are State subjects under List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India, it is the responsibility of respective States/UTs to take appropriate action in the matter.
