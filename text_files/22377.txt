ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a)	Government has consistently called upon Sri Lanka to fulfill its commitments relating to the Tamil community in Sri Lanka. In his meetings with the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister, EAM reiterated India’s longstanding support for the reconciliation process in Sri Lanka and emphasised that it is in Sri Lanka’s own interest that the expectations of the Tamil people for equality, justice, peace and dignity within a united Sri Lanka are fulfilled. That applies equally to the commitments made by the Sri Lankan Government on meaningful devolution, including the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.(b) & (c) 	Since 2020, the Prime Minister has had two meetings with the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka - during the Sri Lankan Prime Minister’s visit to India in February 2020 and during the Virtual Bilateral Summit held on 26 September 2020. During the two meetings, the Prime Minister called upon the Government of Sri Lanka to address the aspirations of the Tamil people for equality, justice, peace and dignity within a united Sri Lanka, including by carrying forward the process of reconciliation with the implementation of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka. ***
