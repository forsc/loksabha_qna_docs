                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF JAL SHAKTI(SHRI  PRAHLAD SINGH  PATEL)(a) & (b) No, Sir.  For sanitation facilities, Government of India had launched Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) [SBM(G)], a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, with effect from 2nd October, 2014 with the aim to attain Open Defecation Free (ODF) India by 2nd October, 2019 by providing access to toilet facilities to all the rural households of the country.  The programme is being implemented through the State Governments.  From the date of launch of SBM(G), more than 10.7 crore individual household latrines (IHHLs) have been constructed under the programme as per the data reported by the States/UTs on the online Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) of SBM(G).  As a result, sanitation coverage in the rural areas of the country has increased from 39% as on 02.10.2014 to 100% and all the villages have declared themselves ODF. For drinking water facilities, Government of India in partnership with States is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) – Har Ghar Jal which aims at providing potable water in adequate quantity of prescribed quality on regular and long-term basis to every rural household, through tap water connection by 2024.  At the time of announcement of JJM, out of total 18.93 Crore rural households, 3.23 Crore rural households (17.05%) of the country were having tap water connections. Since then, over 4.58 Crore (24.11%) families living in rural areas have been provided with tap water connections in their homes and as on 26.07.2021, about 7.81 Crore (41.15%) households are having tap water connections.  As reported by States/UTs, as on 26.07.2021, with sources at a reasonable distance, 79.13% rural habitations having 78.07% population have provision of minimum 40 litre per capita per day (lpcd) of potable drinking water and 18.06% rural habitations having 19.48% population have service level of less than 40 lpcd potable water. However, 2.81% rural habitations having 2.45% of the rural population are reported to have water quality issues in ground water sources.*****
