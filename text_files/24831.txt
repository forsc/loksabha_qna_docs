ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND POWER (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) to (c) The Ministry of New and Renewable energy (MNRE) launched Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) on 8.3.2019, with the following three components:(i) Component-A: installation of 10,000 MW aggregated capacity small solar power plants each of capacity up to 2 MW on the barren/fallow land of the farmers;(ii) Component-B: installation of 20 lakh standalone off-grid solar water pumps; and(iii) Component-C: solarization of 15 lakh existing grid-connected agriculture pumps.Under the Scheme 30.8 GW solar power capacity will be created by 2022 with central financial support of Rs. 34,035 Crore. Under the Component-B and Component-C of the Scheme, the Central Government provides as subsidy 30% of benchmark cost or cost discovered through tender, whichever is lower. In addition to central financial support at least 30% of cost of solar pump is provided by the respective State Government. In case of North-Eastern states including Sikkim; hilly states of Himachal and Uttarakhand; UTs of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Andaman & Nikobar island and Lakshadwwep, higher central financial support of 50% of benchmark cost or cost discovered through tender, whichever is lower is being provided. A total of 47146 nos. of solar pumps have been installed under Component-B; and 580 nos. of existing pumps have been solarized under Component-C. State-wise details of the standalone solar pumps installed/ pumps solarized under PM-KUSUM Scheme and funds released is placed at Annexure-I.(d) Provision of sale of surplus power through solarisation of individual grid–connected pumps has been made under Component-C of PM-KUSUM Scheme. As solarisation of pumps has recently started on ground, billing of surplus power sold by farmers is yet to be reported by the state implementing agencies. (e)&(f) Dark zones or over-exploited ground water resources are identified by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) in association with the State ground water organisations. The ground water resources are assessed in units i.e blocks/ talukas/ mandals/ watersheds. These assessment units are categorized for ground water development based on two criteria - a) stage of ground water development, and b) long-term pre and post monsoon water levels. CGWB has notified 162 Over-exploited areas in the country for regulation of ground water development and management. State Implementation Agencies for PM-KUSUM Scheme so far have not reported installation of solar pumps in the ‘Dark Zones’. *****
