SURESH REGARDING ‘OUTSOURCING IN GOVERNMENT OFFICES’(a):   Yes, Sir.  The establishments in the Government may outsource employees based on their respective requirements. The General Financial Rules 2017 (GFR 2017) allow the Central Government establishments to outsource certain services. As each Ministry/Department is competent to procure services of outsourcing agencies at their level to meet seasonal or short-term requirements, the centralized data is not maintained in this regard. (b):   Regular inspections are conducted under relevant legislations for compliance of various Labour Laws. Scheme has been devised by Government to carry out inspections for implementation of various Labour Laws in Central sphere such as the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970, Minimum Wages Act, 1948, Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996 etc. to regulate the employment of contract labour, payment of wages and welfare of employees recruited through contractors.  The social welfare legislations apply equally to contract/outsourced labourers as in case of regular workers. (c):   Protection of the interests of contractors’ employees is enforced by the Government through the Office of Chief Labour Commissioner (Central) which carries out inspections in case of complaints received from outsourced employees to regulate issues of employment of contract labour, payment of minimum wages and welfare etc. against the contractors. The centralized data is not maintained in this regard.*****
