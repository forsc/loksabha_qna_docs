ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a): The salient features of Regional Connectivity Scheme(RCS)-UDAN(Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik) are as under:i.  UDAN intends to enable air operations on unserved routes connecting regional areas, promote balanced regional growth and make flying affordable for masses. ;ii.  Financial incentives in terms of concessions from Central, State Governments and airport operators are extended to Selected Airline Operators to encourage operations from unserved/underserved airports/heliports/water aerodromes and to keep the air fare affordable.;iii. Support to the Selected Airline Operators in the form of Viability Gap Funding (VGF). State Governments concerned provide 20% share towards VGF for RCS flights pertaining to their states. However, the share of VGF for North-Eastern states and the Union Territories is 10%.;iv. The airlines are required to commit around 50% of the seats as RCS seats (limited to 40 seats) on UDAN flights.;v. For balanced regional growth, route allocations are spread equitably across five regions in the country viz. North, South, East, West and North East (with a cap of 30% in a given region).;vi.  UDAN is a market driven mechanism. Development of regional air connectivity routes is left to market forces. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit proposals at the time of bidding under UDAN from time to time.;(b) to (e):  28 airports figure in the list of unserved/underserved airports in Rajasthan as per UDAN Scheme document. These airports are Abu Road, Alwar, Banasthali, Banswara, Bharatpur, Dholpur, Gadra Road, Hamirgarh, Isarda,  Jhalawar, Jhunjhunu, Kankoroli, Lalgarh, Malapura, Mathania, Merta Road, Nagaur,  Pilani, Salawas, Sawai Madhopur, Shahpur, Sirohi, Suratgarh, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Kishangarh, Kota and Uterlai. Twenty Four (24) Routes in Rajasthan have been awarded to SAOs under UDAN. Three airports, namely, Bikaner, Kishangarh and Jaisalmer have been operationalized under the scheme. UDAN is a demand driven and self financing scheme. The Implementing Agency provides Viability Gap Funding (VGF) to the Selected Airline Operators(SAOs) for operation of flights as per the provisions of the UDAN document.
