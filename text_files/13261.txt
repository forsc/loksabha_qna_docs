Indian Missions/ Posts abroad extend all possible help in transportation of mortal remains of Indians to India.There have been some requests regarding the high and variable cost of transportation of dead bodies of Indian nationals from Gulf countries to India. The matter was taken up with Ministry of Civil Aviation and Air India and based on the discussions, Air India implemented a flat rate for transfer of mortal remains of Indian nationals from Gulf countries to various destinations in India. The flat rate implemented by Air India amounts to average reduction of fares of up to 30-35% to some of the major destinations in India from Gulf countries.In addition, our Missions and Posts abroad continue to provide assistance for free of cost transfer of mortal remains to India under this Ministry’s Indian Community Welfare Fund (ICWF) in deserving cases on a means-tested basis.***
