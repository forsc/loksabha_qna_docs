Counselling, Retraining & Redeployment (CRR) Scheme is being implemented as a social safety net to provide opportunities of self / wage employment to the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) employees (or their dependents) separated under Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) / Voluntary Separation Scheme (VSS). The aim of retraining of the employees is to reorient them through short duration skill training to enable them to adjust to the new environment and adopt new avocations after their separation from the CPSEs.  From the year 2016-17, CRR Scheme is being implemented in collaboration with National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) under Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE). Areas of skill training include sectors like Health Care, Electronics, Retail Associates, Automotive, Food processing, Plumbing, Handicrafts, Logistics, IT etc. This has enabled beneficiaries to get opportunity of gainful redeployment (Wage / Self-employment). A Statement showing number of employees benefited / retrained and redeployed along with amount of expenditure incurred during last 5 years under CRR Scheme are enclosed at Annexure.*****
