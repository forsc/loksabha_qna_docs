The “Tea Development & Promotion Scheme” approved for implementation by Tea Board during the 15th Finance Commission period from 2021-22 to 2025-26 has a component for the welfare of small Tea growers and their workers.             Tea Board has provided the assistance of Rs.25.78 crore towards the welfare of the tea garden workers and their wards/dependents during the period from 2016-17 till 2021-22 (up to January, 2022) covering 36516 beneficiaries in All India. The working condition of tea garden workers in the country are governed by the Plantation Labour Act (PLA), 1951. The Act requires the employers to provide the workers with housing, medical facilities, sickness and maternity benefits and other forms of social security measures. There are provisions for educational facilities for the children, drinking water, conservancy, canteens, creches and recreational facilities for the benefit of the tea plantations workers and their families in and around the work places in the tea estates. The welfare provisions of the Plantation Labour Act, 1951 have now been subsumed in two labour codes- the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 and Social Security Code, 2020. The Plantation Labour Act, 1951 is implemented by the State Governments.There is no delay in disbursement of subsidy. Financial assistance of Rs. 119.03 crore has been provided by the Tea Board under the “Tea Development and Promotion Scheme” to the tea gardens of North Bengal during the last five years and current year [2016-17 till 2021-22 (upto January, 2022)]. Tea Board disburses subsidies to eligible tea stakeholders as per budget provisions and approved scheme guidelines. All cases where subsidy was sanctioned have been disbursed, hence there is no pendency.A provision of Rs. 200.00 crore was provided in the Budget of Tea Board for 2021-22. Sanction process for Rs. 200.00 Crore under BE has not been completed. *****
