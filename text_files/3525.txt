ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b) In the Joint Statement issued after the 27th BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) ministerial meeting on climate change held on 20th November 2018, BASIC Ministers underscored that enhanced pre-2020 ambition and actions are the foundation for post-2020 ambition and actions and invited all remaining Parties that have not yet done so to ratify the Doha Amendment for second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2013-2020). During the 24th Conference of Parties (COP 24) to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Poland from 02nd – 14th December 2018, India and other developing countries urged the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to ratify the Doha Amendment. As a result, the COP 24 decision underscores the urgent need for the entry into force of the Doha Amendment and urges Parties to the Kyoto Protocol that have yet to ratify the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol to deposit their instruments of acceptance with the Depositary as soon as possible.*****
