                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI  R.K. SINGH)(a) to (c) :  Government of India has provided funds to the States for implementation of smart metering under National Smart Grid Mission (NSGM) and Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS). Further, under the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) launched by Government of India on 20th July, 2021, provisions have been made to install 25 Crore pre-paid smart meters across the country by March, 2025.  Priority would be accorded to (i) all Electricity Divisions of 500 AMRUT cities, with AT&C Losses > 15%, (ii) all Union Territories, (iii) MSMEs and all other Industrial and Commercial consumers, (iv) all Government offices at Block level and above and (v) other areas with high losses for installation by Dec., 2023. RDSS does not mandate smart metering for agricultural consumers. The details of smart meters, including prepaid smart meters already installed in the country are available as Annexure.(d) & (e) : 	The Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) envisages smart metering on OPEX mode and provides financial support to DISCOMs opting for prepaid smart metering.  Under the scheme, in “Other than Special Category States”, a fixed amount of 15% (22.5% in case of Special Category States) of the cost per meter worked out over the whole project period, subject to a maximum of Rs.900/- (Rs.1350/- in case of special category States) per meter in case of consumer meters, will be funded.  States/UTs would be incentivised for deployment of prepaid Smart meters by December, 2023. An incentive @ 7.5% of the cost per consumer meter worked out for the whole project or Rs.450 per consumer meter, whichever is lower, would be provided for “Other than Special Category States" for prepaid Smart Meters installed within the targeted timeline of first phase mission i.e. by December, 2023. The incentive for Special Category States would be @ 11.25 % of the cost per consumer meter worked out for the whole project or Rs.675 per consumer meter, whichever is lower.For the purpose of execution of this scheme, all North Eastern States including Sikkim and States of Himachal Pradesh & Uttarakhand and Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep will be treated as Special Category States/UTs.(f) : 		While there are several agencies which have installed smart metering components across the States, large scale deployment of prepaid smart meters has been done by Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) in Bihar. As per information made available by South Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited (SBPDCL), collections after installation of prepaid Smart Meters have improved to the extent of 20%.**********
