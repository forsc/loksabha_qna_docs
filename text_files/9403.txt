ANSWER




MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a)	The process for Haj-2020 has beenmade 100% digital. This includes online application, E-Visa, Haj mobile app, digital pre-tagging of baggages of pilgrims, E-MASISA ( E-Medical Assistance System for Indian Pilgrims Abroad), Portal for Haj Group Organisers (HGOs) with their details and Haj packages.Government of India takes a number of measures for the welfare of the Indian Haj pilgrims both in India and in Saudi Arabia. The Indian Haj pilgrims are provided all basic facilities and services for their smooth, safe and comfortable Haj experience.Haj Committee of India (HCOI) is empowered to make arrangements for the pilgrims only in India under present norms. Ministry of Civil Aviation makes arrangements of air travel of HCoI pilgrims. It supervises the air charter operations during Haj period from 21 Embarkation Points across India and deploys officials in India and Saudi Arabia for assistance in embarkation and disembarkation of the pilgrims. Consulate General of India (CGI), Jeddah, under the overall supervision of Ambassador of India in Saudi Arabia has the responsibility to make arrangements for accommodation, local transport, etc. for the Indian pilgrims for their stay in Saudi Arabia in coordination with Haj Committee of India and Ministry of Minority Affairs. It also has the responsibility to redress their grievances while they are in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It also provides various medical facilities to the Indian Haj pilgrimsfor which temporary Haj Medical Mission offices are opened during Haj season. Ministry of Minority Affairs sends government officials including doctors and para medical staff on temporary deputation to Saudi Arabia during Haj Season to assist CGI, Jeddah in the management of Indian pilgrims in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and providing round-the-clock facilities to them. The new initiatives taken during last three years for ensuring better and adequate facilities for Haj pilgrims are given in Annexure. (b)	The hiring of accommodation in both Makkah and Madinah is done in a transparent manner. The matter of hiring of accommodations in Saudi Arabia is discussed in the annual inter-ministerial Haj review meeting, in which the accommodation hired during previous Haj is reviewed and broad parameters such as categories of accommodation, upper ceiling of rates of hiring, etc. are fixed for ensuing Haj and mandate is given to CGI, Jeddah for starting the process of hiring of accommodations in Makkah and Madinah as per the decisions taken in the meeting. For hiring accommodation, CGI, Jeddah issues advertisements well in advance in local newspaper and on their website, inviting landlords of buildings/ hotels or registered companies or building group dealing in renting of accommodation who are interested in renting their buildings/hotels for the Indian pilgrims coming through HCOI.The building hiring norms for accommodation in Makkah is placed on the website of the Consulate and hiring rates are also known to the building owners/companies in advance. Interested Landlords/Companies register their details on Consulate’s website. After preliminary assessment of the offers received by a team of CGI Officials, the shortlisted buildings are physically inspected and measured by Building Selection Teams (BST) comprising of officials of State Governments/ State Haj Committees. Those buildings, which are recommended by BSTs are again visited by Building Selection Committees (BSC) comprising of Members of HCoI and CGI Officials, which approves or rejects or grants conditional approval for hiring the buildings. The number of units hired in a particular building is as per the hiring norms.Once, the building is finally approved, details of the building are uploaded on the website of Ministry of Hajj and Umrah of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. If the building fulfills all local conditions including approval during inspection by Saudi Ministry of Haj Team, payment gateways are opened after a particular time set by the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah and all payments are to be mandatorily done exclusively through their website.For hiring accommodation in Madinah, advertisements are placed in local newspaper as well as Consulate’s website. Building Groups which deal with accommodation in Madinah, submit their intent to provide accommodation for the pilgrims. A delegation comprising of Chairman,Members and Chief Executive Officer of HCOI visit Saudi Arabia to discuss and negotiate with the groups who had conveyed their intent. The Delegation decides both the rates of accommodation of different categories as well as number of accommodation units to be provided by each group. As the negotiation takes place in the open in the presence of all competitors for providing accommodation, the decision making is highly transparent.*****
