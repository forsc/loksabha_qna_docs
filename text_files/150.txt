ANSWER




MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a)	& (b): CPCB vide letter dated 8th November, 2018 has directed all State Pollution Control Boards and Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) to ensure compliance of relevant provisions of the fly ash notification by all brick manufacturing units, agencies and authorities undertaking construction of building, roads, fly overs or approving its design within 300 km from coal/lignite based thermal power plants (TPPs) and Mines within 50 Km from TPPs by 31.12.2018. CPCB has also directed them to coordinate with the State Governments so as to ensure that State level Monitoring Committee meets atleast once in every quarter. (c) & (d)The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) issued the first Fly Ash notification on 14th September, 1999, which has subsequently been amended in 2003, 2009 and 2016 in order to enhance the fly ash utilization in the various infrastructure development projects.As per Central Electricity Authority (CEA) report, fly ash generation and utilization was 196 million ton and 132 millionton, respectivelyfrom 167 coal/lignite based TPPs in the countryduring 2017-18. The utilization of fly ash has increased from 66.6 million-ton in 2008-09 to a level of 132 million-ton in 2017-18. The percentage of fly ash utilization has increased from 57.11 % in 2008-09 to 67 % in 2017-18. ( e) Coal based thermal power plants are located in 20 States. The Notification mandates the use of fly ash or fly ash based products in construction projects, construction of embankments of roads or flyovers, reclamation of low lying areas, backfilling or stowing of mines, agriculture etc. The cost of transportation of ash up to 100 km distance shall be borne by the Thermal Power Plants (TPPs). The transportation cost between 100 km to 300 km shall be shared equally between the user and TPPs. It further prescribes that the coal or lignite based thermal power plants in the vicinity of the cities shall promote, support and assist in setting up of ash-based product manufacturing units so as to meet the requirements of bricks and other building construction materials.Expert Committee led by MoEFCC on increasing utilisation prepared action plan for enhanced utilisation for fly ash utilisation in the sectors namely mines, roads, bricks, cements etc. The Government of India has also reduced GST rates from 12-18% to 5% on fly ash, fly ash bricks and fly ash aggregates with 90% or more fly ash content. The Ministry of Power has launched a web-based monitoring system and a Fly Ash mobile application named ‘ASH TRACK’ to facilitate information exchange between TPPs and the users.*****
