(a) & (b): 	Yes Sir, as per the Allocation of Business (AOB) Rules, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is responsible for determining the Industrial Policy at Central Government level, including the productivity in Indian industry, Industrial Management, e-Commerce, Start-ups and facilitating Ease of Doing Business (EoDB).  The details of such policy measures are at Annexure-I. (c) to (f):  Government developed the Industrial Information System (IIS), an open web portal, to assimilate information of industrial infrastructure of clusters, parks, nodes, zones etc. across the country.  The Industrial Information System has evolved into a National GIS enabled Land Bank, also referred to as the India Industrial Land Bank by integrating GIS enabled industrial systems of States and UTs with the IIS portal.  For this, Government agencies are provided with unique User ID and password to upload the land details.   	The IIS portal has information on approximately 4000 industrial parks mapped across 5.5 lakh hectare of area with GIS layers on raw material availability, nodal points of connectivity, internal utilities and natural terrain including forest & drainage. 	So far GIS Systems of 13 States in two phases have been integrated with IIS to provide updates on land availability and plot level information, connectivity thereto, basic facilities, other facilities available and contact details of authorities/developer of the park. This information is accessible to investors anywhere in the world on real time basis which helps them in making informed decisions. The plot level information of industrial plots-sector/line of activity, availability status of plot, size of plot, contact details of relevant officer, etc is GIS enabled. This information is now updated on real time basis for 1539 industrial parks mapped across 4.97 lakh hectare of area across 13 States.  The State-wise details of these 1539 industrial zones/parks /clusters mapped on the portal is at Annexure-II.  	The investors/users can go to https://iis.ncog.gov.in/parks/login1 and use ‘Explore Parks’ tab to see the information available on the portal.  A mobile application has also been launched on Android and iOS stores for the ease of accessibility to investors/users.   *****
