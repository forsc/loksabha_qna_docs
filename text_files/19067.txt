                                                        (a) & (b) No Sir. As per the available information only one Indian vessel M.V Jag Anand (IMO No.9463308) owned by M/s Great Eastern Shipping Company had arrived at the Port of Jingtang, North China on 13 June, 2020 for discharging of Coal which she had loaded in Australia. The vessel had 23 Indian Crew on board. The vessel was stranded on account of difficulties faced by them regarding Crew Change at Chinese Ports as the Chinese Port Authorities have banned the entries of Foreigners w.e.f. 28 March, 2020 and suspended all visa and residence permits with a view to control the spread of Covid-19. The vessel was waiting at the port of Jintang, China till first week of January 2021.Information was also received for one foreign flag vessel M.V. Anastasia (IMONo.962590) with 16 Indian seafarers onboard stranded at Caofeidian Anchorage, China since 3rd August, 2020.(c) to (e) No Sir. No agreement has been reached to bring these stranded Indian seafarers.  However, on receipt of the information, the Directorate General of Shipping has taken up the matter with the following authorities seeking assistance to facilitate the crew change of seafarers & repatriation of the crew: i.	the Ministry of External Affairs, South West Division, New Delhi;ii.	the Embassy of India, Beijing, China;iii.	tthe Maritime Safety Administration of People Republic of China; andiv.	the Secretary General, International Maritime Organization (IMO), London. Later on the Indian flag vessel, M. V. Jag Anand was allowed to sail to Japan for crew change and all disembarked crew from the vessel on 18-19 January, 2021 at Chiba, Japan have since been repatriated to India on 20 January, 2021. The vessel M.V. Jag Anand then sailed out of Chiba, Japan on 21 January, 2021 for China. With regard to the vessel, M V Anastasia, the matter has been taken up with the Chinese authorities by the Ministry of External Affairs, Govt. of India/Indian Embassy at China for an early resolution. The foreign office of Hebei Province, China has informed that MV ANASTASIA can leave anchorage in order to effect the crew change, which is likely to take place from Tianjin Port. The authorities in Tianjin port are examining the matter of facilitating the crew change.                                        *****
