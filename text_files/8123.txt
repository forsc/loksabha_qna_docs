ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Yes, Sir. Government has launched a Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) to provide interest subsidy for housing loans to eligible beneficiaries belonging to Middle Income Group (MIG). The Scheme covers two income segments in the MIG viz. annual household income between Rs.6,00,001 to Rs.12,00,000 (MIG-I) and annual household income between Rs.12,00,001 to Rs.18,00,000 (MIG-II). The interest subsidy  under the scheme is available to beneficiaries of MIG-I and MIG-II categories for loan amounts upto Rs.9,00,000/- and Rs. 12,00,000/, respectively for acquisition / constructions of houses (including re-purchase). The interest subsidy is provided at the rate of 4% and 3%, respectively.(b) The details regarding CLSS beneficiaries State/UT-wise and Income Group category-wise are annexed at Annexure.(c) & (d) No, Sir.  However, in order to spread awareness, meetings and workshops are regularly held at City, State and Regional levels to explain the salient features of the PMAY (U) Mission including CLSS component. The Project Management Unit set up under the Mission and senior officers visit States/UTs to interact with the various stakeholders. To publicize the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) component of the mission, radio spots have been broadcast in twelve languages, including Hindi. Also, Social media and the medium of street plays have been used effectively to engage with the stakeholders. Further, workshops are regularly being held by the Central Nodal Agencies (CNAs) identified for operationalizing CLSS, to spread awareness among Banks, Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) and other Primary Lending Institutions (PLIs) on CLSS. The progress of the scheme is reviewed in the State Level Banker’s Committee (SLBC) meetings. A web portal named as CLSS Award Portal (CLAP) has also been launched which provides various information about the scheme.                                    *****
