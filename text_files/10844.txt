For import or manufacture of any medical device, the applicant is required to submit details of design, specification, non-clinical as well as clinical data of safety and performance of the devices. In case of new Medical Devices, the safety, quality and performance data are evaluated by CDSCO in consultation with the Subject Expert Committee in the relevant therapeutic areas. Under the said rules, there are provisions that subsequent to approval of a medical device, the applicant is required to closely monitor the device for its clinical safety. The applicant is required to submit Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) to CDSCO.         The Uniform Code of Pharmaceuticals Marketing Practices (UCPMP) announced by the Department of Pharmaceuticals in December, 2014 which is in operation since 01.01.2015 for voluntary adoption by pharma industry provides that the manufacturers should not use any unethical practices for luring doctors to boost sales of their products.          Further, Clause 6.8 (Code of Conduct for doctors in their relationship with pharmaceutical and allied health sector industry) of the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 prohibits doctors from taking gifts, travel facilities, hospitality or monetary grants from pharmaceutical and allied health sector industry. The said regulation empowers the Medical Council of India and respective State Medical Councils to award punishment to a doctor against any act in violation of code of Ethics.(d): No. (e) & (f):   Notified medical devices are regulated under Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Medical Device Rules, 2017 thereunder.
