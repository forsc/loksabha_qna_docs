The Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) was launched on 25 June, 2015 in 500 selected cities and towns across the country with the purpose to ensure that every household in the selected cities has access to a tap with assured supply of water and substantial improvement of sewerage connection. The Mission focuses on development of urban infrastructure in these cities in the sectors of water supply; sewerage and septage management; storm water drainage; green spaces and parks; and non-motorized urban transport.  Mission also mandates a set of 11 Reforms for all the Mission cities and Capacity Building activities for the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).(b).
