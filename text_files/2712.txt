ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) Under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), deposit free LPG connection is provided in the name of an adult woman member of a poor family and the beneficiary has an option to avail connection with 14.2 kg or 5 kg cylinder. The existing beneficiary with 14.2 kg LPG cylinder has an option to swap with 5 kg cylinder also.(b) & (e) As on 01.07.2019, more than 10.27 crore prospective consumers filled their Know Your Customer (KYC) forms under PMUY, out of which more than 7.30 crore connections have been released. KYC is rejected mainly due to submission of incomplete information, not being eligible under PMUY, having another connection in the name of other family member etc. Details of State/UT-wise LPG connections released under PMUY as on 01.07.2019 are at Annexure-I(c) As on 27.06.2019, more than one crore LPG consumers have given up their subsidy under “GiveItUp” campaign. State/UT-wise details are at Annexure-II. Estimated savings due to ‘GiveItUp’ campaign during Financial Year 2018-19 is ? 2,930 crore.(d) Government has introduced well targeted system of subsidy delivery to LPG consumers through PAHAL. This initiative of the Government was aimed at rationalizing subsidies based on approach h to cut subsidy leakages, but not subsidy per se. Applicable subsidy is directly transferred into the bank account of the beneficiaries. PAHAL has helped in identifying ‘ghost’ accounts, multiple accounts and inactive accounts. This has helped in curbing diversion of subsidised LPG to commercial purposes.The Government has decided to rationalize the subsidy outgo by excluding such LPG consumers from the purview of subsidy, whose or whose spouse have taxable income of ? 10 lakh and above during the previous financial year computed as per the Income Tax Act, 1961 w.e.f. 1.1.2016.LPG consumers were also encouraged to voluntarily give-up their LPG subsidy.(f) As on 01.07.2019, OMCs have released 1,71,372 connections in Churu district of Rajasthan under PMUY.
