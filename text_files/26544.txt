The Ministry of Tribal Affairs has been implementing the Scheme of ‘Mechanism for Marketing of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) through Minimum Support Price (MSP) & Development of Value Chain for MFP’ since 2013-14, with an objective of providing fair price to MFP gatherers, enhance their income level and ensure sustainable harvesting of MFPs. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs and TRIFED conducted a series of meetings through webinar with Chief Ministers, Hon’ble Member of Parliament of reserved constituencies, State Nodal Departments/State Implementing Agencies, advising the States about initiating procurement of MFPs and taking other livelihood measures. The Ministry revised minimum support prices of MFP with a purpose of providing enhanced income to tribal gatherers.

Under Van Dhan Yojana, starting from 27 Aug 2019 onwards, TRIFED has so far sanctioned 2,275 Van Dhan Vikas Kendras consisting of 34,125 Vandhan Self Help groups in 24 States and 2 UTs, in which 6.77 lakh Tribal women forest gatherers have been on boarded. A total of Rs. 336.95 crore has been sanctioned by TRIFED for the purpose.The ongoing intervention under PM Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana (PMJKAY) has been extended for a further period of five months till November, 2021, wherein, provision is there to provide an additional allocation of 5kg of food grains (wheat / rice), free of cost to around 80 crore National Food Security Act (NFSA) beneficiaries including tribal people.
