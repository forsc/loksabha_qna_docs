ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR) (a) to (d): The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) created under Section 3 of the Cinematograph Act, 1952 performs the statutory function of certifying films for public exhibition in accordance with the Cinematograph Act, 1952, Cinematograph (Certification) Rules, 1983 and guidelines issued thereunder. All films, promos, teasers, songs, trailers, etc. meant for public exhibition, irrespective of their length and media type (Celluloid, video, CD or DVD) are subjected to certification by the CBFC. The entire film certification process is being done online by CBFC since the launch of Online Certification System in March 2017. However, CBFC does not have mandate over internet platforms.(e):   The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the CBFC receive complaints, etc. from different sections of society from time to time regarding content on TV and in films.  The content telecast on private satellite TV channels is required to adhere to the Programme and Advertising Codes as prescribed in the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995.  Appropriate action is taken as per the rules whenever violation of the said Codes is established. For films, these are considered based on merits and disposed of, by taking suitable action under the provisions of the Cinematograph Act and Rules. Excisions and/or modifications are directed if any Guidelines under Section 5(2) of Cinematograph Act 1952 are violated. *********
