                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) :		Details of source-wise Installed Capacity during the last 3 years and the current year (upto February, 2022) are given at Annexure-I.(b) to (d) :	Renewable energy is categorized as a Must Run.  Details of Source-wise Renewable Energy generation during the last 3 years and the current year (upto January, 2022) are given at Annexure-II.  The steps taken by the Central Government to promote renewable energy in the country are given at Annexure-III.As on 28.02.2022, a total of about 152.899 Gigawatt (GW) of renewable energy capacity (including large hydro) has been installed in the country.  The renewable energy capacity including large hydro is expected to be around 500 GW by the year 2030.In order to reduce the dependence on coal, based on the Country''s COP26 commitment, more generation capacity will be added in Renewable & Nuclear sources to achieve the target of 500 GW from non-fossil fuel sources. With this addition, the share of coal based generation capacity is likely to reduce from 51.5 % as on 28.02.2022 to 31.8 % as on 31.03.2030.*********
