ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	The Government of India, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has approved a scheme titled “Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA)” to usher in digital literacy in rural India by covering 6 crore rural households (one person per household). To ensure equitable geographical reach, each of the 2,50,000 Gram Panchayats across the country are registering  an average of 200-300 candidates.  Special focus of the said Scheme is on training the beneficiaries on use of Electronic Payment System. The outcome measurement criteria include undertaking at least 5 electronic payments transactions by each beneficiary using UPI (including BHIM app), USSD, PoS, AEPS, Cards, Internet Banking. The Ministry of Rural Development is also implementing two skill development programmes for rural poor youth under the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) as follows:-I.	Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) which is a placement linked skill development program for wage employment.II.	Skill development through Rural Self Employment and Training Institutes (RSETIs) enabling a trainee to take bank credit and start his/her own Micro-enterprise. Some of such trainees may also seek regular salaried jobs.  DDU-GKY is being undertaken all over the country through Project Implementing Agencies (PIAs) registered with Ministry of Rural Development. Under DDU GKY, PIAs are mandated to set up the training centres as per the provisions made in Guidelines. The training centre may be established either in rural or in urban areas. As on 31st March 2019, DDU-GKY has over 1232 Training Centres in partnership with over 533 Project Implementing Agencies. The training on National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) aligned courses is provided to the rural youths.  Training on computer skill is an integral part of all courses run under DDU GKY. The Ministry of Rural Development in partnership with 31 Banks and State Governments is supporting Rural Self Employment Institutes (RSETIs) for skilling of rural youth to take up gainful self-employment. RSETI is being implemented through Lead Banks in the district. At present, there are 582 functional RSETIs in the country. RSETIs undertake 56 courses which are aligned with NSQF. Another 5 Entrepreneurship Development Program (EDP) courses have also been approved by MoRD. This Ministry has brought the functioning of RSETIs in sync with common norms notification of Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. (c):	Does not arise in view of reply given to point (a) and (b) above.  (d) & (e):	DDU- GKY and RSETI recognize the fact that skilling and placement/settlement involves migration of youth from their place of residence to locations outside their district or outside their States. In order to mitigate distress migration, DDU-GKY Guidelines provide for States concerned to set up Migration Support Centres (MSCs) in areas of high concentration of placement of skilled youth. These MSCs provide services to DDU-GKY candidates, including alumni support, accommodation assistance, counseling services, networking events with employers. To this purpose, MoRD has notified a Framework guidelines for Migration Support Centre. DDU-GKY provides for exclusive budgetary support to each State of Rs. 10 lakh per MSC per year.For promotion of self-employment in rural areas, trainings are also being imparted through RSETIs.(f):	Ministry of Rural Development is also implementing Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Programme (SVEP) to support rural entrepreneurs by developing an eco-system for supporting small businesses in rural areas. The scheme was approved on 6th May, 2015 and as on date, SVEP is being implemented in 153 blocks across 23 States.  As on 31st March, 2019, a total of 50,771 enterprises have been formed across 23 States and it is estimated to have created employment for 105,096 persons.*****
