HSCL had submitted a proposal to the Ministry for taking up its dispute with NTPC under the Administrative Mechanism for Resolution of CPSEs Disputes (AMRCD).  However, the proposal was incomplete because HSCL did not provide the supporting documents needed for preparation of the proposal for AMRCD.  On receipt of complete proposal from HSCL, the proceedings under AMRCD will be initiated.                                         *****
