ANSWER




                                                        (a)	The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing the following skill development schemes for the skill development of the youths across the country. S.No.	Scheme	Objective1.	Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY)	MSDE is implementing its flagship scheme PMKVY, with the objective to train candidates across India. PMKVY has two training components, namely, Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition Prior Learning (RPL).2.	Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) Scheme	The scheme aims to provide vocational skills to non-literate, neo-literate, persons with rudimentary level of education up to 8th and school dropouts up to 12th standards in the age group of 15-45 years. The priority groups are women, SC, ST, minorities, Divyangjan and other backward section of the society. The JSSs work at the doorstep of the beneficiaries with minimum infrastructure and resources.3.	National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS)	This scheme is for promoting apprenticeship training and increasing the engagement of the apprentices by providing financial support to industrial establishments under taking apprenticeship program under The Apprenticeship Act 19614.	Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS)	This scheme is for providing long term training in 143 trades through 14,417 Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) across the country.Further to this, MSDE initiated various convergence efforts across the skill ecosystem to bring a common set of rules and guideline into force so that the skill training provided across the country could follow a common set of rules in every area of skill Development. MSDE has undertaken various measures in this regard, the key measures are as below:-•	The introduction of the Common Cost Norms•	The creation of a National Skill Qualification Framework(NSQF) (b)	Since the details of people who have been provided skill training scheme-wise, state-wise and district-wise is too lengthy, all of them are available on the website of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (Link:- www.msde.gov.in/en/useful-links/parl-ques/lok-sabha).(c)	Details of the placement records scheme- wise are as follows: 1.	PMKVY: A three-month placement / self-employment monitoring is done by Training Providers, DSCs, SSDMs2.	Under no other scheme, tracking of placement records is not mandatory and hence records of the same are not maintained. (d)	PMKVY: Placement details of the candidates under PMKVY is placed at Annexure I. As per the Third Party Evaluation of PMKVY 2.0 (2016-20), it was found that average monthly income of PMKVY trained and certified individuals was 15% higher than the comparison group. Also, a significant 19% difference in average monthly income was observed with respondents who had undertaken RPL versus those who had not over a period of time. Moreover, 76% of the candidates acknowledged that after the training, they have better chance of getting employment.Even if it is not mandatory in any other scheme to maintain such records the following are some of the important facts in this regard.JSS: The objective of training imparted under JSS is to link the individuals for gainful livelihood and supplement their family income through self-employment and wage employment. The providing of employment/placement to the beneficiaries is not the mandate of the JSS Scheme. As far as the employment of the JSS scheme beneficiaries is concerned, third party evaluation report of the scheme has been mentioned. “It is finally observed that as an impact of the training programme conducted at JSSs, the self and wage employment and private job have become evident”. The usefulness of the scheme would be further self-evident from the fact that same report has mentioned that (I) 77.05% of the beneficiary trainees have under gone occupational shifts and (II) number of beneficiaries enrolled and trained has increased by 59.23% between the year 2018-19. This facts shows the positive impact of the scheme on the livelihood options of the beneficiaries. CTS: The final report of Tracer Study of ITI Graduates (published in January 2018 by the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, GoI) mentions that 63.5% of total ITI pass-outs got employed (wage+ self, out of which 6.7% are self-employed) and 36.4% remained unemployed and was looking for jobs. Even though the first figure was low for females (55.3%) as compared to that for males (65.1%), the corresponding figures for SCs (65%)and STs (69.8%) were higher than the percentage of total pass-outs in (wage+ self)employed.
