ANSWER




MINISTER OF CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS(SHRI D V SADANAND GOWDA)(a):     The main objectives of Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) Scheme are as under: i.	To promote balanced use of fertilizers.ii.	To reduce subsidy burden on the Government. iii.	To improve availability of fertilizers to farmers.iv.	To encourage competition among fertilizer companies(b):   Agriculture productivity depends upon many factors. DAC&FW has not conducted any study to evaluate the impact of NBS on agricultural productivity. DAC&FW is promoting and advocating the concept of balanced application of Fertilizer use which is also a major factor related to crop productivity. (c):   The Government has implemented Nutrient Based Subsidy Policy w.e.f. 1.4.2010 for Phosphatic and Potassic (P&K) Fertilizers.  Under the policy, a fixed amount of subsidy, decided on annual basis, is provided on subsidized P&K fertilizers depending on their nutrient content.  Under this policy, MRP is fixed by fertilizer companies as per market dynamics at reasonable level which is monitored by the Government. Accordingly, any farmer who is buying P&K fertilizers at MRP is availing the benefit of subsidy under the NBS scheme irrespective of the state. Thus, all the farmers (including poor and marginal farmers) in the state of Gujarat who are buying these fertilizers at MRP, are the beneficiaries under the NBS Scheme. ******
