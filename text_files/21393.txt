To have a comprehensive and objective data about availability of 3G & 4G services in villages, all the Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) were directed to collect the data village-wise & furnish to the Department.

This estimate is further reinforced by the extraordinary four times rise in number of smartphones in India from 16.5 crore in year 2014 to 70 crore in year 2020. It is gathered that good number of these smartphones are also in the hinterland. Similarly, data usage has increased 130 times from 89.4 MB per subscriber per month in year 2014 to 12.1 GB per subscriber per month in year 2020.Government of India is also implementing BharatNet project to provide broadband/high speed internet connectivity to all the Gram Panchayats (GPs) (approx. 2,50,000) in the country. As on 26.02.2021, a total number of 1,54,096 GPs including Block Head Quarters (BHQs)have been made service ready with broadband infrastructure.	As part of the BharatNet project, the last mile connectivity is being provided through Wi-Fi or any other suitable broadband technology, including Fibre to the Home (FTTH). In the 1.23 lakh GPs (approx.) of BharatNet Phase-I, the provisioning of Wi-Fi Services in about 1.10 lakh GPs has been assigned to CSC e-Governance Services India Limited (a Special Purpose Vehicle under Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology), and in about 10,000 GPs to Government of  Rajasthan/Raj COMP Info Services Ltd. (RISL), etc. 	So far, by utilising the BharatNet network, Wi-Fi hotspots have been installed at 1,03,400 GPs, and 4,95,078Fibre to the Home (FTTH) connections have been provided.(d) 		In Parbhani district of Maharashtra, out of 830 villages (as per Census 2011), a total of 809 villages have broadband internet connectivity using 3G or 4G mobile wireless coverage. Further, under BharatNet, 307 GPs out of total of 708 GPs have been made service ready and the remaining are under implementation.  (e) 	As per TRAI’s Indian Telecom Services Performance Indicators report dated 21st January 2021, the average per GB wireless data cost is Rs 10.95.However various Service Providers are free to offer special tariff plans for different segments of customers including students.************
