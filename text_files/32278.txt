ANSWER




                                                        ANSWER        THE MINISTER OF FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(SHRI PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a) The Central Government has no specific policy to encourage the modernization of poultry farms in the dry and non-irrigated areas. However, Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying has recently introduced technologically assisted (modern technology based integrated/ advanced poultry farms) under Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF) to encourage modernization of poultry farming in the country. (b) No such assessment has been done for estimating the actual demand for poultry products in the country.(c) Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying is implementing a scheme namely “Assistance to States for control of Animal Diseases” (ASCAD) under “Livestock Health and Disease Control” (LH&DC) which covers the vaccination of economically important poultry diseases, including control and containment of emergent and exotic diseases like Avian Influenza. Department has developed Action plan for Preparedness, Control and Containment of Avian Influenza which was formulated in 2005 and revised in 2006, 2012, 2015, 2021 Under the LH&DC Scheme financial assistance is provided to the States for upgradation of Diagnostic Laboratories at the district level. In addition, there are six Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratories for prompt and effective diagnosis of different Livestock and poultry Diseases. A National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal under Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has been specially designated as National Referral Laboratory for diagnosis of Avian Influenza which is also financially assisted by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying for diagnosis of Avian Influenza. As regards to waste management, the ICAR –Central Avian Research Institute (CARI), Izatnagar, Bareilly has developed two pilot scale technologies for waste management and adoption of new renewable energy: I. Dilution, Acidification and Carbonization (DAC) technology: used for all weather biogas generation exclusively from poultry excreta and further utilization of it is used as manure in agriculture. The signifying point of this technology is that only poultry excreta are required for biogas production. Used slurry has good manure value and germination potential (>90%), hence can be easily applied in agricultural fields without burning effect on plants which is a common problem with crude poultry excreta. The overall impact of this technology is to alleviate environmental pollution, economize poultry production and generate additional income at poultry establishments. II. Aerobic composting of poultry wastes: (litter, excreta, hatchery waste, slaughter waste, mortalities etc.) has been standardized using various poultry wastes and carbonaceous material (tree leaves, grasses and other plant wastes) for conversion into manure for utilization in organic crop farming as an alternative to chemical fertilizers. These two technologies reduce pollutants, bad odour and flies from poultry establishments. ln addition, preparation of vermi-compost from poultry litter waste (cage litter) is also being practiced at ICAR institutes. (d) & (e) No Sir. No such data is maintained. However, Rs 1387.14 lakhs was released to States/UTs under “Assistance to States for control of Animal Diseases” (ASCAD) under “Livestock Health and Disease Control” (LH&DC) for the FY 2020-21 & 2021-22 for control and containment of Avian Influenza including compensation to farmers whose birds have been culled, poultry eggs and Poultry feed has been destroyed.*****
