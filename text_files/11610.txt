                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****   STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 494 BY DR. ALOK KUMAR SUMAN TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 05.02.2020 REGARDING NEW RAILWAY PROJECTS IN GOPALGANJ  (a):  No, Sir. Projects are sanctioned Zone-wise but not district-wise/ state-wise.   However, sanction of projects for development of Railways is taken up on the basis of last mile connectivity, missing links, alternate routes, remunerativeness, etc.  At present, 55 Projects (New line/Gauge conversion/Doubling) costing ` 71,795 crore for 4,952 km length falling fully/partly in the State of Bihar are under different stages of planning/approval/  execution. Further, total 13 projects covering a length of 986 km  costing             ` 13231 crore falling fully/partly in the State of Bihar have been included in the Budget during last five years and current year (2014-15 to 2018-19 & 2019-2020) and are in different stages of planning/ approval/execution.  (b) and (c): There is an ongoing Hathua-Bhatni (79.64 km) new line project falling fully/partly  in the District of Gopalganj. The latest anticipated cost of the project is ` 770.08 crore. An expenditure of            ` 277.13 crore has been incurred upto March, 2019. Hathua-Panchdeori section (31 km) has been commissioned. Work on balance 48.64 km is held up due to non availability of land (36.00 km in the district of Gopalganj of Bihar and 12.64 km in the District of Deoria of Uttar Pradesh). Land acquisition proceeding for 333 Acre in Panchdeori-Bhore (36 km) section has been taken up in Bihar State and 101.13 Acre in Deoria District of Uttar Pradesh. The completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions of working agencies/contractors etc. and all these factors affect the completion of the project. Therefore,  confirmed timeline for this project cannot be given. To ensure the project is completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, Divisional level, Zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues obstructing the progress of projects. Besides to ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects. ******
