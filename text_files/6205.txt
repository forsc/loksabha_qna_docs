Through Technology Mission programme, DST supports technologies aiming for generating clean energy (smart grids, off grids, clean coal, methanol, solar energy) and water. National Supercomputing Mission of DST through “Build” approach has taken steps towards manufacturing most of the mother board components of Super computers in India itself.The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) under Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) through New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative (NMITLI) scheme has developed various Indigenous technologies with public private partnership. Some of the indigenous technologies for process and product include: Vaccine against Johne’s Disease, Battery operated hand held micro PCR for diagnosing Tuberculosis, Malaria, Dengue, Chikungunya, Hepatitis B and HINI, Supercontinuum Light Source based Confocal Microscope etc.Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) through Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC) has developed numerous indigenous technologies in the entire spectrum of Nuclear Science and Engineering and related areas.
