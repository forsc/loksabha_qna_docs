                                                        THE MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a) to (d) A statement is laid on the table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF STARRED QUESTION    NO *66 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 06.02.2020 REGARDING WATER CRISIS RAISED BY SHRI T.R. BAALU, M.P.(a) to (d)   NITI Aayog, in its report titled “Composite Water Management Index” published in June 2018, has mentioned that India is undergoing the worst water crisis in its history. Further, NITI Aayog, in its report has mentioned that many cities including Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, etc., are expected to run out of groundwater by 2020. This is based on the estimates of annual groundwater replenishment and its extraction. It does not take into account the groundwater availability in the deeper aquifers. Names of such cities as intimated by NITI Aayog are given at Annexure.Water being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation and efficient management of water resources are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments. In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Central Government provides technical and financial assistance to them through various schemes and programmes. Central Government has taken various steps to tackle water crisis in the country.Ministry of Jal Shakti launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), a campaign for water conservation and water security, in 256 water-stressed districts of the country.Hon’ble Prime Minister has written a letter to all sarpanchs on 08.06.2019 regarding the importance of water conservation and harvesting and exhorted them to adopt all appropriate measures to make water conservation a mass movement.Central Government has formulated a National Perspective Plan (NPP) for Water Resources Development which envisages transfer of water from water surplus basins to water deficit basins through inter-linking of rivers. Government of India has approved Atal Bhujal Yojana (Atal Jal), a Rs.6000 Crore Central Sector Scheme, for sustainable management of ground water resources with community participation in water stressed blocks of Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The scheme is being implemented during 2020-21 to 2024-25 with the financial assistance of World Bank with a sharing pattern of 50:50 between Government of India and World Bank. The implementation of the scheme is likely to have several positive outcomes including community based approach for addressing groundwater depletion issues, sustainable groundwater management through convergence of ongoing/new schemes, adoption of efficient water use practices for irrigation, augmentation of groundwater resources in targeted areas, etc.Department of Water Resources, RD & GR is making efforts to create awareness amongst people about water conservation. National Water Awards have been initiated to recognize efforts made in the field for water conservation/management. National Water Mission (NWM) has initiated a seminar series in March, 2019 - “Water Talk” - to promote dialogue and information sharing among participants on various water related topics. NWM has launched a campaign ‘Sahi Fasal’ to nudge farmers to go for crops which use less water and efficiently also. ***** ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. *66 to be answered on 06.02.2020 regarding “Water Crisis”.Cities likely to face water scarcity as per NITI AayogS.No	State	City1	Delhi	Delhi2	Gujarat	Gandhinagar3	Haryana	Gurgaon, Yamunanagar4	Karnataka	Bangalore5	Madhya Pradesh	Indore, Ratlam6	Punjab	Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Mohali, Patiala7	Rajasthan	Ajmer, Bikaner, Jaipur, Jodhpur8	Tamil Nadu	Chennai, Vellore9	Andhra Pradesh	Hyderabad10	Uttar Pradesh	Agra, Ghaziabad*****
