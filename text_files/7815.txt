                                                        (a) to (c):  To create employment opportunities and dispersal of IT/ITES industry in small cities and towns including rural areas (excluding metro locations), Government had launched India BPO Promotion Scheme on 28th December 2015. The scheme aims to incentivize setting up of 48,300 seats BPO/ITES operations by providing financial support up to  Rs. 1 lakh per seat in the form of viability gap funding for capital and operational expenditure along with special incentives like encouraging employment to women and physically disabled persons, promoting local entrepreneurs etc. The disbursements of financial support are directly linked with the objective i.e. employment generation by the units. Since the inception of the scheme, 243 units have started BPO/ITES operations for a total of 47,244 seats across 22 States/UTs of the country (excluding North Eastern Region as that is covered under North East BPO Promotion Scheme), providing direct employment to over 33,000 persons. The duration of IBPS was up to 31.03.2019. The State wise details of BPO/ITES units who started operations under the scheme is at Annexure.  ****** AnnexureDetails of BPO/ITES units started under IBPSS.No	 State/UT Name 	Units	Seats*	Employment1	Andhra Pradesh  	45	13584	87492	 Bihar	12	2300	10953	Chandigarh U.T.	1	100	584	Chhattisgarh	4	400	1945	Gujarat	1	100	106	Haryana	3	300	1517	Himachal Pradesh	3	250	1448	Jammu & Kashmir	8	400	5599	Jharkhand	20	2950	175210	Karnataka	11	2400	135311	Kerala	3	400	20512	 Madhya Pradesh	6	1300	115513	Maharashtra	16	3445	205914	Odisha	21	2232	189415	Puducherry U.T.	1	100	10516	Punjab	10	2600	348117	Rajasthan	3	400	57918	Tamil Nadu 	47	6865	803519	Telangana	3	2398	21020	Uttar Pradesh	13	3320	90221	Uttarakhand	6	500	29522	West Bengal	6	900	182 	Total	243	47,244	33,167 *The budget allocation for each State is according to seats allocated.	********
