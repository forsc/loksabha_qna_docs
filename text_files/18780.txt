The Government has adopted a policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism.Immediate and effective retaliation is undertaken by the security forces in cases of ceasefire violations/ cross border firings. There has been a substantial decline in the terrorist attacks over the last three years, due to a slew of pre-emptive measures undertaken by the Government.The details of the incidents of ceasefire violations, terrorist attacks, civilians and security force personnel killed/injured in ceasefire violations and terrorist attacks along with the number of terrorists killed in counter attacks during each of the last three years in Jammu and Kashmir are as under: -Type of incident		2018	2019	2020Ceasefire violations	Incidents 	2140	3479	5133	Civilian killed	30	18	22	Civilians injured	143	127	71	Security Personnel martyred	29	19	24	Security  Personnel injured	116	122	126Terrorist attacks	Incidents	614	594	244	Civilian killed	39	39	37	Civilians injured	63	188	112	Security Personnel martyred	91	80	62	Security Personnel injured	238	140	106	Terrorists killed	257	157	221(d) The last DG level meeting of BSF and Pakistan Rangers was held from 08-10 November, 2017 at New Delhi.
