ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS (KIREN RIJIJU) (a) to (c) Adequate support for training and preparation of athletes including diet is being provided to athletes and teams preparing for participation in international sports events including Olympics, Asian Games and Commonwealth Games. The Government provides assistance to sportspersons preparing for major international events by providing funding support through its Scheme of Assistance to National Sports Federations (NSFs).   The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports (MYAS) is implementing Target Olympic Podium (TOP) Scheme since July 2014 under overall ambit of National Sports Development Fund (NSDF) with the aim to identify, groom and prepare potential medal prospects for Olympic and Paralympic Games. Extensive or special training is being provided to the selected athletes as per their requirements under selected coaches / training institutes in India and abroad. At present, 94 athletes and 2 teams are included in the TOPS whose details are in Annexure. Private and public entity are contributing to NSDF. Since, Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) is an athlete centric continuous programme, therefore has no ceiling of the year and accordingly, funding is aligned with individual athletes’ requirements and long term plan. (d) Under the various sports promotional schemes of SAI and Khelo India, 10248 and 2932 athletes, have been selected respectively in various sports disciplines which includes non-Olympic disciplines too, are provided financial assistance.     *****
