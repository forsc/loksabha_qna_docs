(c): The proposals for construction of Road Over Bridges/Road Under Bridges (ROBs/RUBs) are received regularly at all levels from different sources, i.e. from Public Representatives, Dignitaries, State Government & various groups, which are processed by Zonal Railway for obtaining consent of State Government for closure of Level Crossing (LC) and cost sharing, wherever applicable. Based on the outcome of this exercise, proposals are processed for inclusion in Railway Works Programme.
