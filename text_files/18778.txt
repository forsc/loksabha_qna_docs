                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS (SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) & (b): National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) compiles prison statistics reported to it by States and Union Territories (UTs) and publishes it in its annual report “Prison Statistics India”. The latest published report is of the year 2019. State/UT-wise total available capacity of prisons, total number of prisoners and undertrial prisoners lodged in prisons as on 31st December, 2019 are given in Annexure.-2-L.S.US.Q NO. 146 FOR 02.02.2021(c) & (d): This data has not been reported to NCRB by the States and UTs. (e):   ‘Prisons’ and ‘persons detained therein’ are State subjects as per Entry 4 of List II of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. Administration and management of prisons is the responsibility of State Governments. States and UTs are competent to adopt appropriate measures in their jurisdictions to reduce population in prisons. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has issued various advisories to the States & UTs, from time to time, for adopting suitable measures to reduce overcrowding in prisons. In view of the Covid-19 situation, MHA had issued an advisory to all States and UTs and Prison authorities on 12th March, 2020 advising them to take appropriate precautions and steps such as washing hands regularly, properly covering mouth and social distancing etc. for maintaining proper hygiene condition in prisons. They were also advised to reduce movement of prison inmates and make use of video conference facilities for their production in Courts and for their visitors etc. in place of personal appearances and meetings. On 2nd May, 2020, MHA issued another comprehensive advisory on management of COVID-19 in prisons. Detailed guidelines and protocols to be followed in prisons were also shared with all States and UTs.-3-L.S.US.Q NO. 146 FOR 02.02.2021Taking cognizance of the fact that overcrowding of prisons is a serious concern in the context of COVID-19 pandemic, the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, in Suo Motu Writ Petition (C) No. 1 of 2020 vide its Order dated 23.3.2020 had directed all States and UTs to constitute a High Powered Committee to determine as to which class of prisoners can be released on parole or interim bail, for such period as may be thought appropriate by them. The Court had further directed the States and UTs that they leave it open for the High Powered Committee of respective States to determine the category of prisoners who may be released, depending upon the nature of offence, number of years to which they have been sentenced or the severity of the offence with which they have been charged or any other relevant factor, which the Committee may consider appropriate.  Based on this direction of the Hon’ble Court, many States and UTs had released prisoners on parole/bail in their jurisdictions.
