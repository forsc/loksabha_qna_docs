ANSWER




                                                        (a):Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has implemented the network of Common Services Centres (CSC) under the Digital India Programme. The CSC scheme envisages setting up of at-least one CSC in each of 2.50 lakh Gram Panchayats (GPs) across the country, for delivery of various Government-to-Citizen (G2C) and other citizen-centric e-Services to citizens. It is a self-sustainable entrepreneurship model which is run by Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs). As on December 2021, total 4,46,789 CSCs are functional across all states & Union Territories of the country, out of which, total 3,48,391 CSCs are functional at Gram Panchayat (GP) level. The list of number of CSCs in the country (State/UT-wise) is enclosed at Annexure-I.(b), (c) and  (d):  CSC SPV under its own initiative, started  “StreeSwabhiman” Project in 2017 for advancing women’s health and hygiene, especially in rural areas of the country. CSC SPV, through this initiative is striving to create a skill-oriented sustainable model for providing affordable and accessible sanitary products close to the homes of adolescent girls and women. The initiative is driven by awareness and outreach by the Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLE) to effect behavioural change towards the issue of menstrual hygiene in the community. Under this project, Sanitary Napkin Micro Manufacturing Units are being set up at CSCs across the country, particularly those operated by women VLEs. The sanitary napkins produced by these units not only suit the needs of low-income communities, but are also bio-degradable and thus environment friendly. Besides, these are made easily accessible to rural communities.Under StreeSwabhiman initiative, a number of women entrepreneurs have turned out to be the symbols of empowerment for women and girls in their communities. They are not just advancing women’s health and hygiene, but also providing employment opportunities for other women in their community.A total number of 1,276 (One thousand two hundred seventy-six) Sanitary Napkin manufacturing units have been set up across the country. The State/UT-wise list of  Manufacturing Unit for sanitary pad,  setup under the StreeSwabhiman Project is enclosed in Annexure II.No other activity relating to social concerns and women’s empowerment has been identified by CSC-SPV.******* Annexure-ISTATE/UT-WISE STATUS OF ROLL OUT CSCs AS ON 31 DECEMBER, 2021 	Functional CSCs (Urban+Rural)	Functional CSCs at GP level State/UT	31 Dec''21	31 Dec''21 Andhra Pradesh	9042	6694Arunachal Pradesh	143	108Assam	9384	8513Bihar	39745	35366Chhattisgarh	17441	13838Goa	127	85Gujarat	13132	9154Haryana	18880	13263Himachal Pradesh	4661	4097Jharkhand	16465	13993Karnataka	11831	7683Kerala	5574	4338Madhya Pradesh	36639	27269Maharashtra	50929	38908Manipur	913	747Meghalaya	824	729Mizoram	324	215Nagaland	365	240Odisha	15131	13181Punjab	10884	7586Rajasthan	20005	16139Sikkim	76	60Tamil Nadu	11549	7549Telangana	6229	4271Tripura	1432	1245Uttar Pradesh	106578	83637Uttarakhand	7855	5775West Bengal	20064	17976State Total	436222	342659Andaman & Nicobar	55	33Chandigarh	100	6Dadra & NH, D&D	66	44Delhi	3713	216Jammu & Kashmir	6326	5230Ladakh	75	66Lakshadweep	14	14Puducherry	218	123UT Total	10567	5732 GRAND TOTAL	446789	348391Annexure-IIThe State/UT-wise list of  Manufacturing Unit for sanitary pad,  setup under the StreeSwabhiman ProjectS.No	State/UT	Unit Setup1	Andhra Pradesh	382	Assam	223	Bihar	1184	Chhattisgarh	745	Daman And Diu	16	Delhi	107	Goa	18	Gujarat	509	Haryana	1210	Himachal Pradesh	1211	Jammu & Kashmir	512	Jharkhand	5113	Karnataka	1814	Kerala	3315	Madhya Pradesh	5716	Maharashtra	7217	Manipur	118	Meghalaya	1519	Mizoram	120	Nagaland	1321	Odisha	28122	Punjab	3523	Rajasthan	10324	Sikkim	125	Tamil Nadu	626	Telangana	2727	Tripura	328	Uttar Pradesh	12429	Uttarakhand	2430	West Bengal	68	Total	1276*******
