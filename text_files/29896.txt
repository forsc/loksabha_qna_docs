One of the components of this Scheme, “Promotion of rural and indigenous/tribal games” is specifically dedicated to the rural sector of the country.(c) and (d) ‘Sports’ being a State subject, the primary responsibility to promote sports at rural level and construct new stadiums or sports complexes rests with the respective State/Union Territory Governments.
