MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) 	Since August 2019, Government of India, in partnership with States, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) to make provision of tap water supply to every rural household of the country by 2024. The key features of the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) are to make provision of potable water to every rural household through tap water connection at a service level of 55 litre per capita per day (lpcd), of prescribed quality (BIS:10500) and on regular and long-term basis. (b) 	The details of Central fund allocated, released/ drawn by the State and reported utilization in Assam under the then National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP) in 2018-19 and under JJM in 2019-20, 2020-21 & 2021-22 is as under:(Amount in Rs. Crore)Year	Central fund	Expenditure under State share	Opening Balance	Allocation	Amount drawn	Total fund available	Reported utilization	2018-19	394.85	567.89	300.76	695.61	336.25	48.342019-20	359.35	694.95	442.36	801.71	358.87	29.012020-21	452.45	1,608.51	551.77	1,004.22	880.44	90.022021-22*	123.78	5,601.16	1,400.29	1,532.37	410.21	55.11*as on 02.08.2021 							Source: JJM, IMIS (c) to (e) 	Drinking water supply is a State subject. Power to plan, design, approve, implement, operate and maintain water supply schemes is vested with States. As such, details of individual projects, inter alia which includes tendering process, etc. are not maintained by this Department. As reported by the State of Assam, the district-wise number of rural households that are yet to be provided with tap water supply are annexed. (f) 	A number of steps have been taken to plan and implement JJM to make provision of potable tap water supply to rural households, schools, anganwadi centres, ashramshalas, etc. with speed, inter alia, which includes joint discussion and finalization of annual action plan (AAP) of States/ UTs including Assam, regular review of implementation of mission works, workshops/ conferences/ webinars for capacity building and knowledge sharing, field visits by multi-disciplinary team to provide technical support, etc. A detailed Operational Guidelines for the implementation of JJM; Margdarshika for Gram Panchayats & VWSCs to provide safe drinking water in rural households and Guidelines on 100–days campaign to provide piped water supply in anganwadi centres, ashramshalas and schools have been shared with States/ UTs, including Assam to facilitate planning and implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission. For online monitoring, JJM–Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) and online JJM–Dashboard has been put in place. Provision has also been made for transparent online financial management through Public Financial Management System (PFMS). Since launch of Jal Jeevan Mission in August, 2019, in Assam, so far 8.59 lakh (13.56%) rural households have been provided with tap water connections. Thus, as on date, 9.71 lakh (15.32%) rural households in the State have provision of tap water supply.*****
