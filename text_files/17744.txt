(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):	 There is no proposal for fixing separate Minimum Support Price (MSP) for Organic Cotton. However, Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare fixes the MSP for two basic varieties of Cotton viz. Medium Staple Cotton and Long staple Cotton on the basis of recommendations of Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP), after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned and other relevant factors. Further, on the basis of support prices of these two basic classes of seed cotton and taking into account the quality differential, normal price differential and other relevant factors, the support price for other classes of seed cotton of Fair Average Quality (FAQ) are fixed by the Ministry of Textiles.  These classes of seed cotton are defined on the basis of Basic Staple Length and the Micronaire value.All varieties of Cotton for which MSP is announced are procured by the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI), the nodal agency for the procurement of cotton, subject to meeting FAQ norms.  However, farmers have the option to sell their produce to the government agencies or in the open market if that is beneficial to them.******
