                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION  (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	& (b) Erstwhile Planning Commission was the nodal agency for estimation of poverty in the country and it used a poverty line based on per capita consumption expenditure as the criterion to determine the persons living below the poverty line (BPL) in rural and urban areas. For determination of the methodology to estimate poverty line erstwhile Planning Commission constituted Expert Groups from time to time. The most recent Expert Group whose recommendations were accepted by the Government in 2011 was chaired by Prof. Suresh D. Tendulkar. Based on the data of Large Sample Survey on Household Consumer Expenditure collected by NSSO in its 68th round conducted in 2011-12 the poverty lines and poverty ratio were estimated following the extant Tendulkar Committee methodology in 2011-12 and released through a Press Note issued on 22nd July 2013. The Press Note defined the poverty line using the criterion of Monthly Per Capita Consumption Expenditure (MPCE). For the year 2011-12, the poverty line at all India level was estimated as MPCE of Rs. 816 for rural areas and Rs. 1000 for urban areas.Ministry of Rural Development also conducts Below Poverty Line (BPL) Census to identify the poor households in the rural areas, to determine the potential beneficiaries under various programmes of the Government of India. The first BPL Census was conducted in 1992 for the Eighth Five Year Plan. Subsequently, BPL census was conducted in 1997, for the Ninth Five Year Plan and in 2002 for the Tenth Five Year Plan period. In 2011, in place of BPL Survey, a Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011 (SECC 2011) was conducted in association with the States/UTs under technical and financial support from the Government of India where besides the Ministry of Rural Development, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner and the States/UTs had also participated.  The findings of SECC (2011) in rural areas are available on www.secc.gov.in. Ranking of Households in rural areas under SECC (2011) was made through a three-step process involving 13 (Thirteen) Automatic Exclusion parameters for identifying not-poor households, 5 (five) Automatic Inclusion parameters for identifying poorest of the poor households and 7 (seven) Deprivation Criteria for identifying poor households. SECC data captures respondent based disclosures on socio economic status of 17.97 crore rural households which has allowed automatic exclusion of 07.07 crore of households as not poor on the basis of 13 parameters, automatic inclusion of 0.16 crore  households as poorest of the poor on the basis of 5 parameters and grading of deprivation of 8.72 crore  of rural households on the basis of seven criteria. SECC – 2011 database helps the Government to generate programme specific priority list for targeting beneficiaries. (c)   State/UT-wise ratio and number of population below poverty (Tendulkar Methodology)   is at Annexure-I and the State/UT-wise data of Socio-economic Caste Census-2011 (Rural) is at Annexure –II.***** Annexure-1                  Number and Percentage of Population below poverty line by states - 2011-12 (Tendulkar Methodology)Sl.
