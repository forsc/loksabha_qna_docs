Following are the salient features of this Mission:-  1.	Component -l (Research, Innovation and Development) with outlay of Rs. 1000 Crore. This component is for promotion of both (i) fundamental research at fibre level aiming at path breaking technological products in Carbon Fibre, Aramid Fibre, Nylon Fibre, and Composites and (ii) application based research in geo-textiles, agro-textiles, medical textiles, mobile textiles and sports textiles and development of bio-degradable technical textiles.The fundamental research activities are proposed to be conducted in various Centre for Scientific &Industrial Research (CSIR) laboratories, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and other scientific/ industrial/academic laboratories of repute. Application based research is proposed to be conducted in CSIR, IIT, Research Design &Standards Organisation (RDSO) of Indian Railways, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Defence Research &Development Organisation (DRDO), National Aeronautical Laboratory (NAL), Indian Road Research Institute (IRRI) and other such reputed laboratories.2.
