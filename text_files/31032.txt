MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION, MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS (RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a)&(b) The Government has received references from Members of 16th Lok Sabha from across the country requesting for release of pending installments due to them to resume the ongoing works and clear the committed liabilities under MPLADS  after the decision of the Government not to operate MPLADS during Financial Year 2020-21 and 2021-22. Accordingly, the Government has approved the restoration of MPLADS during the remaining part of the Financial Year 2021-22 with release of MPLADS fund at the rate of ? 2 crore per Member of Parliament in one instalment; and continuation of MPLADS up to 2025-26 with annual entitlement per Member of Parliament (MP) at ? 5 crores. (c)     The transfer of unutilized funds to successor (sitting) Lok Sabha MP is regulated by para-4.7 of MPLADS Guidelines, which provides that in respect of elected Members of Lok Sabha, the balances of MPLADS funds left by the predecessor MP in a Lok Sabha constituency (funds not committed works of the predecessor MP) would be passed on to the successor (sitting) MP from that constituency. (In case of fresh delimitation, separate orders will be issued).  (d)  As per the latest Monthly Progress Report(MPR) for the Month of November, 2021, there is no uncommitted fund available in the account of 16th Lok Sabha MP of Tejpur constituency.                                                *****
