                                                         MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) to (f):  Against total stocks of 741.41 LMT (as on 01.06.2019), the total storage capacity available with Food Corporation of India (FCI), Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and the State Agencies (both owned and hired capacity), is 862.45 LMT (as on 31.05.2019) comprising 739.76 LMT in covered godowns and 122.69 LMT in Cover and Plinth (CAP) storage. As such, there is sufficient capacity for storage of central pool foodgrains at the national level.  The foodgrains are stored scientifically with various preservation measures like fumigation and treatment with pesticides. In spite of taking necessary care and precautions, some quantities of foodgrains may become non-issuable due to various reasons like natural calamities, transit damages and in some cases due to negligence of officials, for which suitable disciplinary action is invariably taken.                                                        .....2/--2-During the last 5 years including current year, the percentage damage to wheat stored in CAP due to various reasons by FCI are given below:Year	Quantity of wheat stored by FCI in CAP as on 1st  June of Year (in MT)	Quantity of Damaged Wheat accrued in CAP in FCI (in MT)	Percentage damage in CAP with respect to the quantity stored in CAP2015-16	5,31,312	2.2	0.0004%2016-17	2,65,101	1.9	0.0007%2017-18	3,42,496	Nil	Nil2018-19	9,20,258	Nil	Nil2019-20 (as on 01.06.2019)	8,72,651	Nil	NilDepending on requirement in specific areas and for modernization of the storage facilities, the Government implements schemes for construction of godowns and silos for storage of Central Pool Stocks in the country. The Central Sector Scheme (erstwhile Plan Scheme) is implemented in the North Eastern States along with a few other States. Funds are released to FCI and also directly to the State Governments for construction of godowns. The State/UT-wise details of funds allocated and released to FCI and State Governments for construction of godowns under Central Sector Scheme (erstwhile Plan) Scheme during the last 5 years and current year up to 31.05.2019 is at Annexure-I.Additionally, under the Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) Scheme, which was formulated in 2008, storage capacity is created by private parties, Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and State Government Agencies for guaranteed hiring by Food Corporation of India (FCI). Under this scheme, no funds are allocated by Government for construction of godowns and full investment is done by the private parties/CWC/State Agencies. Further, in addition to conventional godowns, Government of India has also approved an action plan for construction of steel silos in the country for a capacity of 100 LMT in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode for modernizing storage infrastructure and improving shelf life of stored foodgrains. The construction is done in PPP mode and in case of construction of silos in Viability Gap Funding (VGF), grant is sought by the private parties in tender. The State/UT-wise details of grant approved by Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India during the last 5 years and current year up to 31.05.2019 for construction of silos under VGF model is at Annexure-II.****ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (f) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.1668 DUE FOR ANSWERED ON 02.07.2019 IN THE LOK SABHA.Year wise and head wise funds allocated under Central Sector (erstwhile Plan) Scheme “Storage & Godowns” and actual fund released.(in Rs.
