ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION (SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) to (c) Education is in the concurrent list of the Constitution and majority of the schools are under the domain of respective State and UT Governments. For this matter, the appropriate authority is the State Government. The aggrieved parties in the matter of Hijab ban approached the Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka, which, vide it’s order dated 10.02.2022 restrained all the students regardless of their religion or faith from wearing saffron shawls (Bhagwa), scarfs, hijab, religious flags or the like within the classroom, until further orders. The State Govt. implemented the said order.Further, a full Bench of the Karnataka High Court in their order dated 15.03.2022 inter-alia observed “It is also true that our Constitution protects the rights of school children too against unreasonable regulations. However, the prescription of dress code for the students that too within the four walls of the class room as distinguished from rest of the school premises does not offend constitutionally protected category of rights, when they are ‘religion-neutral’ and ‘universally applicable’ to all the students.” The Hon’ble High Court   further observed “In view of the above, we are of the considered opinion that the prescription of school uniform is only a reasonable restriction constitutionally permissible which the students cannot object to”.  Further, the matter is still sub-judice before the Hon’ble Supreme court of India. ******
