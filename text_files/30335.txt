The “Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch The Rain” (JSA:CTR) campaign was launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister on 22 March 2021, the World Water Day, with the theme – “Catch The Rain, Where it falls, When it falls”. JSA:CTR has been taken up in all districts (rural as well as urban areas) of the country during the pre-monsoon and monsoon period in the country i.e. from 22nd March 2021 to 30thNovember 2021.JSA:CTR has been implemented with five focused interventions- (1) intensive rainwater harvesting and water conservation which include making of roof-top Rain Water Harvesting Structures (RWHS) on buildings and water harvesting pits in compounds; maintenance of existing RWHS & creation of new check dams/ponds; renovation of traditional WHS; removal of encroachments of tanks/lakes and in their catchment channels; de-silting of tanks,  reuse and recharge of borewells; watershed development; rejuvenation of small rivers and rivulets; revival of wetlands and protection of flood-banks etc; (2) enumerating, geo-tagging & making inventory of all water bodies; preparation of scientific plans for water conservation based on it (3) Setting up of Jal Shakti Kendras in all districts (4) intensive afforestation and (5) awareness generation.
