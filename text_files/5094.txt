                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE OF MINISTRY OF FINANCE (a) & (b):  As informed by Central Bank of India (CBI) the sanctioned strength, officers in place & net shortage for Scale I/II/III officers in Central Bank of India for the year 2019-20 is as under:	Scale I	Scale II	Scale IIISanctioned Strength	1725	1684	1132Vacancies filled through Promotional Process	774	510	377Net Shortage	951	1174	755 	The promotional process for the year 2019-20 and the posting of officers in various Scales in the Branches / Offices in Regions is in progress. (c) & (d):    The Department of Financial Services (DFS), inter-alia, deals with issues relating to Banking, Insurance, Pension Reforms which are very technical in nature and therefore often require expertise and experience from the practitioners in the banking system.  Considering this, the services of staff including female staff of various Public Sector Banks are utilized, as and when required. The Department is also implementing a large number of important schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY), Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY), Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), Atal Pension Yojana (APY), Stand Up India etc. The Department is also coordinating MSME Support and Outreach campaign. Considering the fact that all these schemes require continuous and close coordination with banks/financial institutions, therefore the services of some officials from Banks are utilized from time to time to resolve technical matters.  Their assignment in DFS is, therefore, non-permanent in nature.  Currently, three officers of CBI are working in DFS.*****
