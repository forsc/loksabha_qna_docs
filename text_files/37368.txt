ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a)	:   Import of pharmaceutical products during the last three years is as follows: Years	Values in USD Million2018-19	63592019-20	64602020-21	6975               Source: DGCI&SCountry-wise details of import of pharmaceutical products is given at Annexure -I.(b):  India imports bulk drugs and drug intermediates from China in the form of raw materials as  well as finished products for both domestic consumption and exports. (c ) & (d):  In order to make the country Atmanirbhar in pharmaceuticals, the Department of Pharmaceuticals has launched the following four schemes for promoting domestic manufacturing of Pharmaceutical drugs including bulk drugs by attracting large investments in the sector to ensure their sustainable domestic supply and thereby reduce India’s import dependence on other countries: (I)   Under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for promotion of domestic manufacturing of critical Key Starting Materials (KSMs)/ Drug Intermediates (DIs) and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) in India, financial incentive is given for manufacturing of 41 KSMs/ DIs and APIs. The total financial outlay of the scheme is Rs. 6,940 crore and the tenure of the scheme is from FY 2020-2021 to 2029-30.(II)     The Scheme for Promotion of Bulk Drug Parks provides for grant-in-aid to 3 Bulk Drug Parks for creation of Common Infrastructure Facilities (CIF) with a maximum limit of Rs.1000 crore per park or 70% of the project cost of CIF, whichever is less. In case of North Eastern States and Hilly States (Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir and Union Territory of Ladakh), financial assistance is 90% of the project cost. The total financial outlay of the Scheme is Rs. 3000 crore and the tenure of the Scheme is from FY 2020-21 to 2024-25. (III)     The objective of the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Pharmaceuticals is to enhance India’s manufacturing capabilities by increasing investment and production in the sector and contribute to product diversification to high value goods in the pharmaceutical sector, and also to create global champions out of India who have the potential to grow in size and scale using cutting edge technology and thereby penetrate the global value chains. The total financial outlay of the scheme is Rs. 15,000 crore and the tenure of the scheme is from FY 2020-2021 to 2028-29. (IV)    The objective of Strengthening of Pharmaceutical Industry (SPI) Scheme is to strengthen the existing infrastructure facilities in order to make India a global leader in the Pharma sector. The scheme consists of three components/sub-schemes, of which one of the components is "Assistance to Pharmaceutical Industry for Common Facilities (APICF)" the objective of which is to strengthen the existing pharmaceutical clusters’ capacity for their sustained growth by creating tangible assets as “Common Facilities”. The illustrative list of eligible activities under this sub-scheme in order of priority are R&D Labs, Testing Laboratories for Pharma Products, Effluent Treatment Plants, Logistic Centres and Training Centres. The total financial outlay of the Scheme is Rs.500 Crore and the tenure of the Scheme is from FY 2021-22 to FY 2025-26.******Annexure-IStatement referred to in reply of part (a) of Lok Sabha Unstarred question no. 4561 for answer on 30th March 2022.The import of pharmaceutical products in terms of value from top 25 countries during 2018-19 to 2020-21(Values in USD Million)S.No.	Country	2018-19	2019-20	2020-211	China P Rp	2630.6	2562.8	2903.42	U S A	630.0	631.1	564.43	Belgium	308.2	358.2	380.44	Switzerland	349.6	354.5	394.05	Germany	335.0	319.1	275.66	U K	119.0	126.0	120.67	Singapore	211.7	210.2	191.68	Spain	84.2	97.6	118.99	Netherland	168.6	172.0	173.410	Italy	204.4	220.6	186.911	France	202.5	205.1	231.112	Denmark	108.0	129.4	131.913	Korea Rp	97.0	99.4	339.014	Japan	92.3	112.6	94.315	Indonesia	100.8	127.9	89.216	Russia	3.7	6.4	6.717	Austria	36.0	53.8	66.518	Hong Kong	89.0	61.5	77.419	Brazil	67.7	87.9	91.820	Ireland	57.2	60.9	56.221	Taiwan	39.7	42.2	46.722	Slovenia	28.2	41.1	60.623	Sweden	14.1	22.6	19.024	Malaysia	31.8	33.5	29.925	Vietnam Soc Rep	18.2	22.5	34.5Source: DGCI&S * Provisional*******
