                                                        MINISTER OF CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS, HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE(DR. MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a):   Sir, Government of India introduced Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) Policy for decontrolled P&K fertilizers w.e.f. 1st April,2010. The subsidy on P&K fertilizers is announced by the Government on annual/ bi-annual basis before the beginning of each financial year/ cropping season. Under NBS scheme, subsidy is announced for each nutrient i.e. Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potash (K) and Sulphur (S) on per kg. basis which is converted into subsidy per MT depending upon the nutrient content in each grade of these fertilizers. In order to overcome the deficiency of secondary and micronutrients in soil and to encourage their application along with primary nutrients, provision of additional subsidy on secondary and micro-nutrients has been made.Presently, the NBS is applicable on 25 Grades of P&K fertilizers including, Di- Ammonium Phosphate (DAP), Mono Ammonium Phosphate (MAP), Muriate of Potash (MOP), Triple Super Phosphate (TSP), Single Super Phosphate (SSP), Ammonium Sulphate produced by FACT and GSFC, Potash Derived from Molasses and other 18 grades of NPKS Complex fertilizers.The imports of these P&K fertilizers are under Open General License except imports of Ammonium Sulphate and SSP. All P&K fertilizers are decontrolled, the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) is fixed by Companies as per market dynamics at reasonable level. Government of India completes the process of examination of reasonableness of MRP and the profits earned above 12% treated as unreasonable and such unreasonable profit is recovered from the companies. The reasonableness of MRP of P&K fertilizers are determined on the basis of Audited Cost data collected from Companies. The main objectives of NBS Scheme are as under:i.	To promote balanced use of fertilizers.ii.	To reduce subsidy burden on the Government. iii.	To improve availability of fertilizers to farmers.iv.	To encourage competition among fertilizer companies(b):	The details of state-wise assistance provided under the NBS during the current financial year are at Annexure-1.(c):   The requirement of major fertilizers, namely Urea, DAP, MOP and complex fertilizer, is assessed before each cropping season (viz. Rabi and Kharif) to ensure adequate availability of fertilizers to farmers. This assessment is made through “Zonal Conferences for Agricultural Inputs” organized by Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare(DA&FW), Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare with participation from the representatives of the Department of Fertilizers, Directorate of Agriculture of the State Governments, ICAR, the Fertilizer Association of India. At these conferences, the State Governments/UTs present their projected requirements for major Fertilizers. After detailed discussions and taking into account cropping pattern, cropped area, irrigated/unirrigated area, requirement of nutrients in soil as per soil health status & crop wise recommended dose of fertilizers, consumption pattern etc. the state-wise assessment of requirement of major fertilizers is finalized by DA&FW.(d):	The details on quantity of Fertilizers made available to all the states/UTs (including Rajasthan) during last two years i.e. 2019-20 and 2020-21 are at Annexure ‘2’ and Annexure ‘3’ respectively.(e):    Under NBS,20% of the decontrolled fertilizers produced/imported in India in the movement control under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955(ECA). Government of India regulates regulate the movement of these fertilizers to bridge the supplies in underserved areas. Currently, there is no other proposal or policy is under consideration regarding supply of Fertilizers.(f):   The quantity of DAP supplied to Ajmer district of Rajasthan during 2019-20 and 2020-21 was 0.14 Lakh MT and 0.12 Lakh MT respectively.  However, the subsidy specific to a district is not available.********-3-Annexure-1State Wise DBT Expenditure for Financial Year  : 2021-22     	 	 ( Figures in Rs. Crores)S.No	State	NPKS(Ind.)
