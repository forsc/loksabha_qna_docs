ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS,  HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) to (c)	Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has been monitoring the performance of Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) against the benchmarks for various Quality of Service parameters laid down by TRAI by way of Quality of Service regulations issued from time to time, through Quarterly Performance Monitoring Reports (PMRs). The performance is assessed for a License Service Area (LSA) as a whole.  Hence, no separate information for districts is available in TRAI.As per PMR for the quarter ending December 2019 for Cellular Mobile Telephone Services, all TSPs are largely complying with benchmarks for all the network related parameters in Madhya Pradesh Service area. Therefore, the services in the Madhya Pradesh service area is not poor due to insufficient number of mobile towers.  Further, as per data collected from Department of Telecommunications (DoT) field units as on 31.12.2019, 19 villages out of 1264 inhabited villages in Guna district, 40 villages out of 1305 inhabited villages in Shivpuri district and 15 villages out of 818 inhabited villages in Ashok Nagar district in Madhya Pradesh are not covered by mobile services. Mobile coverage in the uncovered villages in the country is being provided by the Government and TSPs in a phased manner. As on 05.03.2020, number of mobile towers in Guna, Shivpuri & Ashok Nagar districts in Madhya Pradesh are 612, 724 & 376 respectively and number of Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) for these districts are 1943, 2244 & 1089 respectively. Further, new Mobile Towers/ BTSs are installed by TSPs on continuous basis to improve coverage and/or capacity of their networks based on their techno-commercial requirements.Moreover, Aspirational District Scheme for provisioning of 4G based mobile services in 502 uncovered villages in Aspirational Districts of four states Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh & Rajasthan which include 205 uncovered villages of Madhya Pradesh State has been approved. Guna is one of such Aspirational Districts in the State of Madhya Pradesh. The Government has also taken several policy initiatives to facilitate infrastructure growth in the country which include permitting trading/sharing/ liberalisation of spectrum, permitting passive & active infrastructure sharing, notification of Right of Way Rules 2016, making available government land/buildings for installations of towers etc.**********
