                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI A. NARAYANASWAMY)(a) to (c):  Under the Centrally Sponsored  Pre and Post Matric Scholarship Schemes run by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, the State Governments/UT Administrations are the implementing agencies. The scheme guidelines mandate availability of   Grievance Redressal Mechanism for handling issues in a prompt manner in order to assist and help the target group. This Department does not maintain details of Grievance redressal mechanisms available in the States. At the Central level also, a grievance redressal mechanism for all schemes is already in place in Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) available to the citizens  to file their grievances to the public authorities on any subject related to service delivery. It is a single portal connected to all the Ministries/ Departments of Government of India and States.*****
