ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a)&(b): Modernisation of police forces is a continuous and ongoing process. ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects as per Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. However, to supplement the efforts of the States for equipping and modernizing their police forces, the scheme of Modernisation of  Police  Forces  (MPF)  is under implementation since 1969-70. Since 2017 the  scheme  has  been  revised  as  ‘Assistance  to States for Modernisation--2--L.S.US.Q.NO. 2346 FOR 09.03.2021 of   Police’.  Under   this  scheme,  the  States  have  been  provided  central assistance for acquisition of advanced weaponry such as INSAS Rifles & AK series rifles; all types of intelligence equipment including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs),  Night Vision Devices (NVDs), CCTV Surveillance system & body worn camera systems; modern communication equipment and state-of-the-art equipment for  security / training / forensics / cybercrime / traffic policing. Further, ‘construction’ and ‘purchase of operational vehicles’ is permitted in the insurgency affected north-eastern States and Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected districts. (c):  No data is maintained centrally for “IPS officers punished for excesses while discharging their duty”. However ten IPS officers have been punished for misconduct during the last 2 years, i.e., during 2019-20 and 2020-21. (d):It is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments/UT Administrations to ensure efficient functioning of their Police forces. The Centre also issues advisories to the States to bring in the requisite Police reforms to meet the expectations of the people. Further, there are seven directions of the Supreme Court of India pronounced in Prakash Singh case in  2006  pertaining  to police reforms. These directions included a minimum--3--L.S.US.Q.NO. 2346 FOR 09.03.2021 tenure of at least two years of the Director General of Police irrespective of his date of superannuation, minimum tenure of two years to the police officers on operational duties and setting up of a Police Establishment Boards at the State level for inter alia deciding all transfers, postings, promotions and other service related matters of officers of and below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police. These directions are to be implemented by respective State Governments.*****
