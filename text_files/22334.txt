ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)  (a):     As reported by Ministry of Labour & Employment, the number of accidents occurred in coal mines in the country is higher than the number of accidents occurred in non-coal mines during the last three years. (b):     The details of the number of deaths and injuries caused due to accidents in coal mines / State/ UT wise in the last three years are given at Annexure-I. The comparison of accidents in coal mines and non coal mines are not identical. The main reasons for high number of accidents in coal mines in comparison to non-coal mines are as given below:1.	Underground coal mining is more hazardous and geo-mining conditions in the underground mine is totally different in comparison to non-coal mines and also to opencast mining. Non-coal mines are mostly opencast.2.	Volume of production of coal and removal of Over Burden is much more and deployment of machinery in underground coal mines are also more in comparison to non-coal mines.  3.	Risk/Hazard of exposure of employees is more in coal underground mines as compared to non-coal mines.(c)    Steps taken to ensure safety with latest technology to avoid such accidents in coal mines are as follows: 1.	Preparation and implementation of risk assessment based Safety Management Plans (SMPs).2.	Preparation and implementation of Principal Hazards Management Plans (PHMPs) along with Trigger Action Response Plan (TARP).3.	Formulation and compliance of Site-specific Risk Assessment based Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).4.	Conducting safety audit of mines.5.	Online Centralized Safety Monitoring System has been developed for monitoring different safety parameters. (d):  Details of the compensation paid to the dependents of the deceased mine employees who died in any mine accident arising out of and in course of employment as per Employee Compensation Act-1923 (Principal Act) in the last five years and current year, State-wise in CIL and SCCL are given Annexure II.Apart from above compensation being paid in CIL, as per provision of the ECA-1923 (Principal Act), an additional amount of Rs 5,00,000 is also being paid to the next of kin of fatally injured employee (for contractual employees from 21.12.2016 onward). The same amount has been enhanced to Rs 15,00,000 with effect from 14.11.2019. (e): Yes. Sir.(f): Eco-friendly surface miners are used in large opencast mines for extraction of coal as blast free mining and avoidance of associated risks thereof.***
