The drop in the overall occupancy of all reserved trains including Shatabdi Express trains has been mainly due to the various restrictions & prevailing conditions during Covid-19 pandemic.  	The list of trains having low occupancy is voluminous as on Indian Railways, demand pattern of reserved accommodation in trains varies over lean and peak periods and also the impact of Covid-19 restrictions was not uniform. However, the list of trains having average occupancy less than thirty percent during 2020-21 is appended.(c) and (d) The drop observed is on account of Covid-19 pandemic during which people are mainly undertaking unavoidable/ important journeys.******
