                                                               THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                       (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a) to (d) Government of India launched the Smart Cities Mission (SCM) on 25 June 2015 for development of 100 cities as Smart Cities. The selection of 100 Smart Cities has been completed through 4 rounds of selection from January, 2016 to June, 2018. These cities have shown considerable progress in project execution since their selection. As on 9 July 2021, they have tendered out 6,017 projects worth Rs. 1,80,873 crore; out of which work orders have been issued in 5,375 projects worth Rs. 1,49,251 crore; out of these, 2,781 projects worth Rs. 48,150 crore have been completed. There has been more than 260% growth in projects tendered and more than 380% growth in projects grounded/completed in the last three years. Government of India has released Rs. 23,925.83 crore as the Central share to the States/Union Territories (UTs) out of which Rs. 20,410.14 crore (85%) has been utilized by the Smart Cities. The Smart Cities are expected to complete their projects within five years from their date of selection. Ministry regularly interacts with the States/UTs & Smart Cities through video conferences, review meetings, field visits, regional workshops etc. at various levels to assess the performance of the cities and to handhold them for improving the same. Besides, the guidance of domain experts participating in the regional workshops, cities also benefit from peer-to-peer learning during these interactions. At the State level, High Powered Steering Committee (HPSC) chaired by the Chief Secretary has been established. At the national level, the implementation of SCM is being monitored by an Apex Committee headed by Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). Besides, MoHUA nominee Directors on the Boards of SPVs monitor the progress in respective cities on a regular basis. The Geo-spatial Management Information System (GMIS) of the SCM collates project data in real-time thus enabling effective monitoring of project progress.The State/City-wise details of projects of Smart Cities, including in States of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana is given in Annexure-I.(e) & (f) The implementation of SCM at the city level is done by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) created for the purpose. These SPVs are registered under the Companies Act, 2013 and are jointly owned in 50:50 ratioby respective State Governments/UTs& Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).Smart City SPVs are responsible for appraisal, approval, implementation, management, monitoring and evaluation of projects which are part of their Smart City Plans and as such do not need to send any requests regarding projects to the Government. Hence, the question of pending requests do not arise. Even when correspondence regarding broader issues is received by the Government, they are attended to at the earliest.                                         *****
