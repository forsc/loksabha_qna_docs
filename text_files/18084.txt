ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a)	Number of complaints regarding Call Drops/ Improper Network Coverage reported through Centralised Public Grievance Redressal And Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) to Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for the last three years 2017, 2018, 2019 & current year (upto 15.09.2020) are 4534, 1678, 1162 and 162 respectively. State/UT-wise details in this regard are given at Annexure-I. Moreover, as reported and received by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), number of complaints regarding call drops during the last three years 2017, 2018, 2019 & current year (upto 31.08.2020) are 490, 1109, 490 and 390 respectively. Service Area wise details are given at Annexure-II.(b)	Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has been monitoring the performance of Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) against the benchmarks for various Quality of Service parameters laid down by TRAI by way of Quality of Service regulations issued from time to time, through Performance Monitoring Reports (PMRs). The performance is assessed quarterly for a License Service Area (LSA) as a whole.However, in the Quality of Service Regulations issued by TRAI, provisions have been made for imposition of financial disincentives for non-compliance with the benchmarks for various quality of service parameters including call drop.  TRAI has issued “The Standards for Quality of Service for Basic (Wireline) and Cellular Mobile Telephone Services (Fifth Amendment) Regulations, 2017” effective from 1st October 2017. These Regulations have prescribed two revised parameters for assessing call drop in mobile network, viz. Drop Call Rate (DCR) spatial distribution measure (benchmark = 2%) implies that at-least 90% of Cells in the network should perform better than specified 2% benchmark on at-least 90% of days. Similarly, another new parameter, DCR temporal distribution measure (benchmark = 3%) will give confidence that on at-least 90% of Days, network performed better than specified 3% benchmark for at-least 97% of the Cells.  With effect from 1st October 2017, TRAI has also introduced a revised graded Financial Disincentives (FD) structure in case of consecutive repeat violations for DCR parameters, based on the extent to which a TSP’s performance deviates from the specified DCR benchmark.
