ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) to (c): Education is in the concurrent list of the Constitution and majority of the schools are under the domain of the States/UTs. The recruitment, service conditions, training and deployment of teachers come under the purview of the respective State and Union Territory (UT) Government. Ministry of Education requests the States and UT Governments for training of teachers through Review meetings and advisories from time to time. Further, the Central Government through the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Samagra Shiksha, provides assistance to the States and UTs for training of in-service teachers as per the prescribed norms for various levels of schooling.As per National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, implementation of the Policy requires multiple initiatives and actions, which are to be taken up in a synchronized and systematic manner, by multiple bodies including Ministry of Education, CABE, State/UT Governments, education-related Ministries, State Departments of Education, Boards, NTA, the regulatory bodies of school and higher education, NCERT, SCERTs, schools and HEIs.Further, in pursuance of the goals and objectives of the NEP 2020 and to assist States, UTs and other organisations in this task, the Department of School Education & Literacy has developed an indicative and suggestive NEP Implementation Plan for School Education, ‘Students’ and ‘Teachers’ Holistic Advancement through Quality Education (SARTHAQ)’.In addition, National Initiative for School Heads and Teachers for Holistic Advancement - NISHTHA 3.0 has been launched to train the teachers from ECCE to grade V. It has 12 training modules including a module on Multilingual teaching in foundational years, which also covers usage of mother tongue / home language in teaching.(d): NISHTHA- an Integrated Teacher Training Programme was launched in face to face mode in 2019. However, due to COVID pandemic, the training was made completely online at DIKSHA platform in 2020-21 and 2021-22. The State-wise details of the budget allocated and utilised for Teachers Training under Samagra Shiksha during the last 3 years (2019-20, 2020- 21 and 2021-22) is attached as Annexure I.*****
