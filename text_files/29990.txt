It is a Law & Order problem which is a State subject, hence primarily; falls under the domain of the State/District administration to take necessary deterrent action to stop/curb illegal mining of coal. Surprise raids/checks/ inspection are conducted by security personnel as well as jointly with law and order authorities of the concerned State Government.(b):	First Information Reports (FIRs) are lodged whenever any incident of Illegal mining of coal comes to the notice of the coal companies.Number of FIRs lodged in cases of Illegal mining of coal during 2020-21, company-wise and State-wise is given below:                                                                                             (Provisional) Name of the Company 	State	FIR lodged (2020-21)ECL	WB	12 	Jharkhand	1 	Sub Total 	13BCCL	Jharkhand	0 	WB	0 	Sub Total	0CCL	Jharkhand	1NCL	MP	0 	UP	0 	Sub Total	0WCL	Maharashtra	0 	MP	0 	Sub Total	0SECL	MP	0 	Chattisgarh	0 	Sub Total	0MCL	Odisha	0NEC	Assam	3 Coal India Limited	17(c):	Theft/pilferage/illegal mining of coal are carried out stealthily and clandestinely.

This web-based application and mobile application was developed by Bhaskaracharya Institute of Space Application & Geo-informatics (BISAG), Gandhi Nagar, Gujarat, with inputs from CMPDI. CMSMS is a GIS based portal in which any citizen can report an incident of illegal coal mining through Khanan Prahari Mobile Application and the location of the incident is shown on the GIS map. The Nodal Officers of CIL/State Governments then verify the incident and take suitable action on such cases. The satellite data is also used for monitoring of mining operations done by leaseholders to verify if it is within the leasehold boundaries. The report of CMSMS is regularly sent to Ministry of Coal and CVOs of all the subsidiary companies of CIL and Nodal Officers of CIL. Also following steps are taken to check illegal mining of coal: •	Concrete walls have been erected on the mouth of the abandoned mines to prevent access and illegal activities in these areas.•	Surprise raids/ checks being conducted jointly by security personnel and law and order authorities of the concerned State Government.•	Dumping of the overburden is being done on the outcrop zones.•	Installation of check-posts at vulnerable points.•	Training of existing security/ CISF personnel, refresher training and basic training of new recruits in security discipline for strengthening the security setup.•	Maintaining close liaison with the State authorities.•	Committee/ task force has been constituted at different level (block level, sub-divisional level, district level, state level) in some subsidiaries of CIL to monitor different aspects of illegal mining.****
