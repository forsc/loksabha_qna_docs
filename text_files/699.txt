However, to prevent the starvation deaths in the country and to provide food security to the vulnerable population and to ensure that people living below poverty line get adequate food grains, the Government has been providing food grains at highly subsidized prices to the targeted population through the State Governments/UT Administrations under National Food Security Act, 2013 and Other Welfare Schemes (OWS) (Mid Day Meal Scheme, Wheat Based Nutrition Programme, Scheme for Adolescent Girls, Annapurna Scheme, Allocation of foodgrains under Welfare Institutions & Hostels Scheme). The main responsibility for implementation of the Act including distribution of foodgrain lies with the States/UTs. An annual allocation of over 610 LMT of foodgrain is made by Government of India under NFSA and OWS. ..............2/--2-Further Department has issued instructions to all States/UTs that no person/ household shall be deleted from the list of eligible beneficiaries/households and denied subsidized foodgrain under NFSA only on the ground of not possessing of Aadhar number. Instructions have also been issued for providing foodgrains even in the event of authentication failure through alternative mechanisms.To improve the health and nutritional status of vulnerable population of the country, Govt. of India has taken various other measures as well.
