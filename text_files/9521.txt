                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (e):  As informed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, the number of main workers  in the age group of 5-14 years,as per Census 2011, State-wise in the country  is 43.53 lakh.   State wise details of main workers in the age group of 5-14 years as per Census 2011 is Annexed.	For elimination of child labour, the Government of India stands committed to the elimination of child labour in the country. The Government has amended the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act, 1986 and enacted the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 which came into force with effect from 1.9.2016. The Amendment Act inter-alia provides for complete prohibition of work or employment of children below 14 years of age in any occupation and process and prohibition of adolescents in the age group of 14 to 18 years in hazardous occupations and processes. The Amendment Act also provides the stricter punishment for employers for violation of the Act and has made the offence as cognizable.	As per provisions contained in the Act, whoever employs any child or permits any child to work in contravention shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six month but which may extend to two years, or with fine which shall not be less than twenty thousand rupees but which may extend to fifty thousand rupees, or with both.	Also whoever employs any adolescent or permits any adolescent to work in contravention of the provisions shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months but which may extend to two years or with fine which shall not be less than twenty thousand rupees but which may extend to fifty thousand rupees, or with both. 		The Ministry of Labour and Employment is also implementing the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme since 1988 for rehabilitation of child labourers. Under the NCLP, the children in the age group of 9-14 years are rescued/ withdrawn from work and enrolled in the NCLP Special Training Centres, where they are provided with bridge education, vocational training, mid-day meal, stipend, health care, etc. before being mainstreamed into formal education system.  The children in the age group of 5-8 years are directly linked to the formal education system through a close coordination with the SarvaShikshaAbhiyan. To ensure the effective enforcement of the provisions of the Child Labour Act and smooth implementation of NCLP Scheme, a dedicated online portal named PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) has been developed in order to make the NCLP successful through better monitoring and implementation ensuring the timely disposal of work with transparency.  As per Section 2 (14) (ii) of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act), a child  who is found working in contravention of labour laws for the time being in force or is found begging, or living on the street is included as a “child in need of care and protection”, among others. Section 79 of the JJ Act provides,whoever ostensibly engages a child and keeps him in bondage for the purpose of employment or withholds his earnings or uses such earning for his own purposes shall be punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years and shall also be liable to fine of one lakh rupees. The primary responsibility of execution of the Act lies with the States/UTs. The Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing a centrally sponsored Child Protection Services (CPS) Scheme (erstwhile Integrated Child Protection Scheme) for supporting the children in difficult circumstances.The primary responsibility of implementation of the scheme lies with the State Governments/UT Administrations. The scheme inter-alia provides for setting up of Child Care Institutions (CCIs) by the States/UTs either by themselves or in association with voluntary organisations. The scheme, also provides for non-institutional care wherein support is extended for adoption, foster care and sponsorship. The scheme supports 24x7 outreach helpline service for children in distress. This service is available through a dedicated toll free number, 1098 which can be accessed by children in crisis or by adults on their behalf from any place in the geographical location of India. *** AnnexureState wise details of main workers in the age group of 5-14 years as per Census 2011.S.
