ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI RAM VILAS PASWAN)(a) to (f) :  	 A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. *****STATEMENT REFERRED IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (f) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.*22 FOR 19.11.2019 REGARDING ONION PRICES.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------a)	Onion is a seasonal crop with harvesting period of Rabi (March to June), Kharif (October to December) and late Kharif (January to March). In the intervening period (July to October), the market is fed by stored Rabi onions. During 2019-20, there was a 3-4 weeks delay in sowing as well as decline in sown area of the Kharif onion because of late arrival of monsoon. Further, untimely prolonged rains in the major growing States of Karnataka, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh during the harvesting period, i.e., September/October, caused damage to the standing crops in these regions. All this adversely impacted production and quality of the Kharif crop. The rains during September/October also affected transportation of the crop from these regions to consuming areas. This led to limited availability of Kharif onion in the market and has put pressure on its prices. Details of price increase is at Annexure.b)	The details of production and annual demand of onion for last 7 years are as below (quantities in lakh MT): Year	Production	Annual Demand2012-13	168.13	182.522013-14	194.02	185.032014-15	189.27	184.882015-16	203.33	190.022016-17	217.18	207.702017-18	232.62	205.312018-19	234.85	Not AvailableSource: Horticulture Statistics At A Glance 2018, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare	During the current year, the production of Kharif and late Kharif is estimated to be 52.06 LMT which is about 26% lower than previous year’s production of Kharif and late Kharif production of 69.91 LMT.c)	During the current year, total buffer stock of 57,372.90 MT onion was created under Price Stabilization Fund (PSF). Of this, procurement of 48,183.54 MT and 9,189.36 MT was from Maharashtra and Gujarat, respectively. From this buffer, 26,735 MT was distributed to various States Governments, other agencies and also sold in various mandis through open auction. The remaining stock is accounted by disposal of 11,408 MT of low quality onion in the local market and losses due to prolonged storage, driage, spoilage, etc., due to limited shelf-life.d)	Yes, Sir. During April to September, 2019, the Government had requested all States/UTs to indicate their demand for onion from the aforesaid buffer stock under PSF at several forums/levels. Further, in November 2019, Government decided to procure/import onions. States/UTs were again requested to indicate their demand from these procured/imported stock.e)	Government, on 29.09.2019, imposed stock limits on traders across the country – 100 quintals on retail traders and 500 quintals on wholesale traders under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Further, Government of India has urged State Governments to hold regular meetings with the traders of Onions at State and District level to prevent hoarding, speculative trading and profiteering, unfair and illegal trade practices like cartelling, etc.f)	Government has on 09.11.2019, directed MMTC to import up to 1 Lakh MT of onion from surplus countries. For wider participation, the Indian embassies in the major exporting countries of Iran, Afghanistan, Egypt have been requested to facilitate such imports. Also, Government has directed NAFED to procure surplus onion from Rajasthan, Maharashtra for distribution in deficit States. Other corrective steps taken by the Government are as follow:•	Onions were supplied to State Governments of Haryana, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh at no-profit no-loss basis to improve prices and availability situation. •	Since July 2019, onions were supplied from the buffer stock for direct retailing in Delhi-NCR through Mother Dairy, NCCF, NAFED and Govt. of NCT of Delhi at regulated retail rates to ensure availability of onions at reasonable prices. Freshly procured onion from Alwar area is already being supplied to Govt. of NCT of Delhi.•	The benefit on export of onions under Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) was withdrawn through notification dated 11.06.2019. Minimum Export Price (MEP) of $850/MT was imposed on 13.09.2019.•	Since 29.09.2019, export of onions is banned. Stock limits have also been imposed across the country.***** ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.*22 FOR 19.11.2019 REGARDING ONION PRICES.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Retail Price of Onions (?/kg.)Centres	Price As On	1 Month ago	3 Months ago	6 Months ago	1 Year ago	% Variation Over	15.11.19	15.10.19	14.08.19	15.05.18	15.11.18	1 Month	3 Months	6 Months	1 YearDELHI	65	55	28	21	31	18.18	132.14	209.52	109.68MUMBAI	70	54	25	17	33	29.63	180.00	311.76	112.12KOLKATA	70	50	28	20	30	40.00	150.00	250.00	133.33CHENNAI	43	37	22	16	20	16.22	95.45	168.75	115.00All INDIA	60.38	47.03	23.28	17.03	22.84	28.39	159.36	254.55	164.36*****
