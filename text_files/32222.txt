                                                        (a)	There are currently 1,41,473 establishments / companies registered on the apprenticeship portal (www.apprenticeshipindia.gov.in), out of which only 25,832are currently engaging apprentices. (b)		In order to create awareness about apprenticeship activities, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) and its attached offices organizes Information, Education and Communication activities such as Seminars, Pakhwara, Workshops and Outreach activities on regular basis.MSDE launched Apprenticeship Pakhwara which was celebrated from 30th September 2019 to 16th October 2019 with an aim to bring all the stakeholders together in the initiative of making apprenticeship aspirational. A State’s Skill Ministers conclave was organized by MSDE on 30th September, 2019 as a part of Apprenticeship Pakhwara. An industry interaction and closing ceremony of Apprenticeship Pakhwara was held on 16th October, 2019. Apprenticeship Mela was organized on 04.10.2021 across all the States and Union Territories resulting in enrolment of around 50,000 candidates on a single day. Around 5000 establishments also participated in this Mela giving them opportunity to directly interact with the potential apprentices.Further, ministry organizes follow up meetings and regular interaction with all the key stakeholders namely State Skill Development Missions (SSDMs), Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs), Regional Directorate of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (RDSDEs) and industry associations.

(e) 		The reforms undertaken by the government have now started reaping results. However, COVID-19 has also hampered the growth of apprenticeship.
