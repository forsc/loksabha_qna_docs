ANSWER




MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a & b): 	Government had undertaken a study “Farmers Suicide in India: Causes and Policy Prescription” as an all India coordinated study in the work plan 2016-17 through the Institute of Social and Economic Change (ISEC), Bengaluru. The study covered 13 states of the country which included Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. 	The study concluded that frequent crop failure due to vagaries of monsoon, absence of assured water resources and attack of pest and diseases are the most important causes of farmers’ distress. The study had made, inter-alia, following suggestions to address the above problems:i)	Bringing individual farmers under the ambit of crop insurance;ii)	Judicious use of available water is required;iii)	Government intervention through MSP covering cost of production plus reasonable profit margin;iv)	Risk hedging through crop and enterprise diversification should be encouraged to reduce farmers’ distress aiming at sustainable income; andv)	Regulate informal credit market.(c): 	The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs compiles and disseminates information on suicides in its publication titled ‘Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India’ (ADSI). NCRB has published reports upto 2020 which are available on its website. The State-wise details of suicide committed by farmers, as per NCRB Report for the last five years, are at Annexure.(d):	The corrective steps taken by the Government on the suggestions given in the above said study are as under:i)	With a view to provide better insurance coverage to crops for risk mitigation, Government has introduced flagship yield based Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) alongwith weather index based Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS) from Kharif 2016.ii)	Ministry of Jal Shakti has been organising competitions on various aspects of water including water conservation, sustainable development of water resources and for water use efficiency for the purpose of bringing awareness about significance of water in the people of the country.iii)	The Union Budget for 2018-19 had announced the pre-determined principle to keep MSP at levels of one and half times of the cost of production. Accordingly, Government has increased the MSPs for all mandated Kharif, Rabi and other commercial crops with a return of at least 50 per cent over all India weighted average cost of production from the agricultural year 2018-19. In line with the same principle, Government has announced the increase in MSP for all mandated Kharif crops of the year 2021-22 on 9th June, 2021 and for all mandated Rabi crops of the year 2021-22 on 8th September, 2021.iv)	PMFBY scheme aims at supporting the sustainable production in agriculture sector by way of providing financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of unforeseen natural calamities, adverse weather incidence and to help in stabilize the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming.   Comprehensive risk insurance to farmers is provided against non-preventable natural calamities such as drought, dry-spells, flood, hailstorm, inundation etc. under the scheme for entire crop cycle including pre-sowing to post-harvest losses.      The scheme is being implemented on actuarial/bidded premium rate basis.  However, farmers have to pay a minimum uniform fixed premium rate at maximum 2% for Kharif, 1.5% for Rabi food and oilseed crops and 5% for annual commercial/horticultural crops, with balance of actuarial/bidded premium being shared by the Central and State Government on 50:50 basis except in North Eastern States, where it is 90:10 with effect from Kharif 2020 season.     The scheme is voluntary for the States since inception and for all farmers w.e.f. Kharif 2020.       Since inception of the scheme in 2016-17 till 2020-21, against premium of Rs. 21,531 crore paid by farmers, claims of Rs. 1,04,196  crore have been paid to 901 lakh farmer applications.v)	The Government has extended the facility of Kisan Credit Card (KCC) to the farmers practicing animal husbandry and fisheries related activities. All processing fee, inspection, leger folio charges and all other services charges have been waived off for fresh renewal of KCC. Collateral fee loan limit for short term agri-credit has been raised from Rs. 1.00 lakh to Rs. 1.60 lakh. KCC will be issued within 14 days from the receipt of completed application.
