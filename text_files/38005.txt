Workers can easily get themselves registered on the portal through following three modes:-(i) Self registration (ii) Through Common Service Centres (CSCs) (iii)  Through e-State Seva Kendras. To increase the number of registrations, the matter is taken up with all the States/UTs from time to time. The registration facility is available over 4 lakh CSC centres across the country. State Seva Kendras have also been on boarded. Further, CSC organises awareness camps (including night camps) at various places for mobilisation of workers. eSHRAM portal has also been on boarded on UMANG App for easy registration through mobile.Contd..2/-:: 2 ::The Budgetary allocation for the development of the portal and registration was initiated in the year 2019-20. Budgetary allocation of Rs. 1 crore and Rs. 50 crore was made for the financial year 2019-20 and 2020-21 respectively. Out of which, Rs. 45.49 crore has been released/utilized during 2020-21.

A number of protective provisions have been incorporated in the labour laws for equal opportunity and congenial work environment for women workers. These include enhancement in paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks, provision for mandatory creche facility in the establishments having 50 or more employees, permitting women workers in the night shifts with adequate safety measures, etc.Government has taken a decision to allow the employment of women in the aboveground mines including opencast workings between 7 pm and 6 am and in below ground working between 6 am and 7 pm in technical, supervisory and managerial work where continuous presence may not be required.The Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 now subsumed in the Code on Wages, 2019 which provides that there shall be no discrimination in an establishment or any unit thereof among employees on the ground of gender in matters relating to wages by the same employer, in respect of the same work or work of similar nature done by any employee. Further, no employer shall make any discrimination on the ground of gender while recruiting any employee for the same work or work of similar nature in the conditions of employment, except where the employment of women in such work is prohibited or restricted by or under any law for the time being in force.Further, in order to enhance the employability of female workers, the Government is providing training to them through a network of Women Industrial Training institutes, National Vocational Training Institutes and Regional Vocational Training Institutes.As on 30.03.2022, more than 27 crore unorganised workers have been registered on eSHRAM portal.
