ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d) Inland waterways are declared as ‘National Waterways’ (NW) under the National Waterways Act, 2016.  Seven National Waterways viz. NW-1 (river Ganga), NW-8 (river Punpun), NW-37 (river Gandak), NW-40 (river Ghagra), NW-54 (river Karamnasa), NW-58 (river Kosi) and NW-94 (river Sone) flow through Bihar.  	To augment the shipping and navigation capacity of NW-1, the Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) is being implemented by IWAI on the Haldia-Varanasi stretch of Ganga. 12 districts in Bihar namely Buxur, Bhojpur, Saran, Patna, Vaishali, Samastipur, Lakhisarai, Munger, Begusarai, Hagaria, Katihar and Bhagalpur are likely to be benefitted by the JMVP.  Under JMVP, projects worth Rs.1800 crore (approx.) have commenced on ground in a time period of three years after statutory clearances.  The project is progressing in a time bound manner with scheduled completion in March, 2023. Under JMVP, an inter-modal terminal is proposed at Kalughat on NW-1 in Saran district of Bihar for which pre-investment activity i.e. land acquisition has been initiated. 	On NW-37, NW-40 and NW-58, development activities for shipping and navigation were initiated by IWAI and further activities are to be synchronized with cargo demand.   NW-54, NW-81 and NW-94 have not been found feasible for development by the IWAI.                                             ******
