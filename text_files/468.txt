                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		 	  (SHRI NARENDRA  SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (f):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (f) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 57 DUE FOR REPLY ON 25TH JUNE, 2019.(a):	State-wise details of farmer applicants enrolled during 2018-19 under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima yojana (PMFBY) are given in Annexure.(b):	With a view to provide financial support to farmers and to make them eligible for next crop at the time of crop loss due to natural calamities, pests & diseases,  the scheme is made compulsory for the loanee farmers growing notified crops in notified areas and the scheme is voluntary for non-loanee farmers.  However, requests/representations have been received from various quarters including farmer organizations, States etc. to make the scheme voluntary/optional for all farmers.  The revisions/improvements in the crop insurance schemes is a continuous process and decisions on suggestions/representations are taken from time to time after consultation with various stakeholders.(c):	Government has taken several initiatives including active involvement of all stakeholders especially States and implementing insurance companies for conduct of publicity campaign/awareness programmes including organization of camps in the rural areas to build farmer awareness about crop insurance schemes.    Insurance companies have been asked to utilize 0.5% of gross premium collected by them for publicity and awareness generation.  Other activities for awareness generation involve the publicity of features and benefits of the scheme through advertisements in leading National/local News Papers, telecast through audio-visual media, distribution of pamphlets in local languages, participation in agriculture fairs / mela / goshti, dissemination of SMS through Kisan Portal/national crop insurance portal and conduct of workshops/ trainings  State officials, financial institutions and farmers. For non-loanee farmers since crop insurance is optional, the Common Service Centres (CSCs)  and  online enrolment have been activated  to provide Contd…2/¬-2-the services besides traditional modes like banks and insurance intermediaries.   Due to the efforts made by the Government coverage of non-loanee, for whom the coverage is voluntary,  has increased from 5% under erstwhile schemes to 34%, which shows the acceptability of the scheme on voluntary basis.Though the coverage during 2nd year of implementation of PMFBY was decreased due to announcement of loan waiver schemes by some State and making Aadhaar compulsory for deduplication of coverage, but due to aforesaid efforts made by the Government coverage has increased during 2018-19.   (d):	 No, Sir.  In this regard, it is also informed that the difference between premium collected and claims paid is not the margin for the companies.  The cost of reinsurance and administrative cost of gross premium also has to be borne by the Insurance Companies.(e):     	No Sir. Selection of insurance company is made by the concerned State Government through competitive bidding process and the company quoting the lowest premium rate (L-1) is selected for implementation of the scheme.  Various checks and balances for major stakeholders including insurance companies have been provided in the operational   guidelines of    the scheme,    so that    no one can take undue advantage of the scheme.  These checks and balances have further been strengthened by imposing penalty provisions on insurance companies for delay/non-settlement of claims.  Provisions for performance evaluation of insurance companies with various punitive actions including de-empanelment  of insurance companies has also been envisaged in revised Operational Guidelines implemented w.e.f. Rabi 2018-19 season.(f):	Question does not arise.
