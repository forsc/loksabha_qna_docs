  MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a) & (b): The Union Government introduced a rehabilitation package to provide relief to victims of 1984 Anti-Sikh Riots. The scheme contained ex-gratia payment of Rs. 3.5 lakh for each death case and Rs. 1.25 lakh in case of injuries. The scheme also contained a provision for State Governments to grant pension to widows and old aged parents of death victims at the uniform rate of Rs. 2500/- per month, for whole life. The expenditure on payment of pension was to be borne by the State Government.                                                                                                                                  In 2014, the Government of India introduced a scheme for grant of enhanced relief of Rs. 5 lakh per deceased person, who died during 1984 Anti-Sikh Riots.

(c) & (d): For payment of enhanced ex-gratia amount, the States/UTs would disburse the money from their own funds and Ministry of Home Affairs would reimburse the amount to the concerned State/UT Government on receipt of utilization certificate.
