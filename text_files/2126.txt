ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a) to (d)  Project Monitoring - Invest India Cell (PMIC) is an institutional mechanism for resolving a variety of issues with a view to fast tracking the approvals for setting up and expeditious commissioning of large public, private and public-private partnership (PPP) projects. It was set up initially in Cabinet Secretariat in June, 2013. At present PMIC is functioning under the administrative control of Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT). Any investor having issues delaying or likely to delay the execution of a project (Rs. 500 crore and above) can bring it before PMIC for taking it up with the concerned authority in the Central and State Governments through its portal. 	The primary focus of PMIC is to expedite the approvals for clearances from Central and State Authorities for setting up of projects. In accepting a project for resolution of its issues, PMIC does not distinguish between a ‘stalled’ or an ‘under implementation’ project. Further, there is no prescribed criterion for classifying a project as a stalled project in so far as PMIC is concerned. It also does not distinguish  between a  ‘state’ or ‘central’ project.	Project Monitoring - Invest India Cell (PMIC) on its own does not sanction any project or grant any approval for setting up a project or clears any project but facilitates resolution of clearance related issues through discussions and follow up. A list of public sector projects is at Annexure.                                                 ****
