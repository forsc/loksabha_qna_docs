ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a) :	As education is a subject in the concurrent list of the constitution, a majority of schools are under the control of the respective State Governments.Further, ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and the responsibility to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens including crimes against children, rest with respective State government and UT administration.  No such information is maintained in the Department of School Education and Literacy, Ministry of Education. (b) & (c):	The State Governments and Union Territory Administration have direct responsibility to ensure safety and security of students in schools under their territorial control.   The Ministry of Education has issued guidelines in October, 2014 to all State and UTs for ensuring safety and security of school children, including preventive mechanisms and procedures required to be put in place in the schooling system along with relief and redressal strategies in case of any incident.   Following the judgement given in the Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 136 of 2017 and Writ Petition (Civil) No. 874 of 2017 by the Hon’ble Supreme Court, this Department is in the process of preparing guidelines for fixing the accountability of school management in the matter of safety of children studying in schools.National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has also suggested authorities at different levels such as School Management Committees, School Principals, School Management, Education Department and Boards, to conduct safety audits in schools. NCPCR has developed a Manual on safety and security of children in school setting.(d):	Under Samagra Shiksha, funds are provided to the States and UTs in order to sensitize teachers to function as the first level counsellors in schools.  Under NISHTHA, a nation-wide integrated teacher training program, teachers are being given orientation on counselling, provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act, Juvenile Justice Act, School Safety guidelines, helpline and emergency numbers and drop-boxes for complaints, etc.Further, in textbooks published by National Council of Education Research and Training, the inner pages include a reference to POCSO e-box available at NCPCR@gov.in& CHILDLINE No. 1098.Department of School Education and Literacy, Ministry of Education has circulated the School Safety Pledge to all States and Union Territories for being displayed on a board or painted on the wall in English/ Hindi or any other regional language approved by the State/ UT, at a prominent place in the school. It has the contact numbers of some of the important stakeholders like Childline, State Counselling Helpline etc. To ensure safety and security of girls, under Samagra Shiksha, Self defence training is imparted to girls of classes VI to XII studying in Government Schools. Fund for this purpose is provided for three months @ Rs. 3000/- per school per month for inculcating self-defence skills including life skill for self-protection and self-development among the girls. Self defence training is also being given in Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBVs).Furthermore, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has issued a circular on 12.09.2017 directing the schools affiliated to the Board to take measures such as psychometric evaluation of teaching and non-teaching staff, safety audit of premises, CCTV monitoring, character antecedents verification, visitor management, training of staff and setting up Internal Complaints Committee on sexual harassment and Committees under Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO) Act, 2012 etc. to ensure safety of children. CBSE has also issued guidelines to schools for ensuring an atmosphere free from fear in each affiliated school.*****
