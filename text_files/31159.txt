                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a): 	Under the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) reforms, the Department has implemented the technology driven One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan in 34 States/UTs so far by the name ‘Integrated Management of Public Distribution System’ (IM-PDS). .......2/--2-(b): 	After being sanctioned under the IM-PDS scheme in April 2018, the ONORC plan was first started in two clusters of two adjoining States from August 2019 and the number of States was increased to 12 during the year 2019-20. Further, the number of States/UTs under ONORC was increased to 32 with the integration of 20 more States/UTs during the year 2020-21. Currently, a total of 34 States/UTs are seamlessly integrated under the ONORC plan. The implementation of ONORC in the 2 remaining States of Assam and Chhattisgarh depends upon their technical readiness to operate the mechanism of ration card portability. (c): The financial outlay approved for the IM-PDS scheme in all States/UTs is Rs. 127.3 Crore. (d): 	Under the ONORC plan, there is no requirement to upgrade the ration cards or issue new ration cards to the beneficiaries for taking the benefit of ration card portability. Under this technology driven portability system, the National Food Security Act (NFSA) beneficiaries, including migrant beneficiaries, can use their same/existing ration cards to access their quota of subsidised foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) of choice with Aadhaar biometric authentication on an electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) device.****
