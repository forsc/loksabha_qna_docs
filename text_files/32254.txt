Round the clock deployment of forces was ensured in all the vulnerable areas to maintain peace and law and order.  Proportionate and appropriate actions were taken by Delhi Police to control the situation. Sincere, dedicated and incessant efforts made by Delhi Police brought the riotous situation to normalcy within a short span of time and also prevented the riots from spreading across to other areas of Delhi/NCR. *******
