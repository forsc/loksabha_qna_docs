                                                                    THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                                   (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a) and (b):	Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation 2.0 (AMRUT 2.0) scheme, which has been launched on 01 October, 2021 for the period of 05 years i.e. from the financial year 2021-22 to  the  financial  year  2025-26,  is   designed   to  provide  universal coverage of water supply to all households through functional taps in all the statutory towns in the country and coverage of sewerage/septage management in 500 cities covered in first phase of the AMRUT scheme. Making the cities ‘water secure’ and thereby enhancing ease of living of citizens is major objective of the Mission.	All statutory towns of Gujarat have been covered under the Mission.        AMRUT 2.0 will promote circular economy of water through development of City Water Balance Plan (CWBP) for each city focusing on recycle/reuse of treated sewage, rejuvenation of water bodies and water conservation. It will help cities to identify scope for projects focusing on universal coverage of functional water tap connections, water source conservation, rejuvenation of water bodies and wells, recycle/reuse of treated used water, and rainwater harvesting. Based on the projects identified in CWBP, Mission envisages to make cities ‘water secure’ through circular economy of water.          Mission also has a reform agenda on ease of living of citizens through reduction of non-revenue water, recycle of treated used water, rejuvenation of water bodies, augmenting double entry accounting system, urban planning, strengthening urban finance etc.Other components of AMRUT 2.0 are:(i)	Pey Jal Survekshan to ascertain equitable distribution of water, reuse of wastewater, mapping of water bodies and promote healthy competition among the cities / towns.(ii)	Technology Sub-Mission for water to leverage latest global technologies in the field of water.(iii)	Information, Education and Communication (IEC) campaign to spread awareness among masses about conservation of water.(c)	The total indicative outlay for AMRUT 2.0 is Rs. 2,99,000 crore including Central share of Rs. 76,760 crore for five years. This outlay includes funding of Rs. 22,000 crore ( Rs. 10,000 crore as Central Assistance) for ongoing projects of AMRUT till March 2023. Central fund allocation to States/ Union Territories (UTs) for projects will be worked out by distributing entire central project funds ( Rs. 66,750 crore) among States/ UTs giving weightage to urban population (Census 2011) and area of States/ UTs in ratio 90:10.                                         ****
