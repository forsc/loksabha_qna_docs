ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) to (c):  The Spices Board has established a Spices Park at Kottakudy village in Sivaganga district of  Tamil Nadu  in an area of 29.43 hectares  ( 72.69 acres) of land allotted  by the  Government of Tamil Nadu.  The objectives of the Spices Park are to set up common infrastructure facilities for cleaning, grading, processing, value addition,  storage, packing etc of spices, mainly  chilli and turmeric to ensure the quality of spices and thereby better price for the farmers.  The Spices Park will help the growers in shortening the supply chain by establishing   direct linkage with processors and exporters. It is expected to increase the export of spices and spice products  from the State of Tamil Nadu. The infrastructure includes:•	A full line processing facility for chilli with a capacity of 1 ton/hour for cleaning and 0.5 ton per hour for grinding.•	A full line processing  facility for turmeric with a capacity of 1 ton/hour  for  cleaning and 0.5  ton per hour for grinding. •	Steam sterilization unit in batch process with a capacity of 250 kg/hour.•	Warehouse for chilli with 500 MT capacity•	Warehouse for turmeric with 700 MT capacity  and •	Weigh bridge (80 tonnes).	The Board has allotted 26 plots measuring 25.57 acres to 21 exporters on 30 years lease to establish their own processing and value addition units. The exporters in the park will source the spices directly from the farmers in the neighbouring regions. The operation of the Spices Park has not yet been commenced due to delay in getting the approval of Directorate of Town and Country Planning, Government of Tamil Nadu. Now the Board got the Park layout approval from the Block Development Officer, Sivaganga   on 19/7/2019.	   All the Spices Parks established by the Spices Board have been designated as Food Parks by the Union Ministry of Food Processing Industries for availing affordable credit from NABARD and grant from the Ministry of Food Processing Industries by the exporters/entrepreneurs for creation/expansion of spice processing units in the spices parks.  The exporters, to whom the plots are allotted, will commence the construction of processing units in the plots allotted to them after the registration of lease deed executed with  the Spices Board with the local Registration Department and getting  approval for the construction of buildings/ processing units proposed in the allotted plots.  It is estimated that about 115000 to 118000  man days of  employment will be generated  directly and about 50000 man days will be generated  indirectly every year once the park becomes fully operational. ****
