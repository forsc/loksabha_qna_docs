(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):	 National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) is a virtual platform integrating physical wholesale mandis/ markets of different States/ Union Territories (UTs) to facilitate online trading of agricultural commodities through transparent price discovery method to enable farmers to realize better remunerative prices for their produce.The Central Government is providing free e-NAM software and financial grant assistance for related hardware including quality assaying equipments and for creation of infrastructure like cleaning, grading, sorting, packaging and compost unit etc.States/ UTs have availed the assistance by submission of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) and created related infrastructure for smooth functioning of e-NAM at respective mandis. States like Rajasthan, Gujarat & Haryana had installed quick assaying equipments in their e-NAM mandis. State Governments have been advised to explore the possibilities of upgrading the internet connectivity with internet service providers. States have also been advised to provide sufficient computers & other hardwares with requisite manpower. Close monitoring of the progress through meetings at various levels and visits of the officers to e-NAM mandis is carried out. Under the scheme, various training & awareness programmes are conducted for farmers, traders, commission agents and other stakeholders for successful implementation of e-NAM. Farmers are free to register on e-NAM Portal and sell their produce through online transparent and competitive bidding method, which is encouraging them to join increasingly on e-NAM platform. Also APMCs help farmers in registering as sellers in e-NAM.So far, more than 1.72 Crore farmers have registered on e-NAM platform, within the catchment area of 1000 mandis which are integrated on e-NAM platform. The agricultural produce trade with a value of Rs 1.82 lakh crore have so far been recorded on e-NAM platform.Following are some of the major efforts taken by the Government to continuously promote the e-NAM platform:-i. 	Integration of additional 415 mandis with e-NAM, taking the total number of mandis to 1000 across 18 states and 3 UTs, thus bringing more markets access to farmers to sell their agriculture produce.ii. 	FPO trading module has been launched whereby FPOs can trade their produce from their collection center/ premise without bringing the produce to APMC.iii. 	Warehouse based trading module is provided in e-NAM to facilitate trade from warehouses based on e-NWR.iv. 	Further the e-NAM platform is made inter operable with Rashtriya e Market Services Private Limited (ReMS) platform of Government of Karnataka which will facilitate famers of either platforms were can sell their produce in other platform thereby increasing their market access.v. 	GPS Based e-NAM Mandi Locator: Farmers / Sellers can locate their nearby e-NAM mandi using GPS based mandi locator feature through e-NAM mobile app. This will helps the farmers to easily locate and reach the selected mandis and sell their agri-produce.vi.
