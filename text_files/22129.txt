(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) and (b):	Government does not setup cold storage of its own. However, Government is implementing various schemes under which financial assistance is provided for setting up of cold storages throughout the country including Maharashtra. 	Department of Agriculture Cooperation and Farmers Welfare is implementing Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) under which financial assistance is provided for various horticulture activities including setting up of cold storages. The component is demand/entrepreneur driven for which Government assistance in the form of credit linked back ended subsidy is available at the rate of 35% of the project cost in general areas and at the rate of 50% of the project cost in hilly and scheduled areas. The scheme is available for all States/UTs including the State of Maharashtra.	Further, Ministry of Food Processing Industries is implementing the Scheme for Integrated Cold Chain, Value Addition and Preservation Infrastructure as one of the component of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana with the objective of reducing post-harvest losses of horticulture and non-horticulture produce and providing remunerative price to farmers for their produce. Under the scheme, Ministry provides financial assistance in the form of grant-in-aid at the rate of 35% for general areas and 50% for North East States, Himalayan States, ITDP areas and Islands for storage and transport infrastructure and at the rate of 50% and 75% respectively for value addition and processing infrastructure subject to a maximum grant-in-aid of Rs. 10 crore per project for setting up integrated cold chain projects including irradiation facility without any break from the farm gate to the consumer. Standalone cold storages are not covered under the Scheme.  The scheme is available for all States/UTs including the State of Maharashtra.	Government of Maharashtra reported that under National Horticulture Mission, Maharashtra State Horticulture and Medicinal Plants Board, Pune has provided assistance of Rs. 867.92 lakh to establish 20 Cold Storage/Cold Chain Projects since 2005-06 to 2019-20 with a capacity of 31082 MT for Horticulture Produce in Nashik District.*******
