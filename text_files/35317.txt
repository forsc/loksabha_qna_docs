                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW) (a) and (b)  The average number of passengers and earnings for 11057 Chhtrapati Shivaji Terminus-Amritsar  Express at  Gharaunda station is less than the norms prescribed in the extant policy guidelines relating to provision of stoppages.  (c) and (d) To contain the spread of Covid-19 pandemic Indian Railways had discontinued all regular passenger carrying trains including 14095/96 Kalka-Delhi Sarai Rohilla Himalayan Queen   Express. However, train services are being gradually restored. (e)The Survey of Karnal-Yamuna Nagar via Asandh (103 km) new line has been carried out in 2015-16. As per survey report, the project was found financially unviable, as such it could not be taken forward.  Thereafter, this project was taken up for development by Haryana Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd. (HRIDC), a Joint Venture company of Government of Haryana (51%) and Ministry of Railways (49%). Detailed Project Report (DPR) was submitted for seeking In Principle Approval (IPA) for pre-investment activity from Railways. IPA was not granted as project was not operationally justified and was financially unviable. *****
