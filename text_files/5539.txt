ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) & (b):	There are instances of abandonment of tea gardens by the tea garden owners.  The main reasons for abandonment/lock out of tea gardens may be attributed to poor yield of the estates, ageing bush profile, lack of development perspective, poor garden management practices, highly debt oriented funding strategy, ownership disputes etc.  The suspension of work, lock-out or abandonment of any industrial establishment including tea plantation is covered under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1948 and the settlement of the disputes, if any, is done through conciliation, arbitration and adjudication proceedings.   (c) & (d):	The garden management of Dumchipara Tea Garden, belonging to M/s. Duncans Industries Ltd. abandoned the garden on 21st of June, 2019 due to labour unrest owing to non-payment of wages and salaries to workers. The officials of the Tea Board   discussed the matter with the Assistant Labour Commissioner, Birpara, on 25th June, 2019 who  is the appropriate authority in the matter.  The garden has been re-opened on 2nd July, 2019 after making the payment of outstanding wages, for two fortnights on 1st July 2019.******
