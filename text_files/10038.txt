Under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, it is the responsibility of the State Governments to fill up the vacancies of President and Members in the State Commissions and District Fora. The Central Government has been writing to the State Governments from time to time for filling up the existing and anticipated vacancies of President and member well in time for the effective functioning of the Consumer Fora.   To reduce the pendency of cases and for smooth functioning of the Consumer Fora, the Central Government provides financial assistance to the States for strengthening the infrastructure of the Consumer Fora and   also computer hardware, software and technical manpower to the Consumer Fora for computerization of their working.   The Central Government holds annual conference of the Presidents of the State Commissions and Secretaries In-charge of Consumer Affairs of the State /UT Governments to review the functioning of the Consumer Fora in the country, where they are impressed upon to take necessary steps for timely filling up of the vacancies and for reducing the pendency in the Consumer Fora.
