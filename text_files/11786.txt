ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) On 01.07.2016, the left engine cowling of M/s Air India B777-200LR aircraft while operating flight AI922 got damaged while taxi in to stand no. V14 at Mumbai due to collision with aerobridge.;(b) & (c) The incident was investigated by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). The investigation revealed that the Visual Docking Guidance System for the stand no. V14 was unserviceable. Manual marshalling was done to guide aircraft for parking in the bay. The marshaller did not ascertain about the type of aircraft before commencing marshalling the aircraft. He guided the aircraft further forward of the stop point. Accordingly, the aircraft crossed its stop point and the engine came in contact with the aerobridge resulting in damage to the engine cowling.;(d) Based on the outcome of investigation, M/s Air India had revised their Marshalling Procedure. Further, corrective training was also imparted to the involved marshaller and Ramp Supervisor by M/s Air India.
