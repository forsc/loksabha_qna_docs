ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)   No such arrangement is currently being worked out with countries in Europe and North America for grant of visa on arrival to Indian citizens.  While issuance of visa and visa related process is the sovereign and unilateral decision of the respective country, the matter regarding easier and liberalized visa policy for Indian nationals is taken up regularly in bilateral meetings/ forums with foreign countries.   It may be also noted that presently India also does not provide visa on arrival to citizens of countries in Europe and North America.***
