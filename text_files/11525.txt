THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI  PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	& (b): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.******** STATEMENT REFERRD TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO 47 FOR ANSWER ON 5TH FEBRUARY, 2020.(a): 	Yes, Sir.(b): 	Patent Office grants patents to all inventions and claims made therein.  Details of patents granted since 01-01-2005 along with the date of filing of the patent application, date of the patent grant, patent application number, patent number and name of the patentee where the claims included reference to the above mentioned diseases are attached in Annexure-1. Patent term is uniformly 20 years from the date of filing as applicable, unless a patent is ceased because of non- renewal (non-payment of fee).Further, it may be noted, when a patent is applied for, International Non-proprietary Name (INN) is generally not provided by the applicant; neither the same is required in the application as per rules. Therefore, it is not available.It may also be noted that as a result of several measures taken by the Government of India, i) the time taken for examination of patent applications has been brought down from 72 months in 2014-15 to around 24-36 months at present; ii) the pendency in patent examination has come down from 1,78,525 in FY 2014-15 to 81,271 in January 2020; and iii) the disposals have increased from 14,316 in FY 2014-15 to 48,751 in FY 2019-20 till January 2020.*******
