ANSWER




 MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT (SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')  (a) to (d): The Department of School Education and Literacy is implementing Samagra Shiksha which envisages the ‘school’ as a continuum from Pre-school, primary, upper primary, secondary to Senior Secondary levels. Under Samagra Shiksha, various interventions have been targeted to promote education, which include opening of schools in the neighbourhood as defined by the State, provision of free text-books up to Class VIII, uniforms to all girls and SC, ST, BPL boys up to class VIII, provision of gender segregated toilets in all schools, teachers’ sensitization programmes to promote girls’ participation, construction  of  residential  quarters  for  teachers  in  remote/hilly  areas/in areas with difficult terrain.     In addition, there is a provision for twinning of schools under which wellfunctioning Private or Government Schools in urban or semi-urban areas are linked with schools located in rural areas for interaction and exchange of experience. Under the exchange programme, the students from rural schools are  brought to schools in urban areas for one week and vice-versa for greater exposure.     Further, for promoting the merit/capacity of students, including those in rural areas,  meritorious students belonging to the Economically Weaker section can avail the benefit of Scholarship under National Means-cum-Merit Scholarship Scheme. The scholarships are awarded to meritorious students, whose parental income from all sources is not more than Rs. 1,50,000/- per annum to arrest their drop out at class VIII and encourage them to continue the study at secondary stage. One lakh fresh scholarships of Rs.12000/- per annum per student are awarded to selected students of class IX  every year and their continuation/renewal  in classes X to XII for study in a State Government, Government-aided and Local body schools under the scheme.  *****
