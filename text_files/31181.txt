STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (g) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2834 BY SHRI SURESH KUMAR KASHYAP TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 15.12.2021 REGARDING TALLEST RAILWAY BRIDGE (a) and (b):	Yes, Sir.  Railway has taken up construction of Bridge at Chenab river in Reasi District of Jammu & Kashmir. This is the highest Railway Bridge in the world.  The main arch span of this bridge is 359 meter high from Chenab river bed level.  The total length of this bridge is 1315 meter and span of main arch is 467 meter. The construction of Chenab bridge has been taken up as part of Udhampur Srinagar Baramula Rail Line (262 Km.).  The sanctioned cost of the project is     `27949 crore.  Out of which 161 Km length of the project has been commissioned and an expenditure of `26238 crore has been incurred on the project so far.  Work in Katra-Banihal section has been taken up.(c):	The completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, priority of project, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations etc.  All these factors affect the completion time of the project.  As such, confirmed completion time of project cannot be ascertained. Nevertheless, every effort is being made to execute the project expeditiously.(d):	The arch of Chenab Railway bridge is being constructed by erection of arch segments using overhead cable cranes and deck is constructed by incremental launching.  The anticipated cost of this bridge is `1486 crore(e)	Design of bridges depends upon various factors including water ways, topographical and geological conditions  of  area etc. Presently there is no such requirement in Himachal Pradesh.(f) & (g):  The Railway projects are sanctioned Zonal Railway-wise and not State-wise as the Railway projects may span across State boundaries. However, as on 01.04.2021, 04 New line Projects costing `16,133crore for 258 Km length falling fully/partly in Himachal Pradesh are under different stage of planning/approval/execution, out of which 61 Km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `1,712 Cr. has been incurred upto March 21.*****
