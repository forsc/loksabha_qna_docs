                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a) to (c):  An Integrated Check Post (ICP) at Attari, established in April 2012, facilitates land-based international trade. With a view to facilitate an alternate and reliable access route to landlocked countries, in January 2015, India had announced its decision to allow Afghan trucks to enter the Indian territory through ICP Attari for off-loading and loading goods from and to Afghanistan. However, Pakistan does not allow transit through its territory for Indian goods imported by Afghanistan through ICP Attari. Bilateral trade between India and Pakistan, including through ICP Attari, remains suspended as a result of unilateral measures taken by Pakistan in August 2019.****
