                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c):    Due to increasing patient load, there is a waiting period in many cases especially those which require surgery or complex investigative modulation. However, the patients in critical condition are given priority and such cases are not delayed beyond the duration minimally required for surgery.  In the casualty/emergency lifesaving situations, all efforts are made to admit the seriously ill patient in the hospital as far as practically possible. In case of non-availability of bed in the emergency, the patients are first stabilized etc and after stabilization are sent to other Government hospitals for further management.  For improving the infrastructure facility to improve the mismatch between the need and supply of services, various steps have been under taken such as setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar, construction of Surgical and Burns and Plastic Block at AIIMS, New Delhi, redevelopment of Safdarjung hospital etc.  Creation of additional posts of doctors and staff & filling up of these posts is a dynamic process which is being done as per requirement of hospitals, availability of resources by following due procedure. (d):    Under phase-I of the Centrally Sponsored Scheme titled “Establishment of new medical colleges attached with existing district/referral hospitals” launched in January, 2014, 58 district in 20 States/UT have been identified and approved.  42 medical colleges have become functional. Further, under Phase-II of the said Scheme launched in February, 2018, 24 new medical colleges in 8 States have been identified. The State Government have identified the locations on Challenge mode.  Out of 24 medical colleges, 22 have been approved till date. Under Phase-III of the Scheme, the Cabinet on 28.08.2019 has approved establishment of 75 new medical colleges out of which 49 medical colleges have been approved till date.(e):      Public Health and hospitals being a State subject, the primary responsibility of management of public hospitals including crowd management lies with State/UT Governments. However, various initiatives such as National Mobile Medical Unit Service, Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Programme to support dialysis facility in all district hospitals have been taken up for addressing the overcrowding in public health facilities. Online Registration System (ORS), Multiple Computerized Registration Counters, Digital Display Board for que-management, security arrangements for proper crowd management have been implemented in various hospitals.  *****
