The feedback received includes, inter alia,  recommendations to achieve universal reach of broadcasting, improve choice of content, enable a level playing field for sectoral growth and enhance global outreach of broadcast content from India. (c)  	The formulation of a policy like National Broadcasting Policy has multi-dimensional implications and it needs to be firmed up after due process.  Therefore, no time frame can be indicated for the finalization of the policy.(d) 	A proposal for grant of Infrastructure Status to the Distribution Segment of the Broadcasting Sector, as requested by the industry, was submitted to the nodal Department viz. Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance. The Department of Economic Affairs, however, did not agree to the proposal for not meeting the specified criteria. (e) 	The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting continues to create an enabling environment for sustained growth of media and entertainment sector, facilitate value based wholesome entertainment and effectively disseminate information on government policies, programmes and achievements. With the continuous review of policies / programmes, steps are being taken to improve the ease of doing business and to strengthen the broadcasting eco-system in India.*****
