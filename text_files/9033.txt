ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) & (b) Yes, Sir. Out of 273 sections on High Density Network routes, 183 sections are saturated as per latest line capacity statement (2017-18).(c) & (d) Though the over utilization is impacting the availability of time for maintenance, it is not affecting inspections of tracks. If due to any reason, the condition of tracks does not permit safe train operation at maximum permissible speed, speed restrictions are imposed. The non-availability of blocks have not been found to be primary cause of train derailments. (e) In the past, to reduce congestion and augment the capacity of tracks, 189 new lines, 247 doubling, 55 gauge conversion, 62 electrification works and 522 traffic facility works have been included in Railway budgets. In addition to this, there are two ongoing dedicated freight corridors of total 3360 Km length under various stages of execution.*****
