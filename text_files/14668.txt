                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (c):    Schemes under Handloom Sector are implemented on the basis of proposals received from the State Governments and in close coordination with the State Governments.  The year-wise outflow of funds under the various schemes depends on the number of such proposals for release of funds.  This leads to variations in the annual figures.     Budgetary allocation of funds is not made State-wise.  Funds are released to the eligible handloom agencies based on viable proposals received and utilization of previous released funds.  The details of scheme-wise funds allocated and utilized under various Handloom schemes in the last three years are as under: -  Sl. No.	Name of Scheme	2016-17(Rs. In crore)	2017-18(Rs.
