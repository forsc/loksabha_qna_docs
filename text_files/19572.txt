                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) & (b):  The India Cooling Action Plan (ICAP) addresses the cooling requirements and lists out actions, inter-alia reduction of cooling demand, refrigerant transition, enhancing energy efficiency and better technology options over a 20-year time horizon by dovetailing with on-going programmes of the Government and use of appropriate policy, regulatory and financial instruments, where required. As part of implementation framework, the ICAP has listed short, medium and long term recommendations.  Regarding implementation of building energy codes, the ICAP recommends incorporation of relevant provisions of energy efficient building design of the Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC), for all large commercial (non-residential) buildings and wider adoption of Energy Conservation  Building Code – Residential (ECBC)-R in housing projects to enable thermal comfort for Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and Low Income Group ( LIG). (c) & (d): The ECBC of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), launched in 2017, defines minimum energy performance standards for new commercial buildings having a connected load of 100 kW or contract demand of 120 kVA or more.  As on December 2020, 17 States/ UTs have notified the inclusion of ECBC directives in their respective bye-laws. Eco-Niwas Samitha (ENS or ECBC–R) of BEE recommends minimum requirements for the energy efficient design and construction of buildings, for residential sector. Adoption of these provisions in the implementation of ICAP is expected to have impact of about 150 billion units of electricity saving by 2037-38.****
