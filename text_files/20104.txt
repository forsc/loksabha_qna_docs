The State Government of Gujarat had given three reasons for declaration of certain regions as difficult areas viz., poor connectivity, susceptibility to cyclones and earthquakes. The proposal was examined and State was informed that the proposal could be considered once the State Government itself notifies the proposed areas as ‘difficult areas’ by provisioning for the same in Schedule of Rates (SoR) and submits it to the Ministry.  The Ministry has not received the complete proposal from the State Government as yet.(c)&(d) Under PMAY-G higher rate of assistance i.e. Rs.1,30,000/- is provided for construction of houses sanctioned in difficult areas. The allocation of targets and budget is given to the States/UTs every financial year based on the Annual Action Plan submitted by the respective State/ UT Government. The budget allocation  made to the States/UTs covers the houses that are sanctioned in difficult areas as well. ******
