                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF AYUSH(SHRI SARBANANDA SONOWAL)(a) & (b): There are five Ayurveda hospitals being run one each in the districts of Begusarai, Bhagalpur, Buxer, Darbhanga and Patna in Bihar. However, there is no Ayurveda hospital in Gopalganj. As per the information received from State Government of Bihar, these Ayurveda hospitals are being run in own buildings. (c): The details of posts of medical officer/doctors and other staff sanctioned, filled and lying vacant in Ayurveda hospitals in Bihar is at Annexure-I.(d): Under NAM, there is provision of setting up of up to 50 bedded integrated AYUSH hospitals in the State/UTs including in the State of Bihar. Ministry of Ayush has approved one 50 bedded integrated AYUSH Hospital at Patna in 2015-16. Further, State Government has submitted a proposal for setting up of 50 bedded integrated AYUSH hospitals at Gopalganj in 2020-21 through SAAP. However, SAAP could not be approved since State Government has not submitted the Utilization Certificates for Grant-in-aid released earlier under the National AYUSH Mission.
