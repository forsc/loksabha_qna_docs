                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) FOR NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND POWER AND MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP (SHRI R. K. SINGH)(a) and (b) Small Hydro Power Projects are set up as per the policies framed by the State Governments. The States follow their own procedures in allotting and awarding the sites to the developers. Accordingly all necessary clearances i.e. land acquisition, forest clearance, irrigation clearance, etc. are obtained either at the State level or through State Governments. The Clearance of this ministry is not required for setting up of Small/Mini/Micro Hydro Power Projects. It only provides incentives in the form of Central Financial Assistance to the eligible project developers as per prevailing scheme guidelines.    (c) Sixty Four (64) proposals were received in this Ministry for availing subsidy during the last three years. The State/UT wise list is given in Annexure A.*****
