                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (e):	Textile industry is predominantly in the unorganized sector and the government does not maintain any such data. With a view to boost textiles sector in the country, government has initiated two important steps which were part of Budget Announcement in Lok Sabha on 01.02.2020. These are; i)	Creation of National Technical Textiles Mission with total outlay of Rs 1480 crore. Technical textiles are textiles which are used for their functional properties, rather than for aesthetics or comfort. There are a large varities of technical textiles some of which are used in important applications such as agriculture, health and hygiene, medical applications, soil and water conservation, roads and highway, railways, airports, sea-ports, defence, protection of personnel in military, para-military, petrochemical/chemical industries, safety of fireman etc. The aim of the Mission is to position India as a major producer, consumer and exporter of technical textile products in the world map, therefore boosting its economy and technological capability.ii)	Abolition of anti-dumping duty on Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA), which is a critical input for man-made textile fibre and yarns. Its easy availability and competitive pricing is desirable to unlock the immense potential in textile sector which is a significant employment generator. 		In addition, Government is implementing various policy initiatives and schemes for supporting the development of textile industry. These schemes and initiatives which promote technology upgradation, creation of infrastructure, skill development and sectoral development in the textile sector, create a conducive environment and provide enabling conditions for textile manufacturing in the country.  In order to support the growth and modernization of the textile industry in the country, the government has been implementing several schemes, such as the Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (A-TUFS), Schemes for the development of the Powerloom Sector(Power-Tex), Schemes for Technical Textiles, Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP), Scheme for Additional Grant for Apparel Manufacturing Units under SITP (SAGAM),  SAMARTH- The Scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector (SCBTS), Jute (ICARE- Improved Cultivation and Advanced Retting Exercise), Integrated Processing Development Scheme (IPDS), Silk Samagra, National Handloom Development Programme, National Handicraft Development Programme, Integrated Wool Development Programme (IWDP), North East Region Textiles Promotion Scheme (NERTPS), Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (ROSCTL), Scheme for Production and Employment  Linked Support for Garmenting Units (SPELSGU) etc. The Government had also approved a special package for textile sector with an outlay of Rs. 6000 crores to boost employment generation and exports particularly in Garmenting and Made-ups.Investment in the textile industry is by and large in the private sector and no state-wise investments are made. However, Government of India only facilitates the textile industry for development and modernization by providing subsidy on investments made under various Schemes. Funds are released to achieve the desired objectives under various schemes on year to year basis. The textile agencies/organisations in the States involved in textile activities are the beneficiary agencies of above schemes.  Proposals of eligible beneficiary agencies duly recommended by the State Directorate of textiles are considered for financial assistance as per the guidelines of the schemes. Under schemes for providing assistance to Handloom sector, following activities have been undertaken in the last three years and the current year in the State of Bihar: -i)	12 Block Level Clusters have been sanctioned and a sum of Rs. 4.37 crore has been released involving 5114 beneficiaries. ii)	One Mega Handloom Cluster has been sanctioned in Bhagalpur in Bihar in the year 2014-15, where various interventions such as Dye House, Design Studio etc. have been set up for the benefits of handloom weavers.  Out of 12 Block Level Clusters mentioned in para (i) above, 10 Block Level Cluster have been sanctioned in Bhagalpur district.  Project cost of the Mega cluster is Rs. 11.47 crore, consisting GOI Share of Rs. 11.16 crore, of which a sum of Rs. 4.01 crore has been released so far. iii)	03 marketing events have been sanctioned and sum of Rs. 81.50 lakh has been released involving 7000 beneficiaries. iv)	453 beneficiaries have been provided loan worth Rs. 1.18 crore under Weavers’  MUDRA Scheme. v)	1797 beneficiaries have been enrolled under Mahatma Gandhi Bunkar Bima Yojana/Converged Mahatma Gandhi Bunkar Bima Yojana. vi)	1.455 lakh kg of yarn worth Rs. 7.10 crore has been supplied at mill gate price and 0.65 lakh kg of yarn worth Rs. 6.35 crore has been supplied to the weavers under 10% subsidy scheme under Yarn Supply Scheme (YSS).  vii)	In order to prevent production of items reserved for exclusive production on handloom, powerloom inspections are carried out on regular basis.  During the above period, 7824 inspections were carried out.  viii)	10 weavers have been provided improved looms and accessories under HSS, skill upgradation training has been imparted to 1069 beneficiary weavers, 38 weavers have been sanctioned workshed and 484 weavers have been provided lighting units. ****
