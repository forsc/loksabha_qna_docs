ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a): Coal India Limited (CIL) has informed that there are no schools termed as “Colliery Schools” functioning in Eastern Coalfields Ltd. (ECL), Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. (BCCL), Central Coalfields Ltd. (CCL) and Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. (MCL). However, there are some privately managed schools located in the interior area of these subsidiaries. None of these schools are under the managerial or administrative control of subsidiaries of CIL and the teachers of these schools are not given salary by CIL since there is no employer-employee relationship with them. However, aid on the basis of number and qualification of teachers is released to these schools by subsidiaries of CIL. No case of withholding of salary of teachers has been reported by CIL. (b):  Not applicable in view of reply to part (a) above.                                                                 *****
