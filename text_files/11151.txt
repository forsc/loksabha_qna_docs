ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d) Under the National Skill Development Mission (NSDM), 2015 skill training is imparted for the job roles relevant to meet the industry demand in various sectors. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY)(2016 – 2020 the  flagship scheme of Ministry of Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE) aims to train 10 million youth by 2020. PMKVY has two components viz Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed(CSCM) and Centrally Sponsored State Managed(CSSM). The target allocation under PMKVY CSCM component to various training centres across States is based on industry requirements across country. However, under CSSM while Central government provides funds, targets to training Partners/Training Centres are allocated by States based on their own requirements. There are three training routes under the scheme: Short term Training for fresh skilling of school / college drop outs and unemployed youth, Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) to recognize the existing skills and Special Projects to address skilling requirements of groups which are under-represented or require special initiatives and efforts. RPL provides orientation to the already skilled workforce, and does not mandate placements. Norms and condition of PMKVY are periodically updated based on scheme progress, steering committee approval and each of these condition / norms are updated from time to time under the notice section of PMKVY website at http://pmkvyofficial.org/Notices_and_Media.aspx . 	Under PMKVY 2016-2020, training Centres make efforts to facilitate placements of certified candidates through multiple initiatives like Rojgaar Mela and collaboration with industries and Sector Skill Councils. Also, candidates can avail benefit of placement through ‘Yuva Sampark’ portal which brings both candidate and potential employer on IT platform to find potential match between two.Directorate General of Training (DGT), Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is entrusted with the responsibility of long term vocational training in the Country.
