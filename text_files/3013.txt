                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)  (a)	to (d):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 260   FOR ANSWER ON 10th JULY,2019  REGARDING “PROTECTION OF INTERESTS OF PEPPER FARMERS”.(a)&(b): Representations have been received from traders/growers associations of pepper in the country  regarding alleged import of low quality pepper into India from Vietnam through Sri Lanka.  Since most of the pepper producing countries are in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region, the stakeholders have raised apprehensions of routing the pepper produced in ASEAN countries including Vietnam, to India through Sri Lanka, by utilizing the provisions of India Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISLFTA) and Agreement on South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA).The various steps taken up by the Government to curb import of pepper to protect the interests of the Indian farmers  include, inter-alia, the following:  1.	The Union Government Vide Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) Notification dated 6/12/2017 fixed Rs.500/- per kg as  the Minimum Import Price for black pepper.2.	Subsequently, an amendment was brought in the Minimum Import Price (MIP) notification by making import of pepper at or  above Rs.500/- per kilogram free and import below Rs.500/ per kg prohibited vide DGFT Notification dated 21/3/2018.3.	To prevent improper import of  pepper from  other  countries taking advantage of preferential access under the India-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISLFTA) and Agreement on South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA), Sri Lankan Authorities were requested to exercise extreme care and diligence in issuing the Certificate of Origin. On our request, Sri- Lanka has introduced a new procedure to prevent misuse of Certificates of Origin for third-country black pepper shipments destined to India. While issuing such Certificates of Origins, relevant authorities in Sri Lanka are also cross verifying information on exports of pepper obtained from different sources in Sri Lanka, to ascertain the genuineness of exports. Sri Lanka has also put in place a mechanism under which access has been given to Indian authorities to examine the scanned copies of Certificates of Origin issued for black pepper exports under ISFLTA and SAFTA.4.	Sri Lanka has temporarily suspended import of spices including pepper and areca nuts through the Entreport Trade and Commercial Hub Operations to prevent these spices being re-shipped from Sri Lanka to India as Sri Lankan products. 5.	Sri Lanka has also agreed to facilitate the visit of a technical team to examine the existing procedures in Sri Lanka for issuing Certificate of Origin and the new mechanism set up by Sri Lanka for verification of authenticity of certificates issued for black pepper shipments exported by Sri Lanka under ISFTA and SAFTA. 6.	Instruction has been issued to authorized officers of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and field formations of Customs to be vigilant at the point of entry in the ports in order to address the possibility of entry of inferior quality pepper from various countries. Chairman, CBIC, Department of  Revenue  has been  requested  to  issue necessary advisories to the  relevant  authorities in the international borders of Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar to tighten the vigil on the borders to prevent the  alleged illegal entry of black pepper into the country(c)&(d): Government fixes Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) of 22 mandated Kharif and Rabi crops and Fair and Remunerative Prices (FRP) for Sugarcane on the basis of recommendations of Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned and other relevant factors. Crops considered under MSP are major agricultural  commodities which are widely grown and have large area under cultivation, are generally items of mass consumption with fairly long shelf life or/ and necessary for food security. While recommending MSPs, CACP considers a host of factors including all India weighted average cost of production of crops. Based on the latest three years actual cost estimates provided by the Directorate of Economics and Statistics under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, which is compiled under ‘Comprehensive Scheme for studying the Costs of Cultivation of Principal Crops in India’.  CACP undertakes cost projection exercise crop-wise, state-wise for the ensuing season under certain implicit assumptions by utilizing statistical techniques.  These projected estimates of cost of production are considered into formulation of price policy recommendations by the CACP. Pepper is not one of the selected 25 crops that come under the Scheme.                          ****
