ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (g): The quinquennial labour force surveys on employment and unemployment were conducted by National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The last such survey was conducted during 2011-12. Now, NSSO has switched to the annual Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) which was conducted during 2017-18. The survey report has recently been released by the Government. As per the results of the survey, the estimated unemployment rate on usual status (principal status+subsidiary status) basis for persons of all ages in the country is given below:Unemployment Rates (in %) from 1972-73 to 2017-18Survey year	Rural	urban	Male	Female	Male	female2017-18*(PLFS)	5.8	3.8	7.1	10.82011-12(NSS 68th round)	1.7	1.7	3.0	5.22009-10(NSS 66th round)	1.6	1.6	2.8	5.72004-05(NSS 61st  round)	1.6	1.8	3.8	6.91999-00(NSS 55th round)	1.7	1.0	4.5	5.71993-94(NSS 50th round)	1.4	0.9	4.1	6.11987-88(NSS 43rd  round)	1.8	2.4	5.2	6.21983(NSS 38th round)	1.4	0.7	5.1	4.91977-78(NSS 32nd  round)	1.3	2.0	5.4	12.41972-73(NSS 27th round)	1.2	0.5	4.8	6.0(Note: *For comparability, the results of the PLFS with earlier rounds of NSS surveys need to be understood in the context with which the survey methodology and sample selection has been designed)Employment generation coupled with improving employability is the priority of the Government. Government has taken various steps for generating employment in the country like encouraging private sector of economy, fast-tracking various projects involving substantial investment and increasing public expenditure on schemes such as Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) and Deendyal Antodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM). 	Pradhan MantriRojgarProtsahanYojana (PMRPY) has been launched by the Ministry of Labour and Employment for incentivising employers for promoting employment generation. Under this scheme, Government is paying entire employer’s contribution (12% or as admissible) towards EPF and EPS for all eligible new employees for all sectors for 3 years. Till 31-05-2019, the scheme has covered 1,51,579 establishments and 1.21 crore beneficiaries.	Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) has been initiated by Government inter alia for facilitating self-employment. Under PMMY collateral free loans upto Rs. 10 lakh, are extended to micro/small business enterprises and to individuals to enable them to setup or expand their business activities. Upto 31st March, 2019, 18.26 crore loans were sanctioned under the scheme. 	Government has implemented the National Career Service (NCS) Project which comprises a digital portal that provides a nation-wide online platform for the job seekers and employers for job-matching in a dynamic, efficient and responsive manner and has a repository of career content to job seekers. 	Start-up India is a flagship initiative of the Government of India, intended to build a strong ecosystem that is conducive for the growth of start-up businesses, to drive sustainable economic growth and generate large scale employment opportunities.		Besides these initiatives, flagship programmes of the Government such as Make in India, Digital India, Swachh Bharat Mission, Smart City Mission, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, Housing for All, Infrastructure development and Industrial corridors have the potential to generate productive employment opportunities. Ministries/ Departments/ States run skill development schemes across various sectors to improve the employability of youth and also facilitate placements. Schemes such as the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) wherein Government reimburses 25 percent of the stipend payable to apprentices also enhances employability of the youth to access employment.*****
