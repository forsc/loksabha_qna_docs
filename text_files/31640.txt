                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a)  The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component & 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports. The details of current status of link projects and benefits for the states, under Peninsular Component of National Perspective Plan (NPP) is furnished at Annexure.(b)  The implementation of all links  under NPP is expected to result in production of 34 million Kilo Watt (KW) of power.(c)  A “Special Committee on Interlinking of Rivers” has been constituted in September, 2014 for the implementation of ILR programmes. Nineteen meetings of the Committee have been held so far. Further, a Task Force for Interlinking of Rivers has been constituted by MoWR, RD & GR (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in April, 2015 and fifteen meetings of the Task Force have been held so far. Efforts have been made for building consensus among the concerned States and also setting out road maps for implementation of the projects.(d)  Adequate care is taken to address the economic and  environmental aspects in the formulation of interlinking of rivers projects, apart from considering all relevant engineering parameters like hydrological, meteorological, hydraulic, geological, geo-technical etc. During the feasibility study stage, rapid Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) studies are carried out using one season data. While preparing the Detailed Project Report of any link project, Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) study covering the likely impact on river ecology, environmental flows, bio diversity, wildlife, socio-economic factors etc. and mitigation measures to be taken, are carried out as per terms of references approved by Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of MoEF & CC. *****ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3055 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 16.12.2021 REGARDING “INTER-LINKING OF PENINSULAR RIVERS”.Details of current status of link projects and benefits for the states, under Peninsular Component of National Perspective Plan (NPP)- Sl.
