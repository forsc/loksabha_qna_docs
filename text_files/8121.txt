The details of the Smart Cities Proposals, funds released by the Government of India and status of their projects are given in Annexure-I.(c) 	The projects of Smart Cities in Uttar Pradesh are progressing well at par with other Smart Cities. The Smart City proposals of the State of Uttar Pradesh are for Rs. 20,671 crore out of which Central Government would provide Rs. 5000 crore and an equal amount on a matching basis, is to be provided by the State/Urban Local Bodies.
