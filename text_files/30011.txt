                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND EARTH SCIENCES(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)??????? ?? ???????????? ??? ?????? ??????? ???????? ??  ????? ?????? (???????? ??????)  (??. ???????? ????)(a)   Yes Sir, the government proposes to set up more Women Technology Parks in rural/periurban areas through S&T based agencies and knowledge institutions. These parks promote development and adaptation of appropriate technologies; transfer of proven technologies and demonstration of live technology models.These parks aim to improve the weakest link of the predominant livelihood system of women in an area and promote social entrepreneurship and women employment based on the strongest link of the livelihood system. Efforts are done that women in rural and peri-urban areas receive training in WTPs for skill development and capacity building through S&T based interventions, using area specific resources, with goal of achieving local self-reliance for economic growth. Critical gap areas are addressed towards women empowerment, effectively contributing to fulfilling societal needs, creating awareness about health, nutrition, drudgery reduction and other location specific problems. At WTPs, scientists and technologists from mentoring organizations provide knowledge and appropriate technology to women groups at their own farm or work place for adaptation of technologies, standardization of value added products and marketing support. Some of the major technologies being trained through WTPs are Post Harvest processing, Digital art making & Craft designing using CAD, Bio-plate and leaf cup making, Fuel pellets production from agro waste, Hand Block Printing cum Framer computerized embroidery, Preparation of cow dung logs and pots, carpentry and waste management.(b)     Some more women technology parks are in the pipeline at the following places: 1.
