ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)&(b):  The Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is constantly evolving Scheme based on the monitoring and evaluations carried out by the Ministry through National Level Monitors, Common Review Missions, Mid Term Reviews, Third Party evaluations as well as the feedback and guidance received from the Committees of Parliament, Central Employment Guarantee Council and the requests/feedback of the Ministries, State Governments and others. Modifications are made to guidelines, structures and processes in light of above factors for serving the objectives of Mahatma Gandhi NREG Act more efficiently and effectively on a sustainable & sustained basis. (c):     The Ministry along with the States/UTs has been making concerted efforts for improving the timely payment of wages. National electronic Fund Management System (NeFMS) is implemented in 25 States and 2 Union Territory wherein payment of wages is being credited directly to the bank/post office accounts of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS workers by the Central Government through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). The Ministry has issued Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) on timely payment process for direct payment into the account of beneficiaries. States/ UTs have been advised to generate pay orders in time. This has resulted in considerable improvement in the status of timely generation of pay order leading to improvement in actual time taken to credit wages in the workers account. During the current Financial Year 2021-21 (as on 16.09.2020), around 98.58% pay orders have been generated within 15 days from the date of closure of the Muster Roll. (d):    No such panel has been constituted by this Ministry in this regard.  As per section 6(1) of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA), the Central Government may, by notification, specify the wage rate for its beneficiaries.  Accordingly, the Ministry of Rural Development notifies Mahatma Gandhi NREGA wage rate every year for States/UTs. To compensate the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA workers against inflation, the Ministry of Rural Development revises the wage rate every year based on change in Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labour (CPI-AL). The wage rate is made applicable from 1st April of each Financial Year.  However, each State/UT can provide wage over and above the wage-rate notified by the Central Government. The wage rate for the States/UTs for the Financial Year 2020-21, notified on 23rd March, 2020 is at Annexure-I.(e):     The mandate of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA) is to assure upto 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult member volunteers to do unskilled manual work. The responsibility for implementation of the Scheme is   with the States/UTs. The Ministry is in constant engagement with the States/UTs through review meetings, video conferences, Mid Term Review etc. and officers of the Ministry visit to States at regular interval to review implementation of the programme. After the field visits, the findings/shortcomings including technical problems and recommendations are shared with the States for appropriate action at their end. Monitoring and supervision of all aspects including technical problems of the programme have been strengthened for improving the implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA.  ******
