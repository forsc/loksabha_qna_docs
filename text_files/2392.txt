In view of large number of projects to be taken up under Bharatmala Pariyojana, a need was felt to prioritize works depending upon availability of resources. However, later on the decision has been reviewed and as of now there is no such restriction.(d)	The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways receives proposals from various State Governments including Government of Kerala for allocation of funds. Funds are allocated to the State Governments as per inter-se-priority, committed liabilities, progress of ongoing works and availability of funds.  (e)	During last three years, an aggregate length of about 183kms has been constructed in the State of Kerala.  An amount of about Rs.712 crores was allocated during last three years for development of NHs in the State of Kerala through State PWD.  Out of this, expenditure of about Rs.710 crores was incurred.  The fund allocated during last three years, for maintenance of NHs in the State of Kerala through State PWD was about Rs.311 crores out of which expenditure of about Rs. 220 crores was incurred. For the projects implemented through National Highways Authority of India, expenditure is incurred project-wise and no allocation of funds is made State-wise.*****
