                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):	Public health and hospitals being a State subject, the primary responsibility to ensure availability of human healthcare professionals in public health facilities lies with the State/UT Governments. However, under the National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their healthcare systems including support for engagement of doctors on contractual basis, based on the requirements posed by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) within their overall resource envelope. The Government has taken various steps to further increase the availability of human resource in the country which include:i.	Establishment of New Medical Colleges attached with district/referral hospitals in underserved districts of the country.ii.	Strengthening/ upgradation of existing State Government/Central Government Medical Colleges to increase MBBS and PG seats.iii.	Relaxation in the norms for setting up of Medical College in terms of requirement for faculty, staff, bed strength and other infrastructure.iv.	Minimum requirement of land for establishment of medical college in metropolitan cities as notified under Article 243P(c) of the Constitution of India has been dispensed with.v.	Enhancement of maximum intake capacity at MBBS level from 150 to 250.vi.	DNB qualification has been recognized for appointment as faculty to take care of shortage of faculty.vii.	Enhancement of age limit for appointment/ extension/ re-employment against posts of teachers/dean/principal/ director in medical colleges upto 70 years.viii.	The ratio of teachers to students for Professor has been revised from 1:1 to 1:2 for all MD/MS disciplines and 1:1 to 1:3 in all clinical subjects in Government funded medical colleges and in Private medical colleges with 15 years standing. Further, for Associate Professor, the said ratio has been revised from 1:1 to 1:2 and 1:3 if he/she is a unit head in all clinical subjects in Government medical colleges and in Private medical colleges with 15 years standing. This would result in increase in number of PG seats in the country.ix.	By amending the regulations, it has been made mandatory for all medical colleges to start PG courses within 3 years from the date of their MBBS recognition /continuation of recognition.x.	Colleges are allowed to apply for PG medical courses in clinical subjects at the time of 4th renewal. It will serve to advance the process for starting PG medical courses by more than 1 year.xi.	Provision has been made in the regulations to offer less number of seats to the applicant medical college, in case, it falls short of minimum prescribed requirements of applied intake to avoid wastage of human resources.xii.	A Consortium (a group of 2 or upto 4 private organizations) has been allowed to establish a medical college.xiii.	The requirement of land to construct building for School/College of Nursing and Hostel has been relaxed.xiv.	The requirement of a 100 beded parent hospital has been relaxed for hilly and tribal areas for School/College of Nursing and Hostel.xv.	The student teacher ratio for M.Sc(N) programme has been relaxed from 1:5 to 1:10.xvi.	Student patient ratio for Nursing Institutions has been relaxed from 1:5 to 1:3.xvii.	Distance from Nursing School to hospital has been relaxed from 15 km to 30 km . However, for hilly and tribal areas the maximum distance is 50 km.  Super speciality hospital can start M.Sc.(N) without having under graduate programme.(b) &(c): 	In the case of government medical colleges, the respective State governments are responsible for fixation of fee and in the case of private unaided medical colleges, the fee structure is decided by the Committee set up by the respective State Government under the Chairmanship of a retired High Court Judge in pursuance of the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. Clause (i) of Sub-section (1) of Section 10 of National Medical Commission Act, 2019 provides for framing of guidelines for determination of fees and all other charges in respect of fifty percent of seats in private medical institutions and deemed to be universities which are governed under the provisions of the Act.
