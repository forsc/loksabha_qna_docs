MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) and (b): The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has increased theexamination fees of class X and XII board examination 2020 for all students on no profitno loss principle as under:<pre>ClassExamination fee before fee hike Examination fee after fee hikeAll IndiaScheme (ForAll CBSEaffiliatedschools)Delhi Scheme.(SC/ST candidate ofGovt. & AidedSchools of Delhi only)Schools in India SC/STcandidates ofGovt. Schoolsof Delhi only10th 750/- 350/- (#) 1500/- 1200/- (*)12th 750/- 600/- (#) 1500/- 1200/- (*)(#) Out of examination fee of Rs.350/- for Class X and Rs.600/- for Class XII till 2019,only Rs.50/- was paid by SC/ST candidates of Govt.

Substantive increase in cost of paper, printing, transportation;? Increase in the cost of evaluation of answer copies and remuneration andTA/DA to the teachers/invigilators/evaluators;? CBSE has taken some specific measures for safe conduct of examinationswhich has increased the expenditure;? Now, CBSE is not conducting competitive/professional examinations likeNEET, JEE(M) and UGC(NET) examinations etc. any more. Earlieradditional resources from these examinations were used to subsidize theboard’s examinations;? CBSE is a self financed and self-reliant Board and generates its ownresources. It does not take any funds from the consolidated fund of Indiaor any other authority for its expenses; and? The CBSE is holding examinations all over the country and abroad in 25countries. Almost 5000 examinations centers are fixed in India and abroadand to ensure the smooth conduct of examination in all the centers, feeincrease was very essential.</pre>(c) and (d): No, Sir.(e): Does not arise.*****
