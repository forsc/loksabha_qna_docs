ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT (SUSHRI PRATIMA BHOUMIK)(a) to (c): The National Education Policy, 2020 focuses on continuity of common approach of equity and inclusion of persons with disabilities across school and higher education. Further, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 mandates reservation of not less than 5%  seats in Government/Government aided higher educational institutions for persons with benchmark disabilities (disability of 40% or more) including persons with visual and hearing impairment. 	This Ministry implements a scheme to provide financial assistance for existing deaf colleges in five regions of the country. There is no proposal in the Ministry for establishing special colleges for persons with visual impairment and persons with hearing impaired.  	Under Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme of the Ministry, financial assistance is provided to special schools for persons with hearing/visual/intellectual disabilities to enable them to pursue higher education in colleges in an inclusive setup. *****
