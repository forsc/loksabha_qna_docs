                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS,  HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a)	BharatNet project is being implemented in a phased manner to provide broadband connectivity to all the Gram Panchayats (approx. 2,50,000) in the country. As part of BharatNet project, the Last Mile connectivity, through Wi-Fi or any other suitable broadband technology to access broadband /internet services, is to be provided at all the 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats (GPs) in the country. Towards this end, provisioning of 2 Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) is under implementation in each of the GPs of BharatNet Phase-I. As of now, Wi-Fi hotspots have been installed in 45,769 Gram Panchayats (GPs), out of which services are being provided in 16,151 GPs. Further, 34,958 Fibre to the Home (FTTH) connections have also been provided. The State-wise details are given at Annexure-I.(b) to (d) 	BharatNet Network is being monitored through Network Operating Centre (NOC) and its reports are being monitored on a regular basis.  Further, the following steps have been taken for providing stable broadband connectivity from the BharatNet network in the country:•	The Digital Communications Commission (DCC) on 13.06.2019 has approved to award the work of maintenance (i.e. O&M of incremental Optical Fibre Cable network and First Line Maintenance of equipment and supporting infrastructure) in each of about 1.25 lakh GPs of the BharatNet Phase-I, to CSC e-Governance Services India Limited.•	The Operations & Maintenance (O&M) of BharatNet Phase-II network, is to be carried out mainly through the respective Project Implementation Agencies (PIA).For expediting the implementation and operationalisation of the project, the following committees have been constituted for timely resolution of the issues:i)	Empowered Committee under Secretary, Department of Telecommunications (DoT).ii)	Steering Committee under Administrator, Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF).iii)	State Level Implementation Committee chaired by Chief Secretary of the State would be set up which would have DoT/USOF/BBNL designated officials as its members.Operations & Maintenance of BharatNet is very challenging as the project is of mega nature and the GPs are widely dispersed across the country in rural and remote areas. However, Action is taken to rectify the faults expeditiously as and when they are reported. (e)	As on 29.11.2019, out of 27,909 GPs (approx.), a total of 15,269 GPs have been made Service Ready in Maharashtra.
