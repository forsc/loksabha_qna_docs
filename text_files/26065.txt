                                                        THE MINISTER FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) & (b)	The National Anti Doping Agency (NADA) has been set up by the Government as registered society under the Societies Registration Act of 1860 on November 24, 2005. The World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) requires its affiliate National Anti Doping Organisations to be independent in their operational decisions and activities from the government. Accordingly, NADA, which enjoys the recognition of the WADA, is autonomous and independent in its operational decisions and activities from the government. The Government, which fully funds the NADA, oversees the  non-operational activities of NADA with a view to meet the obligations imposed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization’s (UNESCO’s) International Convention against Doping in Sport, to which India is a signatory.*****
