As per programme guidelines, the unit of this programme is a habitation and not a Gram Panchayat. The fund for implementation of the scheme is released by the Ministry to the state as whole.

The allocation of funds to the State for implementation of PMGSY depends, inter-alia, on works in hand, execution capacity of the State and unspent balance of previous year(s) available with the State. The block-wise and district wise list of road sanctioned, completed and ongoing projects can be accessed at programme website: www.omms.nic.in => proposals => state wise list of roads.
