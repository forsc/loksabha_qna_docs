ANSWER




                                                        The MINISTER OF LAW & JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a)	to (e) Digital technology has been effectively harnessed in the realm of legal aid. The government has launched the Tele-Law programme since 2017 which has provided an effective and reliable e-interface platform connecting the needy and disadvantaged sections including rural populace seeking legal advice. Tele-Law aims to provide legal advice at the pre-litigation stage to the beneficiary by connecting them with Panel Lawyers via video conferencing and telephone facilities which are available at the Common Service Centers (CSC) at Panchayat level. This service is free for persons entitled under Section 12 of Legal Services Authorities (LSA), Act 1987 and for others by paying Rs 30/- per consultation. Tele-Law programme is presently operational in 29,860 CSCs in 285 Districts across 29 States/UTs. As on 31st December, 2020, 5,26,132 advice have been enabled under the programme. Another notable measure has been integration of technology to move Lok Adalat to the virtual platform. E-Lok Adalats have been organized in 24 States/UTs. As on 09.01.2021, more than 4.07 lakh cases have been disposed of by these E-Lok Adalats.********
