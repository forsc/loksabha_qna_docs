As per the information received from the State Government of Maharashtra, Terna Shetkari Sahkari Sugar Factory, Ternanagar, Osmanabad, Maharashtra is lying closed due to heavy loss and weak financial position and has been taken into liquidation on 20/11/2017.  The Central Government with a view to encourage setting up of new sugar mills in the country has de-licensed the sugar industry.  Now, it is the responsibility of the concerned cooperative society to take necessary steps to re-open/revive the closed sugar mills of the cooperative sector. (c) to(e):      As per the information received from the State Government of Maharashtra, Assistant Provident Fund Commissioner, Regional Office, Solapur has attached property of the sugar factory on 28/9/2015 for the recovery of provident fund dues of the employees. The liquidator of the sugar factory has challenged recovery of provident fund dues before Hon’ble High Court and the process of sale of property of sugar factory i.e. e-tender process is stayed by Court order. Osmanabad District Co-operative Bank has filed Writ Petition No. 7909/2019 for permission to give sugar mill on lease basis. But the said petition is still pending in the Hon’ble High Court. The matter is subjudice. However, as informed by the State Government, the possibility of reopening of sugar factory can be decided, subject to decision of the petitions filed in the Hon’ble High Court, Mumbai, Aurangabad bench. ****
