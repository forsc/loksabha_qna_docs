ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)  Provision of Urban Amenities in Rural Areas (PURA) was implemented in a pilot mode in seven clusters by selecting one cluster each in the State of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Maharashtra, Orissa, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh for a period of three years (PURA-1.0 2004-05 to 2006-07).  In Bihar it was implemented in Motipur cluster, district Muzaffarpur.  No cluster was allocated to Gopalganj District of the State of Bihar. The scheme was restructured in 2010 and was being implemented in eight Districts of five States, namely, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttrakhand.  The scheme aimed at holistic and accelerated development of compact areas around a potential growth centre in Gram Panchayat(s) through Public Private Partnership (PPP) framework for providing livelihood opportunities and urban amenities to improve the quality of life in rural areas. The primary objective of the scheme was to provide  livelihood opportunities and urban amenities in rural areas to bridge the rural – urban divide. The salient features of the scheme were as below: (i)	Convergence of Central and State Government schemes.(ii)	Implementation in project mode and life cycle cost approach.(iii)	Implementation through a single private partner to ensure simultaneous delivery of key infrastructure required in villages leading to optimal use of resources.(iv)	Selection of clusters by private partner be based on economic viability coupled with need of development of the area.(v)	Agreement between Gram Panchayat and the private partner that makes the restructured PURA a model for empowerment of Gram Panchayats and public accountability.(b)   Under the scheme the Private Partner, selected to undertake PURA projects, was to identify a Gram Panchayat or a cluster of geographically contiguous Gram Panchayats for a population of about 25,000–40,000. There could be sub-projects to cover each of the Panchayats within the cluster, or a single large Panchayat could individually provide critical mass to make the project viable.  In the identified PURA area, the Private Partner was to plan and put up an implementation action plan for different projects/ sub-projects of PURA.  (c)  	The scheme had been discontinued with effect from 2015-16.*****
