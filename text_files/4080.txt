ANSWER




MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D. V. SADANANDA GOWDA)            (a) The Research & Development work in the field of Pharmaceuticals is being carried out various Ministries/Departments/Agencies including the Department of Pharmaceuticals, Department of Health & Family Welfare, Department of Biotechnology, Department of Health Research, Ministry of Science & Technology, Ministry of Ayush, Department of Higher Education, Council of Scientific & Industrial Research, Indian Council of Medical Research etc. under their various schemes and programmes. Lack of coordination amongst various agencies carrying out research & development is a constraint.  (b)	The Government has set up seven National Institutes of Pharmaceutical Education & Research (NIPERs) at Ahmedabad, Guwahati, Hajipur, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Raebareli and SAS Nagar (Mohali) as Institutes of national importance. These Institutes provide postgraduate and doctorate education and conduct research in various specializations of pharmaceutics. NIPER SAS Nagar (Mohali) was the first Institute to be set up in the year 1998 and it has a fully residential campus, well qualified regular faculty and state of art laboratories.  In case of other six NIPERs, the Expenditure Finance Committee in March, 2018 has approved Rs. 959.53 cr. for construction of regular campuses of NIPERs at Ahmedabad and Guwahati and setting up of well-equipped laboratories and create/ fill regular faculty and non-faculty posts in all six NIPERs. Presently, NIPERs at SAS Nagar (Mohali), Hyderabad and Ahmedabad are ranked as number three, six and nine respectively under the ‘Pharmacy’ category in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2019 of the Ministry of Human Resource Development. (c)	In order to periodically review and coordinate research being carried out by various Ministries/ Department/ Agencies in a collaborative, synchronized and synergized way for optimum utilization of funds allocated for the purpose and to ensure no overlapping and duplication of efforts and resources, the Government has constituted an Inter- Departmental Committee (IDC) on 9th January, 2019 to institutionalize a robust mechanism to ensure economy, efficiency, effectiveness and transparency in the arena of Pharmaceutical research. *****
