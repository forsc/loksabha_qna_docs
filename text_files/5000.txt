ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b) There is a serious academic competition. Students have a difficult time with thedemands of classes, grades, choice of subjects and parental pressure. AccordinglyUniversity Grants Commission (UGC) notified Guidelines on “Safety of Students on andoff Campuses of Higher Education Institutions” dated 06.04.2015. These Guidelines arealso uploaded on UGC website (www.ugc.ac.in).Further in January 2016 UGC asked allUniversities to set up a student counseling system to deal with the problems whichstudents might face. Indian Institute of Technology (IITs) have been taking various stepsas peer assisted learning, special languages classes for week students in order to easethe academic stress. In addition, IITs conduct workshops/ seminars on happiness andwellness, regular sessions on Yoga, induction programs, extracurricular activitiesincluding sports and cultural activities and appointment of Student Counselors foroverall personality development and de-stressing students.Since ragging also affects the mental well being of students, in 2009, UGCregulation on curbing the menace of ragging in Higher Educational Institutions wasmade. These regulations have been further amended in 2016 by enlarging the definitionof ragging. These regulations are to be followed by all higher educational institutions.The Ministry allocates Rs 5 crore every year to the UGC for undertaking publicitycampaigns against ragging in Higher Educational Institutions in the country. An Anti-Ragging toll free ‘helpline’ 1800-180-5522 in 12 languages has been made operationalby the UGC with call centre facilities for helping victims of ragging, besides facilitatingeffective coordinated action by all concerned.In order to make education more relevant and to create skilled workforce foremployment, University Grants Commission (UGC) has implemented three schemes i.e.Community College, B.Voc and Deen Dayal Upadhyay Kaushal Kendra under NationalSkill Qualification Framework. These schemes facilitate close interaction between theinstitutions offering skill-based courses and the service industry. In addition, All IndiaCouncil of Technical Education implements Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojna fortechnical institution (PMKVY-TI) to train youth in professional skills through approvedtechnical institutions.Bachelor of Vocation (B.Voc.) studies programme introduced in 162 institutionsof higher learning in 80 trades with intake of 17600 students. Deen Dayal UpadhyayaKaushal Kendras have been approved by the UGC in 64 universities and colleges. Thesecentres function as the apex centres for skill development in Universities and colleges.The Community Colleges offer credit based courses which allows multi-point entry andexit for skill up-gradation or employment market, banking on credits and allows re-entryinto the higher education.. Under the scheme through University Grants Commission(UGC) and All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) put together, a total of 273institutions (mainly polytechnics) are offering skill courses in about 83 trades. Thecourses are aligned as per NSQF from 3 to 5. UGC has enrolled 12440 students so far, ofwhom 9330 students have been placed successfully.***
