ANSWER




(a) & (b):     Yes Sir.     The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) played a crucial role in ensuring the availability of essential drugs at reasonable prices during the COVID-19 pandemic. The situation arising due to COVID-19 has been closely monitored by the NPPA. Timely and effective steps were taken to ensure no shortage of drugs during the lockdown period throughout the country. To ensure seamless availability of drugs, the NPPA set up a ‘Control Room’ with Helpline No. 1800111255 and issues like non-availability of medicines, masks, gloves, hand sanitizers etc., and price violation of medicines, masks, gloves, hand sanitizers, etc., were resolved promptly. Also, a COVID-19 dashboard on the NPPA’s website (www.nppaindia.nic.in) having latest office orders, circulars, helpline no., Email for sending grievances etc., was created for convenience of public and other stakeholders.             An Inter-ministerial Empowered Committee was constituted vide order dated 26.03.2020 to make recommendations for export of drugs/items requested by foreign Governments. This committee also monitors the availability and supply of COVID-19 treatment drugs. The NPPA worked as a Secretariat to this Inter-ministerial empowered committee. The NPPA has ensured the availability of drugs by coordinating with State Health Authorities like SDCs and Central Govt. Authorities like the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), Director General of Health Services (DGHS), Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) etc. The NPPA collected the critical information from drug manufacturers used in decision making to ensure drug availability. The NPPA has taken steps to ensure the availability of Heparin used in COVID treatment. Further, on intervention in the issue of price-parity of N-95 Masks by the NPPA, major manufacturers/importers of N-95 Masks have reduced their prices significantly up to 67%. The NPPA also coordinated issues related to production of raw material, medicines, medical devices, packaging material, etc. by manufacturers and movement of raw material, packing material, finished goods and manpower etc. to availability of life saving essential drugs during the lockdown. The NPPA has taken various steps to ensure the availability of life saving essential drugs like Hydroxychloroquine, Paracetamol, Vaccines, Anti-Tuberculosis drugs, Anti-diabetic drugs, cardiac drugs, imported Anti-epileptic drugs and COVID-19 drugs like FDC Lopinovir& Ritonavir, Remidesivir, Favipiravir, Zinc Sulphate, Mythyleprednisolone, Enoxparin, Dexamethasone etc.             Further, on the intervention of the NPPA and the Drugs Controller General of India , DCG(I), manufacturers of Remdesivir have created a Helpline to make available the remdesivir. However, both these drugs are not part of Covid-19 Protocol and continue as under investigational therapy Drugs. The details of various steps taken by the NPPA are at Annexure 1. The state-wise details of steps taken is not available, however in respect of West Bengal, the NPPA received 34 number of calls on its control room which were resolved promptly. (c) & (d):   The NPPA has set up a Control Room to prevent any shortage of medicines during COVID-19 pandemic and resolve public grievances. The details of the Control Room are at Annexure 2. (e):       Based on information received from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) till 09.06.2020 (Till Hydroxychloroquine and Paracetamol were under export restriction), exemptions were granted to export Hydroxychloroquine to 114 Countries and to export Paracetamol to 24 countries. Details are as following:- S.No.	Drug	API1	Hydroxychloroquine	44,783.34 Kgs (44.79 MT), 39,72,10,290 Tablets2.
