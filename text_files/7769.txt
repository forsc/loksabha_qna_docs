ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF MINES, COAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a): 	Yes, Sir. NALCO exports two types of products to the overseas markets, i.e., Calcined Alumina and Aluminium metal. (i)	 In case of Alumina, the export plan is finalised based on two factors:-  Total Calcined Alumina production by NALCO’s Alumina Refinery.-  Alumina requirement in NALCO’s Smelter Plant for Aluminium metal production.Upon meeting the production requirements of the Smelter Plant, and selling a small quantity in the domestic market, the entire surplus quantity of Alumina is exported to overseas markets. Therefore, the quantity of Calcined Alumina being exported is already maximised.(ii)	In case of Aluminium metal, the export plan is based on the metal availability after fulfilling all supply commitments in the Domestic market. Thus, higher export quantity is planned in case higher quantity of metal is available after meeting the entire domestic demand.(b)	The export performance of NALCO during the last three years (FY 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19) is as under:Sl. No.	Description	2016-17	2017-18	2018-191.	Calcined Alumina Exports (in MT)	1,243,103	1,276,775	1,244,2562.	Aluminium Exports (in MT)	100,591	75,847	38,463(c )	For the Financial Year (FY) 2019-20, NALCO’s Export sales target has been fixed higher as compared to that of FY 2018-19 in both Alumina as well as Aluminium metal.(d)  	The tentative Export sales target for the Financial Year 2019-20 is tabulated hereunder:Sl. No.	Description	Export Target (approx.)1.	Calcined Alumina Exports (in MT)	1,266,0002.	Aluminium Exports (in MT)	61,500*****
