The Act provides for coverage of up to 75% of the rural population and up to 50% of the urban population for receiving foodgrains (rice, wheat & coarse grains) at highly subsidized rates i.e. Rs. 3/2/1 per kg respectively. Under the Act, eligible families are categorized into Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) families and Priority Households (PHH). About 80 Crore persons are presently covered to receive subsidized foodgrains through PDS across the country.          The total foodgrain allocation to State of Gujarat for the year 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 (upto May, 2019) are 21.79 LMT, 23.67 LMT, 23.79 LMT and 3.96 LMT respectively....2/--2-In Gujarat, about 3.82 crore persons are covered under NFSA. Nearly 66.26 lakh NFSA ration cards are active in Gujarat during 2019-20. This includes 8.08 lakh AAY ration cards and 58.18 lakh PHH ration cards. BPL category does not exist under NFSA.(d): 	To improve the efficiency and introduce transparency in Public Distribution System (PDS) operations, Government is implementing a scheme on ''End-to-End Computerization of PDS Operations’. Under the scheme, digitization of ration cards/beneficiaries database, setting up of transparency portals and grievance redressal mechanisms have been completed in all States/UTs. Online allocation has been implemented in all States/UTs and computerization of supply chain management has been completed in 26 States/UTs.  Automation of Fair Price Shops (FPSs) by use of electronic point of sale (ePoS) devices is also being done in all States/UTs. So far, about 4.12 lakh FPSs out of 5.34 lakh FPSs across the country (including all FPSs of Gujarat) have operational ePoS devices.         Besides, a new central sector scheme ‘Integrated Management of PDS’ (IM-PDS) is being implemented for establishing Public Distribution System Network (PDSN) to implement national level portability of ration cards/beneficiaries, national level de-duplication, Central Data Repository and Central Monitoring of PDS Operations.****
