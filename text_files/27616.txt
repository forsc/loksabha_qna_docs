MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (d) The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)’s present set of textbooks and academic materials have been prepared based on the National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005. The NCERT, as a regular activity, update their textbooks before these are reprinted every year keeping in view the comments, suggestions and grievances received from different stakeholders. The Central Board of Secondary Education follows the textbooks developed by the NCERT. Further, cconsequent upon the announcement of the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020, a new NCF is under preparation, which will be followed by development of new textbooks in all subjects, after extensive research and consultation. So far as the textbooks and academic materials published by the State Education Boards are concerned, it is for the respective State Government to take care of the contents of the textbooks and academic materials published by them.*****
