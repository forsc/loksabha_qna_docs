                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a):  	A Statement indicating the State/Union Territory (UT)-wise number of beneficiaries covered under the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) is at Annexure-I and a statement indicating the district wise (including Alwar and Sikar Districts) number of beneficiaries in Rajasthan covered under the Act is at Annexure-II.(b):   The NFSA provides for coverage upto 75% of rural population and upto 50% of urban population for receiving highly subsidized foodgrains under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), thus covering about two-thirds of the total population.  Corresponding to the all India coverage of 75% and 50% in the rural and urban areas, State-wise coverage was determined by the then Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog) by using the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) Household Consumption Expenditure Survey data for 2011-12.......2/--2-          At present, against the intended coverage of 81.35 crore, about 80.60 crore beneficiaries are identified by the States/UTs under the Act. No proposal for revision in State/UT-wise coverage is under consideration of the Government.(c):   Foodgrains at subsidized prices is made available by Food Corporation of India (FCI) to the States/UTs under the NFSA, for which food subsidy is released to FCI. Only in the case of States participating in the Decentralized Procurement (DCP), under which State Government take responsibility of procurement of foodgrains and its distribution to the eligible households, that food subsidy is released directly to State Governments. Ministry of Finance allocates scheme-wise fund as a whole. There is no State-wise fund allocation for Food Subsidy. A Statement indicating the fund allocated and released to FCI and DCP States under this scheme is at Annexure-III.           Central Government also provides Central assistance to States/UTs under NFSA for meeting expenditure on intra-State movement and handling of foodgrains and fair price shop dealers’ margin as per approved norms. A statement indicating the funds released to States/UTs under this scheme is at Annexure-IV.**** ANNEXURE-1ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN PART (a) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1400 FOR ANSWER ON 20.09.2020 IN THE LOK SABHAState-wise number of beneficiaries covered under the National Food Security Act, 2013 S.No.	Name of States/UTs	Number of beneficiaries covered under NFSA (In lakh)		September, 2018	September, 2019	September, 20201	Andhra Pradesh	268.23	268.23	268.232	Arunachal Pradesh	8.21	8.21	8.213	Assam	251.63	251.63	251.534	Bihar	857.12	857.12	871.16345	Chhattisgarh	200.77	200.77	200.776	Delhi	72.73	72.73	72.737	Goa	5.32	5.32	5.328	Gujarat	382.54	382.54	382.549	Haryana	126.49	126.49	126.4910	Himachal Pradesh 	28.64	28.64	28.6411	Jharkhand	263.70	263.70	263.7012	Karnataka 	401.93	401.93	401.9313	Kerala	154.80	154.80	154.8014	Madhya Pradesh	546.42	546.42	546.4215	Maharashtra	700.17	700.17	700.1716	Manipur	22.44	24.31	24.6717	Meghalaya	21.40	21.46	21.4618	Mizoram	6.68	6.68	6.6819	Nagaland	14.05	14.05	14.0520	Odisha	323.60	323.60	323.6021	Punjab	141.45	141.45	141.4522	Rajasthan	446.62	446.62	446.6223	Sikkim	3.79	3.79	3.7924	Tamil Nadu	357.34	357.34	364.6925	Telangana 	191.62	191.62	191.6226	Tripura	24.83	24.83	24.8327	Uttar Pradesh	1499.83	1390.98	1464.2828	Uttarakhand	61.96	61.96	61.9429	West Bengal	601.84	601.84	601.8430	A&N	0.59	0.58	0.6131	DNHⅅ	3.00	2.91	2.5232	Lakshadweep	0.22	0.22	0.2233	Chandigarh (DBT)	2.80	2.79	2.7934	Puducherry (DBT)	6.16	6.15	6.3035	J&K	74.13	74.13	72.4136	Ladakh			1.44Total 	8073.047966.018060.45*****’/ ANNEXURE-IIANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN PART (a) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1400 FOR ANSWER ON 20.09.2020 IN THE LOK SABHADistrict wise number of beneficiaries covered under NFSA in RajasthanSr. No	District	NFSA Beneficiary		As on 01.09.2018	As on 01.09.2019	As on 01.09.20201	Ajmer	1686253	1768050	17359202	Alwar	2717527	2831766	28985533	Banswara	1726344	1727317	16817784	Baran	981395	1042968	10623695	Barmer	1906357	1949382	19831476	Bharatpur	1651056	1718361	17180567	Bhilwara	1560574	1661519	17045308	Bikaner	1424336	1458471	14626119	Bundi	711163	800220	82447010	Chittaurgarh	1041470	1063446	101476211	Churu	1395050	1455594	147500812	Dausa	1179400	1248554	125297013	Dhalpur	888357	942096	94963014	Dungarpur	1373209	1384619	136627115	Ganganagar	1184137	1237307	124329716	Hanumangarh	1011244	1086035	108867717	Jaipur	3055847	3217687	341689518	Jaisalmer	425006	450228	45707319	Jalor	1211531	1242909	128797520	Jhalawar	1151913	1202395	120230121	Jhunjhunun	1164992	1329224	143418622	Jodhpur	2083621	2262312	239042323	Karauli	1031097	1064529	106095424	Kota	1012439	1055579	108179525	Nagaur	2395751	2563060	257324626	Pali	1374352	1442943	143580127	Paratapgarh	773233	789154	77442028	Rajsamand	860700	926052	96417429	SawaiMadhopur	879738	915840	92426730	Sikar	1804020	1900646	193133231	Sirohi	831249	848554	85556432	Tonk	1009173	1084904	109120433	Udaipur	2609342	2580200	2545920****ANNEXURE-IIIANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN PART (c) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1400 FOR ANSWER ON 20.09.2020 IN THE LOK SABHAFund allocated and subsidy released during financial year 2019-20 & 2020-21(Rs. in crores) 	Food Corporation of India	Decentralized  Procurement StatesYear	Fund Allocated	subsidy released	Fund Allocated	Subsidy released2019-20	75000	75000	33508.35	44944.35*2020-21 (upto 14.09.2020).	77982.54	48000	37337.14	33013.36***Over & Above, Rs 44,164.02 crores in FY 2019-20 released from food subsidy has been adjusted for repayment of National Small Saving Fund(NSSF) loan.**The RE, 2019-20 was Rs. 33508.35 crore.
