NCRB has published reports upto 2019 which are available on its website. The State-wise number of suicide committed by farmers, as per NCRB Report 2017 to 2019, is at Annexure.          In the ADSI Report 2019, the reasons for farmers’ suicide have not been given. However, the causes of suicides by persons (including farmers) are ‘Family Problems’, ‘Illness’, ‘Drug Abuse/ Addiction’, ‘Marriage Related Issues’, ‘Love Affairs’, ‘Bankruptcy or Indebtedness’, ‘Failure in Examination’, ‘Unemployment’, ‘Professional/Career Problem’  and ‘Property Dispute’.(d) & (e): 	Under the Agriculture Loan Waiver and Debt Relief Scheme announced in the Union Budget 2008-09, 3.73 crore farmers of different states were benefitted for an amount of Rs 52,259.86 crore. Since all the farmers are not covered under institutional credit, only a few farmers were benefited from the loan waiver scheme.
