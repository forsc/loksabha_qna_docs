ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) FOR NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY, POWER and MoS for  SKILL DEVELOPMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP(SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) The metering methodology and settlement of power exported to grid from a rooftop solar plant installed by industrial and commercial consumers in the states/UTs are governed by regulations notified by the respective Electricity Regulatory Commission. In some states the surplus power after settlement of net-metring is not purchased by DISCOMs and such surplus power exported to the grid is not accounted. Similarly, some states do not have provision to mandatorily install solar power generation meter and it is not possible to measure the solar power consumed internally by the consumer. Therefore, exact amount of electricity exported into the grid and used by commercial and industrial units having solar rooftop plants are not available for all the states. (b) The DISCOMs are purchasing the solar power exported from rooftop solar plant installed by commercial and industrial units on the basis of regulations and tariff fixed by the respective Electricity Regulatory Commission. The amount of money spent by them on such purchase varies from year to year.(c) The amount of money that will be saved/spent by DISCOMs by replacing ‘Net metering ‘with the ‘Gross Metering ‘mechanism of disbursal for commercial and industrial units having solar rooftop solar plants would depend upon the regulations and tariff determined for the gross metering by the respective Electricity Regulatory Commission.(d) The Government has set a target of reaching 100 GW of solar power capacity in the country by 2022 and as on 31.12.2020 a total solar power capacity of 37.5 GW is reported installed, 36.69 GW is under installation and 18.46 GW is under bid. The installed Roof Top capacity is 3730 MW, which is 10 percent of the current installed capacity of Solar. (e) Considering average cost of installation of rooftop solar plant as Rs. 5 Cr /MW, the total investment made for installation of 3.73 GW rooftop solar capacity as on 31.12.2020 would be Rs. 18650 Cr.*****
