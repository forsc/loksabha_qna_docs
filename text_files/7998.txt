SINGH) (a) to (d) :	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.                                        ***********            STATEMENTSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF STARRED QUESTION NO.145 TO BE ANSWERED IN THE LOK SABHA ON 28.11.2019 REGARDING SUPPLY OF POWER ON CREDIT.*********(a) to (d) : 	As per PRAAPTI Portal, as on 30th September, 2019, the over dues outstanding amount of generating companies payable by Distribution Licensee has increased to around Rs.65,000/- crore.  To make the power sector sustainable, it is essential that the distribution licensees pay for the power they buy.  If they don’t pay in time, the generating company will not be able to buy coal as coal is supplied only on advance payment under cash and carry policy of Coal India Limited. 		In order to correct the situation, the Government have directed that the provisions of the Power Purchase Agreements signed between the distribution licensees and the generating company for making payments for the power purchase and opening of the Letter of credit (LC) be adhered to. 		The Government cannot remove any condition in PPA as the PPA are sacrosanct and is signed by distribution company and the generating company.  Government is not a party to any PPA.                                           *************
