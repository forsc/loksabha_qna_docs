                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b): 	In order to increase the production and productivity of various crops, the Government of India has already been implementing several crop development programmes such as National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), Sub-Mission on Seeds and Planting Material (SMSP), Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanisation (SMAM), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY),  etc. under the Umbrella scheme, “Green Revolution- Krishonnati Yojana”.  (c) to (e): The  Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme is a continuous and ongoing scheme, in which the financial benefit is transferred to the bank accounts of the identified beneficiaries in the States / UTs as and when their correct and verified data is uploaded by the concerned States / UTs on PM-KISAN web-portal. Many States / UTs have not been able to upload the requisite data on the portal due to which it has not been possible to transfer the benefit to the farmers in those states. The 1st installment of Rs. 2000/- out of the assured amount of Rs. 6,000/- per year under the scheme has already been credited into the bank accounts of 3,95,55,934 beneficiaries and 2nd installment of Rs. 2000/- each to 3,12,69,025 beneficiaries in the country. In the state of Chhattisgarh, out of 39,77,327 number of estimated land holdings 17,79,431 data of eligible beneficiaries were uploaded on the PM-KISAN portal. Out of which 10,47,733 have been accepted. Accordingly, 3,47,253 beneficiaries have received the 1st installment and 1,11,768 beneficiaries received 2nd installment so far.  Out of Public Finance Management System (PFMS) approved, benefit will be released after Request for Fund Transfer (RFT) is signed by the state. ********
