ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) to (e) Opening of new Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) is a continuous process. KVs are opened primarily to cater to the educational needs of the wards of transferable Central Government Employees including Defence & Para-Military personnel, Central Autonomous Bodies, Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and Central Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) by providing a common programme of education. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations and committing resources for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from varioussponsoring authorities found fulfilling the mandatory pre-requisites for opening of new KVs have to compete with other such proposals under the “Challenge Method” and subject to approval of the competent authority. KVs are not opened on the criteria of district wise or Parliamentary Constituency wise. However, it is not possible to add another shift in existing KVs, as approval is for single shift only. At present, 122 KVs (including 4 in Gautam Buddh Nagar Parliamentary Constituency) are functioning in the State of Uttar Pradesh.(f) Samagra Shiksha is an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education. Under the Information & Communication Technology (ICT) component of the Scheme, there is a provision to impart computer literacy and computer enabled learning to children across the country. It supports establishment of smart classrooms and ICT labs in schools, including support for hardware, educational software and e-content for teaching. It envisages covering all Government / Government-aided schools with classes VI to XII.The financial provision for Smart Classrooms includes a non-recurring grant for Smart Class rooms (2 smart classrooms per school) of Rs. 2.40 lakh and the recurring grant of Rs. 0.38 lakh, including E Content and Digital Resources, charges for electricity. The State may also use Solar Power-Hybrid system instead, to ensure Sustainability and Internet connectivity (Tele communications / satellite communication / OFC). Total 111 schools have been approved for Smart Classrooms in 2021-22 with a financial outlay of Rs. 266.40 lakhs in Jaunpur district, Uttar Pradesh.*****
