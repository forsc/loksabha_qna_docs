ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):		Yes Sir, the production of horticulture crops has increased in recent years in the country.(b):		The details of production of potatoes, tomatoes and onions during the years 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 is as under:-			Production in Lakh TonnesHorticulture Crops	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19 (3rd Adv. Est.)Potato	486.05	513.10	530.27Tomato	207.08	197.59	193.97Onion	224.27	232.62	234.85(c) & (d): 	Horticulture crops are usually remunerative. However, in few cases, where the production has been bumper and the prices are non-remunerative, Government is implementing a Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) for procurement of agricultural and horticultural commodities which are perishable in nature and are not covered under the price support scheme (PSS).  The objective of intervention is to protect the growers of these commodities from making distress sale in the event of bumper crop during the peak arrival period when the prices tend to fall below economic levels and cost of production.*******
