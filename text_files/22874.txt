                                                        ANSWERMINISTER FOR MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND MINISTRY OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a)	to (d): A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT LAID ON THE TABLE OF THE LOK SABHA IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (d) TO THE STARRED QUESTION NO. *343(3RD Position) REGARDING LANDSLIDE SUSCEPTIBILITY MAPPING TO BE ANSWERED ON FRIDAY, MARCH 19, 2021.(a)	Yes Sir. Geological Survey of India (GSI) has collected data of 3656 nos. of major landslides that occurred during the last five years in different States/ UT, which have impacted lives and/ or infrastructure. These landslide data were collected by GSI through onsite field investigations under the Post-Disaster Studies programme taken up annually by GSI in all the landslide prone States/ UT as per GSI’s Standard Operating Procedure, mainly in response to the requests received from the concerned State Governments.(b)	The state-wise details of 3656 major landslide incidences, collected so far have been tabulated below. For all these landslides, during field validation, GSI collected vital preliminary geoparametric attributes for each of the landslides, including studying its impacts, future vulnerability, and indicating the requirements for future detailed geoscientific investigations, if any. All the above data are also used for updating GSI’s existing national landslide inventory.Landslides occurred and studied during the period 2014-2020State Name	Number of landslidesArunachal Pradesh	33Assam	120Meghalaya	32Mizoram	14Tripura	10Manipur	20Nagaland	34Sikkim	20Himachal Pradesh	97Jammu & Kashmir (UT)	169Uttarakhand	27Karnataka	194Tamil Nadu	196Kerala	2238Maharashtra	78West Bengal	374Total	3656(c) – (d)   The National Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (NLSM) project was launched by GSI after the 2013 Uttarakhand disaster as per the directive of the Technical Advisory committee (TAC). With the NLSM mapping, GSI has prepared 1: 50,000 scale landslide susceptibility map of 85% of the total target area (3.63 lakh sq. km. out of 4.2 lakh sq. km.) in different landslide prone States/ UTs. The work for the remaining area in Arunachal Pradesh is under execution and will be completed by Field Station (FS) 2021-22. During NLSM, GSI also collected historical information on 61287 nos. of landslides polygons using both Remote Sensing (RS) and field-based source data, out of which, 28831 landslides have already been field validated by GSI (Annexure-I). This huge historical national landslide inventory is continuously being updated with the new landslide data collected year-wise as part of Post-disaster studies. Landslide Susceptibility Mapping is a specific multi-thematic geoscientific mapping exercise, carried out primarily by the specialised technical resources of Geological Survey of India. In this geoscientific endeavour, the State Government has no specific role in mapping, other than reporting information of any new landslide incidence impacting lives and infrastructure, if any to GSI. While preparing the landslide susceptibility maps and updating the national landslide inventory, GSI duly considers those landslide occurrences too that are reported by any State Government. The Geographic Information System (GIS) enabled NLSM outputs – the landslide susceptibility and national landslide inventory map are already shared through Web Map Service (WMS) with NDMA, with a request to share such vital geo-data with all the landslide prone States/ UTs and other relevant stakeholders, for integrating the same in their respective landslide disaster management plans, and also for using in land-use zoning regulations in their respective landslide prone terrains. The above geo-data is also uploaded in GSI’s Bhukosh map portal (https://bhukosh.gsi.gov.in/Bhukosh/MapViewer.aspx) as “NLSM” and “Landslide Inventory” map services for free downloading by any stakeholder. Till date, 753 registered non-GSI users from 412 different affiliations have so far downloaded the above vital landslide geodata by raising 7118 different online requests to GSI in Bhukosh. In addition, the NLSM outputs also delineates the critical and problematic areas, where further up-scaled and detailed geoscientific studies are required for undertaking site specific effective remediation and mitigation by the concerned State Governments and other relevant stakeholders (e.g., road/ rail construction and maintenance authorities).ANNEXURE-IStatus National Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (NLSM) Programme 2014-2020State/ UT	Target area proposed (km2)	Target area completed so far (km2)	Landslide polygons mapped (Nos.)
