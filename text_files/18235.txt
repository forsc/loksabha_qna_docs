ANSWER




                                                        (a)	 The tender for construction of the new Parliament Building is under scrutiny while architectural plans for other buildings are under planning stage.  The estimated cost for Construction of new Parliament Building is Rs 971 crore. Estimated cost of other buildings and development / redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue shall be worked out after finalization of plans.(b)	 The existing Parliament House Building was started in 1921 and commissioned in 1927; thus building is already 93 years old and has since been declared heritage grade-I building. Its facilities and amenities are highly inadequate to meet the current demand of the Parliament. There is acute shortage of office space and there are no individual chambers for Members of Parliament. This building was not              meant  to  be for  bicameral  Parliament  and  has  been  over-stressed through large scale retrofitting done over the years. The other buildings on the Central Vista were built after independence, i.e. Krishi Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan etc. These buildings are more than 50 years old and there is shortage of working space, parking, amenities and services in these buildings for efficient office atmosphere. The spread of Central Government Ministries and Departments in different locations leads to inefficiency and the problems can be resolved by developing a Common Central Secretariat. The Central Vista, which is the main boulevard of New Delhi extending from Rashtrapati Bhawan to India Gate, is one of the most visited tourist places in Delhi. It is used for Republic Day Parade and various other functions which showcase the capital to the world. However, it lacks basic public facilities, amenities and parking etc. The unorganized vending and haphazard parking leads to congestion and gives a poor public perception. Therefore, there is a need for its up-gradation of the central vista.  In the current economic scenario, the project shall generate large number of direct and indirect employment which could be an important fulcrum for economic revival.(c) The Consultancy work for development/ redevelopment of the Central Vista has been awarded to HCP Design Planning and Management Pvt. Ltd. through a quality-cum-cost based (QCBS) tendering system followed by Central Public Works Department (CPWD).The tender for construction of new Parliament Building have been invited through open competitive bidding.  M/s TATA Projects Ltd emerged as the lowest tenderer with quoted amount of Rs. 861.91 Crore.                      *****
