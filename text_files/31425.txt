ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a): 	The estimation of poverty using poverty line had been done by the erstwhile Planning Commission based on the large sample surveys on household consumer expenditure carried out by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). The last poverty estimates were released by the erstwhile Planning Commission following the methodology recommended by Tendulkar Committee for the year 2011-12 through a press note. The poverty line was defined on the basis of monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) as the criterion. For the year 2011-12, the poverty line at all India level has been estimated as Rs. 816 for rural areas and Rs.1000 for urban areas. The number of persons living below the poverty line in 2011-12 were estimated at 27 crore (21.9%). (b) to (d):  Recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of poverty, Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011 (SECC 2011) was conducted in association with the States/UTs under technical and financial support from the Government of India. SECC-2011 provides data of households on various aspects of their socio-economic status viz., housing, landholding/ landlessness, educational status, status of women, the differently abled, occupation, possession of assets, scheduled caste/ scheduled tribe (SC/ST) households, income, etc.     	In November 2021, NITI Aayog has released the "National Multidimensional Poverty Index: Baseline Report" based on National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) of 2015-16, which captures multiple deprivations faced by households across the three macro dimensions of health including nutrition, education and living standards.******
