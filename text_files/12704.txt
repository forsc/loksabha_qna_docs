ANSWER




(a):	There is no provision in Drugs (Prices Control), 2013 (DPCO, 2013) to examine and regulate the actual cost of production of medicines with reference to the ceiling prices / retail prices, as it follows a market based methodology and not cost-based one.(b):	No, Sir. As per para 2(j) of DPCO, 2013 generic version of a medicine means “a formulation sold in pharmacopeial name or the name of the active pharmaceutical ingredient contained in the formulation, without any brand name”. However, ethical drug is not defined in DPCO, 2013. Drugs imported, manufactured and sold in the country are regulated under the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules made thereunder. The medicines, whether branded or generic, imported or manufactured for sale, distribution in the country, are required to comply to the same standards as specified in the Second Schedule to the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.(c):	DPCO, 2013 doesn’t differentiate between generic and branded medicines for price fixation. The prices fixed by National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) are applicable on both the generic and branded medicines. NPPA has taken the following action for making the medicines affordable:(i)	NPPA fixed the ceiling prices of 530 scheduled formulations under National List of Essential Medicines, 2011 (NLEM, 2011).(ii)	NPPA has notified the ceiling prices of 860scheduled formulations under NLEM, 2015.(iii)	NPPA has fixed prices of 106 Anti-diabetic and Cardiovascular drugs under Para 19 of DPCO, 2013 in Public interest.(iv)	NPPA has fixed ceiling price of Cardiac Stents being scheduled formulation under DPCO, 2013 affecting pricereduction for Coronary Stents.(v)	NPPA has fixed ceiling price of Orthopedic Knee Implants under Para 19 of DPCO, 2013 in Public interest effecting price reduction up to 69%.(vi)	NPPA has capped the Trade Margin of non-scheduled formulations of 42 select Anti-cancer medicines under “Trade Margin Rationalization” approach as a Pilot for proof of concept, wherein price of above 500 brands of medicines were reduced upto 90%.*******
