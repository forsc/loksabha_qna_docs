ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS  (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	One of the important roles of district planning is to strategize the efforts for development by identifying gaps, setting targets after taking into account the resource availability by suitably converging the Schemes of the Central and the State Governments and to monitor the progress in achieving the identified targets. Therefore, the launch of the Aspirational Districts Programme was accompanied by preparation of District Action Plans (DAPs) for Aspirational Districts by the respective District Magistrates/ Collectors. While the onus of implementing the vision of the DAPs primarily rests with the implementing agency i.e. the District Administration, NITI Aayog has created the ''Champions of Change'' dashboard for monitoring the real-time progress of districts on 49 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The dashboard helps the District Magistrates/Collectors to keep track of the performance of their district on each selected KPI and therefore, encourages the district to implement the programmes and proposals incorporated in the DAP. At the same time, NITI Aayog also rewards the best performing districts in each sector, including in Agriculture & Water Resources, on a monthly basis to incentivize them to keep improving their districts performance on each KPI.As per the data of Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, in 2020-21, the Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) vaccination of 25,000 sheep and goats has been successfully completed as against the target of 45,588 in Wayanad district. Similarly, the Foot & Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccination of 67,846 bovines have been successfully completed as against the target of 84,104 in Wayanad district, under the National Animal Disease Control Programme.(b)	With respect to micro-irrigation, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) is implementing Per Drop More Crop component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY- PDMC) which is operational in the country including Kerala from 2015-16. The PMKSY- PDMC focuses on enhancing water use efficiency at farm level through Micro Irrigation viz Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation System. The details of Central Assistance released and area covered under Micro Irrigation from 2015-16 to 2020-21 under PMKSY- PDMC in the State of Kerala and Wayanad district is attached as Annexure – I.(c)	& (d) Targeted Financial Inclusion Intervention Programme (TFIIP) is being implemented in Wayanad district under the Aspirational Districts Programme. The key objective of the ongoing programme is to achieve 100% targets before the end of September 2021 as under:i.	Ensuring availability of at least one banking touch-point (branch / BC kiosk) within 5 kms of every inhabited village in the districtii.	Enhancing coverage under identified KPIs for financial inclusion in camp/ mission mode to reach 100% of the benchmark level for Aspirational Districts in January 2020. These KPIs relate to number of banks accounts (CASA) and enrolments under the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY), Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) and Atal Pension Yojana (APY). In order to give fillip to activities under the Programme, the following 3-tier implementation and monitoring structure has been established:i.	National Level Steering Committee (NLSC)ii.	State Level Implementation Committee (SLIC)iii.	District Level Implementation Committee (DLIC)For implementing the programme, district administration is organizing camps and outreach programme in order to achieve the targets within the stipulated time. For effective implementation of TFIIP in 112 Aspirational Districts, Senior Officers from Public Sector Banks have been nominated as Nodal officers. Monthly progress under the Programme is being shared by DFS with all 112 Districts, including Wayanad district. The details of specific inputs received from SBLC, Kerala and from Mission Office (Banks), DFS are attached as Annexure II.The details of the initiatives/programmes being undertaken to improve skill development in Wayanad district are attached as Annexure III.(e)	Wayanad district has shown improvement of 23.17% in the Financial Inclusion & Skill Development sector since the inception of the Programme. The district theme composite score of Wayanad for Financial Inclusion and Skill Development sector, across different months, is as follows:Financial Inclusion and Skill DevelopmentMonth	District Theme Composite ScoreFeb-20	38.0Jun-20	29.4Feb-21	27.8 The fall in the thematic composite score of Wayanad district in Financial Inclusion & Skill Development, post February 2020, is representative of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic as the Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) were not operational during the lockdown measures and thus, have adversely affected the KPIs relating to fresh enrolments and training of those already enrolled. Once the impact of pandemic lessens, the progress of the district in key parameters of financial inclusion is likely to improve.     (f)	Yes, two independent assessments of the Aspirational Districts Programme have been done in the last one year. Firstly, a study by Social Progress Imperative, under the supervision of Prof. Michael Porter (Harvard Business School) and Prof. Scott Stern (MIT Sloan) was launched in August 2020 which is publicly available on the weblink: https://socialprogress.blog/an-assessment-of-the-aspirational-districts-programme/More recently, in June 2021, United Nations Development Program (UNDP) also conducted a detailed appraisal of the Programme which recommends the replication of ADP in other developing countries. The Appraisal Report is also publicly available on the weblink:https://www.in.undp.org/content/india/en/home/library/poverty/Aspirational_District_Programme_Appraisal.html(g)	Both reports have made some recommendations and provided constructive feedback to further improve the Programme. While the detailed recommendations may be read directly for the respective reports, some of the key recommendations are as below.The report by Social Progress Imperative recommends that the third-party survey and data collection mechanism could be further streamlined by grouping of indicators which are heavily co-related and by adjusting the frequency of data collection from monthly to quarterly or yearly, depending upon the time taken by the indicators to show any significant change. The report also encourages the respective District Administrations to regularly update their Action Plans as per their performance on various KPIs and also replicate the emerging best practices from other districts, with suitable modifications, as per the need of the district. With respect to the role of development partners, the report recommends that the partners should define their areas of operation based on their length and intensity of their engagement, such that all Aspirational Districts benefit from their presence on the ground. Lastly, the report also recommends that young professionals should be engaged to work directly at the local level with the district administration and development partners.     The UNDP Appraisal Report also makes a number of key recommendations for dealing with the existing challenges in the Programme. Firstly, to make the competition between the districts fairer, districts should be grouped together based on their common characteristics and supported accordingly. Further, the KPIs of the Programme should be revised periodically to removed indicators which are nearing saturation and replacing them with new areas that need to be prioritized. Thirdly, the UNDP Report too recommends that dedicated personnel like the Aspirational Districts Fellows need to be deployed in all Aspirational Districts to bring in additional accountability and ownership for the Programme. Lastly, the report also recommends inclusion of new sectors in the Programme, such as environment and gender, as they are essential for achieving inclusive and sustainable growth.
