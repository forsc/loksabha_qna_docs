To benefit farmers engaged in sericulture, CSB is implementing a restructured Central Sector Scheme “Silk Samagra”, which mainly focuses on improving quality and productivity of domestic silk thereby reducing the country’s dependence on imported silk. Under the scheme, assistance is extended to sericulture stakeholders for the beneficiary oriented components like, raising of Kissan Nursery, Plantation with improved Mulberry varieties, Irrigation, Chawki Rearing Centres with incubation facility, construction of rearing houses, rearing equipment,  door to  door  service agents  for  disinfection  and input supply, support for Improved reeling units like Automatic Reeling units, multi-end Reeling machines, Improved Twisting machines and support for post yarn facilities for quality Silk and fabric production.Under North East Region Textile Promotion Scheme (NERTPS), 38 Sericulture projects are being implemented in all North East States in the identified potential districts under three broad categories viz., Integrated Sericulture Development Project (ISDP) and Intensive Bivoltine Sericulture Development Project (IBSDP) and Aspirational District. Objective of these projects is to establish sericulture as viable commercial activity in North East Region by creating necessary infrastructure and imparting skills to the locals for silkworm rearing and allied activities in the value chain.  Steps taken to promote silk production and exports of silk: i.	Production of Bivoltine Silk:  Bivoltine silk is the high quality mulberry silk produced in India as an import substitute silk.  Research and Development has been focused to evolve productive bivoltine hybrids and package of practices for production of high quality bivoltine silk in the country.ii.

Cold Storage facilities and Bivoltine grainages have been strengthened to produce, store and supply quality Bivoltine silkworm seed.iv.	For production of 3A-4A grade raw Silk from the bivoltine cocoons, Automatic Reeling Machines (ARM)/Units have been established in the country. v.	Central Silk Board and State Governments mobilize additional funds for sericulture development through convergence by availing the schemes such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) etc., being implemented by various other Ministries of Government of India to create required infrastructure at stakeholder’s level.	vi.	To make the domestic silk weaving market segment stronger and also Indian silk export sector highly competitive, basic customs duty of 10% and 20% is levied on raw silk and silk fabric import respectively.vii.	Thrust provided on product development & diversification with focus on silk blends and popularizing Vanya silk products in the export business. viii.
