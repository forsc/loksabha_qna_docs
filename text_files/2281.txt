ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b):In order to provide affordable air services, Government has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) which is a market driven mechanism and supported by Central Government, State Governments and Airport Operators. Development of regional air connectivity routes is left to the market forces such that airlines undertake assessment of demand and nature of supply required on particular routes and lead the process under RCS - UDAN. Ministry of Civil Aviation has targeted an indicative airfare of Rs 2500 per passenger approximately, indexed to inflation, for a 50% of the capacity of the aircraft (subject to minimum 9 and maximum 40 seats) for a distance of 500 kms to 600 kms on RCS - UDAN routes (equivalent to about one hour of flight).;(c):  Government of India does not provide funds for procurement of aircraft. Each airline procures aircraft based on its own business plan.
