The details for Tariff Subsidy Billed (Rs. Cr.) and Tariff Subsidy Received   (Rs. Cr.) for all category of consumers including agricultural consumers State-wise are at Annexure.There is no separate category for power supply to borewell as far as collection of data for electricity subsidy to agriculture is concerned.  The States providing free electricity to Agriculture consumers for the FY 2020-21 are Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Puducherry, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Telangana.At present there is no proposal of Central Government to make DBT of subsidy mandatory for electricity consumers in agriculture sector. However, as per information available with Central Government, DBT has been implemented by some of the States like Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh in certain areas of supply.As per the Electricity Act 2003, every request for electricity connection/infrastructure has to be complied within a stipulated time period. This is to be ensured by the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC).  In order to further streamline the process of giving new connection to the consumers, Central Government has notified Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules, 2020 on 31.12.2020 which provides a timeline of seven days in metro cities, fifteen days in other municipal areas and thirty days in rural areas for providing new electricity connection.  The SERCs have been requested to take necessary action to implement various provisions of the Rules by amending relevant regulations, if required.***********
