                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a) to (d) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO.169* FOR 12TH FEBRUARY, 2021(a) to (d) Two COVID-19 vaccines, presently being used in our country, require completion of two-dose schedule at an interval of 28 days to complete the vaccination process. It takes around 14 days after second dose to develop immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A Communication strategy has been developed for implementation at the National and State level to raise awareness about the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines through prompt and consistent dissemination of factual information and to address misinformation related to it. The strategy is based on five key pillars– viz, advocacy, capacity building, media engagement, community engagement and crisis management. The strategy aims to leverage people’s ownership (Jan Bhagidaari) in taking the awareness about vaccination drive and its intended benefits forward.For successful implementation of the strategy, several measures have been taken so far. These include capacity building of stakeholders at National and State level including State Immunization and IEC officials, Civil Society Organizations, Radio including Community Radio professionals, etc. for leveraging their networks for active campaigning to create awareness about benefits of vaccination. Aggressive advocacy to build vaccine confidence has been done through reputed public and private sector Doctors at National level and in States/Union Territories (UTs) who have received vaccination and through other key influencers. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is also carrying out real-time review of news reports and developing and disseminating content on building confidence in vaccines and to counter less than adequate informed media narrative.   A special campaign against vaccine hesitancy have also been launched by the Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare.                  The Ministry also reached out to 22 Central line ministries including Rural Development, Panchayati Raj, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and MyGov etc. for engaging their field level networks to support information dissemination and social mobilization. Other measures include:  a special webpage on information pertaining to COVID 19 vaccine (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/covid_vaccination/vaccination/index.html); national helpline number 1075 to answer queries regarding COVID-19 vaccination drive; a new pre-caller tune; dissemination of communications package comprising of posters, banners, leaflets, bilingual Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and videos with information on COVID 19 across States/ UTs; Panel discussions and interviews on Television; Digital campaigning on Social media platforms; publication of articles in major National and Regional dallies etc.A total of INR 480 crore have been allocated to the States/UTs for operational costs for COVID-19 vaccination. This also includes cost for IEC material and awareness activities to be conducted to counter the issues/doubts arising out of the effects of the vaccine and instill confidence in the people.****
