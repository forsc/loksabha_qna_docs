ANSWER




MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a):	The objective of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) Policy is to ensure remunerative prices to the growers for their produce with a view to encourage higher investment and production.(b):	Government fixes MSPs of 22 mandated crops on the basis of recommendations of Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP), after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned & other relevant factors. In addition, MSP for Toria and De-Husked coconut is also fixed on the basis of MSPs of Rapeseed & Mustard and Copra respectively. These MSP crops account for 99 percent of agricultural production (excluding horticulture) in the country.(c):	 While recommending MSP, CACP considers various factors viz. cost of production, overall demand-supply situations of various crops in domestic and world markets, domestic and international prices, inter-crop price parity, terms of trade between agriculture and non-agriculture sector, likely effect of MSP on consumers and overall economy along with rational utilization of land, water and other production resources. After announcement of Union Budget for 2018-19, CACP also considered a minimum of 50 per cent as the margin over cost of production while recommending MSP. (d):	MSP operations are given wide publicity through pamphlets, banners, sign boards, radio, TV and advertisements through print & electronic media. In addition to that farmers are made aware of the quality specifications and purchase system to facilitate the farmers to bring their produce conforming to the specifications.*******
