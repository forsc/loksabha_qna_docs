Accordingly, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare constituted a committee in February, 2016. The recommendations of the committee have been sent on 20.09.2016 to all States/ Union Territories for making legislation/guidelines in this regard.  Health being a state subject, it is for the concerned State Governments to make legislation/ guidelines for the purpose. All the State Governments have been requested from time to time for improvement of service conditions of nurses including those working in the private sector. 		As per information available, four States namely, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Punjab and Delhi have issued notification in this regard.In so far as nurses and paramedical staff working in the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) hospitals under the Ministry of Labour & Employment are concerned, no specific direction has been received from the Hon’ble Supreme Court.    Moreover, salary and welfare measures for the nurses and paramedical staff working in ESIC hospitals are provided as per equivalent pay scales and service conditions of the Central Government. In the State run ESI hospitals, salary and service conditions equivalent to the State Government norms are paid.                                        *******
