Besides the Gold Standard RT-PCR (in 1715 labs), TrueNat (in 941 labs), CBNAAT (in 130 labs) techniques and other testing platform (in 18 labs) are also being used for testing. In addition, Rapid Antigen testing is being utilized for point of care testing in containment zones and in hospital settings. Those found positive by this test are considered as ‘true positives’. Those symptomatic found negative should be sequentially tested by RT-PCR.COVID-19 testing, and treatment is being provided free of cost to patients in all Government facilities. In addition, Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY health assurance scheme provides health cover of Rs. 5 lakhs per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization to over 10.74 crores poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries). Packages for ‘Testing for COVID-19’ and ‘Treatment of COVID-19’ were also notified on 4th April 2020.
