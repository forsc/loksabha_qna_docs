                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	The Import and Export of E-Waste is regulated under the Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016. The import of e-waste in India is prohibited under Rule 12(6) of the said rules. Therefore, no country can deposit its e-waste in India.(b)	The estimated quantity of e-waste generation during Financial Year (FY) 2019-20 is 10,14,961.213 tonnes. The rate of generation for the FY 2019-20 is 31.6% and the rate of generation for the FY 2018-2019 was 8.86%. The quantity of e-waste recycled during FY 2019-20 is 2,96,356.8 tonnes which is based on annual reports received from 28 State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/ Pollution Control Committees (PCCs). (c)	&(d) As per the provisions of the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016, SPCBs/PCCs have been mandated to grant authorisation to dismantlers and recyclers of e-waste in their respective States/ Union Territories (UTs) on being satisfied that the said dismantlers and recyclers have environmentally sound technologies and facilities in compliance to the guidelines specified by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). CPCB during quarterly review meetings held on 16.06.2020 and 09.10.2020, have advised SPCBs/PCCs for ensuring compliance of CPCB guidelines in general and with respect to capacity of the dismantlers and recyclers in particular as it has been observed that capacity granted to dismantlers and recyclers are not in line with the criteria given in CPCB’s guidelines. As on date there are 407 authorised dismantlers and recyclers in the country having authorised capacity of 1,10,103.22 tonnes.(e)	   The management of e-waste is regulated under the frame work of E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016 and amendments there off. The said rules are effective from 01.10.2016 and have the following specific objectives:(i)	Extended Responsibility to producers to manage a system of E-waste collection, storage, transportation and environmentally sound dismantling and recycling through EPR Authorization (EPRA).(ii)	To promote and encourage establishment of an efficient e-waste collection mechanism. (iii)	To promote Environmentally Safe & Sound Recycling through authorized dismantlers and recyclers of e-waste.(iv)	To minimize illegal recycling / recovery operations.(v)	Reduce Hazardous substances in Electrical and Electronic components.	Under the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), the producers of Electrical and Electronic Equipments (EEE) listed in the Schedule-I of rules have been given responsibility of management of their products once they have attained end of life. As per the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016, CPCB is issuing EPR authorization to the producers of EEE along with e-waste collection targets on annual basis. Asper the information provided by CPCB, a total no of 1678 Producers have been registered for EPR Authorization and also 44 Producers Responsibility Organizations (PROs) have obtained registration. For enforcement of the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016 in the country, an action plan is in place and the same is being implemented by all SPCBs/PCCs in their respective states/UTs. SPCBs/PCCs are submitting quarterly progress report as envisaged in the Action Plan through a web portal developed for this purpose. The Action Plan is at Annexure - I. (f)	Under Rule 12(1) of the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016, State government through department of Industry in State or any other government agency authorised in this regard has been given responsibility to ensure earmarking or allocation of industrial space or shed for e-waste dismantling and recycling in the existing and upcoming industrial park, estate and industrial clusters.*****
