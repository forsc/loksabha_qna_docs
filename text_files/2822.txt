The Central Government has enacted the Insecticide Act 1968 to regulate the use of pesticides (including Glyphosate). The Registration Committee after evaluating  Glyphosate on parameters, such as, chemistry, bio-efficacy, toxicity, packaging and processing has registered it for tea plantation and non-cropped area only.(b):	 As per the information available on the Rotterdam and Stockholm Convention website, Glyphosate is not banned in any country. (c):	 Presently, there is no such proposal. (d):	 Yes Sir, Alternatives for Glyphosate are available in the country.Contd…2/--2-(e) & (f):	 The Department is propagating judicious use of chemical pesticides.  This Department has established 35 Central Integrated Pest Management Centres (CIPMCs) across the country. These CIPMCs propagate the use of Integrated Pest Management and recommend judicious use of chemical pesticide. The CIPMCs, inter-alia, release bio-control agents in the fields, conduct Farmers Field Schools and organize IPM orientation programs. In the last three years, 5957.25 million bio-control agents have been released, 2142 nos. of Farmers Field Schools and 391 nos. of IPM orientation programs have been organized by the CIPMCs. ********
