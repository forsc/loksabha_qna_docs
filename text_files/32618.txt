Disciplinary action is initiated against delinquents wherever abnormal/unjustified losses are reported after due investigation.Transit Loss:-?	The concerned EDs (Zone)/ GMs (Region) are being continuously pursued to closely monitor the trend and take effective steps to control the trend of losses. Region-wise trend of TL is being reviewed in every MPR meeting and monitored regularly.?	Joint Verification is being undertaken to fix the responsibility wherever transit loss is reported to be more than 0.75%. Moreover, GMs have been authorized to get the JV conducted wherever losses are between 0.50% and 0.75%.?	Depots incurring high level losses in a month are inspected at the   level of EDs (Zone), GMs (Region) and other senior officers.?	Special Squad checking at selected rail heads and destination/ dispatch centers is being undertaken by the field offices.?
