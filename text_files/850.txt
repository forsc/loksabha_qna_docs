                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a): Yes, Sir. (b): Indian Railways are taking all the necessary initiative like ensuring training of staff, availability of dust bins/mugs, improvement in flushing system, provision of ventilation system,  improved coach cleaning, design improvements, augmentation of required infrastructure etc. to ensure proper and smooth functioning of bio-toilets in all the trains.Zonal Railways are organizing passenger awareness campaign at stations by regular announcement, display of short films etc. Stickers regarding proper use of bio-toilets have been provided in coach lavatories. Further, a short film has also been uploaded on social media highlighting correct usage of bio-toilets. Public awareness campaign about appropriate usage of bio-toilets through media is also being conducted. Passengers are being informed through models etc. at some of the railway stations.(c) & (d):  Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) in its report no. 36 of 2017 has mentioned instances of deficiencies/complaints such as choking, foul smell, non-availability of dust bins/mugs, non-functional sub-assemblies/components etc. in bio-toilets. Bio-toilets, being proliferated in Indian Railways’ coaches, are vulnerable to misuse. Generally, the problems of choking and foul smell in coach lavatories are due to use of toilet pan as garbage bins, inadequate use of water in flushing and inadequate ventilation. Out of 64280 coaches, 56779 coaches have been fitted with bio-toilets till May 2019. Following actions have been taken by the Railways to address these issues:•	Passengers are being educated regarding proper use of bio-toilets.•	Provision of individual dust bin in each coach lavatory has been made mandatory.•	Improved flushing system is being installed.•	Improvement to ventilation systems is also underway to eliminate foul smell.•	Concerned staff is being trained for proper up-keep and maintenance of bio-toilets.•	Continual design improvements are being done like replacement of ball valve, P-trap and wire rope operating mechanism with simpler S-trap arrangement.•	Vacuum based flushing system.To address quality issues, specifications have been made more stringent and stern assessment of concerned vendors is being done. Strict inspection of bio-toilet material is being carried out by inspection agencies.The address quality issues, approved vendor list for retention tank (bio-toilet) has been revised and there are sufficient number of  suppliers in the present Vendor Directory having a combined declared monthly capacity of more than 14000 bio-toilets (retention tanks) which is adequate for Indian Railways requirement. To expedite the supply and installation of bio-toilets in Zonal Railways, method of placing Centralized Rate Contracts from Railway Board has already been adopted for bulk purchase and accelerated retro-fitment of bio-toilets.*****
