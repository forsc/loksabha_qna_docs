No.	Name of state	Number of closed sugar mills1	Uttar Pradesh	382	Maharashtra	663	Bihar	184	Gujarat	145	Karnataka	226	Haryana	27	Punjab	88	Tamilnadu	189	Other States	64	Total	250......2/--2-Non-operation/closure of the sugar mill is normally attributable to non-availability of adequate sugarcane, uneconomic size of plant, lack of modernization, high cost of working capital, poor recovery from sugarcane, lack of professional management, overstaffing, financial crunch and lack of adequate irrigation in the catchment area of sugar mill etc.(c) to (e): 	As regards revival of closed sugar mills, in case of private sector sugar mills, it is the responsibility of the entrepreneurs to take necessary steps to operationalise their closed sugar mills, and in case of co-operative/public sector sugar mills, the responsibility lies with the co-operative societies/respective state governments. The Government of India has taken various interventions from time to time viz provided financial assistance to sugar mills to offset the cost of cane, financial assistance for maintenance of buffer stocks, financial assistance to facilitate export of sugar, extended soft loans to sugar mills, fixation of minimum selling price of sugar etc. Due to such interventions, sugar sector survived and many sugar mills are prevented from closure. Various state governments have also taken steps to operationalise the potential non-operational sugar mills of their states, which are given at Annexure.**** ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (c) TO (e) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3526 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 10.08.2021 IN LOK SABHA.State	Steps takenUttarakhand	It is proposed to operate one sugar mill of cooperative sector namely Sitarganj for the next sugar season.

This is present policy of the State Government. In Karnataka 8 cooperative sugar factories have been leased out to private entrepreneur so far.
