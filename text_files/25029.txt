The Ministry is implementing two major afforestation schemes namely National Afforestation Programme (NAP) for tree plantation in degraded forests through people’s participation and National Mission for a Green India (GIM), An area over 2 million hectare was sanctioned for taking up afforestation in the States/Union Territories (UTs) with an investment of about Rs. 3936.41 crores till 2020-21 under NAP since its launch year 2000. Under GIM an amount of about Rs. 455 crore has been released to States/UTs since 2015-16 to 2020-21. The State-wise details of funds released during last three years (2018-19 to 2020-21) are given in Annexure I.ii.	The Government of India has disbursed an amount of Rs. 48477.77 crore from National Fund to 31 State funds as share of respective States as per Compensatory Fund Act, 2016 till 31.01.2021 for taking up various activities for improvement of forest area. State/UT wise details are given in Annexure I.iii.	The MoEFCC encourages plantation/ afforestation through people’s participation under Nagar Van Yojana (NVY) for protection and development of urban forests. Rs. 14.10 crore has been released to 9 States for creation of Nagar Van during 2020-21 and 2021-22.  iv.	Further, tree plantation, being a multi-departmental, multi-agency activity, are also being taken up cross-sectorally under various programmes/funding sources of other ministries/ organizations and also through State Plan budgets. v.
