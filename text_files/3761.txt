ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ''Nishank'')(a) & (b) No, Sir. At present, there is no proposal to set up a new Central University in Darjeeling.During 12th Plan (2012-17), as approved by National Development Council (NDC), the thrust is onconsolidation of the higher education system. Expansion is to be mainly done by scaling up capacityof the existing institutions in place of setting up new institutions. The Central Government haslaunched Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) on cost sharing basis to assist States to opennew institutions. Further, ‘Education’ is a concurrent subject, State Governments also take variousinitiatives to enhance the access to higher education in the respective States along with other PrivateUniversities/Institutions.*****
