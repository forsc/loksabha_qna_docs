ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) to (d) The government has so far given ‘in-principle’ approval for strategic disinvestment of 35 CPSEs and Subsidiaries/Units/Joint Ventures of CPSEs since 2016, the list of which is annexed. This is based on the recommendations of NITI Aayog, which has been mandated to identify CPSEs for strategic disinvestment. For this purpose NITI Aayog identified these CPSEs based on the criteria of (i) National Security; (ii) Sovereign function at arm’s length; and (iii) Market Imperfections and Public Purpose.   Profitability or loss of the CPSE is not a relevant criterion for disinvestment.  This list includes profit-making as well as loss-making CPSEs.(e) In the Budget for the financial year 2021-2022, target for disinvestment receipts has been kept at Rs.1.75 lakh crore (BE). The quantum of disinvestment receipts and timing of disinvestment transactions will depend on the prevailing markets conditions and investors’ interest.(f) On strategic disinvestment, it is expected that the strategic buyer will bring in new funds, technology and improved management practices for optimum development of business potential and growth of the CPSE.  The growth of the company post-disinvestment would be able to generate higher economic activity, growth of the ancillary industries and contribute to the economic growth of the country, which will result in creation of new job opportunities.  The proposed strategic disinvestment of the company is on a ‘going concern’ basis, with change in ownership only and employees will generally continue to be company’s employees.  Further, the agreed terms and conditions laid down in the Share Purchase Agreement may have specific clauses in respect of the employees.  Post-disinvestment, the prospects of the employees are expected to improve with the growth in production, productivity and profitability. *****  Annexure to Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 3031 for reply on 15-03-2021List CPSEs and Subsidiaries/Units/Joint Ventures of CPSEs for which Government has given ‘in-principle’ approval for strategic disinvestment since 2016.a)	Ongoing TransactionsS.No	Name of CPSE	Registered Head Quarter	PAT(Rs.in Lakh)2017-18	PAT(Rs.in Lakh)2018-19	PAT(Rs.in Lakh)2019-201.
