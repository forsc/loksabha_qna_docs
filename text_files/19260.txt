                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):	Health is a State subject. Ministry of Health & Family Welfare does not maintain any centralized data on patients visiting public and private hospitals for COVID-19 care. However, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has written to all States/UTs to engage private hospitals through mutually agreeable arrangements. Rates under PM-JAY and CGHS packages have been advised. A large number of States have accordingly issued instructions to that affect.(c):	There are no indigenous manufactures of the drug Tocilizumab in India. The Drug is currently being imported in the country by M/s Roche Products (India) Pvt. Ltd.CDSCO has granted permission to manufacture Remdesivir Injectable formulations to various manufactures as follows:1.	M/s Hetero Labs Limited2.	M/s Cipla Ltd.3.	M/s Mylan Laboratories Limited4.	M/s Jubilant Generics Limited at M/s Immacule Lifesciences Private Limited, H.P5.	M/s Dr. Reddys Laboratories Ltd.6.	M/s Cadila Healthcare7.	M/s Syngene InternationalCDSCO has granted permission to manufacture Favipiravir Formulations to various manufactures as follows:1.	M/s Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited2.	M/s Optimus Pharma Pvt. Ltd.3.	M/s BDR Pharmaceuticals International Pvt. Ltd. at M/s J. Duncan Healthcare Private Limited, Maharastra4.	M/s Cipla Limited5.	M/s Zenara Pharma Private Limited6.	M/s Strides Pharma Science Limited7.	M/s Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Limited8.	M/s Pure & Cure9.	M/s Hetero labs10.	M/s MSN Laboratories11.	M/s Precise Biopharm12.	M/s Macleods Pharma13.	M/s Lee Pharma14.	M/s Synokem Pharma15.	M/s Synmedic Pharma16.	M/s Mascot HealthSome of the manufactures have more than one manufacturing site.(d):	Data on availability of individual drugs is not maintained Centrally. In the initial part of the pandemic, taking cognizance of reports of shortages, the CDSCO requested all the State Drugs Controllers to keep a strict vigil on the illegal sale to prevent black marketing along with other measures. Subsequently, with increase in supply of the drug by more number of manufacturers, as stated above, the situation has improved. Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has not received any reports of shortage recently.(e):	Drug Tocilizumab has been included under in the National COVID-19 treatment management protocol (available at: https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/UpdatedClinicalManagementProtocolforCOVID19dated03072020.pdf) as an investigational therapy only to be used in a defined subgroup of patients, with moderate disease with progressively increasing oxygen requirements and   in mechanically ventilated patients not improving despite use of steroids.  The drug Favipiravir has not been part of National COVID-19 treatment management protocol. Further these drugs are also not included in the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM). Therefore National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) has not put a price cap for these drugs.
