ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(SHRI PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a)  The prevention of cruelty to animals is a state subject. The data in this regard is not maintained in the Central Government. However, the Animal Welfare Board of India is regularly getting information on the cruelty to animals for which the AWBI is writing to the State Governments and local authorities to take necessary action as per the prevailing laws. (b) The prescribed fine and penalty in the current Prevention to Cruelty to Animal Act is not sufficient enough to take action against the cruelty to animals. (c)  The need for amending the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 by introducing more stringent penalties has been recognized by the Government. The draft amendment worked out includes increasing monetary penalties and punishment provisions.*****
