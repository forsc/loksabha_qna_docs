ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): Line maintenance requirements are generally met by the domestic airline operators through self-handling or third party domestic sourcing. For base maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO), only about 4 domestic Aircraft Maintenance Organizations (AMOs) out of the 48 standalone AMOs approved by Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in India have the capacity and requisite certifications to meet a part of the base MRO needs of India''s aviation sector. An estimated 85% to 90% of the base MRO is supplied by overseas AMOs approved by DGCA.;;         Given the technical and skill base and in recognition of the potential for attaining self-sufficiency in MRO sector, attracting business from foreign airlines, and developing India as a hub for MRO services, various interventions have been made from time to time under the National Civil Aviation Policy, 2016. There has been a renewed focus on development of engine shops, component and airframe MRO in India by aviation original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and logistics services providers. The major initiatives for creation of a congenial atmosphere for broad-based development of MRO in the country, inter alia, include the following:;(i)   Exempted Customs Duty on tools and tool kits,;(ii)  Reduced Goods and Services Tax rates on various spare parts, accessories, and consumables,;(iii) Simplified clearance processing of parts,;(iv) Relaxed restriction on utilization of duty-free parts from one year to three years,;(v)  Extended stay in India of foreign aircraft for entire duration of MRO work or 6 months, whichever is lesser,;(vi) Revised the Notification to enable export of serviceable parts,;(vii) 100% Foreign Direct Investment permitted via automatic route for MRO,;(viii) Liberalised policy for borrowing and lending in Foreign Currency and Rupees on competitive terms for MROs, and;(ix)  Prescribed modalities for concessional temporary imports of spare parts by foreign airlines for repair of their aircraft in transit.;
