ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES & PUBLIC ENTERPRISES(SHRI ARVIND GANPAT SAWANT)(a) & (b):  As per information available with Department of Public Enterprises (DPE), 19 Sick & loss making Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) have been approved for closure by the Government. Detail of such CPSEs is at Annexure–I. Regarding CPSEs under strategic disinvestment, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) has informed that the government has given ‘in-principle’ approval for strategic disinvestment of 28 CPSEs including Subsidiaries, Units and Joint Ventures with sale of majority stake of Government of India and transfer of management control. A list of such CPSEs including Subsidiaries, Units and Joint Ventures is given at Annexure-II.(c): The major reasons for closure of a CPSE would include continuous losses/ sub-optimal returns on equity invested by Government, inability to compete in competitive market, etc. As for strategic disinvestment, DIPAM being the nodal Department has observed that in sectors where the competitive markets have come up of age, the economic potential of such entities engaged in producing goods and services may be better discovered in the hands of the strategic investors due to various factors, e.g. infusion of capital, technology up-gradation and efficient management practices etc. Besides, the Government would also be able to monetize its investment in CPSEs.* * *
