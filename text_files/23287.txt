NIP projects with details including project completion status are in the public domain at  https://indiainvestmentgrid.gov.in/home which is updated by the concerned central ministries/departments/state governments, etc.NIP is not a scheme and therefore it is not having any project centric provision and mechanism for any fund or disbursal of any fund. The projects included in the NIP have been primarily proposed by concerned project authorities of Central Ministries/State Govts and it is for them to fund these projects through their budgetary/extra budgetary resources, innovative financing including selection of mode of implementation of the project whether EPC/PPP, etc. ******
