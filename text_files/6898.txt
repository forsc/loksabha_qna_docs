THE MINISTER OF MINES, COAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS  (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a) to (d): Yes, Sir. India is deficient in Lithium and Cobalt resources. However, to meet the country’s requirement of Lithium and Cobalt, a joint venture viz. Khanij Bidesh India Ltd.

(e) & (f): Geological Survey of India (GSI) is engaged in mineral exploration activity to search for different mineral commodities including Lithium and Cobalt prospects in different parts of the country. GSI takes up exploration projects for multi-metal elements including Lithium and Cobalt. 	Presently, Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration & Research, Department of Atomic Energy is carrying out exploration for lithium in potential geological domains in parts of Karnataka, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Bihar and Jharkhand. Lithium (Spodumene) mineralisation has been identified in pegmatite in Marlagalla along the Nagmangla Shist Belt, Karnataka. Surveys are also being carried out in brines of Sambhar & Pachpadra playas, Rajasthan and Rann of Kachchh, Gujarat for lithium mineralisaton.    *****
