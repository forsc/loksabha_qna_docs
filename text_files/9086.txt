JITENDRA SINGH)(a) to (c):  The Government of India, in pursuance of its commitment to “Zero Tolerance Against Corruption”  has taken several measures to combat corruption which, inter alia, include:i.	Systemic improvements and reforms to provide transparent citizen-friendly services and reduce corruption. These, inter alia,  include:a)	Disbursement of welfare benefits directly to 	the citizens under various schemes of the 	Government in a transparent manner 	through the Direct Benefit Transfer initiative. b)	Implementation of E-tendering in public procurements.c)	Introduction of e-Governance and simplification of procedure and systems.d)	Introduction of Government procurement through the Government e-Marketplace (GeM).ii.	 Discontinuation of interviews in recruitment of Group ‘B’ (Non-Gazetted) and Group ‘C’ posts in Government of India. iii.	 Invocation of FR-56(j) and AIS(DCRB) Rules, 1958 for prematurely retiring officials whose performance has been reviewed and found unsatisfactory. iv.	 The All India Services (Disciplinary and Appeal) Rules and Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules have been amended to provide for specific timelines in the procedure related to disciplinary proceedings. Contd.P.-2/--2-v.	 The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 has been amended on 26.07.2018 to bring a paradigm shift in tackling corruption in as much as clearly criminalizing the act of giving bribe, checking big ticket corruption by creating a vicarious liability in respect of senior management of commercial organizations where the act of giving of bribe is with their consent or connivance.   vi.	  Issue of instructions by the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) asking the organizations to adopt Integrity Pact in major procurement activities and to ensure effective and expeditious investigation wherever any irregularity/misconduct is noticed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     vii.	 The institution of Lokpal has been operationalised by appointment of a Chairperson and eight Members, including four judicial Members. Lokpal is statutorily mandated to directly receive and independently process complaints as regards alleged offences against public servants under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.	In addition, the CVC as an apex integrity institution has adopted a multi-pronged strategy and approach to combat corruption, which encompasses punitive, preventive and participative vigilance.  However, the Government of India does not follow the practice of maintaining chart of corruption percentage pertaining to States and Union Territories.(d):    No such data is being maintained.*****
