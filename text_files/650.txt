                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PG & PENSIONS AND IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE(DR. JITENDRA SINGH):(a)	Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), since its inception, has been driven by the objective of harnessing the benefits of space technology for national development and improving the lives of the people. The satellite enabled data and services are being used to improve the living standards of people. These include Television broadcasting, Direct-to-Home, ATM, Mobile communication, tele-education, tele-medicine and advisories on weather, pest infestation, agro-meteorology and potential fishing zones. Satellite data is also used for crop production estimation, crop intensification, agricultural drought assessment, wasteland inventory, identifying ground water prospect zones, inland aquaculture suitability and disaster risk reduction, which indirectly benefits the people.(b)	& (c)	Yes, Sir. In order to promote use of space technology for governance and public administration, Department of Space had formed expert working groups in ISRO for proactive interaction with the Government departments and prepared the joint action plan on “Effective use of Space Technology in Governance & Development”. These action plans were deliberated in One Day National Meet held in New Delhi in September 2015, with the participation of all the Central Government Ministries/ Departments. The projects that emerged out of this Meet in the areas of Natural Resources Management, Planning, Monitoring & Decision Making and Disaster Risk Reduction have been executed. Further, to promote utilization of space technology in State Government Departments, State level workshops have also been conducted in 18 states. 	Several training programmes have been conducted at Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA), DoPT and Institute of Secretariat Training & Management (ISTM), DoPT on space technology based applications for sensitization of officials at different levels of public administration. More than 1150 officials have been benefitted so far.*****
