ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) Global warming is a global collective action problem and has to be solved by international cooperation. India is a party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Paris Agreement (PA), and reports its emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) on a periodic basis to the UNFCCC through its National Communications and Biennial Update Reports (BURs). Both UNFCCC and its PA recognise and acknowledge that the emissions of the developing countries, India included, will rise owing to their social and developmental needs. As per the third BUR submitted to the UNFCCC, India’s net Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in 2016, including Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry were 2,531.07 million tonne CO2 equivalent. Between 2014 and 2016, India’s net GHG emissions rose by nearly 225 million tonne CO2 equivalent, a growth of about 4.8% per annum. Nevertheless, India’s per capita GHG emissions in 2016 was only 1.96 tonnes of tCO2e which is less than one third of the world’s average per capita GHG emissions. India’s contribution to historical global cumulative emissions from 1850 to 2017 is also only about 4%. Hence, India’s annual and cumulative emissions in both absolute and per capita terms have been significantly low, and far less than its equitable share of the Global Carbon Budget. Thus the impact of global warming on India is largely due to the emissions of the developed countries and other big emitters and not due to our own emissions. In addition, India’s emission intensity of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has reduced by 24% between 2005 and 2016 against the pre-2020 voluntary goal of reducing it by 20-25% from 2005 levels by 2020. This indicates our continued efforts at decoupling growth from emissions. Forest and tree cover has increased by around 1.3 million ha between the 2015 and 2019 assessments of the Forest Survey of India. The Land Use and Land-Use change sector, under which forests and tree cover are included, removed 15% of the country’s carbon dioxide emissions in 2016, amounting to a net removal of about 307.82 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, increasing its status as a sink by 2.2% since 2014. (b) Under the Paris Agreement, India has submitted its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) balancing the concerns and priorities of climate change, sustainable development including poverty eradication, and economic growth of the country. India’s NDCs comprise eight goals for 2021-2030, including (i) to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030 from 2005 level; (ii) to achieve about 40 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030 with help of the transfer of technology and low-cost international finance; and (iii) to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonne of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. Government is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which provides the overarching framework for climate actions, through  eight national missions in specific areas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan eco-system, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. Under the NAPCC’s overarching framework, thirty-three (33) States /UTs have prepared State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCC). Further, to support adaptation measures in States / UTs in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change, Government is implementing the National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC). In addition, Government has set up an Apex Committee for Implementation of Paris Agreement (AIPA) to coordinate and oversee the implementation of the Paris Agreement.(c) and (d)  According to the Climate Transparency Report (2020) which makes reference to the Climate Action Tracker (CAT) assessment, India is the only G20 country whose NDC targets are compatible with the Paris Agreement temperature target of 2 degrees Celsius. *****
