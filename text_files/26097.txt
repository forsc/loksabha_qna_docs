                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (SHRI MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a) to (d) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 173* FOR 30TH JULY, 2021(a) & (b) :	Yes, There are 3500 licensed blood banks in the country. Detailed information regarding number of blood banks functioning in the country, State/UT wise is given in Annexure–I.(c) :	The extant policy norm for setting up blood banks as per National Blood Policy is to have at least one licensed blood bank in every district while avoiding clustering of the blood banks in urban and semi urban areas. The policy also advocates for a hub and spoke approach towards transfusion services, wherein blood is collected and processed in the hubs, which are high volume blood banks and distributed through spokes, which are smaller blood banks and blood storage centers. 	There are 63 districts in the country without blood banks and the details thereof are given in Annexure–II. Due to various administrative reasons, State Governments carve out new districts periodically,however  blood needs of such districts continue to be catered through blood banks in nearby districts and through blood storage centres set up in First Referral Units at Community Health Centres and select Primary Health Centres.(d) :	Government of India has formulated a policy to have at least one Blood Bank in every District of the country. However, Public Health, being a State subject, it is the primary responsibility of the State Government to ensure the establishment of Blood Banks as per their need. However, support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their healthcare system including strengthening existing blood banks/establishing new blood banks based on the proposals submitted by the States through National Health Mission.
