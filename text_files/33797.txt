ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION, MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS [RAO INDERJIT SINGH](a): As per World Inequality Report, 2022 published by World Inequality Lab in partnership with United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the share of top 10% people in India’s National Income was equal to 57% in 2021.(b) & (c):  The United Nations General Assembly, in its 70th Session held on 25th September 2015, considered and adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which came into force with effect from 1st January, 2016. SDGs are comprehensive list of global goals integrating the social, economic and environmental sectors of development. The SDG 10, i.e.  “Reduce inequality within and among countries”, aims at reducing inequality within and among countries. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has released the progress report 2021 (version 3.1) on SDGs National Indicator Framework (NIF) on 29th June, 2021, which includes targets and national indicators under SDG 10. These indicators of SDG 10 inter-alia include wealth inequality related indicators which are based on the data of Household Consumer expenditure Survey (HCES) 2011-12.This Ministry has carried out an All-India survey on Household Consumer Expenditure during NSS 75th round (July 2017- June 2018). The Ministry has followed a rigorous procedure for vetting of data and reports which are produced through surveys. The results of this survey were examined and it was observed that there was a significant variation in the levels in the consumption pattern as well as in the direction of the change while comparing with other administrative data sources. The matter was also referred to a Committee of Experts which has recommended refining the survey methodology and improving the data quality aspects on a concurrent basis and it was decided that the results of HCES 2017-2018 would not be released. The latest data on Consumer Expenditure Survey published by this Ministry is the report on Consumer Expenditure Survey (NSS 68th Round: July, 2011-June, 2012). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation which prevailed during 2020 & 2021, the period was considered to be an abnormal one and hence Consumer Expenditure Survey was not taken up. (d) & (e): The National Statistical Office, MoSPI annually  publishes ''National Accounts Statistics''  which inter-alia includes the estimates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), National Income etc.                                          *****
