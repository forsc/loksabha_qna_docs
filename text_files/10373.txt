                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (e): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3898 BY SHRI M.K. RAGHAVAN TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 11.12.2019 REGARDING KOZHIKODE RAILWAY STATION AS WORLD CLASS STATION(a): Kozhikode railway station has been entrusted to Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) in August 2019 for redevelopment.  RLDA has initiated action for appointment of Consultant for feasibility study, preparation of Master Plan and Detailed Project Report etc.  As the station is planned to be redeveloped in PPP mode with no cost to Railway, allocation of fund is not required.  Station redevelopment project is complex in nature and requires detailed techno-financial feasibility studies and statutory clearances from local authorities.  Therefore, no time-frame for completion of the project can be indicated at this stage.(b)to(e): Presently, four pairs of MEMU services, namely 66606/66607 Palakkad Town-Coimbatore MEMU, 66605/66604 Coimbatore-Shoranur MEMU, 66608/66609 Palakkad Town-Erode MEMU and 66611/66612 Palakkad-Ernakulam MEMU are being operated  in the Palakkad Division, which is adequately catering to the needs of passengers. Requests, including that from the Hon’ble Member of Parliament have been received for introduction of more MEMU services in Palakkad Division. However, owing to the operational and resource constraints, at present there is no proposal to introduce additional MEMU trains in Palakkad Division.Conversion of coaches of trains into LHB coaches, is being undertaken in phase-wise manner. Accordingly, 29 pairs of trains running with LHB coaches, are serving Palakkad Division.To cater to the needs of Bangaluru-Mangaluru sector, 16585/16586 Yesvantpur-Mangaluru Central Express has been introduced w.e.f. 21.02.2019, which is in addition to the 4 pairs of services serving the sector. Similarly, two pairs of trains are catering to the Mangaluru-Kozhikode sector.  However, at present, there is no proposal to introduce new train between Kozhikode-KSR Bangaluru. *****
