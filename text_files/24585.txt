ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) to (d): Yes, Sir. The Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) and Ministry of Ports, Shipping and  Waterways (MoPSW) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on June 15, 2021 for the development of seaplane services in India. This MoU envisages development of Non Scheduled/Scheduled operation of seaplane services within territorial jurisdiction of India. The main objective of this MoU is to enhance seamless connectivity across the nation by promoting eco-friendly transportation through Seaplanes and also give a boost to the tourism industry.Further, MoU will facilitate in expediting the development of new water aerodromes and operationalization of new seaplane routes in India. For development of Water Aerodromes, MoPSW would undertake the responsibilities of waterside works considering their expertise. The State/UT Governments would execute the landside activities. MoCA as a nodal Ministry would coordinate with the stakeholders for operationalization of water aerodromes. Development of water aerodromes and promoting seaplanes operations would go a long way in opening up the new mode of transportation. These operations will also help in connecting the tourist destinations to give impetus to tourism sector.
