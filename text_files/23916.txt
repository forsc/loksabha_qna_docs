ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP(SHRI  R.K. SINGH)(a) :		The State/UT-wise details of power demand in the country in terms of Energy Requirement and Energy Supplied during the last three years and the current year 2020-21 (upto February, 2021) are given at Annexure. (b) :		The Government of India had announced following measures to give relief to the power sector during Covid-19 lockdown:(a)	The Government of India decided to make an infusion of liquidity of Rs. 1,20,000 crore through Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) as a part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan to extend special long term transition loans to Discoms. (b)	Payment of fixed charges of Central Power Gencos for power not scheduled to the Discoms during the lockdown period was deferred. (c)	Central Power Gencos/Central Transmission Companies were suggested to consider giving a rebate of 20-25% on fixed charges to Discoms during the lockdown period.(d)	The requirement of either making prepayment or giving Letter of Credit (LoC) for the entire cost of the power was relaxed to 50% during the period 24.03.2020 to 30.06.2020. (e)	Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) had issued an order to the effect that if any delayed payment by the distribution companies to the generating companies and inter-state transmission licensees beyond 45 days from the date of the presentation of the bills falls between 24.03.2020 and 30.06.2020, the concerned distribution companies shall make the payment with a Late Payment Surcharge (LPS) at the reduced rate of 12% per annum.(f)	Further, in order to alleviate the financial stress on the DISCOMs, Government has advised the generating companies and Transmission companies to charge LPS at a rate not exceeding 1% per month for all payments made under the Liquidity Infusion Scheme of PFC and REC under Aatmanirbhar Bharat.(c) & (d) : 	It may not be possible to bring down the rate of interest for borrowing by DISCOMs from PFC and REC to the level of rate of interest offered by the Banks since the cost of raising fund for PFC and REC would always be a little higher as compared to Banks. However, PFC and REC, from time to time, review their interest rates.(e) & (f) :		A reforms-based result-linked power distribution sector scheme is proposed with an outlay of Rs.3,05,984 crores over 5 years. The scheme will provide assistance to DISCOMs for infrastructure creation and upgradation, prepaid smart metering, feeder separation, up-gradation of systems, etc. The release of funds will be conditional upon improvement in performance including reduction in AT&C losses. Only the States/UT owned DISCOMs are proposed to be covered under the reforms-based result-linked power distribution sector scheme. ************
