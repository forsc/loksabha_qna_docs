JITENDRA SINGH)(a):  The Government of India, in pursuance of its commitment to “Zero Tolerance Against Corruption”  has taken several measures to combat corruption which, inter alia, include:i.	Systemic improvements and reforms to provide transparent citizen-friendly services and reduce corruption. These, inter alia,  include:a)	Disbursement of welfare benefits directly to the citizens under various schemes of the Government in a transparent manner through the Direct Benefit Transfer initiative. b)	Implementation of E-tendering in public procurements.c)	Introduction of e-Governance and simplification of procedure and systems.d)	Introduction of Government procurement through the Government e-Marketplace (GeM).ii.	 Discontinuation of interviews in recruitment of Group ‘B’ (Non-Gazetted) and Group ‘C’ posts in Government of India. iii.	 Invocation of FR-56(j) and AIS(DCRB) Rules, 1958 for prematurely retiring officials whose performance has been reviewed and found unsatisfactory. iv.	 The All India Services (Disciplinary and Appeal) Rules and Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules have been amended to provide for specific timelines in the procedure related to disciplinary proceedings. Contd.P.-2/--2-v.	 The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 has been amended on 26.07.2018 to bring a paradigm shift in tackling corruption in as much as clearly criminalizing the act of giving bribe, checking big ticket corruption by creating a vicarious liability in respect of senior management of commercial organizations where the act of giving of bribe is with their consent or connivance.   vi.	 Issue of instructions by the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) asking the organizations to adopt Integrity Pact in major procurement activities and to ensure effective and expeditious investigation wherever any irregularity/misconduct is noticed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      vii.	 The institution of Lokpal has been operationalised by appointment of a Chairperson and eight Members, including four judicial Members. Lokpal is statutorily mandated to directly receive and independently process complaints as regards alleged offences against public servants under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.	In addition, the CVC as an apex integrity institution has adopted a multi-pronged strategy and approach to combat corruption, which encompasses punitive, preventive and participative vigilance.(b):  As per information provided by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), it is investigating a substantial number of cases having inter-state ramification, hence state-wise data of cases is not maintained by CBI. However, during the last three years CBI has registered 2113 cases under the provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.       As per information provided by the Enforcement   Directorate (ED), the ED has initiated investigations in 162 cases relating to corruption under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA) during the last three years. State-wise number of these cases is Annexed.(c):  As informed by CBI, out of the 2113 cases registered by CBI, investigation has been completed in 1352 cases.As informed by ED, the Proceeds of Crime (PoC) involved have been attached and Prosecution Complaints have also been filed in some cases.   (d):  Cases pertaining to corruption involve scrutiny of voluminous documents and examination of numerous witnesses to prove the allegations.  Further, PMLA investigations involve a number of steps such as quantification of PoC, analysis of money trail to locate such PoC, identification and attachment of movable and immovable assets derived by way of laundering of PoC, collection of evidence of money laundering and filing of Prosecution Complaint. Hence, the time by which the pending cases are likely to be disposed can not be specified.*****
