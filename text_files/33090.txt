ANSWER




                                                              MINISTER OF STATE					(SHRI AJAY BHATT)      IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE(a) to (c): Indian Army: (i)	The capacity & capability development plans of Indian Army remain dynamic/ flexible and are based upon the appreciated immediate & emerging national security challenges and in support of our operational response strategies. Accordingly, Indian Army is ensuring preparation & implementation of prioritised acquisition plans to maximize capacity & capability development, in consonance with the evolving threat perception.(ii)	Defence Planning Committee (DPC). The DPC under the chairmanship of National Security Advisor has been constituted in 2018 for facilitating Integrated Planning at the apex level and its focused execution to promote Strategic Planning, Capability Development, Defence Diplomacy and Indigenisation in Defence Sector.(iii)	Appointment of CDS. The appointment of the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and the creation of Department of Military Affairs (DMA), has resulted in far greater synergy with Ministry of Defence as also given the twin objectives of ‘Integration/ Jointness’ and ‘Resource Optimisation’ within the Services a much needed fillip.(iv)	Long Term Modernisation Planning. Factoring the emerging/ futuristic security challenges, and in consonance with the ‘CCS Mandate to CDS’ for implementing the Integrated Capability Development Plan (ICDP), an Integrated Capability Development System (ICADS) has been initiated vide DAP 2020. The ICADS process will maximise resource optimisation and infuse much needed jointness/ integration in tri-services planning/ procurement process.(v)	Army Design Bureau (ADB). The ADB, since its raising in 2017, has made major forays in supporting R&D/ harnessing technology with an extensive outreach to industry, academia and ushering a collaborative engagement with the technology providers, manufacturers and users.(vi)	Reorganisation of IHQ of MoD (Army). The recent reorganisation of the Army HQ, creating a Deputy Chief for looking after both the Capability Development & Sustenance needs of the Indian Army, further empowers Indian Army to pursue a focused approach towards achieving the mandate of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’.(vii)	Raising of Niche Capability Structures. To address critical capability voids in the domains of space, Cyber and Special Forces Capabilities, Niche Capability Structures in terms of Defence Space Agency, Defence Cyber Agency & Armed Forces Special Operations Division have been raised in 2018-19.(viii)	Emergency Procurement Powers. Emergency procurement Powers have been delegated to the Service Headquarters by the Government to address the emergent operational needs for effectively responding to the operational situation in Eastern Ladakh/ Nothern Borders.(ix)	Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP) 2020. The new DAP 2020 has been promulgated in October 2020 as an enabling document that lays emphasis on indigenous production and self-reliance under the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ initiative and further streamlines capital procurements for the  Army.(x)	Committee for Technical Modernisation of Armed Forces. To address long term technological capability needs of the Armed Forces, the Government has constituted a high level Committee, in October 2021, for recommending a Roadmap to achieve self-reliance and Technical Modernisation of the Armed Forces. The Roadmap prepared by the committee is likely to facilitate the Armed Forces in retaining continued focus on acquiring niche / emerging / disruptive capabilities & technologies for addressing the evolving threats & challenges that may manifest in the foreseeable future.Indian Navy:The modernisation of Indian Navy is an ongoing process and aims to strengthen India’s maritime security.  The capability development/ modernisation of the Indian Navy is being undertaken in accordance   with   the   Long   Term   Integrated   Perspective   Plan  (LTIPP).    The   ongoing modernisation aims to create capabilities for accomplishing a range of missions across the entire spectrum of threats and challenges addressing rapidly shifting global and regional balances of power.	Over 100 contracts have been concluded since 1st April, 2018 towards modernisation of the Indian Navy.Indian Air Force:(a)	To meet emerging challenges the Indian Air Force (IAF) is progressing well on a capability driven modernization plan in consonance with the roadmap laid down in the LTIPP. This is being achieved by the induction of the new platforms and weapon systems along with the continuous upgradation of the existing equipment.(b)	In the fighter fleet, Rafale induction is under progress. LCA Mk1A has been contracted. Deliveries will commence from Jan 2024.(c)	The major induction in the transport fleet will be the C-295 aircraft. Chinook and Apache helicopters have also been inducted.(d)	There is significant progress in the Air Defence capabilities with the induction of new Radars and SAGW systems. The induction of S-400, MRSAM, VSHORADS, and CIWS will enable a layered Air Defence capability. Work has also commenced on the development of AEW&C Mk II by CABS, DRDO.(e)	The MiG-29, Jaguar, Mirage-2000 and Mi-17 helicopters are being upgraded in a phased manner. Lastly and more importantly, the IAF is swiftly progressing towards complete Network Centric Operations and aims to improve ISR capability, Command and Control structures to meet the future challenges.(f)	Consequent to shifting regional and global balance of power, IAF is continuously working towards enhancing its capacity to meet the emerging challenges in all the war fighting domains. A substantial offensive and defensive capability and ability to swiftly deploy/swing the forces to desired area of operation demonstrates its capability to deter any adversary.(g)	IAF is sharpening its offensive edge through indigenization of aircraft, weapons and sensors (Light Combat Aircraft, Light Combat Helicopter, Brahmos, Long Range Surface to Air Missile), procurement of next generation assets such as Rafale and integration of weapons on existing and new platforms. IAF is also enhancing interactions in the form of exercises and joint training with friendly foreign countries to enhance cooperation and share best practices.(h)	IAF is aware of changing character of warfare and emerging technological trends like drone technologies including anti drone and swarm drones, Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) concepts utilizing UCAV and niche technologies. The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in planning and mission execution, quantum technology and advanced weapons including hypersonic weapon are key areas of further exploration and inclusion into IAF operational planning.*****
