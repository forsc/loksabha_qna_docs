(5) In case a private retrieval hospital is not doing post mortem, they shall arrange transportation of body along with medical records, after organ or tissue retrieval, to the designated postmortem centre and the post mortem centre shall undertake the postmortem of such cases on priority, even beyond office timing, so that the body is handed over to the relatives with least inconvenience.”	The guidelines of 15.11.2021 supplement the already existing provisions as it enables the Health Facilities to conduct post-mortem on priority when organ donation is involved.***
