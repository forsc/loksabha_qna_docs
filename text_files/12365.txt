ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (a) to (d) As per extant guidelines dated 18.5.2017 on rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy,  Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has granted  general  permission  to domestic  Scheduled  Commercial  Banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks), to  open banking outlets  at  any place  in the country, without  seeking  prior  approval of  RBI  in  each  case, subject  to at least  25 percent  of the total  number  of  banking outlets  opened  during a  financial  year being in  unbanked  rural centres i.e. centres having population less than 10,000 (Tier 5 and Tier 6 centres). A ‘Banking Outlet’ for a Domestic Scheduled Commercial Bank (DSCB), a Small Finance Bank (SFB) and a Payment Bank (PB) is a fixed point service delivery unit, manned by either bank’s staff or its Business Correspondent (BC).As informed by RBI, as on 31.3.2019, there were 5.41 lakh banking outlets in villages providing banking services through BCs. State-wise data of banking outlets in villages through BCs is at Annexure. District-wise data of banking outlets is not maintained by the RBI.Further, under Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), all villages were mapped by banks into 1.59 lakh Sub-Service Areas (SSAs) with one SSA catering to 1,000 to 1,500 households. While 0.33 lakh SSAs have been covered with bank branches, 1.26 lakh SSAs, have been covered by deployment of interoperable Business Correspondents (BCs).As per RBI’s master circular dated 1.7.2014 on ‘Branch Authorisation’ banks are permitted to formulate a policy for engaging BCs with the approval of their Board of Directors. Further, the terms and conditions governing the contract between the bank and the BC are required to be defined in written agreements and subjected to a thorough legal vetting.*****Annexure as referred in reply to in part (b) of the Lok Sabha unstarred Q.
