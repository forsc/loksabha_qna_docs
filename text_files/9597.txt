ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND MINISTRY OF EARTH SCIENCES (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a) & (b) 	Yes Sir. The Government has introduced several latest information technologies to provide information to the farmers on agriculture related activities. India Metrological Department (IMD), under “Gramin Krishi Mausam Sewa (GKMS)”scheme, issues district level weather forecasts for the next five days covering all the districts in the country. Based on the weather forecast, Agromet Advisories are prepared in collaboration with 130 Agro-Meteorological Field Units (AMFUs) and Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). These advisories are communicated to the farming community through multichannel dissemination systems including SMS using mobile phones. Such inputs help farmers to save their crops under adverse weather situations as well as to take the benefit of benevolent weather condition to undertake appropriate farm operations to increase yield. Agromet Advisories are also issued to the farmers through SMS during extreme weather events like hailstorm, cyclone, heavy rainfall etc. so as to minimize the crop damages due to inclement weather, by taking preventive action. Based on Extended Range Forecasts for the next 20-30 days, the Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA) in collaboration with IMD, issues weekly National Agromet Advisory bulletin for the planners at Central and State levels, farmers and other organisations for preparedness to cope up with ensuing weather conditions for better crop management. (c) 	Currently, IMD is generating medium range weather forecasts at sub-district level across the country in 12km x 12km scale. A high resolution (12 km grid scale) state of the art Global Ensemble Prediction System (EPS) namely Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS) was commissioned on 01 June 2018 for generating operational probabilistic weather forecasts for 10 days which will enhance the weather information being provided by the current models by quantifying the uncertainties in the weather forecasts. IMD is taking continuous efforts to popularize the service among the farming community by organising Farmers’ Awareness Programmes (FAPs) in various parts of the country. IMD along with the experts from AMFUs also participates in KisanMelas, Farmers’ Day etc. to create awareness about the services so that more farmers get benefitted. Through such programmes, details of more number of farmers are also collected for enhancing the outreach. Around 42 million farmers are now receiving the weather information and Agromet Advisories through SMS on regular basis.
