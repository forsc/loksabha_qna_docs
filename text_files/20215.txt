                                                        (a)	to (e):   A statement is laid on the Table of the House.  STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.*122 FOR 10.02.2021 REGARDING EMPLOYMENT GENERATION IN ELECTRONICS AND IT INDUSTRY.......... (a):    As per the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM), the Information Technology (IT) industry employs over 43 lakhpersons in the country. As per the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), employment in Electronics hardware manufacturing industry in the country is estimated to be about 30 lakh persons. (b) and (c): As a result of various initiatives of Governmentincluding Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP), India has become a promising centre for mobile phonesand their sub-assemblies/ partsmanufacturing in recent years. The production of mobile phones has gone up significantly from around 6 crore units valued at INR 19,000 crore in 2014-15 to around 33 crore units valued at INR 2,14,000 crore in 2019-20. As per Industry estimates, over 200 units are manufacturing mobile phones and their sub-assemblies / partsin the country, up from only 2 units manufacturing mobile phones in 2014. Most of the major brands (both foreign and Indian) either have already set up their own manufacturing facilities or are in the process of doing so or have sub-contracted manufacturing to Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) companies operating from the country. The details of the number of factories producing mobile phones and their sub-assemblies / parts/ components in the countryapproved under the Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS) of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), year-wise and State-wise are at Annexure-1.(d):  Promotion of electronics hardware manufacturing, including manufacturing of mobile phonesand their sub-assemblies / parts is one of the important pillars of both “Make in India” and “Digital India” programmes of the Government of India. The measures taken by the Government to promote electronics hardware manufacturing,includingsetting up of mobile phone manufacturing factories in the country are listed at Annexure-2.The key measures inter-aliainclude:(i)	Government has notified the National Policy on Electronics 2019 (NPE 2019) on 25.02.2019, with the vision to position India as a global hub for Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) and create an enabling environment for the industry to compete globally. One of the objectives of NPE 2019 is promotion of domestic manufacturing and export in the entire value-chain of mobile phone manufacturing.(ii)	To attract and incentivize large investments in the electronics value chain and promote exports, Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing has been notified on 01.04.2020 under the aegis of NPE 2019. The Scheme provides an incentive of 4% to 6% to eligible companies on incremental sales (over base year) involved in mobile phone manufacturing and manufacturing of specified electronic components, including Assembly, Testing, Marking and Packaging (ATMP) units. (e):    The PLI Scheme was announced in April 2020 and the last date for receipt of applications was 31.07.2020.The scheme has been a huge success in terms of the interest received from applicant companies and projected outcomes. The PLI Scheme is designed to attract global champion companies into India and promote Indian champion companies in electronic manufacturing. Over the next five years, the scheme is expected to lead to a total production of about INR 10.5 lakh crore. The scheme is expected to boost exports significantly and of the total estimated production, more than 60% is expected to be contributed by exports.The scheme is also expected to bring in additional investment in electronics manufacturing to the tune of INR 11,000 crore. Value addition by the approved companies is expected to go up from 20-25% presently to 35-40% by 2025.*****Annexure-1Factories producing mobile phonesand their sub-assemblies / parts / components in the country approved under theModified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS)State / Year	2014	2015	2016	2017	2018	2019	2020	TotalUttar Pradesh	1	5	5	1	2	3	1	18Maharashtra	2	3	4	1	1	-	2	13Haryana	-	2	6	1	1	-	-	10Tamil Nadu	-	2	2	2	1	1	-	8Karnataka	-	2	2	-	2	1	-	7Andhra Pradesh	-	1	3	-	-	-	1	5Gujarat	-	1	3	-	-	-	-	4Rajasthan	-	1	-	-	1	-	-	2Telangana	-	-	1	-	-	-	1	2Daman	-	-	1	-	-	-	-	1Himachal Pradesh	-	-	1	-	-	-	-	1Total	3	17	28	5	8	5	5	71Annexure-2 Measures taken by the Government to promote electronics hardware manufacturing, including setting up of mobile phone manufacturing factories in the country1.	National Policy on Electronics 2019: The National Policy on Electronics 2019 (NPE 2019) has been notified on 25.02.2019. The vision of NPE 2019 is to position India as a global hub for Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) by encouraging and driving capabilities in the country for developing core components, including chipsets, and creating an enabling environment for the industry to compete globally.To attract and incentivize large investments in the electronics value chain and promote exports, following three Schemes have been notified under the aegis of NPE 2019:(i) Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing notified vide Gazette Notification No.CG-DL-E-01042020-218990 dated April 01, 2020 shall provide an incentive of 4% to 6% to eligible companies on incremental sales (over base year) involved in mobile phone manufacturing and manufacturing of specified electronic components, including Assembly, Testing, Marking and Packaging (ATMP) units. (ii) Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) notified vide Gazette Notification No.CG-DL-E-01042020-218992 dated April 01, 2020 shall provide financial incentive of 25% on capital expenditure for the identified list of electronic goods that comprise downstream value chain of electronic products, i.e., electronic components, semiconductor/ display fabrication units, ATMP units, specialized sub-assemblies and capital goods for manufacture of aforesaid goods. (iii) Modified Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC 2.0) Scheme notified vide Gazette Notification No.CG-DL-E-01042020-218991 dated April 01, 2020 shall provide support for creation of world class infrastructure along with common facilities and amenities, including Ready Built Factory (RBF) sheds / Plug and Play facilities for attracting major global electronics manufacturers along with their supply chain to set up units in the country. The Scheme provides financial assistance for setting up of both EMC projects and Common Facility Centres (CFCs) across the country.2.	100% FDI:As per extant Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy, FDI up-to 100% under the automatic route is permitted for electronics manufacturing (except from countries sharing land border with India), subject to applicable laws/ regulations; security and other conditions.3.	Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS): The Scheme was notified on 27thJuly, 2012 to provide financial incentives to offset disability and attract investments in the electronics manufacturing sector. It was amended in August, 2015 to extend the period of the scheme, enhance scope of the Scheme by including 15 more product verticals, and attract more investment. The scheme was further amended in January, 2017 to expedite the investments. The scheme provides subsidy for capital expenditure - 20% for investments in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and 25% in non-SEZs. The incentives are available for 44 categories / verticals of electronic products and components covering entire electronics manufacturing value chain. The Scheme was open to receive applications till 31.12.2018 and is in the implementation mode.4.
