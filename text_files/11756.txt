Phase-wise provision for inclusion of cities under PMAY-U Mission was relaxed in March, 2016 to include all statutory towns as per Census 2011 and towns notified subsequently including Notified Planning/Development Areas. So far, against the validated demand of 1.12 crore houses, 1.03 crore houses have been sanctioned across 4,521 cities in the country under various verticals of PMAY-U Mission. (c)	: Till now, 1,98,751 houses have been sanctioned  in the State of Jharkhand under PMAY-U Mission, out of which 1,35,156 houses have been grounded and 76,865 completed/delivered respectively. The details of physical and financial progress of PMAY-U Mission in the State of Jharkhand are at Annexure-II.(d)	& (e): Yes, Sir. The PMAY-U Mission guidelines stipulate that houses constructed under the Mission under each component should conform to the standards provided in National Building Code (NBC). The houses under the Mission are designed and constructed to meet the require¬ments of structural safety against earthquake, flood, cyclone, landslides etc. conforming to the NBC and other relevant Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) codes. In order to ensure quality of houses sanctioned under the Mission, apart from regular quality checks by Urban Local Bodies (ULBs)/Implementing Agencies (IAs), Third Party Quality Monitoring (TPQM) of all the ongoing projects is also mandatory. States/UTs engage Third Party Quality Monitoring Agency (TPQMA) to ensure quality of construction under various components of the Mission.                                          *****
