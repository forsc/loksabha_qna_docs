                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION (DR. SUBHAS SARKAR)(a) & (b)	Due to the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, schools in States and Union Territories (UT) were closed as a precautionary measure to protect the students. which interrupted their learning. Ministry of Education has held several consultations with the States and UTs to assess the various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  After discussion with the States and UTs, a multi-pronged approach has been adopted for leveraging technology to reach the students. A comprehensive initiative called PM eVIDYA has been initiated which unifies all efforts related to digital/online/on-air education to enable multi-mode access to education. The initiative includes, the following components: ? DIKSHA the nation’s digital infrastructure for providing quality e-content for school education in states/UTs:  and QR coded Energized Textbooks for all grades (one nation, one digital platform) ? One earmarked Swayam Prabha TV channel per class from 1 to 12 (one class, one channel)? Extensive use of Radio, Community radio and CBSE Podcast- Shiksha Vani? Special e-content for visually and hearing impaired developed on Digitally Accessible Information System (DAISY) and in sign language on NIOS website/ YouTube Where the digital facility (mobile device/ DTH television) is not available, Ministry of Education has taken many initiatives like Textbooks, worksheet supplied to residence of learners, Handbook on 21st Century Skills and organizing community/mohalla classes. Innovation Funds are used to set up mobile school, virtual studios, virtual class rooms in schools, Continuous Learning Plan (CLP) for States/UTs has been initiated in all States/UTs, pre-loaded tablets under Samagra Shiksha in various states and UTs are effectively used in remote/rural areas where online classes are difficult. Further in order to provide continuous professional development opportunities to the teachers at the elementary level, this Department launched the National Initiative for School Heads'' and Teachers'' Holistic Advancement (NISHTHA) online training programme using DIKSHA platform in October 2020. NISHTHA online for elementary level covered 18 modules in 11 languages, including use of ICT in teaching-learning. NISHTHA 2.0 and NISHTHA 3.0 have also been launched for covering secondary and primary level teachers respectively.The Centrally Sponsored Scheme Samagra Shiksha has been aligned with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 in order to ensure inclusive and equitable, quality and holistic school education. The major interventions, across all levels of school education, proposed under the scheme are: (i) Universal Access including Infrastructure Development and Retention; (ii) Foundational Literacy and Numeracy, (iii) Gender and Equity; (iv) Inclusive Education; (v) Quality and Innovation; (vi) Financial support for Teacher Salary;  (vii) Digital initiatives; (viii) RTE Entitlements including uniforms, textbooks etc.; (ix) Support for ECCE; (x) Vocational Education; (xi) Sports and Physical Education; (xii) Strengthening of Teacher Education and Training. Samagra Shiksha also has a clear focus on bridging and eliminating gender differences in enrolment, retention and quality of learning. (c) to (e) 	Education is in the concurrent list of the Constitution and majority of the schools are under the domain of respective State and UT Governments. Thus, the matter relating to fees and its components in schools are regulated in terms of Rules and Instructions of the State Government concerned. It is for the respective State Government concerned to take necessary action against such schools which violate the Rules and Instructions of the State Government in the matter. So far as schools affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) are concerned, the Board has issued circular on 17th April, 2020 to all the State Education Department with the request to consider issuing suitable instructions on periodicity of payment of school fees and payment of salaries to the teaching and non-teaching staff to be applicable during the period of pandemic. The circular can be accessed on the website https://www.lms.org.in/assets/front/pdf/Fee_payment_Circular_dated17April2020.pdf******
