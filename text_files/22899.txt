HARSH VARDHAN)(a)&(b) 	The government has come up with a draft Science, Technology and Innovation Policy (STIP) which aims to set up an Open science framework to facilitate free access of all data used in and generated from public-funded research on findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) terms. The data includes, manuscripts, research data, supplementary information, research protocols, review articles, conference proceedings, monographs, book chapters, etc. Since the STI Policy is still at the draft stage, there is no timeline available for launch of the open science framework. (c)	Does not arise as the framework is yet to be finalized.                                                 *****
