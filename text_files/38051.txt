Under this Treaty, India and Nepal have agreed to implement the Pancheshwar Multi-purpose Project as an integrated project. •	A Joint Project Office (JPO-SKSKI) was constituted in 2004 with the mandate to prepare the Detailed Project Report (DPR) for Saptakoshi High Dam Multipurpose Project and Sunkoshi Storage-cum-Diversion Scheme in Nepal.  •	An India-Nepal Agreement on Kosi Project was signed in 1954 and amended in 1966, for building, operation and maintenance of Kosi barrage and associated structures. Further both countries signed an agreement on Gandak Project in 1959 and amended in 1964, for building, operation and maintenance of Gandak barrage and associated structures. Kosi barrage and Gandak barrage are already built and operational. •	Projects to minimize the risk of inundation while also providing benefits on irrigation and power generation are on the bilateral agenda of issues for discussion and cooperation with Nepal. These include, inter-alia, the river training works in Kamala, Bagmati and Lalbakeya rivers which have been completed with Indian assistance in form of grants.******
