                                                        MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (e): Under the Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDMS), the Central Government started providing 100% Central Assistance for construction of kitchen-cum-stores at a flat rate of Rs. 60,000/- per unit since 2006-07. All the States and UTs including Telangana have expressed their inability to construct Kitchen-cum-Stores (KcS) at old rates i.e. @ Rs.60,000/- per unit due to cost escalation. Accordingly, the norms for kitchen-cum-stores have been revised from the month of December, 2009 and the cost of construction of Kitchen-cum-Stores is now determined on the basis of plinth area norms and the State Schedule of Rates prevalent in the States and UTs. All the States and UTs including Telangana have also been advised to expedite the construction of remaining KcS.As informed by State Government of Telangana, 17,483 Kitchen-cum-Store have been constructed and 3698 are in progress. It has also been decided by the State Government to develop infrastructure facility in all the schools in three phases for construction of remaining Kitchen-cum-Stores. The District-wise details of Kitchen-cum-Stores (KcS) sanctioned and constructed in Telangana under the Scheme during 2006-07 to 2019-20 is given at Annexure.
