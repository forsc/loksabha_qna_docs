                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)  (a) to (e): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.  ***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.1841 BY SHRI B.B.PATIL TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 03.07.2019 REGARDING ROBs/RUBs AND FOBs(a) & (b): 1535 Road over Bridges (ROBs) and 105 Road under Bridges (RUBs) have been sanctioned on Cost sharing basis. However, no Foot over Bridge (FOB) has been sanctioned on Cost Sharing basis in Plan Head-30 (PH-30). State-wise details of sanctioned ROBs/RUBs on cost sharing basis including Telangana is at Appendix-I. Proposals for construction of ROBs/RUBs in lieu of Level Crossings (LCs) are normally received at various levels in Zonal Railways from State Government and other Statutory Authorities. After completing various formalities with State Government/Statutory Authorities, regarding the consent for sharing of cost and closure of LCs, proposals received for construction of ROBs/RUBs in lieu of LCs are further processed for their inclusion in Budget. This is a continuous process. No proposal of ROBs/RUBs which qualifies for Cost sharing and consent of State Government received, is pending in the Railway Board for the State of Telangana.(c) : The Zone-wise details of ROBs/RUBs sanctioned on Cost sharing basis during last three years and zone-wise details of the Fund allocation and utilization during the last three years and current year are at Appendix-II & Appendix-III respectively. So far as ratio of State share is concerned, all cost sharing works are being sanctioned on 50:50 cost sharing basis.(d) & (e): Normally, Railway undertakes construction of ROBs/RUBs in Railway portion whereas approaches are being constructed by State Government.  Generally, there is no problem of construction of ROBs/RUBs in Railway portion. However,  it is difficult  to construct  ROBs/RUBs on approaches  because it depends upon many factors such as availability  of land, removal of encroachments, fixing the alignment of approaches, allocation of requisite funds etc. However, during last three years, work for construction of 12 Nos. of RUBs has been completed in the State of Telangana. Remaining works for construction of ROBs/RUBs are at various stages of planning, estimation and execution.*****
