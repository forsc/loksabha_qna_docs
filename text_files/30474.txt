ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) to (d) 	The work of 4-laning from Sitapur to Lucknow on NH-24 has already been completed. 	The construction work of 6-laning of Hapur Bypass-Moradabad Section of NH-24 from Km 50.000 to Km 149.250, including flyovers at Garhmukteshwar, Pakbara, Joya, Rajabpur, is in progress with Physical Progress 80.85 % with completion by  May-2022.  	The next stretch of highway from Moradabad to Bareilly of NH-24 has already been 4-laned.	Earlier, the work for 4-laning of Bareilly-Sitapur section of NH-24 was awarded to M/s BHPL in 2011 and the project was terminated in May 2019 due to poor performance of the Concessionaire. Thereafter the balance work has been re-awarded and same was restarted on 17.12.2019. However due to Covid-19 situation in the country, the progress of the work was slowed down. The present physical progress is 40.60% with completion by December 2022. 	Traffic jam at Katra on route to Shahjahanpur is mainly due to construction work of Railway Over Bridge (ROB), which was awarded as a separate work, to expedite the construction of ROB, in June-2020 with completion by March, 2022. The present physical progress is 58.00%. However, the existing girders present at the site were rejected by the Railway in May-2021, which also delayed the project.*****
