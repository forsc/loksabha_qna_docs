ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):	Enforcement of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 primarily lies with States/Union Territory Administrations. As per reports received from States/UTs, the details of food samples analysed and action taken during the last five years, State/UT-wise are at Annexures I to V.(c):	Many States/UTs have inadequate manpower for regulatory work and laboratory infrastructure. To overcome the shortage of regulatory staff for effective enforcement action, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) impresses upon the States/UTs to create adequate number of posts of Designated Officers/Food Safety Officers and recruit full time staff against  posts.  FSSAI has also insisted upon the States that Food Safety Commissioner should be a full time officer, which in most of the States have additional charge of the post. FSSAI has also assisted  the States under Central Sector Scheme for “Strengthening of Food Testing System in the Country including provision of Mobile Food Testing Labs ” (SoFTel) ’ and  a sum of Rs.  269.69 Crore has been sanctioned/released for the upgradation of 38 State Food Testing Laboratories, including purchase of high end equipments and setting up of microbiology labs.  FSSAI has also provided 54 Mobile Food Testing Labs, called Food Safety on Wheel, to 31 States/UTs. FSSAI  also regularly conducts Food Analysts Examinations for ensuring availability of adequate pool of food analysts and is providing training to lab personnel of States/UTs.(d):	Yes. To evolve the overall approach to compliance, FSSAI is adopting a Risk Based approach towards inspections and surveillance aligning to global standards. Risk Based Inspection System (RBIS) is meant to strengthen and protect safe food supply and fair trade practices and to prevent fraudulent practices. Its objectives are to (i) prevent unsafe food to be placed in the domestic market;(ii) to draw a food inspection system from a product-based process to a risk-based process that can be used by food inspectors across the entire food sector regardless of the specific product(s) handled or manufactured; and (iii) linking ‘Risk grade’ with Licensing and Registration System.Further, Regular surveillance, monitoring, inspection and random sampling of food items have been carried out by the Food Safety Officers and samples are sent to the laboratories recognised by FSSAI for analysis. In cases where the samples are found to be non-conforming to the provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and Rules and Regulations made thereunder, recourse is taken to the penal provisions under Chapter IX of the Act.The details are available at Annexure IV and V.
