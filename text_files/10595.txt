                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in association with the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/ Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) monitors the water quality of rivers on a regular basis across the country through a network of monitoring stations. As per latest report of CPCB, 351 polluted river stretches have been identified on 323 rivers based on the value of Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD).  State-wise & priority-wise number of polluted river stretches is provided in Annexure.(b) & (c)	This issue of desilting has been considered by Government since long. In this regard, Government constituted a committee under the chairmanship of former Chairman, Central Water Commission, Dr. B.K. Mittal in October, 2001. The Committee found that desilting of rivers in general is not technically feasible due to several reasons like non-sustainability, non-availability of vast land required for the disposal of dredged material etc. However, the Committee have suggested dredging the river reaches in waterways path to have minimum depth of water for navigation purpose and desilting of river in vulnerable stretches based on model study subject to techno-economic viability. (d)  Government of India, vide Notification dated 9th October 2018, has notified minimum environmental flows to be maintained in river Ganga for stretch from its origin to Unnao (Uttar Pradesh). The notified environmental flow regime is monitored by Central Water Commission.Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) in the Standard terms of Reference (ToR) for conducting the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies for any proposed River Valley and Hydroelectric Project have mentioned the norms for release of environmental flows which is 30% in monsoon season, 20% in season and 25% in non-monsoon & non-lean season to be followed corresponding to flow of 90%  dependable  year. These norms along with the site specific requirements for environmental  flow releases as per the studies are then stipulated in the Environment Clearance (EC) letter for compliance.	        Further, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), SPCBs and PCCs monitor industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under  various provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.     ***** ANNEXURE Annexure referred to in reply to Part (a) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 4051 to be answered on the 12.12.2019 on “Polluted Rivers”State/Union Territory wise and Priority wise number of Polluted River StretchesSTATE	I	II	III	IV	V	Grand TotalANDHRA PRADESH				2	3	5ASSAM	3	1	4	3	33	44BIHAR			1		5	6CHHATTISGARH				4	1	5DAMAN, DIU AND DADRA NAGAR HAVELI	1					1DELHI	1					1GOA			1	2	8	11GUJARAT	5	1	2	6	6	20HARYANA	2					2HIMACHAL PRADESH	1	1	1		4	7JAMMU & KASHMIR		1	2	2	4	9JHARKHAND				3	4	7KARNATAKA			4	7	6	17KERALA	1			5	15	21MADHYA PRADESH	3	1	1	3	14	22MAHARASHTRA	9	6	14	10	14	53MANIPUR		1			8	9MEGHALAYA	2			3	2	7MIZORAM			1	3	5	9NAGALAND	1		1	2	2	6ODISHA	1		3	2	13	19PUDUCHERRY				1	1	2PUNJAB	2			1	1	4RAJASTHAN			1		1	2SIKKIM					4	4TAMIL NADU	4			1	1	6TELANGANA	1	2	2	2	1	8TRIPURA					6	6UTTAR PRADESH	4		1	2	5	12UTTARAKHAND	3	1	1	4		9WEST BENGAL	1	1	3	4	8	17Grand Total	45	16	43	72	175	351*****
