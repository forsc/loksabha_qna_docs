In case, jute mills are not able to supply the indented quantity of jute bags, Government has provided a provision of maximum 30% of dilution against the total requirement. The Government exercises the dilution powers in case of exigency to avoid short supply of jute bags for packaging of foodgrains.(c) & (d):	There was no manufacturing of PPE Coveralls in India prior to January, 2020.
