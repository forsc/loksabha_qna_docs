Piped Natural Gas (PNG) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) are being supplied to households in the country as per availability, to reduce dependence onpolluting fuels, including biomass fuels (wood, dung or agricultural residues), kerosene, coal etc.(c) to (e) Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) is the authority to grant authorization to the entities for the development of City Gas Distribution (CGD) network in Geographical Areas (GAs) as per PNGRB Act, 2006. PNGRB identifies the GAs for the development of CGD network depending on the natural gas pipeline connectivity/natural gas availability and techno-commercial feasibility.
