ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	  The prices of agricultural produce are determined by supply and demand conditions in the market on a day-to-day basis. Price of agricultural produce tends to fall after the harvesting season due to increase in market arrival of new crop in a lumpy manner. There is no general indication that farmers are getting rock bottom prices for their produce. The all India average annual wholesale prices are more or less close to the level of Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for MSP crops. A statement showing all India wholesale prices and MSP of major agricultural crops is given at Annexure.(b) to (d):	 The Government is implementing the scheme for Integrated Cold Chain and Value Addition Infrastructure as one of the component of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana with the objective of arresting post-harvest losses of horticulture & non-horticulture produce and providing remunerative prices for their produce. Under the scheme, the Government provides financial assistance in the form of grant-in-aid @35% for general areas and 50% for North East States, Himalayan States, Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP) areas and Islands. These are provided  for storage and transport infrastructure and 50% and 75% respectively for value addition and processing infrastructure subject to a maximum grant-in-aid of Rs. 10 crore per project for setting up integrated cold chain projects including irradiation facility without any break from the farm gate to the to the consumer. The integrated   cold chain and preservation infrastructure can be set up by individuals, groups of Contd…2/--2-entrepreneurs, cooperative societies, Self Help Groups (SHGs), Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), Central/State PSUs, etc. The scheme is primarily private sector driven and proposals under this scheme are invited through Expression of Interest (EOI).        Under the Scheme for Integrated Cold Chain & Value Addition Infrastructure (as on 31.05.2019) 296 cold chain projects have been approved. Out of 296, 152 cold chain projects have stated their commercial operations and remaining 144 are in various stages of implementation.The capacity created by 152 operational cold chain projects under the Scheme is as under:Cold Storage/ Controlled Atmosphere / Deep Freezer	5.41 Lakh MTIndividual Quick Freezing(IQF) / Spiral Freezer	143.45 MT/hourMilk Processing /storage	59.01 Lakh Litres Per DayReefer Vehicles	836 Nos.   As per the Report of the Committee for Doubling Farmers’ Income, establishing modern pack-houses on a priority basis at horticulture producing areas with aim to move the aggregated and pre-conditioned produce to wholesale market is a key objective as there is a huge shortfall of 69831 numbers in the Integrated pack-house infrastructure.  For Integrated (modern) Pack houses, the Government provides Rs.50.0 lakhs/unit with throughput capacity of 16 MT/day, with facilities for conveyor belt sorting, grading, washing, drying & weighing.
