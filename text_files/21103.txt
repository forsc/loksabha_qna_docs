(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):	Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) aims at supporting sustainable income in crop production, especially in adverse climatic conditions by way of: •	Providing financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of unforeseen events. •	Stabilizing the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming. •	Encouraging farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices. •	Ensuring credit worthiness of the farmers, crop diversification and enhancing growth and competitiveness of agriculture sector besides protecting the farmers from production risks.Earlier the scheme was mandatory for farmers availing crop loans/Kisan Credit Card loans and optional for others.  However, the Scheme has now been made optional for all farmers w.e.f. Kharif 2020 season. In Gujarat, 84.31 lakh farmers’ applications were enrolled and 25.57 lakh farmers got claims as per provisions of the scheme from Kharif 2016 to Rabi 2019-20 season.  However, Gujarat Government has not implemented the scheme during 2020-21.*******
