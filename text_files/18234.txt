ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c)  Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) facilitates and assists States / Union Territories (UTs), through its Missions / Schemes  in  development  of  cities  and  towns covered   under  them. Funds allocated and released under these urban development Missions / Schemes during last three years and current year are at Annex. Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY), which ended on 31.03.2019 is a Central Sector Scheme and is fully funded by the Central Government. In all other Missions / Schemes, apart from the Central Government’s assistance, the States / UTs / Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) / beneficiaries contribute as per specific guidelines / instructions for completion of the project / scheme / benefit. Also, all the fund flow is through the concerned State / UT Government. In certain cases funds remain unspent as the Central Government released fund or State / ULB / Beneficiary component, is not fully made available as per the directed scale of fund flow. This is pursued closely by the concerned Missions / Divisions of the Ministry with the States / UTs / ULBs.(d) & (e)	Yes, Sir. Monitoring of utilization of funds allocated to the States / UTs under the Missions / Schemes by the respective Divisions is a continuous process and is carried out through institutional frameworks that consist of progress reports, field visits of senior officers, review meetings in States / UTs and review through video conferences. It is also done through geo-tagged Information Technology based Management Information System (MIS).(f)	In order to strengthen capacities of Urban Local Bodies a component for Capacity Building is available under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). Against the mission target of training 45,000 municipal functionaries, around 54,000 municipal functionaries have been given Capacity Building trainings. Further AMRUT provides incentives to States to undertake reforms across 11 different areas. Most of the reforms are targeted to improve capacity and service delivery of the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).                               *****
