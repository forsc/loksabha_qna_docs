                                                        MINISTER FOR CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D.V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a):    No, Sir.  The requirement, availability and sales position of fertilizers (Urea and P&K) during Rabi 2019-20 (as on dated i.e 25.02.2020) in the State of Gujarat is as follows:<Figures in LMT>Rabi 2019-20 (01.10.2019 to 25.02.2020)	Pro Rata Requirement	Availability	DBT Sales   Urea	                                            9.75	    13.39	11.11   P&K*	                                            4.54	    11.07	6.42                                                              Source: e-urvarak Dashboard*P&K group of fertilizers consists of DAP, MOP and NPKS fertilizers. It can be seen from the above table that availability of Urea and P&K fertilizers against sales and requirement is sufficient/ adequate in Gujarat and there is no shortage of fertilizers.(b):     Following steps are being taken by the Government to ensure timely supply of adequate fertilizers to the farmers across the country:Before the commencement of each cropping season, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), in consultation with all the State Governments, assesses the requirement of fertilizers. After assessment of requirement, DAC&FW projects month-wise requirement of fertilizers. On the basis of month-wise & state-wise projection given by DAC&FW, Department of Fertilizers allocates sufficient/ adequate quantities of fertilizers to States by issuing monthly supply plan and continuously monitors the availability through following system: (i)	The movement of all major subsidized fertilizers is being monitored throughout the country by an on-line web based monitoring system called integrated Fertilizer Monitoring System (iFMS);(ii)	The State Governments are regularly advised to coordinate with manufacturers and importers of fertilizers for streamlining the supplies through timely placement of indents for railway rakes through their state institutional agencies like Markfed etc.(iii)	Regular Weekly Video Conference is conducted jointly by Department of Agriculture & Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), Department of Fertilizers (DoF), and Ministry of Railways with State Agriculture Officials and corrective actions are taken to dispatch fertilizer as indicated by the State Governments. (iv)	The gap between demand (requirement) and production is met through imports. The import for the season is also finalised well in advance to ensure timely availability. Further, to maintain the availability of fertilizers in all parts of the State/ UTs, the monitoring of supply is being carried out by the senior officers of the Government at State and district level so that artificial scarcity cannot be created.(c) & (d):  The Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change has taken various steps for controlling discharge of toxic chemicals into rivers like•	Formulation and notification of general as well as industry specific effluent standards for various industrial sectors, which are enforced by State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) and Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) for UTs through consent mechanism and regular monitoring.•	CPCB has established a network of water quality monitoring stations on aquatic resources across the country.•	CPCB has issued directions to all 17 category of highly polluting industries and Grossly Polluting Industries (GPI) in Ganga basin States to install Online Effluent/ Emission Monitoring System (OCEMS) with connectivity to SPCBs concerned and CPCB for real-time monitoring of discharge of effluents and emission.•	CPCB has started inspection of 17- category of highly polluting industries since 2016 onwards based on the alerts generated by Online Continuous Emission/ Effluent Monitoring Systems (OCEMS). Based on the inspection finding, directions are issued under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to non-complying industries, which includes show-cause as well as closure.******
