ANSWER




(a) & (b):  Bulk drugs accounted for 63% of the total pharmaceutical imports in the country during 2019-20. India imports bulk drugs largely for economic considerations. The following are major countries from which India imported APIs during 2019-20.  S. No.	Country	Percentage share of import1	CHINA P RP	68.042	U S A	3.533	ITALY	3.024	SINGAPORE	2.885	SPAIN	2.176	GERMANY	1.857	FRANCE	1.568	JAPAN	1.539	DENMARK	1.2610	HONG KONG	1.25 Source: DGCIS, Kolkata(c) & (f) : With a view to attain self-reliance and reduce import dependence in APIs/ Bulk drugs, the department of pharmaceuticals has rolled two schemes viz. (i) “Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for promotion of domestic manufacturing of critical Key Starting Materials (KSMs)/ Drug Intermediates (DIs) and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) In India” and (ii) "Promotion of Bulk Drug Parks". The guidelines of both the schemes were released on 27th July, 2020.(d) & (e):  Under the scheme ‘Promotion of Bulk Drug Parks’ financial assistance will be provided to the State implementing agencies for creation of common infrastructure facilities in Bulk Drug Parks to be developed by State Governments. Three Bulk Drug parks will be financed under the scheme. States will be selected on the basis of scores obtained by the proposals submitted by the states on a predefined selection criteria ( given in the scheme guidelines available on the website of the department under the tab titled ''schemes''). A State Implementing Agency has to be a legal entity set up for the purpose of developing the Bulk Drug Park and having minimum 51% equity of the State government. No proposal has been submitted by the state government of Tamil Nadu. States can submit proposals under this scheme within a period of 60 days from the date of issuance of the scheme guidelines (guidelines were issued on 27th July, 2020). xxxxx
