As per the provisions of the Rules, only the non-usable, non-recyclable, non-biodegradable, non-combustible and non-reactive inert waste and pre-processing rejects and residues from waste processing facilities are allowed to go to sanitary landfill sites. The rules further stipulate that every effort shall be made to recycle or reuse the rejects to achieve the desired objective of zero waste going to landfill.Further, the Rules prescribe setting up of material recovery facilities with sufficient space for sorting of recyclable materials; collection of waste from vegetable, fruit,flower, meat, poultry and fish markets and promotionof setting up of decentralized compost plant or bio-methanation plant at suitable locations; facilitating construction, operation and maintenance of solid waste processing facilities and associated infrastructure including the following:i.	bio-methanation, microbial composting, vermi-composting, anaerobic digestion or any other appropriate processing for bio-stabilization of biodegradable wastes;ii.	waste to energy processes including refused derived fuel for combustible fraction of waste or supply as feedstock to solid waste based power plants or cement kilns;The Urban Development Department in the States and Union Territories are mandated to ensure implementation of provisions of these rules by all local authorities.
