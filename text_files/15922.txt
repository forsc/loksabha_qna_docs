Further, the Government has been implementing a number of skill development schemes/programmes across 22 Central Ministries/Departments for training over 40 crore people in India in different skills by 2022. The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship has been implementing Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY-2016-2020) which envisages to train one crore persons including 40 lakhs under Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL).As on 17.01.2020, 40.27 lakh candidates have been trained under short term training (STT) and 33.20 lakh candidates have been oriented under Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) across the country.Further, the Ministry under its Jan ShikshanSansthan (JSS ) Scheme has trained 6.64 lakh persons during the last three years i.e. 2017-18 to 2019-20.  So far as long term skilling is concerned, 38.74 lakhs persons have been trained under Craftsman Training Schemes (CTS) of Industrial Technical Institutes (ITIs) during 2016-17 to 2018-19.It may be added here that PMKVY 1.0 was implemented for one year during the financial year 2015-16 whereas PMKVY 2.0 is being implemented during the period 2016-20.
