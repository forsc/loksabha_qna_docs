                                                        MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a)to (c) A statement has been laid on the Table of the House.    *****Statement referred to in reply to part (a) to (c) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No.85 due for reply on 07.02.2020 by Shri Talari Rangaiah regarding Social Forestry Schemes(a)	to (c) The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) encourages plantation in the country including various metropolitan cities through various programmes and schemes such as Nagar Van Udyan Yojana, School Nursery Yojana, etc. which promotes urban forestry, tree plantation on vacant lands and bunds on farm lands etc. by involving local communities, educational institutions, local bodies, etc. Further, the following steps taken by the Government contribute to preservation and development of forest areas in the country including in the metropolitan cities:i.	For preservation and protection of forest & wildlife, various laws including the Forest (Conservation) Act 1980, Indian Forest Act, 1927, Wildlife Protection Act 1972, and other central/state laws as applicable to a State/UT, are implemented by the respective State Government /UT Administration. The Ministry also provides financial supports to the States /UTs under Forest Fire Prevention and Management Scheme for protection against forest fire.ii.	The MoEFCC is implementing two major afforestation schemes namely National Afforestation Programme (NAP) for tree plantation in degraded forests through people’s participation and National Mission for a Green India (GIM), under which in addition to other sub-missions, there is a specificsub-mission for enhancing tree cover in urban andperi-urban areas. An area over 2 million hectare was sanctioned for taking up afforestation in the States/Union Territories (UTs) with an investment of about Rs.3874 crore under NAP since its launching year 2000 and under GIM an amount of about Rs. 300 crore has been released to States/UTssince 2011-12 to 2018-19. During current financial year (2019-20) an amount of Rs. 128 crores has been released to various States for taking up plantations.iii.	The MoEFCC encourages plantation/ afforestation through people’s participation under School Nursery Yojana and Nagar Van Udyan Yojanathat were started in 2015-16. An amount of Rs. 1.54 crore (for 505 school nurseries)& Rs. 51.24 crore (for 46 Nagar Van Udyans) respectively have been released under these schemes.iv.	Urban forestry is a permissible activity under the provisions of Compensatory Fund Act, 2016 and the Rules made thereunder. The Government of India has disbursed an amount of Rs.47,436 crore from National Fund to 27 State funds as share of respective States as per Compensatory Fund Act, 2016. v.	MoEFCC also advised States/UTs to take up tree plantation under various schemes, and on all available vacant land within and outside forest areas by involving local communities, educational institutions, NGOs, local bodies etc. vi.	As per information received from Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), 1437 No. of parks over 2628 acres of land have been developed in the Mission cities. In addition, 775 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) have participated in the recently launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) for water conservation. The ULBs have undertaken various plantation programs under the JSA, including plantation along road sides, around water bodies, vacant public spaces, etc. vii.	Further, tree plantation, being a multi-departmental, multi-agency activity, are also being taken up cross-sectorally under various programmes/funding sources of other ministries/ organizations and also through State Plan budgets.Implementation of various afforestation measures and concerted efforts of various agencies have resulted in maintainingan increasing trend in forest and tree cover which is evident from the India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2019 released recently showing an increase of 5,188 square kilometres of forest and tree cover in the country compared to the ISFR 2017.*****
