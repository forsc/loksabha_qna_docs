                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) & (b):	 The Global Social Mobility Index 2020 released by the World Economic Forum, available on the website, has neither been communicated to Ministry of Labour and Employment nor the comments were sought on the issues on which such ranking has been assigned. Government of India has taken several initiatives for bringing transparency and accountability through reforms and enforcement of labour laws, with the objective of strengthening the safety, security, health, social security for every worker and bringing ease of compliance for running an establishment to catalyze creation of employment opportunities. These initiatives include governance reforms through use of e-governance measures and legislative reforms by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the existing labour laws into 4 labour codes. Contd..2/-:: 2 ::The Code on Wages, 2019 ensures minimum wages along with timely payment of wages to all the employees and workers. India has jumped to 63rd position among 190 countries in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business 2020 Report. In order to encourage employment of women, a number of protective provisions have been incorporated in various labour laws for creating congenial work environment for women workers. These includes child care centers, time-off for feeding children, enhancement in paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks, provisions for mandatory crèche facility in the establishments having 50 or more employees, permitting women workers in the night shifts with adequate safety measures, etc. *******
