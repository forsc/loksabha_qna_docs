ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is implementing a flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) to impart short duration skill development training to youth of the country including artisans and craftsmen. Under PMKVY, training has been imparted in various job roles of 37 different sectors including job roles of traditional arts and crafts under Handicrafts and Carpet Sector Skill Council (HCSSC). Under PMKVY 2.0, traditional arts and crafts were promoted by giving flexibility to the States/UTs for allocating upto 25% of their total allocated target for the skill training in State specific job roles and the sector of local traditional arts and crafts.Presently, PMKVY 3.0 is a demand driven scheme with bottom-up approach and District Skill Committees (DSCs) have been entrusted with the task of identifying local demand, based on which training has been arranged in the district which strengthens the local skill capability including traditional arts and crafts. Under PMKVY, as on 31.12.2021 since 2016, 2,62,880 candidates have been trained/oriented (20,196 trained under STT and 2,42,684 oriented under RPL) in various traditional job roles in the country. These job roles are Bamboo Basket Maker, Bamboo Mat Weaver, Beading Artisans, Carpet Weaving, Carving Artisans, Tarakashi Jeweller, Decorative Painter, Sketching & Painting Artisans, Hand Rolled Agarbatti Maker, Crochet Lace Trailers, Hand Embroiderer etc.In the recent time post-COVID, the Ministry has developed several special skilling projects under PMKVY targeting marginalized and vulnerable groups such as street vendors and artisans’ clusters to deliver skills in the clusters of demand in partnership with private sector in a manner where 100% artisans are ensured employment. Under this, special project to revive the traditional Namda craft of Jammu & Kashmir and Upskilling of Weavers & Artisans on traditional crafts of Nagaland and Jammu and Kashmir are being implemented.Additionally, under long term skilling Directorate General of Training under Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is conducting various schemes to impart vocational training to prospective youth of the country including artisans under Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS) through a network of Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) / collaboration of ITIs and Industries /Establishments. Scheme wise breakup of courses is as under:  S. No.	Name of Scheme	Number of courses1.		Craftsmen Training Scheme	1422.		Apprenticeship Training Scheme 	2663.		Crafts Instructors Training Scheme (CITS) 	534.		Flexi MoU Scheme 	165.		Short Term Training 	146.		Advanced Diploma (Vocational) 	04(b)	In view of (a) above, question does not arise.(c)	In order to enhance the income of artisans and craftsmen of traditional clusters of the country and towards making India a 5 trillion economy, Ministry is already implementing various skilling schemes to improve the productivity of skilled artisans and weavers, which leads to enhance the earning capacities of artisans and weavers to ensure sustainable livelihood.
