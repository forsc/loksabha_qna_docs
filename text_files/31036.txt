Marketing events, Quiz Contests etc. were organised to popularize handlooms, stimulating interest of the Indian public and creation of sales opportunities for the weavers.(c):	The Government imparts various training programmes and schemes for promotion, development and employment for artisans of handicraft sector under “National Handicraft Development Programme (NHDP)” and Comprehensive Handicrafts Cluster Development Scheme (CHCDS).***
