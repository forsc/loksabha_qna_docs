ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PG & PENSIONS AND IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE(DR. JITENDRA SINGH):(a)		Yes, Sir.(b)	Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Center (IN-SPACe) is launched for handholding, promoting, authorizing and regulating private space activities. In order to promote private investment and innovation in the space sector, access to ISRO technology, expertise and facilities which are capital intensive and otherwise not available elsewhere in the country will be given at free of cost wherever feasible or at reasonable cost to private entities. The existing sector specific policies in space domain will be revised and new policies will be brought in by government to bring in predictable policy and regulatory environment to private players. IN-SPACe will bring in promotional measures within ambit of the above policy and legal framework set forth by government.  Apart from this, DOS will nurture Indian space industries by sharing its experiences on quality and reliability protocols, documentation and testing procedures. ISRO/DOS will also identify areas to offer challenges to industries in new domains of technology and Announcement of opportunity will be made for selected science and exploration missions to private industries.(c)	The various space sector policies which are under consideration by the government together with the draft Space Activities Bill will together form the regulatory mechanisms.  IN-SPACe will be the autonomous agency in Department of Space for enabling space activities as well as usage of ISRO/DOS owned facilities by private entities. Appropriate financial mechanisms will be put in place once regulatory and institutional mechanisms are fully established.(d)	Government will allow private players to participate in end-to-end space activities including building and launching satellites, launch vehicles, establishment and/or operation of ground infrastructure and space based services/applications.****
