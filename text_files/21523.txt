                                                        National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has developed Information and Communication Technology (ICT) curriculum for teachers and students in school education. As a part of this curriculum, safety, security and ethics in the cyber world are being introduced as separate chapters in ICT, IT and Computer Science textbooksfor class 9 to 12. The cyber safety components have also been introduced into the course content of ICT curriculum for students till class 8. (b):   As per the data maintained by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Ministry of Home Affairs, a total of 7, 40 and 45 cases were registered for cyber stalking/bullying, under section 354D of Indian Penal Code, under cyber-crimes against children during the years 2017, 2018 and2019respectively. The details of State/UT wise cases reported during 2017 – 2019 are at Annexure. ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects as per the Constitution of India. States/UTs are primarily responsible for prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of crimes including cyber-crime through law enforcement machinery. The Law Enforcement Agencies take legal actions as per provision of law against offenders. To strengthen the mechanism to deal with cyber-crimes in a comprehensive and coordinated manner, the Central Government has taken steps for spreading awareness about cyber-crimes; issuance of alerts/advisories; capacity building/training of law enforcement personnel/prosecutors/ judicial officers; improving cyber forensic facilities; etc. (c) and (d): The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, notified under the Information Technology Act, 2000, provides for dealing with unlawful content appearing on intermediary platform and Online Curated Content Platforms. These rules provide for mechanism of complaint and grievance redressal. A three-level grievance redressal mechanism has been established under the rules with two levels of self-regulation, Level-I being the publisher and Level-II being the Self-Regulatory Body, and the third level being the Oversight Mechanism under the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting. The rules provide for an effective grievance redressal mechanism for receiving, processing, and time-bound disposal of public grievances related to the Code of Ethics. The publishers shall appoint a Grievance Redressal Officer based in India, who shall be responsible for the redressal of grievances received by it. The self-regulatory body would be headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court or of a High Court, or by a person of eminence from the relevant field, and can issue advisories to the publisher.*******AnnexureState/UT-wise cases registered under Cyber Stalking/Bullying under Cyber-crime against Children (Sec 354D IPC r/w IT Act) during 2017-2019S.
