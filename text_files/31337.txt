ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) The details of road length constructed in Rajasthan under various interventions/verticals of Pradhan Matri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), district-wise including Alwar, Banswara and Dungarpur districts are given in Annexure.(b) Rural roads under PMGSY are constructed and maintained  as per the technical specifications and geometric design standards given in the Ministry of Rural Development Specifications for Rural Roads, Rural Roads Manual of the Indian Roads Congress (IRC) (IRC-SP:20) and also, where required, the Hill Road Manual (IRC:SP:48) and other relevant IRC Codes & Manuals. (c)  The State Technical Agencies (STAs) scrutinize the project proposals prepared by the State Governments and provide technical support to them. Ministry has also identified reputed Technical and Research Institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) as Principal Technical Agencies (PTAs) for various groups of States, which scrutinize at least 10% of the proposals. Once the proposals are received from the State, National Rural Infrastructure Development Agency (NRIDA), which has been set-up by the Ministry to provide technical and management support to the programme, further scrutinizes DPRs on a sample basis. The states are required to modify the project reports based on the technical observations of the STA/ PTA/ NRIDA. The proposals are then submitted for scrutiny in a Pre-Empowered Committee Meeting chaired by the Additional/ Joint Secretary & Director General, NRIDA. Thereafter, the proposal is placed before the Empowered Committee chaired by the Secretary, Department of Rural Development. The recommendations of the Empowered Committee are submitted to the Minister of Rural Development and in case the proposals meet the programme requirements, the same are sanctioned. Every road constructed under the scheme is required to undergo quality control checks.  There is a three-tiered Quality Control mechanism for the purpose.  Under the first tier, the Programme Implementation Units (PIUs) are required to ensure process control through mandatory tests on material and workmanship at the field laboratory.  The second tier is a structured independent quality monitoring at the State level through State Quality Monitors (SQMs) to ensure that every work is inspected at initial stage, intermediate stage and the final stage of construction.  Under the third tier, independent National Quality Monitors (NQMs) are deployed for random inspection of road and bridge works by the Central Government. (d) The PMGSY has inbuilt mechanism for consultation with public representatives at planning, selection of roads and monitoring stages.  As per the programme guidelines of the latest phase of the programme, i.e., PMGSY-III, the proposals received from the Members of Parliament with regard to selection of roads are given full consideration and such proposals that cannot be included are communicated in writing to the Members of Parliament with reasons for non-inclusion of such proposal in each case. In order to ensure that the State Government give due attention towards provisions of the programme guidelines while submitting the proposals to the Ministry of Rural Development for sanction, the Ministry has issued an advisory to the States on 2nd June, 2020. The State Governments have been advised, inter-alia, to communicate the final list of proposals in the order of priority to the Member of Parliament with the reasons for non-inclusion of certain roads in the proposals and obtain their consent on the proposals sent for approval. (e) As per PMGSY guidelines, maintenance of roads constructed under the programme is the responsibility of the State Government concerned.  As reported by the State Government of Rajasthan, the condition of the roads sanctioned/ completed under PMGSY in the State, including in the districts of Banswara and Dungarpur are good.  In Banswara district, out of 10 projects inspected by NQM in last one year, 8 projects were graded satisfactory and necessary action has been taken by the State Government in remaining 2 projects as per the observations of NQM. In Dungarpur district 22 projects were inspected by NQM in last one year, out of which 20 projects were graded satisfactory and necessary action as per the observations of NQM has been taken on remaining two projects. (f) & (g) The tendering and execution as also the maintenance of projects under PMGSY is the responsibility of the State Government concerned. As reported by the State Government of Rajasthan, no complaint of carelessness in the repair work of PMGSY projects in Rajasthan has been received. During the last two years (December, 2019 to November, 2021), 154 maintenance works were inspected by the NQMs, out of which only 9 works were graded as Unsatisfactory (5.84%). The State Government has also intimated that no contractor has been blacklisted for PMGSY works in the State.  *****
