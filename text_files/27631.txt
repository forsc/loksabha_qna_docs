ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (d): Education is in the concurrent list of Constitution and most of the schools are under jurisdiction of concerned States and UTs. State and UT Governments are the appropriate Governments under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, and have the responsibility and mandate to provide school infrastructure in accordance with the norms laid down in the Schedule to the RTE Act, 2009 and as per respective State RTE Rules.As per Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+), 2019-20, 54,119 Government schools are having dilapidated building blocks. 21 Kendriya Vidyalaya school buildings need repair/replacement (part/full) and the repair works in respect of these Kendriya Vidyalayas has been initiated. Presently Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) has 816 permanent school buildings and remaining 281 Kendriya Vidyalayas are functioning from temporary accommodation provided by State/Sponsoring Authority including Kendriya Vidyalaya in Mandya district of Karnataka. Minor repairs and maintenance of school buildings are regularly attended by the schools.Samagra Shiksha scheme is an integrated centrally sponsored scheme for school education which has been launched in 2018 and further extended for next five years in 2021, covers the entire gamut of school education from pre-school to class XII. Under Samagra Shiksha, States and UTs are supported for strengthening of existing Government schools, and for creation and augmentation of infrastructure facilities as per Annual Work Plan and Budget of respective State/UT. The scheme also provides for an annual recurring composite school grant varying upto Rs. 1,00,000/- per annum depending upon the number of students, for all government schools, out of which at least 10% is to be spent on activities related to Swachhata Action Plan (SAP) for hygiene and sanitation. The scheme also provides for annual maintenance and repair of existing school building, toilets and other facilities to upkeep the infrastructure in good condition.Under erstwhile Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) till 2017-18 and Samagra Shiksha effective from 2018-19, construction of 3.15 lakh school buildings and 18.92 lakh additional classrooms have been sanctioned to States and UTs for Elementary schools, out of which States and UTs have reported construction of 2.99 lakh school buildings, 18.25 lakh additional classrooms till 30.06.2021; 12,553 new school buildings and 53,303 additional classrooms have been sanctioned to States and UTs for Secondary schools, out of which States and UTs have reported construction of 10501 new school buildings and 44569 additional classrooms till 30.06.2021. 1,20,241 Major Repairs works have also been sanctioned to States and UTs, out of which States and UTs reported completion of 1,04,296 works.
