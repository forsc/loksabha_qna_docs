ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a)	 Floods are natural calamity that the country faces almost every year, in varying degrees of magnitude. The occurrence of floods can be attributed to various factors, including wide variations in rainfall both in time and space with frequent departures from the normal pattern, inadequate carrying capacities of rivers, river bank erosion and silting of river beds, landslides, poor natural drainage in flood prone areas, snowmelt and glacial lake out-bursts. Central Water Commission (CWC) is the nodal Organisation entrusted with the task of flood forecasting & early flood warnings in the country. As per flood forecasting network of CWC, during the last 3 years, above normal to extreme floods were witnessed in the state of Karnataka in the basins of Krishna, Cauvery and their tributaries, and West flowing rivers from Tapi to Tadri due to excess to large excess rainfall combined with extremely heavy rainfall in short duration. The summary of flood situation in Karnataka as per flood forecasting and monitoring network of CWC from 2019 to 2021 is given in Annexure-I.(b)	 The primary responsibility for disaster management rests with the State Government. The concerned State Government undertakes relief measures in the wake of natural disasters from the State Disaster Response  Fund  (SDRF) already placed at their disposal in accordance with Government of India''s approved Contd…P/2//2//items and norms. Additional assistance is provided from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) as per established procedure in case the disaster is of severe nature. Upon receipt of the request from the State Government of Karnataka for additional financial assistance from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) was constituted by this Ministry of Home Affairs and visited the State an on-the-spot assessment of damages caused by the floods/landslides of 2021. Financial assistance is considered by High Level Committee as per laid down procedure. As per IMCT’s report, 20 human lives, 419 livestock were lost and 10018 Nos. of houses/huts and 217897 ha. cropped (Agriculture +Horticulture) area have been lost/damaged in wake of flood/landslides-2021. In the meantime, Government of Karnataka has also sent a communication along with memorandum for financial assistance for flood during October-November-2021. Government has decided to depute the same team for visit to the affected areas of Karnataka. Further, the State Government of Karnataka has been allocated Rs.843.20 crore     (Rs.632.80 crore as Central Share + Rs.210.40 crore as state share) under the SDRF for 2021-22. The central share of SDRF has been released, in advance to the State of Karnataka.(c) & (d)   Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has informed that heavy rainfall activity had been one of the reason for flood in Karnataka and it had been due to weather systems like low pressure systems, cyclonic circulations etc. affecting the State in addition to strong monsoon condition in association with strong southwesterly winds over the east central Arabian Sea sometimes occurring during monsoon season (June-September). All these intense rainfall activities had been predicted well in advance to support disaster management work & mitigation measures. India Meteorological Department (IMD) is effectively functioning in the country maintaining accurate weather forecasting services along with monitoring services for early detection of natural disasters. During the past few years, IMD has been continuously improving weather prediction services in terms of accuracy, lead time and associated impact. ******ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO PART (a) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.3039 TO BE ANSWERED ON 16.12.2021 REGARDING “FLOODS IN KARNATAKA”.[Summary of Flood situation in Karnataka from 2019 to 2021Year	No. of flood forecasting station flowed in 	Reservoirs having Inflows Above threshold value	Extreme Flood	Severe Flood 	No. of Monitoring Stations other than Flood forecasting Stations which flowed in the EXTREME situation 	2019	-	1	13	132020	1	-	5	13  2021(Till Nov)	-	-	3	13*****
