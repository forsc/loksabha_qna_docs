                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a): As on 01.04.2019, 498 Railway projects including 188 New Lines, 55 Gauge Conversion and 255 Doubling Projects are in different stages of execution/planning/sanction. The total length of these projects is 49,069 Km, costing `6.75 lakh crore.  This includes 07 New Line, 01 Gauge Conversion and 02 Doubling projects of length 1014.77 km & costing `10146.48 crore falling fully/partly in the State of Haryana. The project wise details of projects are made available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in >Ministry of Railways >Railway Board >About Indian Railways >Railway Board Directorates >Finance (Budget).  (b) & (c): The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions  of working agencies/contractors etc. All these factors vary from project to project and site to site and affect the completion time and cost of the project, which is finally worked out at the completion stage. Therefore, timeline for completion of projects cannot be given.(d): These two projects have been taken up by HRIDC, JV company of Government of Haryana and Ministry of Railways for feasibility steady. The report has been shared with Government of Haryana. There is no further development since the studies have not been referred to Ministry of Railways.*****
