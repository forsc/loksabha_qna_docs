                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a) to (f) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO.350* FOR 19TH MARCH, 2021(a) The Government of India has launched the ‘Transformation of Aspirational Districts (ADs)’ initiative anchored at NITI Aayog in 112 ADs across 27 states. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) is supporting the States in implementing the Health initiatives in these districts.  (b) Since the inception of the programme in January 2018, ADs in general have shown significant improvement with respect to the Health and Nutrition indicators as highlighted under the AD program. While most of the districts have improved, some of the districts have shown very rapid progress. District wise details about the achievement in health and nutrition sector as per Champions of Change dashboard by NITI Aayog is attached as Annexure I (District wise composite score and Delta ranking as on May’18 and Jan’21).(c) As the main strategy of the program is based on convergence of existing schemes which have their own funding arrangement, large infusion of additional fund is not envisaged. However, in order to foster competitive spirit and for addressing the critical gaps, additional allocation via challenge route is provided by NITI Aayog. As of February 2021, a total of approximately Rs. 139 crores have been disbursed to 53 Aspirational Districts during FY 2019-20 and FY 2020-21 for undertaking projects in the Health & Nutrition sector by NITI Aayog based on the challenge route. The district-wise details of funds disbursed by NITI Aayog funding scheme for undertaking projects in the Health & Nutrition sector is attached as Annexure II.(d) Yes, Health and Nutrition have been assigned maximum weightage of 30%.(e) NITI Aayog has identified these relatively underdeveloped districts by ranking them on deprivation and status of other critical sectors like health and nutrition, education among others. (f)  To provide focused attention for overall development of these ADs, the government has nominated senior officers of the rank of Joint Secretary/Additional Secretary as Central Prabhari Officers for each of the 112 districts. The role of these Prabhari Officers is to guide the district administration, on basis of their long experience, for progress in all the focus areas of the program. MoHFW has developed various tools such as Health Atlas, Operational guidelines and Supportive Supervision checklists to monitor and provide technical assistance for improving the Health interventions across the ADs.Special provisions for AD program under National Health Mission include extra financial resources for ADs, relaxation of norms for hiring of manpower, flexibility to hire specialists with top up allowances and priority sanctions of infrastructure development in ADs.
