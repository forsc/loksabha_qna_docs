The States have choice to use PMJAY IT Systems or use their own IT systems and share respective data with National Health Authority. To ensure efficiency, effectiveness and reliability of the IT systems, a strong feedback, grievance and ticketing management system has been put in place to ensure taking proactive and regular inputs from beneficiaries, stakeholders and users of the IT Systems and accordingly make changes as and when required. The systems are also utilized by States/stakeholders to raise any issue faced on real-time basis resolution.These feedbacks are evaluated in detail and the changes are done on the IT Systems. Accordingly, all concerned are informed.  	A proactive check is kept on issues, if any, with the IT Systems. Region-wise as well as State-wise reviews and consultations are done on regular basis. Whatever issues are highlighted, are resolved on priority basis.In addition, a comprehensive Learning Management System is being implemented to ensure training and capacity building of all users of the system.The applications and the performance are kept under regular checks. The systems are under 24x7x365 monitoring at infrastructure (on Government Community Cloud) and systems (Application Performance Management tools being used). User-based testing is done in a regular manner.*****
