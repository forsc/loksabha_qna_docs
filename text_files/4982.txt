MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (d): The undergraduate programmes in the premier institutions such asIndian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the National Institutes of Technology(NITs) are the most sought after academic programmes. However, only few ofthem opt to pursue research after completing their B.Tech. courses. In orderto attract these meritorious students into research, Government of India, in2018 launched Prime Minister’s Research Fellows (PMRF) Scheme, whichoffers direct admission to such students in the Ph.D porgrammes in theIndian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Indian Institutes of Science Educationand Research (IISERs) and Indian Institute of Science (IISc) with attractivefellowship of Rs.70,000/- to Rs.80,000/- per month. In addition, a researchgrant of Rs.2 lakh per year is provided to the selected fellows for a period offive years to present research papers. With further modification, the schemehas been opened for eligible students from all recognizedinstitutions/universities in the country. The rate of fellowship/emoluments forother Ph.D, Junior Research Fellows (JRF) and Senior Research Fellows(SRFs) has also been revised from the existing Rs.25,000/- to Rs.31,000/- andRs. 28,000/- to Rs.35,000/- per month effective from 01.01.2019. Allstudents pursuing M.Tech. programmes in the Centrally Funded TechnicalInstitutions (CFTIs) and those affiliated with All India Council for TechnicalEducation (AICTE) are offered a monthly fellowship of Rs.12,400/-.The Department of Science & Technology has also revised the rates ofemoluments for Research Associates from the existing Rs.36,000 to 47,000/-,Rs.38,000/- to 49,000/- and Rs.40,000/- to Rs.54,000/- per month as pereligibility.
