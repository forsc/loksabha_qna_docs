                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES & PENSIONS AND PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (Dr. JITENDRA SINGH):    (a)&(b) 	No, Sir. After implementation of 6th Central Pay Commission, entry level is in Group ‘C’ and hence no Group ‘D’ recruitment is made in the Constituent Units/Public Sector Undertakings and Aided Institutions of the Department of Atomic Energy.  However, the Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL), a Public Sector Undertaking under the Department of Atomic Energy, carries out recruitment in Group ‘D’ cadre for the local people (land displaced) only as per Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy-2006 and their rules and facilities are governed by the said policy.(c)&(d) The UCIL do not have operations in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan and hence no recruitment in any cadre has been carried out in the said locations in the last three years.******
