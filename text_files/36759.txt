ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) to (c): The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has already incorporated age-appropriate contents related to tobacco, drugs and intoxicants in the syllabus, textbooks and other teaching learning materials based on extant National Curriculum Framework. The contents on Drug Abuse are discussed in the NCERT’s textbooks of Science for Class VIII, Biology for Class XII and Psychology for Classes XI and XII. Syllabus of Health and Physical Education developed by the NCERT also provides space to drug abuse with an objective to spread awareness among children. Under the Ayushman Bharat School Health and Wellness Programme (SHP), special classes and experiential learning activities like Role Play, Folk Dance, Poster making, Creative writing, Debate, Discussion and Skill Building activities are organised with school students for awareness generation on issues related to tobacco, drug / substance misuse. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has introduced Life-Skills education as a part of curriculum in the schools affiliated to it. Life-skills enable students to abstain from tobacco and other addictive substances. CBSE schools follow textbooks of NCERT which have content related to drug abuse including the ill effects of tobacco in the syllabus of Classes VIII, XI and XII. CBSE has also been issuing periodic circulars to schools affiliated to it for sensitizing all students about ill-effects of tobacco.****
