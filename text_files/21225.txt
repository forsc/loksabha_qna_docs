                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(DR. SANJEEV KUMAR BALYAN)(a)	This Department is implementing following schemes for dairy farmers with interest subvention:i.	Dairy Processing and Infrastructure Development Fund (DIDF)ii.	Support to Dairy Cooperatives and Farmer Producer Organisation (SDCFPO)iii.	Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF)(b)	The details of the schemes are as under:i.	DIDF is being implemented in the country with objective to modernize the milk processing plants and machinery and to create additional infrastructure for processing more milk since December 2017 with total outlay of Rs. 11,184 Crore and loan component of Rs. 8,004 Crore. As on 31.01.2021, 40 projects costing Rs. 4972.32 Crore have been approved with Rs. 3393.41 Crore as loan component; against which Rs. 1109.97 Crore has been disbursed to the End Borrowers (Cooperatives and Milk Producer Companies). Under this scheme milk processing capacity of 45 Lakh Litre per Day (LLPD), milk powder manufacturing capacity of 165 Metric Ton per day (MTPD), Value Added Product capacity of 6.76 LLPD (milk equivalent) and 113 Bulk Milk Coolers of 3.40 LLPD capacity have been established as on 31.01.2021ii.	SDCFPO was launched during 2017-18 with a corpus of Rs. 300 crore to be kept in perpetuity with National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) for providing soft loans for working capital to enable Cooperative Societies and farmer producer organizations to maintain a stable market access to farmers. Due to Economic Impact of Covid-19 on Dairy Sector, a new component was introduced namely “interest subvention on working capital loans for Dairy sector”  under this scheme with an outlay of Rs 203 Cr. Under this new component, 2% per annum interest subvention on working capital loan is provided and for prompt and timely repayment, additional 2% interest subvention will be payable at the end of the loan repayment period. As on 26.02.2021, Interest Subvention amount of Rs 131.49 crore has been approved against working capital loan amount of Rs 12,023.64 Cr @ 2% p.a and Rs 38.58 Cr has been released by NDDB as interest subvention amount.iii.	AHIDF: Under Aatmanirbhar Bharat package, AHIDF has been approved on 24.06.2020 with an outlay of Rs. 15,000 crore for incentivising investment by individual entrepreneurs, private companies, MSME (Medium and Small scale Enterprises), Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and section 8 companies to establish infrastructure for value addition in dairy processing, meat processing and animal feed. The scheme provides 3% interest subvention for loan upto 90% of the estimated/ actual project cost from the Scheduled Banks based on the submission of viable projects by eligible beneficiaries. This Department has started implementation of the scheme.(c)	Yes, these schemes are to be implemented throughout the country. The number of dairy farmers to be benefited from the DIDF scheme is 95 lakhs. Since the scheme SDCFPO provides working capital, there is no target set for the farmer members. However, a substantial number of farmer will be benefitted indirectly. AHIDF is a demand driven scheme and no target for farmers has been projected. (d)	Yes, these schemes are to be implemented during 2021-22. The funds allocated for these schemes as interest subvention during 2020-21 are as under: Year	(Rs in Crore)	DIDF	SDCFPO	AHIDF2020-21	10.00	100.00	77.00********
