                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) As informed by Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the State/UT-wise number of branches of Scheduled Commercial Banks in the country as on 30.09.2019 is at Annexure 1. (b) to (e) Under Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), all villages were mapped by banks into 1.59 lakh Sub-Service Areas (SSAs) with one SSA catering to 1,000 to 1,500 households. As informed by banks, while 0.33 lakh SSAs have been covered with bank branches, 1.26 lakh SSAs are covered by deployment of interoperable Business Correspondents (BCs). As per extant guidelines dated 18.5.2017 on rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy,  Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has granted  general  permission  to domestic  Scheduled  Commercial  Banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks), to  open banking outlets (a fixed point service delivery unit, manned by either bank’s staff or its Business Correspondent (BC))  at  any place  in the country, without  seeking  prior  approval of  RBI  in  each  case, subject  to at least  25 percent  of the total  number  of  banking outlets  opened  during a  financial  year being in  unbanked  rural centres i.e. centres having population less than 10,000 (Tier 5 and Tier 6 centres).Further, ten Small Finance banks and seven Payments Banks have been licensed by RBI for providing banking services across the country including the rural centres.In pursuance of RBI guidelines, rolling out of banking outlets in uncovered areas is a continuous process and looked after by State Level Bankers'' Committee (SLBC), in consultation with the concerned State Government, member banks and other stakeholders. Banks, inter-alia, consider proposals for opening banking outlets in the light of RBI’s instructions, their business plans and their commercial viability. To further assess the viability for opening a banking outlet, banks carry out survey as required. As informed by RBI, State/UT-wise number of branches opened by Commercial Banks as on 30.09.2019 along with last three years is at Annexure 2.***** 	Annexure 1Annexure as referred in reply to part (a) of the Lok Sabha unstarred  Q.
