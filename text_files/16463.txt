MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a):  Under the Scheme of Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA), during the last 5 years (2015-16 to 2019-20), the Project Approval Board (PAB) has approved Rs 9749.35 crores,with a central share of Rs. 6391.15 crores for all the States/UTs under various components. This includes Rs. 601 crores for the State of Rajasthan with a central share of Rs. 360.60 crores. The details of approvals State-wise and District-wise for the State of Rajasthan during the last five years are annexed.(b) & (c): Under RUSA, no new Greenfield Universities are set up. However, central support is provided for creation of Universities by way of up-gradation of existing autonomous colleges and creation of Universities by conversion of colleges in a cluster. A total number of 15 such Universities have been approved central support under RUSA in the last five years (1 each in Andhra Pradesh, Puducherry and Uttar Pradesh, 2 each in Jharkhand and Odisha, 4 each in Karnataka and Maharashtra). Although no new University has been approved for the State of Rajasthan under RUSA, central support amounting to Rs. 611 crore has been approved for 130 units under various components of RUSA such as Infrastructure Grants to Colleges, Infrastructure Grants to Universities, Equity Initiatives, etc.  (d): Education being in the Concurrent List, creation of new institutions and enhancing the quality of education are the responsibilities of both Central and State Governments. However, recognising the need for central assistance, the Central Government has implemented various schemes supporting State Governments. The Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) is aimed at inter-alia correcting regional imbalances in access to higher education, especially in un-served and underserved areas by setting up quality higher educational institutions and upgrading the existing ones.(e): The details of the status of execution of RUSA State-wise and district-wise for the State of Rajasthan are annexed.****
