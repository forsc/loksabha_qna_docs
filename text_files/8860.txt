ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI DANVE RAOSAHEB DADARAO)(a) to (c) :	From time to time BIS receives complaints on misuse of ISI mark.  On receipt of such complaints, investigations followed by raids are carried out.  Thereafter, prosecution is launched against the offender(s) in the Court of law having jurisdiction over the matter.   For launching prosecution regarding the misuse of ISI mark, testing of the sample of the product is not required.State wise number of search and seizure operations carried out during last three years is at Annexure-I.(d)	:	Scheme-I is the Conformity Assessment scheme for Grant of licence to use or apply Standard Mark (ISI) on goods and articles as per Indian Standard.  This scheme is governed by the provisions of BIS (Conformity Assessment) Regulations, 2018. For licences, so granted to the manufacturing units, performance is assessed through factory surveillance at periodic intervals. During the surveillance, Product samples may also be drawn and sent to third party laboratory for checking conformance to relevant standard. In addition, samples of the product bearing BIS standard mark are also purchased from the market and got tested at third party laboratory for checking conformance to relevant standard. Based on the non-conformance if any, observed from the test report, actions are initiated against manufacturer, depending on frequency of failure and considering performance of licence previously.During the last four years, number of licences cancelled because of failure of sample in testing were as under:Year	Number of licences cancelled	Number of licences cancelled because of sample failure. 2015-16	220	602016-17	351	972017-18	348	652018-19	219	21(e) :	The Central Government through issuance of various Quality Control Orders has brought 155 products under compulsory BIS certification (List enclosed as Annexure-II) and 50 Electronics, IT & Solar products under compulsory registration of BIS (List enclosed as Annexure-II). According to these Quality Control Orders, the products specified therein shall conform to relevant Indian Standards and bear standard mark under a licence from BIS. It thus ensure the quality of such products.****ANNEXURE-ISTATEMENT REFERRED IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.2529 FOR 03.12.2019 REGARDING FAKE ISI MARK.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------State-wise and year-wise statement of raids conducted for the last four years and current year (upto 25 Nov 2019).State	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20Andaman & Nicobar Islands (UT)	-	-	-	-Andhra Pradesh	03	-	04	-Arunachal Pradesh	-	-	-	-Assam	-	-	01	01Bihar	01	05	-	01Chandigarh (UT)	-	-	-	-Chhattisgarh	03	03	04	-Dadra & Nagar Haveli (UT)	-	-	-	-Daman & Diu (UT)	-	-	-	-Delhi (UT)	12	08	12	06Goa	-	01	-	01Gujarat	11	14	21	09Haryana	15	06	06	06Himachal Pradesh	-	1	01	-Jammu & Kashmir	-	-	03	-Jharkhand	01	01	04	03Karnataka	02	02	09	-Kerala	01	02	02	-Lakshadweep (UT)	-	-	-	-Madhya Pradesh	06	03	06	02Maharashtra	05	04	07	07Manipur	-	-	-	-Meghalaya	-	-	-	-Mizoram	-	-	-	-Nagaland	-	-	-	-Odisha	02	02	03	-Puducherry (UT)	-	-	-	-Punjab	03	07	04	03Rajasthan	12	06	09	01Sikkim	-	-	-	-Tamil Nadu	15	15	13	03Telangana	05	6	04	01Tripura	-	-	-	-Uttar Pradesh	06	03	03	09Uttarakhand	05	-	-	06West Bengal	06	-	08	-Total	114	89	124	59ANNEXURE-IISTATEMENT REFERRED IN REPLY TO PART (e) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.2529 FOR 03.12.2019 REGARDING FAKE ISI MARK.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------LIST OF PRODUCTS UNDER MANDATORY CERTIFICATIONSr No.	IS No.	ProductCement1.
