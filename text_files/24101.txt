                                                        MINISTER OF TRIBAL AFFAIRS(SHRI ARJUN MUNDA) a.	to f. A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. †*9 FOR 19.07.2021 RAISED BY SHRIMATI JASKAUR MEENA REGARDING "EKLAVYA MODEL RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS".a.	The concept of Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRSs) was introduced in the year 1997-98 to provide quality education to Scheduled Tribes (ST) students in remote areas in their own environment.  These schools were funded under Article 275 (1) of the Constitution, where grants are given to states.  Each school has a capacity to enroll up to 480 students from Class 6th to 12th, out of which 50% would be girls. 288 schools were sanctioned across country between 1998 and 2018.   In order to give focused attention, a separate Central Sector scheme of EMRS was carved out to improve the geographical outreach of such schools to every block with more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons. 452 such blocks have been identified for establishment of EMRS schools under the revamped scheme.  On qualitative aspect, the schools are envisaged to be brought at par with Navodaya Vidyalayas and to have special facilities for preserving local art and culture besides providing training in sports and skill development. A National Education Society for Tribal Students (NESTS) as an autonomous body under the Ministry has been setup to provide overall support and policy directions to the schools in order to bring uniformity in the administration of the schools. The State/UT EMRS Societies at the State/UT level have been set up for day-to-day management of the schools.  There are 367 functional EMRSs across the country with around 85232  students currently enrolled.  b.	and c.:  A total of 30 EMRSs have already been sanctioned for the state of Rajasthan out of which 21 EMRSs are reported to be functional. One more EMRS for the state is to be set up during the current financial year after identification of land by the State Government. No EMRS location has been identified in Dausa district as per existing criteria of the scheme. The details of identified locations and EMRS sanctioned by the Ministry is at Annexure-I.d.& e. :  During the year 2020-21, Rs. 8900 lakh was released towards construction grant and Rs. 4044.17 lakh towards recurring grants.f.	Out of 30 schools so far sanctioned for the state of Rajasthan, construction of 17 schools is complete and construction work of remaining 13 schools is under progress.  Construction agencies have been allowed time of 18 months to complete the project which also includes pre-construction activities.
