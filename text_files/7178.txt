                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (c) Ground water levels in various parts of the Country are declining because of continuous withdrawal due to reasons such as increased demand of fresh water for various uses, vagaries of rainfall, increased population, industrialization & urbanization etc.  Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) carries out ground water monitoring four times a year in different States.  In order to assess the declining/rising trend in water level on a long-term basis, pre-monsoon water level data 2019 has been compared with the decadal average (2009-2018) water level. Analysis of data indicates decline in ground water level in about 61% of the wells being monitored. State-wise details are given in Annexure which includes Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.Water being a State subject, efforts to conserve and manage ground water is primarily States responsibility. A number of States have done notable work in this regard.  Of these, mention can be made of ‘Mukhyamantri Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan’ in Rajasthan, ‘Jalyukt Shibar’ in Maharashtra, ‘Sujalam Sufalam Abhiyan’ in Gujarat, ‘Mission Kakatiya’ in Telangana, Neeru Chettu’ in Andhra Pradesh among others.Government of India launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan which is a time bound campaign with a mission mode approach intended to improve water availability including ground water conditions in the water stressed blocks of 256 districts in India. In this regard, teams of officers from Central Government along-with technical officers from Ministry of Jal Shakti were deputed to visit water stressed districts and to work in close collaboration with district level officials to undertake suitable interventions.Other steps taken by the Central Government to control water depletion and promote rain water harvesting / conservation are at the following URL: http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf***** ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) to (c) of Unstarred Q.
