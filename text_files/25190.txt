This scheme being implemented through Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), seeks to reduce the financial burden of the employers and encourages them to hire more workers. Under the scheme:•	An employee drawing monthly wage of less than Rs. 15000/- who was not working in any establishment registered with the Employees’ Provident Fund Organization (EPFO) before 1st October, 2020 is eligible for the benefit. The employees who lost their job during Covid-19 pandemic and didn’t join in any EPF covered establishment upto 30.09.2020 are also eligible for the benefit.•	Government of India is crediting for a period of two years, both the employee’s share (12% of wages) and employer’s share (12% of wages) of contribution payable or only the employee’s share, depending on employment strength of the EPFO registered establishments. •	The scheme has commenced from 1st October 2020 and shall remain open for registration of eligible employers and new employees upto 31st March, 2022. Government is paying the subsidy for two years from the date of registration.(b) & (c): As on 16.07.2021, benefit of Rs. 57.29 crore has been provided to 1.29 lakh beneficiaries through 6439 establishments in Rajasthan. The district-wise details of people registered and benefitted under the scheme in the State is at Annexure. (d) to (f): There is no specific State-wise allocation of funds under the scheme. The scheme is intended to benefit a total of 71.80 lakh beneficiaries. As on 16.07.2021, benefit of Rs. 1143.40 crore has been provided to 24.89 lakh employees through 89070 establishments under the scheme. Mass awareness has been created through large-scale publicity through seminars and workshops with both the employers & employers’ associations and employees and union representatives. Moreover, EPFO is also promoting the scheme through social media platforms. Further, to increase the coverage, the registration of beneficiaries which was initially only upto 30.06.2021 has been extended till 31.03.2022.*****
