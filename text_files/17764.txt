ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (b) : The estimation of poverty using poverty line had been done by the erstwhile Planning Commission (now NITI Ayog). The Ministry of Rural Development had been conducting Below Poverty Line (BPL) Census to identify the poor households in the rural areas. The first BPL Census was conducted in 1992, and then in the year 1997 and the last one in 2002. After 2002 BPL Census, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of poverty, Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011 (SECC 2011) was conducted in association with the States/UTs. SECC-2011 provides data of households on various aspects of their socio-economic status viz., housing, land-holding/landlessness, educational status, status of women, the differently abled, occupation, possession of assets, scheduled caste/ scheduled tribe (SC/ST) households, income, etc. The beneficiaries under several schemes of Government of India as well as many state governments are selected based on the (i) “automatically excluded households”, (ii) “automatically included households” and (iii) “deprived households” data of SECC-2011. The State/Union Territory– wise numbers of rural households in these three categories are given at Annexure-1.   (c) to (d) : No request for increase in the number of BPL families has been received from any state government.*********
