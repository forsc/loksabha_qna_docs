ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE 					(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	As per New Education Policy 2020, the professional councils, such as Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Veterinary Council of India (VCI), National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE), Council of Architecture (CoA), National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET) etc., will act as Professional Standard Setting Bodies (PSSBs). They will play a key role in the higher education system and will be invited to be members of the General Education Council (GEC). These bodies, after restructuring as PSSBs, will continue to draw the curricula, lay down academic standards and coordinate between teaching, research and extension of their domain/discipline, as members of the GEC. As members of the GEC, they would help in specifying the curriculum framework, within which Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) may prepare their own curricula. Thus, PSSBs would also set the standards or expectations in particular fields of learning and practice while having no regulatory role. All HEIs will decide how their educational programmes respond to these standards, among other considerations, and would also be able to reach out for support from these standard-setting bodies or PSSBs, if needed. In this context ICAR is responsible to oversee, regulate and facilitate agricultural education and research in the country.(b)	The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) under Department of Agricultural Research and Education (DARE), Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India is the apex body for co-ordinating, guiding and managing research and education in agriculture including horticulture, fisheries and animal sciences in the entire country.*******
