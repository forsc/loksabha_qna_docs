Therefore, complaints, if any, are forwarded to State/UT Governments for taking appropriate action.  Details of such complaints and action taken by respective State/UT are not maintained Centrally.Government of India has enacted the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010 (CE Act, 2010) and notified Clinical Establishments (Central Government) Rules, 2012, as emended in 2018 and 2020 thereunder, which prescribe conditions for registration and regulation of clinical establishments (both Government and Private) in the country.  As per the Act, among other conditions the clinical establishments in the States/UTs which have adopted the Act, are required to display the rates charged for each type of service provided and facilities available in the local as well as in English language at a conspicuous place for the benefit of the patients.
