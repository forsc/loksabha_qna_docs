However, in order to reduce the out-of-pocket expenses  of the people particularly poor people of the country, the Government of India has  taken several steps which inter-alia include: Government of India launched Ayushman Bharat Yojana in 2018 comprising of two components namely: I. Provision of Comprehensive Primary 	Healthcare through Health and Wellness 	Centres (HWCs) and II. Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY).

Under the PMJAY, coverage upto Rs 5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation to over 10 crore poor and vulnerable families (approx. 50 crore persons) is envisaged. This scheme covers poor and vulnerable families based on deprivation and occupational criteria as per Socio Economic Caste Census data.	In addition, the ongoing schemes of NHM, PMSSY etc. also strive to reduce financial burden incurred by the population on health.(d) The MOHFW does not maintain district-wise data on expenditure on primary heathcare centres.
