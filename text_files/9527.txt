The salient features of the  Abhiyaan inter-alia include ensuring convergence with various programmes; incentivizing States/ Union Territories for achieving targeted goals; Information and Communication Technology enabled Integrated Child Development Services-Common Application Software; Evaluation by NITI Aayog; Setting up of National Nutrition Resource  Centre (NNRC) at National level and State Nutrition Resource Centre (SNRC) in each State/Union Territory; Community Mobilization & Behaviour Change & Communication, Awareness Advocacy  and Information Education Communication; Jan Andolan by educating people on nutritional aspects; Innovation; Strengthening human resource;  measuring height and weight of children below 6 years of age for early detection of stunting and wasting;  strengthening of Training & Capacity Building etc. (b)	The results of the POSHAN Abhiyaan can be known after the programme has completed its approved period.  However, in the meantime, as per the report of Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) conducted by UNICEF, prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight among children is 34.7%, 17% and 33.4% respectively, which is an improvement and reduction from the levels reported in National Family Health Survey-4.(c)	The main purpose of the POSHAN Abhiyaan is to improve the nutritional status of children and reduce the level of under-nutrition.
