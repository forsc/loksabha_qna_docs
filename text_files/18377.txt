The copy of the order passed by the Hon’ble Supreme is placed as Annexure II.   Stickers are being affixed through vehicle manufacturers and their dealers but there is little progress with regard to old vehicles. Accordingly, EPCA in September 2019 had filed a Report No. 103 “Delay in implementation of colour-coded stickers on vehicles as directed by the Hon’ble Court vide its order dated 13.8.2018” in the Hon’ble Supreme Court (copy enclosed as Annexure III).(b)	The ban on operation of BS VI Diesel vehicles may not be required in view of the similar mass emission standards for particulate matter as that of petrol/ CNG vehicles.****
