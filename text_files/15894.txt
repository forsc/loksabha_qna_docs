                                                        (a)	Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) have already filed Counter affidavits before the Hon’ble Supreme Court in WP(C) No. 109/2008 and IA No.5 of 2014 in WP(C) No. 109/2008 in the matter of Wildlife First and Others Vs UOI & Others defending the Constitutional validity of Forrest Right Act (FRA).(b)	In the context of orders of Hon’ble Supreme Court dated 13.02.2019 in W.P.(C) No. 109 of 2008, MoTA has filed affidavit inter-alia indicating that, “...under the Act, the rejection of a claim does not ipso facto lead to eviction of a tribal. There is no provision in the Act that provides for eviction after a claim is rejected. If a claim is rejected, then the appropriate state government would be obliged to resort to appropriate provisions to evict a person from the forest in accordance with law”.  (c)   As per Forest Rights Act, 2006 and the rules made thereunder, the State Governments are responsible for implementation of the Act.  As per information received from the State Governments, the overall and State wise status of implementation of Forest Rights Act, 2006 is given as Annexed.
