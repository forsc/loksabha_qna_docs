                                                        (a)	to (c): With the borderless cyberspace coupled with the anonymity along with rapid growth of mobile telephone and connectivity including growth of number of users on Internet and smartphone as well as ease of committing cyber crime by anyone, anytime from anywhere in the world, rise in cyber crime is a global phenomenon. As per the data maintained by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Ministry of Home Affairs, a total of 21796, 27248 and 44546 cybercrime cases were registered during the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively. Latest data pertains to 2019. The State/UT wise cybercrime data for 2017, 2018 and 2019, as reported by NCRB, is at Annexure-I.“Police” and “Public Order” are State subjects as per the Constitution of India; and prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of crimes; and capacity building of police personnel are primarily responsibility of States. The Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) take legal action as per provisions of law against the cyber crime offenders. However, Government of India helps States in combating cyber crimes by assisting them through advisories and funds under various schemes. In this regard, Government has taken a number of legal, technical and administrative measures to prevent cyber crimes.  These inter alia, include:(i)	Enactment of the Information Technology Act, 2000 which has provisions to deal with prevalent cybercrimes.  Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 empowers Government to block any information generated, transmitted, received, stored or hosted in any computer resource in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above.(ii)	National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal, www.cybercrime.gov.in launched by Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) enables citizens to online report complaints pertaining to all types of cyber crimes with special focus on cyber crimes against women and children. Complaints reported on this portal are attended by the respective Law Enforcement Authorities of States. A nation-wide helpline number [155260] is also made functional to help the public in filing complaints through the portal.(iii)	Cyber Coordination Centre (CyCord) portal has been launched to provide a platform to the Law Enforcement Agencies and other stakeholders to collaborate and coordinate their efforts to resolve cyber crime, and for other cyber related issues like sharing case studies / research findings, experience sharing, formulation of research problems, finding solutions to complex cyber issues, etc.********  	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Annexure-IState/UT-wise Cases Registered (CR), Cases Chargesheeted (CCS), Cases Convicted (CON), Persons Arrested (PAR), Persons Chargesheeted (PCS) and Persons Convicted (PCV) under Cyber Crimes during 2017-2019SL	State/UT	2017	2018	2019		CR	CCS	CON	PAR	PCS	PCV	CR	CCS	CON	PAR	PCS	PCV	CR	CCS	CON	PAR	PCS	PCV1	Andhra Pradesh	931	198	4	388	269	5	1207	243	10	522	412	14	1886	235	3	452	344	52	Arunachal Pradesh	1	0	0	0	0	0	7	0	0	0	0	0	8	0	0	1	0	03	Assam	1120	179	0	1261	726	0	2022	201	3	1730	224	3	2231	349	13	1636	733	134	Bihar	433	251	2	884	265	3	374	229	0	357	330	0	1050	288	4	1014	519	175	Chhattisgarh	171	78	9	128	127	9	139	78	3	118	109	3	175	94	13	139	136	196	Goa	13	4	0	1	6	0	29	2	1	3	3	1	15	20	0	3	25	07	Gujarat	458	190	0	472	437	0	702	334	0	786	647	0	784	447	0	1083	1064	08	Haryana	504	130	11	211	197	12	418	184	5	260	252	5	564	188	6	314	288	109	Himachal Pradesh	56	15	2	34	17	2	69	25	0	19	27	0	76	20	2	44	24	210	Jammu & Kashmir	63	11	0	17	12	0	73	14	0	19	19	0	73	18	0	22	22	011	Jharkhand	720	115	3	368	155	3	930	186	34	450	362	38	1095	344	19	402	568	1912	Karnataka	3174	130	0	294	163	0	5839	139	1	378	198	1	12020	111	9	446	183	1013	Kerala	320	144	8	240	159	9	340	203	8	298	256	12	307	176	2	220	214	214	Madhya Pradesh	490	349	7	544	548	9	740	575	19	735	808	25	602	405	18	659	531	2415	Maharashtra	3604	720	11	1716	1196	10	3511	1052	10	2118	1449	22	4967	980	7	1739	1470	916	Manipur	74	0	0	25	0	0	29	0	0	8	0	0	4	0	0	8	0	017	Meghalaya	39	1	0	8	1	0	74	0	0	12	0	0	89	2	0	3	3	018	Mizoram	10	7	2	10	7	2	6	2	0	3	2	0	8	4	0	5	5	019	Nagaland	0	0	0	0	0	0	2	1	0	2	1	0	2	0	0	0	0	020	Odisha	824	143	1	200	200	1	843	219	0	254	284	0	1485	220	0	316	351	021	Punjab	176	60	2	223	111	2	239	80	5	258	118	7	243	90	5	259	118	922	Rajasthan	1304	184	5	374	357	5	1104	232	2	418	411	3	1762	312	35	571	556	4123	Sikkim	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	1	0	2	1	0	3	2	024	Tamil Nadu	228	70	0	208	99	0	295	131	11	326	185	11	385	113	8	400	161	1025	Telangana	1209	266	1	808	428	1	1205	480	0	699	601	0	2691	847	10	748	1564	1126	Tripura	7	1	0	3	1	0	20	0	0	4	0	0	20	4	0	1	5	027	Uttar Pradesh	4971	1700	79	2726	2576	83	6280	2325	373	3437	3238	445	11416	3705	201	4324	5258	27228	Uttarakhand	124	47	1	55	58	2	171	55	2	92	75	3	100	40	1	71	72	129	West Bengal	568	133	1	266	99	1	335	186	3	159	198	3	335	186	3	159	198	3 	TOTAL STATE(S)	21593	5126	149	11464	8214	159	27004	7177	490	13466	10210	596	44395	9199	359	15042	14414	47730	A&N Islands	3	2	0	1	2	0	7	9	0	2	13	0	2	0	0	0	0	031	Chandigarh	32	13	1	30	20	1	30	13	3	13	13	3	23	9	5	14	14	632	D&N Haveli	1	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	033	Daman & Diu	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	3	0	0	1	0	034	Delhi	162	38	2	105	69	2	189	32	2	83	49	2	115	58	2	147	80	235	Lakshadweep	0	0	0	0	0	0	4	0	0	2	0	0	4	0	0	0	0	036	Puducherry	5	0	0	0	0	0	14	3	0	3	3	0	4	3	0	8	8	0 	TOTAL UT(S)	203	54	3	137	92	3	244	57	5	103	78	5	151	70	7	170	102	8 	TOTAL (ALL INDIA)	21796	5180	152	11601	8306	162	27248	7234	495	13569	10288	601	44546	9269	366	15212	14516	485Source: Crime in India	 	Note : Due to non-receipt of data from West Bengal in time for 2019, Data furnished for 2018 has been used(a)	to (c): With the borderless cyberspace coupled with the anonymity along with rapid growth of mobile telephone and connectivity including growth of number of users on Internet and smartphone as well as ease of committing cyber crime by anyone, anytime from anywhere in the world, rise in cyber crime is a global phenomenon.
