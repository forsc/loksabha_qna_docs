ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a)	Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) has informed that at present 59 Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) are functioning in the State of Maharashtra.  District-wise details are at Annexure-I. (b)	The State / UT-wise details of KVs opened / constructed during the last three years and current years are at Annexure-II. (c) to (e) The Ministry of Tribal Affairs has informed that it has been decided to set up Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS) in every block having 50% or more Schedule Tribe population and at least 20,000 or more tribal persons by the year 2022. A total number of 452 such blocks / sub-districts without an EMRS have been identified in the country, out of which 300 schools have already been sanctioned from 2018-19 to 2020-21. The remaining 152 blocks are to be covered by 2022.Department of School Education and Literacy is implementing Samagra Shiksha - an Integrated Scheme for School Education (ISSE). Bridging gender and social category gaps at all levels of school education is one of the major objectives of the Integrated Scheme. Consequently, the Integrated Scheme attempts to  reach  out  to  girls,  and  children  belonging  to  SC,  ST,  Minority  communities  and transgender.  The Integrated Scheme also focuses on the identified Special Focus Districts (SFDs) on the basis of adverse performance on various indicators of enrolment, retention, and gender parity, as well as concentration of SC, ST and minority communities.  To reduce gender gaps at all levels of school education and for providing quality education to girls from disadvantaged groups, Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBVs) have been sanctioned in Educationally Backward Blocks (EBBs) under Samagra Shiksha. KGBVs are residential schools from class VI to XII for girls belonging to disadvantaged groups such as SC, ST, OBC, Minority and Below Poverty Line (BPL). Target Group for KGBVs is the Girls in the age group of 10-18 years aspiring to study in classes VI to XII belonging to SC, ST, OBC, Minority communities and BPL families.Under Samagra Shiksha, total 5726 KGBVs have been sanctioned in the country out of which 4886 KGBVs are operational with the enrolment of 6.07 lakh girls as on 11.01.2021.844 KGBVs have been sanctioned in 109 Schedule Tribe Special Focus Districts (ST SFDs) having 25% and above ST population out of which 657 are operational with the enrolment of 64.89% ST Girls.******
