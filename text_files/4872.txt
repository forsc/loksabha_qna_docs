                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (d):	As per the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) “Three-year Report of Population Based Cancer Registries: 2012-2014, Bengaluru, 2016”, the estimated number of incidence of cancer cases in the country reported during last three years, State/UT wise, is at Annexure-I. To enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer, the Central Government is implementing Strengthening of Tertiary Care Cancer facilities scheme to support setting up of State Cancer Institutes (SCI) and Tertiary Care Cancer Centres (TCCC) in different parts of the country. Under the scheme, 63 proposals for setting up SCIs and TCCCs were received from State Governments, out of which proposals for 16 SCIs and 20 TCCCs have been approved as per the details at Annexure-II. The deficiencies in rest of the proposals, including proposals for setting up of SCI at Bilaspur and TCCC at District Koriya, received from the Government of Chhattisgarh, were communicated to the respective State Governments. In the meanwhile, approval for continuation of the scheme till year 2020, received in February 2019, provides for setting up of 4 new SCIs, including one at Bilaspur. As per this approval, there is no provision for setting up of new TCCCs in States/UTs. Therefore, the proposal of TCCC from Chhattisgarh cannot be considered.27 Regional Cancer Centres were also set up under the erstwhile National Cancer Control Programme. Oncology is one of the focus areas in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojna (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar (Haryana) and second campus of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata has also been approved. All these will enhance the capacity for prevention and treatment of cancer in the country.
