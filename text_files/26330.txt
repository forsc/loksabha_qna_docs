ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (e): A statement is laid on the table of the House.*****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) to (e) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 198 FOR REPLY ON 02.08.2021 ASKED BY SHRI SANJAY JADHAV, HON’BLE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT REGARDING INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM(a): Yes Sir. Implementation of National Education Policy 2020 is led by various bodies including State/UT Government. Education being a subject matter of concurrent list of Constitution, it will need careful planning, joint monitoring, and collaborative implementation between the Centre and States. The policy provides different timelines as well as principles and methodology for its implementation. Accordingly, Ministry and other implementing agencies under its purview have started taking initiatives towards implementation of NEP 2020.(b): One of the fundamental principles of NEP 2020 is ‘substantial investment in a strong, vibrant public education system as well as the encouragement and facilitation of true philanthropic private and community participation’. Accordingly, NEP 2020 unequivocally endorses and envisions a substantial increase in public investment in education by both the Central government and all State Governments to reach 6% of GDP. The Policy also calls for the rejuvenation, active promotion, and support for private philanthropic activity in the education sector. In particular, over and above the public budgetary support which would have been otherwise provided to them, any public institution can take initiatives towards raising private philanthropic funds to enhance educational experiences.(c) to (e): To make India a global education destination, NEP 2020 provides for facilitation of research/teaching collaborations and faculty/student exchanges with high-quality foreign institutions. NEP 2020 also encourages high performing Indian universities to set up their campuses in other countries, and similarly, selected universities e.g., those from among the top 100 universities in the world will be facilitated to operate in India. Guidelines for Internationalisation of Higher Education have been announced on 29.07.2021.NEP 2020 aims to ensure that no student loses any opportunity to learn and excel because of the circumstances of birth or background. It proposes special emphasis to be given on Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Groups (SEDGs). The NEP 2020 reaffirms that bridging the social category gaps in access, participation, and learning outcomes in both school and higher education will continue to be one of the major goals of all education sector development programmes.The universities are autonomous bodies which are governed by their respective Acts / Statutes etc. Based on the type of universities, the criteria for fee structure is administered. AICTE has issued instructions that institutions shall not directly or indirectly demand or charge capitation fee or demand any donation by way of consideration for admission to any seat in a course.*******
