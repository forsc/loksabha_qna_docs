(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (e): 	So far, no such instance of microplastics in fertilisers   and pesticides has come to the knowledge of the government. Further, no such study is conducted on presence of microplastics in Agriculture . However, all fertilisers are generally registered under Fertiliser Control Order (FCO) after thorough assessment of its nutrient status,   bio efficacy, permissible limits of impurities and their biodegradability. Similarly, pesticides are registered on pre-defined chemical composition, which is duly verified through pre-registration verification process before granting the registration to the particular pesticide. Till date no pesticide has been registered with micro plastic as its constituent at the Secretariat of CIB&RC. Periodic quality testing of fertilisers and pesticides is done by regulatory agencies at central and state level to ensure that prescribed norms are adhered to.******
