ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES[SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR](a) & (b) Setting up of Community Radio Stations (CRS) is a voluntary effort, by eligible organizations such as not-for-profit voluntary organizations, educational institutions, state agricultural universities and Krishi Vigyan Kendras. The Government only plays the role of licensor and facilitator in setting up of CRS. The Ministry endeavours to facilitate setting up of more CRS in the country and so far, a total of 317 CRSs are operational in the country. A State/UT-wise list of operational CRSs, including Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan, is available on Ministry’s website www.mib.gov.in. (c) The Policy Guidelines for setting up Community Radio Stations, prescribes criteria for setting up of a CRS and are available on the website of the Ministry. Clause 3(a)(i) of the Policy Guidelines has been amended to simplify the application process.	Government Universities, Deemed Universities (Central and State), Government Colleges, Government Schools and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (run by Government) have single window clearance. No separate clearance shall be necessary. An Inter-Ministerial Committee, chaired by Secretary (I&B), considers applications from such organizations and issues Letter of Intent, subject to allocation of frequency by WPC Wing. In addition, the application form for applying for Community Radio permission has been simplified by the Government recently.(d) The Private FM Radio Stations and CRS can broadcast news and current affairs contents sourced exclusively from AIR in its original form or translated into the local language/dialect (in case of CRS). It will be their responsibility to ensure that the news is not distorted or edited during translation.In respect of both private FM Radio Stations and Community Radio Stations, the broadcast pertaining to the following categories are treated as non-‘news and current affairs’ broadcast and will therefore be permissible:(i) Information pertaining to sporting events excluding live coverage. However live commentaries of sporting events of local nature may be permissible;(ii) Information pertaining to Traffic and Weather;(iii) Information pertaining to and coverage of cultural events, festivals;(iv) Coverage of topics pertaining to examinations, results, admissions, career counselling;(v) Availability of employment opportunities;(vi) Public announcements pertaining to civic amenities like electricity, water supply, natural calamities, health alerts etc. as provided by the local administration;(vii) Such other categories not permitted at present that may subsequently be specifically permitted by Ministry of Information and Broadcasting from time to time.(e) The Ministry has taken many measures to expand Community Radio service in the country, some of which are as under:(i) conducting awareness workshops, from time to time, to encourage eligible organizations for setting up of CRS, especially in Community Radio dark areas;(ii) engagement with Coastal States/UTs, Aspirational Districts and National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to identify and persuade eligible organizations for setting up of CRS, especially in those areas where no CRS is presently operational.****
