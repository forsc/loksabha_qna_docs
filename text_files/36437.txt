There are 712 Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) existing as on 28.02.2022 for cases related to rape and Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act. (b) to (e): As regards setting up of FTCs and allocation of funds thereto is concerned, it lies within the domain of the State Governments who set up such courts as per their need and resources, in consultation with their respective High Courts. Central funding for FTC’s have been discontinued after 31.03.2015. The 14th Finance Commission had urged State Governments to utilize enhanced fiscal space available through tax devolution (32% to 42%)for this purpose.Information on funds allocated and utilized for setting up these Courts by States is not maintained centrally. The details of cases pending and disposed of by FTCs during the last five years including the current year, State/UT-wise, is given at Annexure-I. The number of FTCs functional during last five years including the current year is given at Annexure-II. As regards FTSCs are concerned, the Central Government has started a Centrally Sponsored Schemefor setting up of 1023 FTSCs in 31 States/UTs for expeditious trial and disposal of cases related to rape and POCSO Act, in pursuance to the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2018 and the direction of Hon''ble Supreme Court of India in Suo Moto 1/2019 dated 25.7.2019.  Initially, the Scheme was for 1 year which has now been continuedup to 31.03.2023.  As per information received from the High Courts,712 FTSCs including 399 exclusive POCSO Courts are operationalized in 27 States/UTs as on 28.02.2022. State of Goa has consented but is yet to operationalize earmarked FTSCs. 08 States viz.Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha and Telangana have partially operationalized earmarked FTSCs while3 States/UT (West Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh and A&N Islands) are yet to join the scheme. As informed by the State of West Bengal and High Court of Calcutta, the matter relating to setting up FTSCs in West Bengal is under active consideration of the Administrative Committee of the Calcutta High Court. State of Arunachal Pradesh has not joined the scheme for the time being as they have less number of cases. The UT Administration of A&N Islands has taken up the issue of creation of post for Judicial Officer as well as supporting staff to be posted to earmarked FTSC.In respect of FTSCs, Central Government has released to various States/UTs Rs.140 Cr. in FY 2019-20, Rs.160 Cr. in FY 2020-21 and Rs.110.09 Cr. in FY 2021-22 till 22.03.2022.
