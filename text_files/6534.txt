ANSWER




MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D. V. SADANANDA GOWDA)                               (a): The department does not maintain information regarding Research and Development (R&D) expenditure of Indian Pharmaceutical companies. There are five Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) under the aegis of the Department of Pharmaceuticals, but all of them are either under closure or strategic disinvestment.  The R&D expenditure of the pharma PSUs during the last five years is as under:Year	2014-15	2015-16	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19R&D Expenses (In Rs. Crores)	0.27	0.36	0.90	1.40	0.15(b), (c) & (d): The Department of Pharmaceuticals has constituted an Inter-Departmental Committee (IDC) to coordinate work in the area of Pharmaceuticals research undertaken by organizations and institutes under the Central Government for institutionalizing a robust mechanism to ensure economy, efficiency, effectiveness and transparency in the arena of Pharmaceutical research. The Terms of Reference (ToR) of the Committee are: (i) To periodically review and coordinate the research work undertaken by various governmental organizations under different Central Ministries/Departments in a collaborative, synchronized and synergized way for optimum utilization of funds; and (ii) To ensure that research is conducted in such a way so as to avoid duplication of efforts and resources. The Department has set up seven National Institutes of Pharmaceutical Education & Research (NIPERs) as Institutes of national importance all over the country to impart masters and doctorate education and conduct research in various specializations of pharmaceuticals.Further, the Government has initiated several programs and schemes to discover and develop new drug molecules. It provides funding for different laboratories that are actively involved in drug design and development. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Defence Research & Development Organization (DRDO) and Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) laboratories have been set up in the country to facilitate drug discovery and development programs by Government of India. These research laboratories have not only had developed state of the art facilities for drug discovery and development but also taken new drug molecules to the clinical stage or launched the products. Similarly, the Ministry of Ayush was set up by Government of India to promote and develop Ayurvedic and Herbal medicines. Further details are given at Annexure. Annexure referred to in part (b), (c) & (d) of LokSabhaUnstarred Question No. 248 for reply on 19.11.2019 raised by ShriDushyant Singh regarding ‘R&D Expenditure’. (b), (c) & (d): (i) As per information received, several new drug molecules have been developed by the Indian pharmaceutical industries and/or research institutions as under: S No	Name of molecule	Therapeutic category	Organization	Status1	DRF-2593	Diabetes-PPAR agonist	Dr Reddys Laboratories Ltd	Terminated the development2	Rbx2258	Benign prostatic hyperplasia	Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd	Out licensed to ShwarzPharma3	RBx11160(Synriam)	Cerebral malaria	Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd 	Launche4d globally in 20124	Polycap	Heart attack	Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd and IIIM, Jammu (CSIR lab)	Out licensed to Western Biotech Ltd5	Crofelemer	Antidiarrhoeal agent	GlenmarkPharma Ltd	Launched in 2012 globally6	Centchroman	Contraceptive	CDRI and HLL Lifecare Ltd 	Launched in India in 19907	Dalzbone	Rapid fracture healing	CDRI and Pharmanza Herbal Pvt Ltd	Launched in India in 20159	Gugulipid	Hypolipidemic	Cipla Ltd	Launched in India in 198710	IN-105	Diabetes mellitus	Biocon Ltd	Under phase III clinical trial11	MiADMSA	Metal toxicity	DRDE, Gwalior	Under phase II clinical trials(ii) NIPER-Kolkata is conducting R&D research with an eye to develop lead molecules which may have cytotoxic activity against cancer cell line. The molecule that have been synthesized by so far, are Spiro-oxindolocurcuminoids which showed cytotoxic effects on HePG2 (Hepatic cancer cell line) and Hela (cervical cancer cell line). The testing of this molecule in the animal model of cancer is underway.(iii) NIPER-Guwahati has developed 2 potential lead molecules which can be used in the cancer therapy by inhibiting autophagy process and cell metabolism by inhibiting aldose reductaseenxyme. NIPER-Guwahati is also working toward the development of new drug delivery system. With the potential commercial exploitation of modern drug delivery strategies including both solid- and liquid-retentive drug delivery systems after their amalgamation with plant-derived biologically active medicinal agents like coriander, fenugreek, ginger, saffron, etc. Initially, tremendous focus was made only with single medicinal agent to entrap it effectively into the drug delivery carrier. In the recent times, our theme of research is to entrap two medicinal agents in a single drug delivery carrier especially into the liquid-retentive vector. (iv) Under the drug development program, Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) and Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH) are undertaking development of new formulations/drugs through a systematic process of drug development viz standardization, pre-clinical safety & clinical study. In this regard, CCRAS has developed 12 technologies and commercialized them through National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) for wider public utility. New drugs in Homoeopathy developed by CCRH are as under:1. Asclepiascurassavica2. Brass icaoleracia3. Buxussempervirens4. Cardiosperm urn halicacabum5. CassiajIstula6. Cusculareflexa7. Curcuma longa 8. Cynarascolymus9. Foe niculumvulgare10. Persea Americana 11. Phyl/antheusneruri12. Withaniasomnifera13. Cassia sophera14. Glycyrrhizaglabra15. Dengue Nosode16. New Malaria Nosode17. Nosode from JE virus 18. Nosode from Leishmania19. Nosode from Rota virus and E-coli bacteria(v) The Department of Science & Technology under the Ministry of Science & Technology has been implementing a Plan Scheme (Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Research Programme – DPRP) since 1994-95 for promoting R&D in Drugs & Pharmaceutical Sector with the following objectives:•	To synergize the strengths of publicly funded R&D institutions and Indian Pharmaceutical Industry;•	To create an enabling infrastructure, mechanisms and linkages to facilitate new drug development;•	To stimulate skill development of human resources in R&D for drugs and pharmaceuticals; (vi)	Collaborative Projects (Public Private Partnership) - An Indian Pharma company involved in drug development can jointly carry out R&D projects with national laboratories under CSIR, ICMR, ICAR, etc., University department/other academic institution and any other publicly funded R&D institution.  The Industry has to contribute 30% of the recurring cost to the institute. The DST will contribute 70% of the recurring cost and 100% of the equipment component.Under this programme 119 industries - institutional alliances both in modern and Indian systems of medicine including veterinary drugs have been funded. The programme has supported R&D projects on Tuberculosis, Malaria, Diarrhoea, Diabetes, Cataract, Cancer, Dementia, HIV/AIDS, Anti Fungal, Anti Virals, Anti Cancer, Anti Bacterial, Anti Rabies, Anti Obesity, Anti Asthma, Arthritis, etc., vaccine for Dengue, Japanese Encephalitis, Hepatitis-B, etc.Projects Leading academic institutions/national laboratories having scientific expertise can apply in the field of the facility demanded to cater the needs of Pharma Industries. Basic infrastructure like building will not be considered however specialized structures like cold room, animal house isolation chambers, etc. and other state-of-the-art equipment could be considered. 57 state-of-the art infrastructure for Pharmaceutical R&D have been created in different premier institutions and Universities on Bio-availability, Pharmaco-informatics, Regulatory Toxicology, Safety Pharmacology at NIPER, Mohali, Pharmacokinetic & Metabolic Studies, Regulatory Pharmacology & Toxicology, Medium Throughput Screening at CDRI, Lucknow; Transgenic & Gene Knockout Mice, Clinical Research facility to Stem Cell Technologies and regenerative medicine, Biosafety Laboratory at CCMB, Hyderabad, Bioequivalence, Pharmacovigilance, New Chemical Entities development, Animal Facility for Indian System of Medicine etc. have been created in other Universities & Institutions.Under this programme grants-in-aid is extended to Indian Pharmaceutical industries for clinical trials – Phase-I, II & III for neglected diseases such as Tuberculosis, Malaria, Kala-Azar, Filariasis, etc. Since 2008-09, this programme supported 4 (four) grants-in-aid projects to Indian Pharma industries for conducting clinical trials in neglected diseases such as malaria, kala-azar, etc.(vii)	The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) supports drug research through state-of-the-art infrastructure and facilities at its constituent laboratories like CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute (CSIR-CDRI), CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT), CSIR-Institute of Microbial Technology (CSIR-IMTECH), CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, etc. The laboratories are pursuing drugs and pharmaceutical Research and Development activities with an emphasis on affordable healthcare.(viii)	To strengthen research facilities for drug development, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has identified the Product Development Centres at PGIMER-Chandigarh, CDRI-Lucknow, Nizam Institute-Hyderabad, Seth G.S. Medical Collage & KEM Hospital-Mumbai and AIIMS-Delhi. These centres will evaluate potential products developed by ICMR funded projects in colleges/ICMR centres/centre for advance research. The centres will carry out clinical trials for developing national guidelines/programs, for new drugs e.g. phytopharmaceuticals.(ix)	The Department of Biotechnology (DBT), towards strengthening the product development for Biopharmaceuticals, has initiated a Mission entitled: Industry-Academia Collaborative Mission for Accelerating Discovery Research to Early Development for Biopharmaceuticals – “Innovate in India (i3) Empowering biotech entrepreneurs & accelerating inclusive innovation”.
