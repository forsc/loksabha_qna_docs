                                                    (a) the reason for low number of Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRS) in second largest ST populated State Maharashtra in comparison to other States;(b) whether the current norm of minimum 50 per cent ST population and more than 20,000 ST population in a block has adversely affected the ambition of Maharashtra State to promote this flagship programme;(c) if so, the effective steps taken by the Union Government to avoid this;(d) whether the Maharashtra Government has proposed 10 per cent to 50 per cent ratio of ST population to the Union Government for approval of the new EMRS;(e) if so, whether this proposal has been sanctioned; and(f) the steps taken by the Union Government to consider the revised rules proposed by Maharashtra and approve 50 new EMRs of the State? 






ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c) As per Budget Announcement 2018-19, Government has decided to establish at least one Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS) in each block across the country having 50% or more ST population and minimum 20,000 tribal persons by the year 2022. As per this criteria, a total number of 21 blocks have been identified for establishment of EMRSs in Maharashtra. Out of this, 12 schools have already been sanctioned and 9 more EMRSs are scheduled to be sanctioned during 2021-22 subject to furnishing of land details by the State Government. Besides, 18 number of EMRSs had already been sanctioned to the State of Maharashtra prior to the above budget announcement thereby taking the total number of EMRSs in Maharashtra to 39 by the year 2022. Thus, the current norm of minimum 50 per cent ST population and more than 20,000 ST population in a block is not affecting the implementation of this flagship programme in Maharashtra and rather it is facilitating quality education to the ST students in their own environment with sanction of altogether 39 number of schools by the year 2022.(d) to (f) Yes Sir. However, this proposal has not been sanctioned since this Ministry has been focusing to establish at least one EMRS in each block having 50% or more ST population and minimum 20,000 tribal persons across the country by the year 2022 as per existing norms and the total number of schools scheduled to be established across the country is 740 including 39 for Maharashtra upto the year 2022.*****
