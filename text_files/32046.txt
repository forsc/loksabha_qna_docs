                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) to (c): The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005, developed by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), emphasizes on ethical development, inculcating the values, attitudes and skills required for living in harmony with oneself and with others. NCERT has informed that their textbooks in Social Sciences have already included the themes that focus on communal harmony across the stages. The curriculum, syllabus and textbooks developed by NCERT are followed in all the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) affiliated schools. So far as the Universities and Colleges are concerned, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has developed an ‘Educational Framework for Global Citizenship in Higher Education’, which aims at enabling individuals to recognise, respect and appreciate differences and multiple identities, to live in harmony with others; and demonstrate empathy and compassion.****
