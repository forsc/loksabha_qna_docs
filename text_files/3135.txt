ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a)  & (b)	The Government has not received any specific complaint that embassies do not provide 	adequate assistance or legal services when domestic workers in foreign countries, particularly in Arab countries, have to flee due to the harassment of their employers. The well being and welfare of Indian nationals abroad is a foremost priority for Indian Missions and Posts abroad. Our Missions and Posts extend all possible assistance to distressed domestic workers, including counseling, legal assistance, financial assistance for food and lodging and completing necessary formalities for their repatriation to India.  Assistance is also provided from the Indian Community Welfare Fund (ICWF) in deserving cases on means tested basis.(c) & (d)	 Domestic laws pertaining to labour in India, including women who are going as domestic workers to Gulf countries, do not extend to these countries.  However, Government has taken further measures to promote the protection and welfare of Emigration Check Required (ECR) passport holding Indian women going abroad as domestic workers, including restricting their recruitment only through seven State Government recruiting agencies w.e.f. 2 August, 2016; mandatory age restriction of minimum 30 years; and mandatory requirements of their foreign employers registering themselves on e-Migrate system and depositing a bank guarantee equivalent to US $ 2500.  (e) 	The country-wise numbers of female workers who approached the Embassies/Consulates seeking assistance, including for repatriation, in Gulf countries are as under.<pre>S.
