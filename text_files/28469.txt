ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (c) Opening of new Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) is a continuous process. Proposalsfor opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments ofthe Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrationsand committing resources for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from varioussponsoring authorities found fulfilling the mandatory pre-requisites for opening of new KVshave to compete with other such proposals under the “Challenge Method” and subject toapproval of the competent authority. No proposal in the prescribed proforma has beenreceived from State Government of Assam for opening of new KV in Charideo in JorhatConstituency.The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one Jawahar NavodayaVidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country for providing good quality modern educationto the talented children predominantly from rural areas. All the districts including 27districts in Assam (as on 31st May, 2014) of the States/UTs which have accepted thescheme, have been covered. Opening of new Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) is acontinuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government/ UT administration to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction ofthe permanent building and making available required temporary building, free of rent, torun the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction andopening of new JNV depends on the availability of funds and approval by the CompetentAuthority.*****
