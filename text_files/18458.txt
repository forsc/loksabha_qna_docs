                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	&(b)  As per the information available with Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) generation of e-waste is increasing every year.The Government has made provisions for inventorization of e-waste generation across the country under the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016. Under the said Rules, the responsibility for inventorization of generation of E-Waste has been assigned to State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) and Pollution Control Committees (PCCs). As per the information of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), so far seven SPCBs namely Goa, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Punjab have completed the inventorization of e-waste generation. Inventory for each of the states in the country is not available. CPCB had also circulated methodology for inventorization of e-waste to all the SPCBs/PCCs. 	The E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016are effective from 01.10.2016. Accordingly, CPCB has estimated the generation of e-waste at the national level on the basis of sales data of 21 types of notified Electrical & Electronic Equipment (EEE) from Financial Year (FY) 2017-2018. The estimated generation of e-waste during Financial Year (FY) 2017-2018, FY 2018-2019 & FY 2019-2020 is given below:?	For FY 2017-18, the estimated generation of e-waste is 7,08,445 tonnes for 21 types of EEE. This is based on the sales data of 244 producers.?	For FY 2018-2019, the estimated generation of e-waste is 7,71,215 tonnes for 21 type of EEE. This is based on the sales data of 1168 producers?	For FY 2019-2020, the estimated generation of e-waste is10,14,961.2 tonnefor 21 types of EEE. This is based on the sales data of 1380 producers.(c)	For the disposal of E-waste in an environmentally sound manner, Government has notified E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016. The regulations intend at taking all steps required to ensure that e-waste is managed in a manner which shall protect health and environment against any adverse effects, which may result from such e-waste. The said rules are effective from 01.10.2016. Under the said rules, Producers of EEE have been given responsibility under the principal of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for collection and environmentally sound management of e-waste and for creating awareness among consumers and bulk consumers. The said rules have provisions for environmentally sound collection, transportation, storage, dismantling and recycling of e-waste. In the rules role and responsibilities of different stakeholders have been clearly defined. Under EPR, producers have to obtain Extended Producer Responsibility Authorization (EPRA). In the EPRA of the producer’s e-waste collection targets are mentioned which is based either on their generation or on their sale of EEE.(d)	& (e) The electronic products and electrical equipments after their useful life do not cause any harm to environment if stored and processed in an environmentally sound manner. However, if the E-waste is opened-up and unscientific methods are used for extraction of precious and semi-precious material from it, then it causes health risks and damage to environment. However, no specific studies to assess the damage caused by e-Waste on Environment have been carried so far. Also, Under the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016, the safety and health of workers involved in dismantling and recycling of e-waste has been ensured through department of Labour or any other agency authorized in this regard by the concerned State government. As per the Rule 12(2) of the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016, Department of Labour in the State or any other government agency authorised in this regard by the State Government shall: is reproduced below:(a)	ensure recognition and registration of workers involved in dismantling and recycling;(b)	assist formation of groups of such workers to facilitate setting up dismantling facilities;(c)	undertakes industrial skill development activities for the workers involved indismantling and recycling;(d)	undertakes annual monitoring and to ensure safety & health of workers involved indismantling and recycling;*****
