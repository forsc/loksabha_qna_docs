(a) & (b): Purnea airport is an Air Force Station owned and managed by Indian Air Force (IAF). The IAF has undertaken major repair/upgradation including work of resurfacing the entire length of runway at the airport. The airport would be available for any civil operations once it is ready.; (c): The Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)-UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) to stimulate regional air connectivity and making air travel affordable to the masses. UDAN is a market driven scheme. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under UDAN from time to time. No valid bid was received in respect of Purnea airport in Bihar in UDAN 1.0. Since the airport is under major repair/upgradation the airport has not been included in the subsequent UDAN documents for bidding.;
