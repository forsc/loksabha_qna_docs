                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) & (b) The state-wise details of border covered by fencing along Indo-Bangladesh border is as under:(Approx.

The Government regularly monitors the progress of work along Indo-Bangladesh border to ensure its completion. (c) The riverine border along Indo-Bangladesh border is dominated through floating Border Out Posts, patrolling with boats, foot patrolling along river banks during day and night and by conducting special operations with state police as and when required.(d) Floodlights are installed along fenced border including small river/ nallah gaps.(e) & (f) Border Security Force conducts regular patrolling, lay nakas, establish observation posts and carry out anti-tunneling exercise to stop illegal migrants. However, some illegal migrants are able to enter in a clandestine and surreptious manner, mainly due to difficult riverine terrain in parts of International border with Bangladesh which are not amenable to physical fencing. The state-wise details of illegal migrants apprehended by BSF along Indo-Bangladesh border during last five years w.e.f. 01.01.2015 is as under:Sno	Border State	Year		2015	2016	2017	2018	2019	2020 (upto 31st Aug)1.
