ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	 There has been continuous demand for reforming agriculture marketing system in India to facilitate farmers in selling their produce for better price realization as has been suggested from time to time by various committees etc. Government of India has been actively and intensively engaging with the States for about two decades for reforms in agriculture marketing sector to provide accessible markets and barrier free trade facilities for selling their produce at better price anytime anywhere. 	In order to provide better marketing facilities to the farmers, the Government had released a new model “The Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2017” popularly known as Model APLM Act, 2017, in April 2017 for its adoption by States/Union Territories (UTs). 	Further, Government of India had launched reform linked National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) scheme, a virtual platform integrating physical wholesale mandis/ markets of different States/ Union Territories (UTs) to facilitate online trading of agriculture and horticulture commodities to enable farmers to realize better remunerative prices for their produce. All these contribute towards better marketing efficiency and also better prices to farmers.  	Barrier free market for inter-state and intra-state trade in farmers produce as well as to provide competitive marketing channels near to farm gate is vital to enhancing price realization by farmers to increase their income.   	With this intention, Government has enacted “The Farmers'' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020” to provide for the creation of an ecosystem where the producers and buyers enjoy the freedom of choice relating to sale and purchase of farmers’ produce which facilitates remunerative prices to farmers through competitive alternative trading channels promoting  efficient transparent and barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade and commerce of farmers’ produce outside the physical premises of regulated market yards/ sub-yards and deemed markets notified under various State Agricultural Produce Market legislations. 	The Farming agreement i.e “The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement On Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020” will enable production and processing of high value agriculture produces and give fillip to exports.  The framework will also mitigate the risks for the farmers, enhance their income and will put in place an effective and conducive policy regime for agreements. 	Farm Acts provides sufficient safeguard mechanism to protect the interest of farmers including that of small and marginal farmers. Simple, accessible, quick and cost effective dispute resolution mechanism is prescribed at local Sub-divisional level and deterring penal provisions have been provided against traders to prevent and curb any violation of the Act by them.(b) & (c):	 Yes Sir. The twin organizations, namely Directorate of Marketing and Inspection(DMI) and National Institute of Agricultural Marketing(NIAM) since their inception in 1935 and 1988 respectively have been mandated, among other things, to provide all type of technical support to the States relating to agricultural marketing. This broadly includes promotion of Grading and Standardization, training & awareness, guidance on regulatory and reform matter, promotion of post-harvest marketing and value chain infrastructure etc. The DMI is also giving training to State Agricultural Marketing Officials on Agricultural Marketing subjects. The CCS NIAM through its academic program covers Stakeholders namely Farmers, Govt. Officers, NGOs, Cooperatives and Marketing Boards etc.******
