ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (d) : 	The Rajiv Gandhi Combined Cycle Power Plant (RGCCPP) of NTPC located at Kayamkulam is available to generate electricity at all times subject to the schedule given by the beneficiary State for supply of power. This being a single beneficiary State station with full power allocation to the State of Kerala, is not being operated at the moment because it is not receiving any schedule from Kerala. NTPC had offered to operate the station with reduced energy charge rate due to fall in Naphtha price. However, so far the station has not been scheduled for supply of power by Kerala. No request has been received for any meeting by the State of Kerala, which is the sole beneficiary of this project. ***********
