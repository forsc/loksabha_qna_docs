                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS (SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) to (c):	Prices of petrol and diesel have been market-determined with effect from 26.06.2010 and 19.10.2014 respectively. Since then, the Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) take appropriate decision on pricing of petrol and diesel in line with international product prices, exchange rate, tax structure, inland freight and other cost elements.  For domestic LPG, the Government continues to modulate the effective price to consumer to insulate the common man from rise in international prices.x-x-x-x-x
