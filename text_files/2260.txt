ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF JAL SHAKTI(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (c) The Government had launched Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) [SBM(G)] with effect from 2nd October, 2014 with the aim to attain Open Defecation Free (ODF) India by 2nd October, 2019 by providing access to toilet facilities to all rural households in the country.  Under SBM(G), 9.62 crore toilets have been constructed till 01.07.2019.  As a result, sanitation coverage in the rural areas of the country which was 38.7% on 2.10.2014 has increased to more than 99% and 30 States, 622 Districts, 6,210 Blocks, 2,50,583 Gram Panchayats and 5,67,498 villages have been declared ODF.  Some steps taken-up under SBM(G) are as follows :- •	Focus is being given on community based collective behavior change by massive campaigning at the national and State level. •	Focus is also on the outcome of ODF villages, and not only on construction of individual toilets. •	Given the vast socio-economic-cultural diversity of India, and also from the point of view of promoting innovations, the programme provides flexibility to the States to choose the strategy best suited to them in its implementation. •	Greater emphasis is being given on capacity building, especially in community approaches and programme management, by imparting training to the States and selected organizations called Key Resource Centres (KRCs), involving District Collectors to provide leadership to the programme at the district level. •	The programme is being run as a jan andolan with cooperation of all sections of the society including the NGOs, corporates, youth etc. The Panchayats are being actively involved.•	Sanitation is being prioritized amongst the overall development agenda. The Government has taken a decision to prioritise all Centrally Sponsored Schemes in ODF villages.  Various other development schemes are being converged with the sanitation outcomes.
