                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c):      A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2606 BY SHRI MALOOK NAGAR TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 04.12.2019 REGARDING LEASING OF UNUSED LAND. (a) to (c):  As on 31.03.2019, the total  land available with the Indian Railways  is 4.78 lakh hectares out of which 0.51 lakh hectare (approximately)  land is vacant.  This vacant land is mostly in the form of narrow strips along tracks and utilized for servicing and maintenance of track, bridges and other infrastructure. The vacant land is also utilized for execution of various infrastructural projects for meeting future growth needs of Railways which include projects like expansion of new railway lines, doubling/tripling and traffic facilities works, etc. Railways’ operations also necessarily require development of ancillary logistic support/infrastructure such as bulk oil installations and oil depots, steel yards, concrete sleeper plants, coal dumps, connectivity to private sidings, connectivity to ports and other infrastructure, commercial plots, vending stalls, etc. for which land is only leased/licensed. Further, vacant land which is not required by Railways for its immediate operational use is also utilized to generate revenue through commercial development on long term lease basis by Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA), wherever feasible. Redevelopment of stations is also planned through leveraging commercial development of vacant land and air space in and around railway stations. *****
