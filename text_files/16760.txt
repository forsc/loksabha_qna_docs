ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION  (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	The official poverty estimates are based on data of Large Sample Surveys on Household Consumer Expenditure carried out by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The latest data of Large Sample Survey on Household Consumer Expenditure has been collected by NSSO in its 68th round conducted in 2011-12. The poverty estimates for 2011-12 have been computed following the extant Tendulkar methodology and these have been released through a Press Note issued on 22nd July 2013. According to this Press Note, the number of persons living below poverty line in India has been estimated as 27 crore (21.9%) in 2011-12 as compared to 40.76 crore (37.2%) in 2004-05. The rate of decline of poverty ratio during 2004-05 to 2011-12 was 2.18 % per year. (b)	The State-wise number of people living below poverty line in the country including Chhattisgarh are given at Annexure.(c)	&(d) In India, the erstwhile Planning Commission was the nodal agency in the Government for estimation of the poverty in the country and it used a poverty line based on per capita consumption expenditure as the criterion to determine the persons living below the poverty line (BPL). The methodology to estimate poverty has been reviewed from time to time. In 1977, the erstwhile Planning Commission constituted a Task Force on poverty under the chairmanship of Dr. Y.K. Alagh which submitted its report in 1979 and the erstwhile Planning Commission accepted its recommendations in the same year. In September, 1989, it constituted the Expert Group under the chairmanship of Prof. D.T. Lakdawala for estimation of poverty and it submitted its report in 1993 and erstwhile Planning Commission accepted its recommendations in 1997. The erstwhile Planning Commission constituted an Expert Group under the chairmanship of Prof. Suresh D. Tendulkar in 2005 to review the methodology for estimation of poverty. The expert group submitted its report in November, 2009 and the erstwhile Planning Commission accepted its recommendations in January, 2011. Presently, the official poverty estimates are based on Tendulkar methodology. In June 2012, erstwhile Planning Commission constituted an Expert Group under the Chairmanship of Dr. C. Rangarajan to “Review the Methodology for Measurement of Poverty”. The Expert Group submitted its report on 30th June 2014. However, the Government is yet to take decision on the report submitted by the Expert Group.After the formation of NITI Aayog which replaced the erstwhile Planning Commission a Task Force on Elimination of Poverty in India was constituted on 16th March, 2015 under the Chairmanship of Dr. Arvind Panagariya, former Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog. The report of the Task Force was submitted to Prime Minister’s Office on 11th July, 2016. The Terms of Reference for the Task Force inter alia included to “Develop a working definition of poverty”. The report of the Task Force primarily focuses on issues of measurement of poverty and strategies to combat poverty. Regarding estimation of poverty, the report of the Task Force states that “a consensus in favour of either the Tendulkar or a higher poverty line did not emerge. Therefore, the Task Force has concluded that the matter be considered in greater depth by the country’s top experts on poverty before a final decision is made. Accordingly, it is recommended that an expert committee be set up to arrive at an informed decision on the level at which the poverty line should be set.”(e)	The Report of the Task Force is under consideration of the Government.AnnexureNumber and Percentage of Population below poverty line by states-2011-12 (Tendulkar Methodology)               Sl.No.	States	Rural	Urban	Total		%age of Persons	No. of Persons (lakhs)	%age of Persons	No. of Persons (lakhs)	%age of Persons	No. of Persons (lakhs)1	Andhra Pradesh	10.96	61.80	5.81	16.98	9.20	78.782	Arunachal Pradesh	38.93	4.25	20.33	0.66	34.67	4.913	Assam	33.89	92.06	20.49	9.21	31.98	101.274	Bihar	34.06	320.40	31.23	37.75	33.74	358.155	Chhattisgarh	44.61	88.90	24.75	15.22	39.93	104.116	Delhi	12.92	0.50	9.84	16.46	9.91	16.967	Goa	6.81	0.37	4.09	0.38	5.09	0.758	Gujarat	21.54	75.35	10.14	26.88	16.63	102.239	Haryana	11.64	19.42	10.28	9.41	11.16	28.8310	Himachal Pradesh	8.48	5.29	4.33	0.30	8.06	5.5911	Jammu & Kashmir	11.54	10.73	7.20	2.53	10.35	13.2712	Jharkhand	40.84	104.09	24.83	20.24	36.96	124.3313	Karnataka	24.53	92.80	15.25	36.96	20.91	129.7614	Kerala	9.14	15.48	4.97	8.46	7.05	23.9515	Madhya Pradesh	35.74	190.95	21.00	43.10	31.65	234.0616	Maharashtra	24.22	150.56	9.12	47.36	17.35	197.9217	Manipur	38.80	7.45	32.59	2.78	36.89	10.2218	Meghalaya	12.53	3.04	9.26	0.57	11.87	3.6119	Mizoram	35.43	1.91	6.36	0.37	20.40	2.2720	Nagaland	19.93	2.76	16.48	1.00	18.88	3.7621	Odisha	35.69	126.14	17.29	12.39	32.59	138.5322	Punjab	7.66	13.35	9.24	9.82	8.26	23.1823	Rajasthan	16.05	84.19	10.69	18.73	14.71	102.9224	Sikkim	9.85	0.45	3.66	0.06	8.19	0.5125	Tamil Nadu	15.83	59.23	6.54	23.40	11.28	82.6326	Tripura	16.53	4.49	7.42	0.75	14.05	5.2427	Uttarakhand	11.62	8.25	10.48	3.35	11.26	11.6028	Uttar Pradesh	30.40	479.35	26.06	118.84	29.43	598.1929	West Bengal	22.52	141.14	14.66	43.83	19.98	184.9830	Puducherry	17.06	0.69	6.30	0.55	9.69	1.2431	Andaman & Nicobar Islands	1.57	0.04	0.00	0.00	1.00	0.0432	Chandigarh	1.64	0.004	22.31	2.34	21.81	2.3533	Dadra & Nagar Haveli	62.59	1.15	15.38	0.28	39.31	1.4334	Daman & Diu	0.00	0.00	12.62	0.26	9.86	0.2635	Lakshadweep	0.00	0.00	3.44	0.02	2.77	0.02 	All India	25.70	2166.58	13.70	531.25	21.92	2697.83Notes:	1.
