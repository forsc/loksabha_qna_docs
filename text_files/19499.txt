ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (d): The National Education Policy 2020 has been finalised after detailed consultation process with all stakeholders including State/UT Governments, followed by the approval of Union Cabinet. This Ministry has communicated to all States/UT Governments for implementation of NEP 2020. State of Kerala and Tamil Nadu have made their observations on certain issues related to the NEP, 2020. A series of workshops have been held with States/UTs to address these  observations and also to discuss innovative ideas for NEP implementation. Ministry of Education had organised ‘Shikshak Parv’ from 8th September to 25th September, 2020 to deliberate on various themes and implementation of NEP 2020 aimed at eliciting suggestions.  Ministry had also organised a Conference of Governors on “Role of National Education Policy in Transforming Higher Education”. In the conference, Governors and Lt. Governors of State and Union Territories, Education Minister of State and UTs, Vice Chancellors of State Universities and other dignitaries participated and stated that the State/UT Governments have started taking initiatives for implementing the NEP 2020. Majority of states have taken steps toward implementation of NEP 2020. There has been wide publicity with a positive and encouraging response from stakeholders on NEP 2020. National Education Policy 2020, like National Education Policy 1968 and 1986, reiterates that three-language formula will continue to be implemented while keeping in view the Constitutional provisions, aspirations of the people, regions, and the Union, and the need to promote multilingualism as well as promote national unity. However, there will be a greater flexibility in the three-language formula, and no language will be imposed on any State. *******
