                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a):  As per information provided by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), number of cases reported district-wise in which children (below 18 years) were trafficked under Human Trafficking during 2019, State/UT-wise including Jharkhand is at Annexure-I.(b):  As per Section 2 (14) (ix) of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act), a child who is found vulnerable and is likely to be inducted into drug abuse or trafficking is included as a “child in need of care and protection (CNCP)”. The JJ Act, 2015 mandates a security net of service delivery structures to provide Institutional and non-Institutional care to these children. The primary responsibility of execution of the Act lies with the States/UTs. As per information provided by the States/UTs, details of Child Care Institutes (CCIs) for CNCP which are being supported under the Child Protection Services (CPS) Scheme during the current financial year is at Annexure-II. (c) & (d):The Ministry of Women and Child Development implements a centrally sponsored Child Protection Services (CPS) Scheme (erstwhile Integrated Child Protection Scheme) for supporting the children in difficult circumstances. The primary responsibility of implementation of the scheme lies with the States/UTs. Under the scheme institutional care is provided through CCIs, as a rehabilitative measure.The programmes and activities in Child Care Institutions inter-alia include age-appropriate education, access to vocational training, recreation, health care, counseling etc.As per the scheme guidelines, the State government is required to assess the need and submit a proposal for consideration of  Project Approval Board (PAB) under the Chairpersonship of Secretary (WCD) annually. The PAB  scrutinizes and approves implementation plans, and financial proposals from States/UTs for release of grants under the scheme.  Ministry also implements Ujjawala Scheme for combating trafficking of women and children for commercial sexual exploitation, with five specific components – Prevention, Rescue, Rehabilitation, Re-Integration and Repatriation of victims of trafficking. The scheme has been conceived primarily for the purpose of preventing trafficking on  one hand and rescue and rehabilitation of victims on the other.
