ANSWER




                                                                              MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE                                 (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a)	The number of Permanent Account Numbers (PANs) which are linked with Aadhaar Number as on 11.11.2019 is 29,30,74,520.(b)	Yes Sir. As per sub-section (1) of section 139AA of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (Act), every person who was eligible to obtain Aadhaar Number, w.e.f. 1st July, 2017 has to quote the Aadhaar in the application form for allotment of PAN and in the return of income. 	Further, as per sub-section (2) of section 139AA of the Act, every person who was a PAN holder as on 1st July, 2017 who was otherwise eligible to obtain Aadhaar Number has to intimate his/her Aadhaar to such authority in such form and manner as may be prescribed, on or before a date to be notified by the Central Government in the Official Gazette. This process is commonly known as Linking of PAN with Aadhaar. Vide Notification bearing G.S.R. No. 642(E) dated 27.06.2017, the Principal Director General of Income-tax (Systems) had been notified as the ‘prescribed authority’ to whom the Aadhaar Number has to be intimated by a person who was having PAN as on 1st July, 2017. Further, vide Notification bearing S.O.No.1495(E) dated 31.03.2019, the Central Government specified 30th September, 2019 as the due date for linking the PAN with Aadhaar Number, which was subsequently extended till 31.12.2019 vide Notification bearing S.O. No. 3539(E) dated 28.09.2019.  The objective behind this move is to ensure unique identity of the PAN card holders and to weed out undetected duplicate PANs. This is also essential to prevent misuse of PANs and potential tax frauds.(c)	Vide Notification bearing S.O.No.1513(E) dated 11.05.2017, senior citizens of the age 80 years or more at any time during the previous year who do not possess the Aadhaar Number or the Enrollment ID are exempt from the applicability of section 139AA of the Act.(d)	It will ensure uniqueness of PAN and prevent applicants/entities from obtaining multiple PANs.(e)	As per the Notification bearing S.O.No.3539(E) dated 28.09.2019, the linking of PAN with Aadhaar Number has to be completed by 31st December, 2019.(f)	Appropriate measures have been taken in terms of provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961, Information Technology Act, 2000 and other applicable laws to ensure that the confidentiality of data is maintained. The security assurance of Aadhaar ecosystem strengthened with enactment of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 and subsequently the Aadhaar and Other Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019 which has stringent penalties/punishments for offenders.                                               *****
