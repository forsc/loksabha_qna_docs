ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (d)   As per the Compendium on Silting of reservoirs in India (2015) compiled by Central Water Commission (CWC) the last sedimentation survey of Hirakud reservoir was carried out in the year 2000.   The gross capacity of Hirakud reservoir, which was commissioned in 1957, has decreased by about 27.27% due to siltation as per the last sedimentation survey data available for the year 2000.  The reason of storage capacity reduction is accommodation of silt which is a natural process. Usually de-silting of large dams is not techno economically feasible.Water being a State subject, operation and maintenance including silt management etc. is carried out by the Dam Owners which are generally State Government, Central/State PSUs, Private Owners. Union Government provides technical and financial assistance through various schemes such as Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP). Government of India started DRIP in April 2012 with the loan assistance from World Bank. Provision of rehabilitation of 223 dams located in seven States viz. Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand has been made to improve the safety and operational performance of selected existing dams and associated appurtenances in a sustainable manner. Original budget outlay of the project was Rs 2100 crore. DRIP originally was a six year scheme with scheduled closure date as 30th June 2018. Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs (CCEA) in September 2018 approved the revised cost of DRIP for Rs 3466 crore along with two years extension.Government of Odisha has included Hirakud Dam under DRIP. However, no desiltation work has been taken up in Hirakud reservoir under the Project. No fund has been allocated for desiltation of Hirakud reservoir.*****
