ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b) A Statement containing State-wise details of complaints received under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) and action taken thereon for the period 2016-17, 2017-18,2018-19 & 2019-20 (upto February, 2020) is given at Annexure. Data related to cases reported against officials and contractors is not maintained centrally. (c) & (d)  As per the PMGSY Programme Guidelines, ensuring the quality and compliance to the prescibed criteria ,in respect of the road works constructed under PMGSY is responsibility of the respective State Governments which are implementing the Programme. All PMGSY roads are designed as per relevant guidelines of Indian Road Congress (IRC). The Ministry of Rural Development/ National Rural Infrastructure Development Agency (NRIDA) issue general guidelines on quality control and prescribe Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads to regulate the quality control processes, at work level. There is a very well structured three-tiered Quality Control mechanism for ensuring construction of quality road works and durability of road assets under PMGSY.  Under the first tier, the Programme Implementation Units (PIUs) are required to ensure process control through mandatory tests on material and workmanship at field laboratory.  The second tier is a structured independent quality monitoring at the State level through State Quality Monitors (SQMs) to ensure that every work is inspected at initial stage, middle stage and final stage of the construction.  Under the third tier, independent National Quality Monitors (NQMs) are deployed for random inspection of road works to monitor quality and also to provide guidance to the field functionaries. Whenever, a work is reported as deficient by NQMs, on account of both structural and non-structural defects, the PIU ensures that the contractor replaces the material or rectifies the workmanship, as the case may be. The Action Taken Report (ATR), for each such work, is verified on ground by the SQMs. Thereafter, the State Quality Coordinator (SQC) examines the ATR for each such work and furnishes the compliance report regularly through programme Management Information System (MIS)-Online Management, Monitoring and Accounting System (OMMAS). To fast track the compliance on NQM observations, provisions have been made to upload and monitor the action taken report for each work through web based programme. Close monitoring has improved the quality of projects.   Under PMGSY, implementation of all sanctioned works is being monitored through online programme MIS named OMMAS on real time basis.  Progress of all roads uploaded on OMMAS on real time basis with the provision of Geo-tagged Photographs. Progress is also monitored with the States by way of Regional Review Meetings (RRMs), Performance Review Committee (PRC) Meetings, Pre-Empowered/ Empowered Committee Meetings with the States. In addition to this, special review meetings are also held by Secretary/ Additional Secretary, Ministry of Rural Development with Chief Secretaries/Principal Secretaries of the States. A Mobile App “Meri Sadak” was launched on 20th July, 2015 with the view to achieve the objectives of e-governance and Digital India for user friendly and transparent Citizen Feedback and complaint redressal system. The citizens, with the use of this application, can express their concerns related to slow pace, abandoned work or quality of work of PMGSY works. Further, Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India is implementing a project for the creation of web based Geographic Information system (GIS) under PMGSY through which the mapping of all rural roads in the country is being done. Further, to promote transparency and effective monitoring, the Superintending Engineer concerned of the zone/region has been asked to request the concerned Member of  Parliament and Zilla Panchayat Pramukh representing the zone/region, once in six months, to select any PMGSY project(s) for joint inspection. Similarly, the Executive Engineer in-charge of a division has been asked to request the MLA/ Chairperson of the Intermediate Panchayat concerned, once in three months for joint inspection and the Assistant Engineer in-charge of the sub-division has been asked to request the concerned Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat once in two months to select any PMGSY project(s) for joint inspection.  *****
