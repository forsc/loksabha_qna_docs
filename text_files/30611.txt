ANSWER




(a)     Poshan Tracker, an ICT based application is a governance tool to strengthen and bring about transparency in nutrition delivery support systems. It was rolled by by Ministry of Women and Child Development in March 2021. Technology under Poshan Tracker is being leveraged for last mile tracking of nutrition service delivery  and for real-time monitoring and tracking of all AWCs, AWWs and beneficiaries on defined indicators.  As on date, around 9.83 crore beneficiaries including Children under 6 years, Pregnant & Lactating Mothers and Adolescent Girls are registered on the Poshan Tracker.(b)     To ensure continuous nutritional support to the beneficiaries, the Anganwadi Workers and Helpers distributed Supplementary Nutrition at the doorsteps of beneficiaries once in 15 days during Covid-19 as all Anganwadi Centres across the country were closed to limit the impact of the pandemic. In addition, they also assisted the local administration in community surveillance, creating awareness as well as other work assigned to them from time to time.****
