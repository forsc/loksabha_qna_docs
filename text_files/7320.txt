ANSWER




ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):      As per data available with Central Bureau of Health Intelligence (CBHI), under this Ministry the State/UT-wise details of cases reported and deaths due to rabies, during the last three years in the country are given in the Annexure.(b):      As per Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), the details of Anti-Rabies Vaccine (ARV) manufacturers in the country are given below:•	M/s Serum Institute of India Pvt., Ltd., Pune•	M/s Human Biologicals Institute Ltd., Hyderabad•	M/s Cadila Healthcare, Ahmedabad•	M/s Bharat Biotech International Ltd., Hyderabad•	M/s Chiron Behering, Bharuch, GujaratContd………-2-(c):     Procurement of Anti Rabies Vaccine (ARV) is decentralized. As procurement of anti-rabies vaccine is done by the State Governments, their availability status is accordingly maintained at the state level and no central database on availability of ARV is maintained. However, shortage of ARV has been reported by some of the States like West Bengal, Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka, etc.As there is rabies elimination drive by 2030 globally, there is significant demand of Anti Rabies Vaccine and Serum from the neighboring courtiers like Myanmar, Malaysia and Philippines and these countries are importing vaccine from India.  Many states and stakeholders have pointed out that preferential export of ARV by Indian Manufactures at escalated prices to the neighboring countries has resulted in nonresponse and non-participation by the manufactures in domestic tenders.(d) & (e):      Presently, there is no plan to include rabies vaccination as a part of universal immunization programme.  The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has taken note of the shortage of ARV reported by the States and Drug Controller General of India has been directed to monitor the pharmaceutical firms producing ARV for ensuring regular supply of ARV to the States.
