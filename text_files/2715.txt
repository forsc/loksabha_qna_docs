ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) State/UT-wise details of LPG consumers as on 01.06.2019 are at Annexure. Government of India (Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas) makes allocation of Public Distribution System (PDS) Kerosene on quarterly basis to States/UTs. Further distribution of PDS Kerosene within the States/UTs under PDS network to various categories of ration card holders/consumers is the responsibility of the concerned States/UTs. Scale and criteria of distribution are also decided byrespective State/UT. Therefore, the details and number of Kerosene consumers may be available with the respective State Govt./UT administration only. (b) & (c) Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas has launched Direct Benefit Transfer in PDS Kerosene (DBTK) Scheme. The DBTK Scheme is being implemented with an objective to bring reforms in Allocation and Distribution of PDS SKO distribution system. Under the DBTK Scheme, as a part of distribution reforms, PDS Kerosene is sold to the identified beneficiaries at non-subsidized rate and the applicable subsidy is directly transferred into the bank account of the beneficiaries. The State Government of Jharkhand has implemented DBTK in all the 24 districts. The consent of State/UT is is required for implementation of DBTK. Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas has taken up with the States/UTs to implement DBTK Scheme. (d) Government, as a measure of Good Governance had introduced well targeted system of subsidy delivery to LPG consumers through PAHAL(DBTL). The initiative of the Government was aimed at rationalizing subsidies based on approach to cut subsidy leakages, but not subsidies themselves. Under PAHAL Scheme, the LPG cylinders are sold at non-subsidised price and the applicable subsidy to LPG consumers is transferred directly into the bank account of the consumers. The subsidy is transferred either through Aadhaar Transfer Compliant (ATC) or Bank Transfer Compliant (BTC) mode. PAHAL has helped in identifying ‘ghost’ accounts, multiple accounts and inactive accounts. This has helped in curbing diversion of subsidised LPG to commercial purposes. As on 02.07.2019, out of 26.49 crore LPG consumers, 24.86 crore consumers have joined the Scheme and are getting subsidy in their registered bank account. (e) & (f) Implementation of PAHAL has resulted in identification of 4.49 crore ghost/fake/duplicate connections as on 01.07.2019. These connections have been blocked by Oil Marketing Companies.
