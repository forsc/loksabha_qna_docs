ANSWER




(a) & (b):	Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has notified 24 medical devices as drugs under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act & Rules. Out of these, for 4 medical devices (Cardiac stents, drug eluting stents, condoms and intra uterine devices) which are in the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) and therefore covered under Schedule – I of Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO, 2013), the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) has fixed a price cap. The remaining 20 medical devices are non-scheduled formulations. The NPPA is mandated to monitor the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of all these non-scheduled formulations including medical device. In case of knee implants, it was found that there was a mark up upto 449%. The Government has fixed and notified the ceiling prices of orthopedic knee implants for knee replacement system in exercise of the powers under paragraph 19 of DPCO, 2013.(c) &(d):	 Department of Pharmaceuticals has a sub-scheme viz. Assistance to Medical Device Industry for Common Facilities Center under the umbrella scheme for Development of Pharmaceuticals Industry. Under this sub-scheme, financial assistance to the tune of Rs. 25 Crore or 70% of the project cost, whichever is less is provided for creation of common facilities under any upcoming Medical Device Park promoted by State Governments/State Corporations. The Department has given ‘in-principle’ approval to the proposals received from State Governments of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. This move is expected to bring down the manufacturing cost of medical devices and boost their manufacturing in the country.	*******
