                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL) (a)to (c) 	Drinking water being a State subject, it is States, including Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, who plan, design, approve and implement drinking water supply schemes. Government of India supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical and financial assistance. As such details of individual projects/ schemes for rural water supply projects are not maintained at the Government of India level. To make provision of potable tap water supply to every rural household of the country by 2024, since August, 2019, Government of India in partnership with States is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM). At the time of announcement of Jal Jeevan Mission, out of 18.93 Crore rural households, 3.23 Crore (17%) households were reported to have tap water connections. Since then, in last 27 months, tap water connection has been provided to additional 5.42 Crore (28.2%) rural households. Thus, as of date, out of 19.22 Crore rural households in the country, 8.66 Crore (45%) households are reported to have provision of tap water supply in their homes. A number of steps have been taken to plan and implement Jal Jeevan Mission in the whole country with speed and scale, inter alia which includes joint discussion and finalization of saturation plan and annual action plan (AAP) of States/ UTs, regular review of implementation, workshops/ conferences/ webinars for capacity building, training, knowledge sharing, field visits by multi-disciplinary team to provide technical support, etc. A detailed Operational Guideline for the implementation of JJM; Margdarshika for Gram Panchayats & VWSCs to provide safe drinking water in rural households and Guidelines on a special campaign to provide piped water supply in anganwadi centres, ashramshalas and schools have been shared with States/ UTs, to facilitate planning and implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission. For online monitoring, JJM–Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) and JJM–Dashboard has been put in place. Provision has also been made for transparent online financial management through Public Financial Management System (PFMS). Year-wise timelines finalized by States/ UTs for making provision of tap water supply to every rural household is as under:2020	2021	2022	2023	2024Goa	TelanganaBiharPuducherryA & N IslandsDadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu	GujaratHimachal PradeshHaryanaUttarakhandLadakhManipurMeghalayaPunjabSikkim Jammu & Kashmir	Arunachal PradeshChhattisgarhKarnatakaKeralaMadhya PradeshMizoramNagaland Tamil NaduTripura	AssamAndhra PradeshJharkhandMaharashtraOdishaRajasthanUttar PradeshWest BengalIn Goa, Telangana, Haryana, Puducherry, A & N Islands, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu, provision of tap water supply to all rural households, has been made.*****
