The overall Under 5 Mortality Rate is 36 per 1000 live birth at national level in 2018.The differential Under 5 Mortality Rate in Rural and urban areas varies from state to state. The details of Under 5 Mortality Rate in larger States/ UTs including Assam covered under SRS is placed at Annexure.In order to bring down the mortality among children, the Government of India is supporting all States/UTs including North-Eastern States under National Health Mission in implementation of Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, Adolescent health and Nutrition (RMNCAH+N) strategies. The major interventions include the following: •	In order to improve pregnancy outcome and reduce newborn/ child mortality due to home delivery, Institutional deliveries are promoted under Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) through cash incentive. Women delivering in public health institutions are entitled for free delivery including Caesarean section, post-natal care under Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakaram (JSSK).  Treatment of sick infants up to one year of age is also covered under JSSK.•	Sick Newborn Care Units (SNCU) are established at District Hospital and Medical College level, Newborn Stabilization Units (NBSU) are established at First Referral Units (FRUs)/ Community Health Centres (CHC) for care of sick and small babies. India Newborn Action Plan (INAP) was launched in 2014 to make concerted efforts to reduce neonatal mortality.•	Under Home Based Newborn Care (HBNC) and Home-Based Care of Young Children (HBYC) program, home visits are performed by ASHAs to improve child rearing practices and to identify sick new-born and young children in the community. •	Early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding for first six months and appropriate Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices are promoted under Mothers’ Absolute Affection (MAA). •	Social Awareness and Actions to Neutralize Pneumonia Successfully (SAANS) initiative has been launched for reduction of Childhood morbidity and mortality due to Pneumonia. •	Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) is being supported to provide vaccination to children against life threatening diseases such as Tuberculosis, Diphtheria, Pertussis, Polio, Tetanus, Hepatitis B, Measles, Rubella, Pneumonia and Meningitis caused by Haemophilus Influenzae B.
