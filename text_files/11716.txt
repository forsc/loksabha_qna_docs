(a) Yes, Sir.(b) & (c):  The e-auction was carried out on 17 December, 2019 wherein a total of three bidders participated.  However, the auction was rejected in MSTC bidding process as the H1 bid was less than 50% of Reserve Price of the ship.(d)  The next auction is likely to be scheduled in March, 2020.(e)  The expected amount has been fixed in accordance with existing GoI regulations on disposal of ships as ‘Scrap’.
