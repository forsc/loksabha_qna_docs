ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a): In order to reduce the financial burden towards electricity requirements at airports, airports are using solar panels at airports.  It also helps in reducing the carbon emissions from power generation source.  The airport wise details of JV airports are as follows:;;Airport                        Solar power capacity in MW;Delhi                             7.8;Bangalore                     6.8;Mumbai                        4.5;Hyderabad                   5.0;Cochin                        42.0;;In addition, airports operated by Airports Authority of India have a combined capacity of 43 MWp as in June 2020.(Airport wise data in Annexure).(b) to (e): ICAO had adopted the aspirational goal of achieving carbon neutral growth from 2020 onwards, to ensure that emissions from international aviation do not exceed the 2020 emissions levels.  In order to achieve it, ICAO has developed a global market based measure, in the form of Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) wherein year-wise increase in total global emissions from international flights when compared to the baseline emissions value, will require to be offset by the airlines. CORSIA will be implemented in a phased manner i.e., Pilot phase (2021 to 2023), First phase (2024 to 2026)  and Second phase (2027 to 2035).  Though Pilot and First phases are voluntary, the Second phase is mandatory for all countries who are covered under the scheme.Being a member of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), India like other member countries, is bound to follow the directions issued by ICAO. However, India has decided not to join CORSIA in the voluntary phases.  Hence, CORSIA will be applicable for the Indian carriers from 2027 onwards. India has raised its voice at the ICAO Assembly Session against the design elements of CORSIA stating that they are not fair to the airlines of developing countries who have potential to grow much more after 2020 compared to the airlines of developed countries. India has also filed reservations with ICAO in this regard, both in 2016 and 2019. ;
