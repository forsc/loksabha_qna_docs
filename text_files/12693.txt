                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a):       Yes, Sir. The registration of farmers under PM Kisan Maan Dhan Yojana had started by Common Service Center (CSC) from 09.08.2019 all across the country.(b):       With a view to provide social security to small and marginal farmers in their old age when they have no means of livelihood and minimal or no savings to take care of their expenses, the Government is implementing a new Central Sector Scheme, namely, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan Dhan Yojana (PM-KMY). Under this scheme, a minimum fixed pension of Rs.3,000/- is provided to the small and marginal farmers, subject to certain exclusion criteria, on attaining the age of 60 years. It is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme, with entry age of 18 to 40 years. The subscribing farmer is required to contribute to a Pension Fund between Rs.55 to Rs.200 per month depending on the entry age, with equal contribution from the Central Government. The Pension Fund is managed by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC).   For enrollment in the Scheme, the farmer is required to approach the nearest Common Service Center (CSC) or the Nodal Officer (PM-Kisan) nominated by the State / UT Governments. The Scheme was formally launched on 12th September, 2019.(c):	The matching contribution of 50% of the pension fund are released by this Department to LIC, as per requirement. As of now funds amounting to Rs. 50 crore have been released to LIC. The actual release of funds to LIC in future towards matching contribution of the Government would depend on the number of farmers joining the Scheme in subsequent years.*****
