The work was commenced in May, 2015 with scheduled completion in December, 2017. However, the progress achieved up to September, 2018 was only 30.57%. The work was delayed due to various reasons such as financial constraints of the contractor, poor mobilization of resources, delay in land acquisition etc. As milestones were not achieved in scheduled time, the contract was terminated in November, 2019. 	The action for completion of balance works on this stretch (excluding Tiruvarur Bypass) has been initiated.  Moreover, repair and maintenance of the existing stretch has been taken up at the cost of Rs. 11.01 crore separately to keep the existing road in traffic worthy condition.  *****
