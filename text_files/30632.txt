ANSWER




(a) to (f): No such study has been conducted by the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Further, in respect of the crimes committed by overseas Indian citizens, the laws of the respective countries apply. The practice of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is a penal offence under sections 319 to 326 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which deal with causing hurt or grievous hurt, including hurt or grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means. Further, in relation to girls below 18 years of age, the provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act, 2012 apply. The Government implements the scheme of One Stop Centres (OSC) across the country to provide a range of services such as police facilitation, legal aid, psycho-social counseling, medical aid and temporary shelter to violence affected women and girls in an integrated manner, under one roof. These are also available to victims of FGM.*****
