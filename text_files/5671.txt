ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND PENSIONS AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a) & (b):   No, Sir. The Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2014 (No. 17 of 2014) has been notified on 12th May, 2014. The Act requires amendments aimed at safeguarding against disclosures affecting sovereignty and integrity of India, Security of the State, etc., before it is brought into force. To make these amendments to the Act, the Government introduced the Whistle Blowers Protection (Amendment) Bill, 2015 in the Lok Sabha on 11th May, 2015 which was passed by the Lok Sabha on 13th May, 2015 but discussion on the Bill remained inconclusive in Rajya Sabha. The Bill has since lapsed upon the dissolution of the Sixteenth Lok Sabha. (c) & (d):    No such data is centrally maintained. Government of India had drawn the attention of State Governments to the reports appearing in the media about the victimization of people, who use RTI to expose corruption and irregularities in administration. The framework of existing laws such as Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code etc. is considered adequate to provide for safety and security to all citizens, including RTI activists.   *****
