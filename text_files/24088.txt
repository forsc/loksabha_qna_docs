ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) 158 Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) and 61 Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) have been opened in the country from 2014 onwards till date. KVs and JNVs are not opened constituency-wise. State/UT-wise details of KVs and JNVs opened from 2014 onwards till date including State of Odisha are annexed.(b) The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one JNV in each district of the country. All the 30 districts of State of Odisha have already been covered with Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme and an additional JNV has also been functional in Scheduled Tribes concentrated Malkangiri district.(c) Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) has informed that the proposal for opening of a new KV in Talcher was received from the State Government of Odisha. The proposal has been referred back to the State Government for removal of discrepancies.(d) e-Granthalaya, a digital platform developed by National Informatics Centre provides a complete ICT solution with integrated library management software, a digital library module and cloud hosting environment. e-Granthalaya software has been installed in the libraries of the KVs and 603 Navodaya Vidyalayas in the country. e-Granthalaya software is being used for issue and receipt of library books and maintenance of records of books in digital mode. Upgradation and modernization of laboratories in the KVs and JNVs is a continuous process and the work is taken up in a phased manner as per requirement.(e) Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti has informed that 206 teachers are engaged on short-term contract basis to fill up the vacant teaching posts immediately to avoid any academic loss of students.******
