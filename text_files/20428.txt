RAMESH CHANDRA MAJHI, M.P.(a) to (c)  Irrigation Projects with Cultivable Command Area (CCA) less than 2,000 ha fall under Minor/Small Irrigation category, and their appraisal are done by concerned State Governments themselves. Appraisal of Medium Irrigation projects (CCA between 2,000 ha and 10,000 ha) on inter-state river system, is done by Central Water Commission (CWC), based on the project proposal in the form of a Detailed Project Report (DPR) submitted by the concerned State Government. The minor/ small and medium irrigation projects presently under appraisal in CWC are as below: (i) Minor/Small Irrigation ProjectsDepartment of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (DoWR, RD & GR) has received proposals of Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI) projects from various States, seeking Central Assistance under Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP) component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) Scheme. The details of the such proposals are given below:  S.N.	State	No. of SMI Projects	Est. Cost. (Rs. In crore)	Targeted Irrigation Potential in ha1	Madhya Pradesh	63	335.85	185802	Meghalaya	70	229.51	93763	Nagaland 	213 	133.21	68374	Mizoram 	9 	8.51	2475	Tripura 	5	2.41	836	Sikkim 	309	163.55	75217	Uttarakhand	422	349.39	19524 	Total:	1091	1222.43	62168Presently, no proposal from Odisha for Minor/ Small Irrigation project, is pending with this Ministry. Further, the inclusion of the above projects for funding under PMKSY-HKKP depends upon techno-economic viability of the project, its eligibility under the scheme, availability of funds, etc.(ii) Medium Irrigation ProjectsPresently, four medium irrigation projects are at various stages of appraisal in CWC, as per details below: Contd…P/2//2//No.	Title of Project	State	CCA (Ha)	Est. CostRs. in Crore 	Status1	Attapady Irrigation Project 	Kerala	6,500	497.00	Consent of Cauvery Water Management Authority awaited for initiation of appraisal.2	BordiNalla Medium Irrigation Project	Maharashtra	4,649	515.96	Presently under appraisal3	Katepurna Barrage Medium Irrigation Project – 	Maharashtra	4,356	533.81	Presently under appraisal. Compliance on inter-state matters awaited from State Government.4	Kolibirra Medium Irrigation Project- Pre Feasibility Report 	Chhattisgarh	3,500	164.25	Presently under appraisal On completion of the appraisal process, these projects are to be placed for consideration of Advisory Committee of DoWR, RD&GR on Irrigation, Flood Control & Multipurpose Projects. However, the approval of the projects depends on successful completion of the appraisal of various aspects like hydrology, irrigation planning, design, inter-State issues and cost estimation in CWC, with active participation of concerned State Governments. (d)  So far during 2020-2021, an SMI scheme cluster of 375 SMI projects from Manipur, with targeted irrigation potential of 9,641 hectare, and estimated cost of Rs.226.7 crore, has been included under PMKSY-HKKP. Further, one Medium Irrigation project, namely Amreng Irrigation Project (Assam), having CCA of 6,800 hectares, has also been accepted by the Advisory Committee of DoWR, RD & GR during 2020-21, for estimated cost of Rs.540.46 crore, at 2019-2020 price level.(e)  In order to take up appraisal in a time bound manner, project proposals for inter-state medium irrigation projects are to be submitted to CWC on the portal specifically developed by CWC for this purpose, namely ePAMS. This procedure ensures that the appraisal process is transparent, time-stamped and monitored online at various levels, against laid down timelines. The issues where compliance is required from the State Govt. concerned is to be provided, is also highlighted in ePAMS. For minor irrigation projects, the DPR and thus the associated appraisal process is simplified, and multi-layered monitoring mechanism ensures timely approvals.*****
