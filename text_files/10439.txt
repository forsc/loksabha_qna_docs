Towards this end, AIM is establishing Atal Tinkering Labs across the country for students between grade 6th to 12th, equipped with latest emerging technologies such as electronics, IoT (Internet of Things), 3D printing, Robotics, etc.As of today, a total of 8878 schools have been selected and 4680 schools have been given the ATL grant-in-aid for establishment of ATL.AIM is planning to operationalize 10,000 ATLs by the end of March 2021.(b)	The state-wise number of selected schools and corresponding schools which have received the ATL grant is placed at Annexure A.(c)	70% of the schools selected for ATLs to date are Govt. / Govt-aided schools and 70% are girls and co-ed schools.
