ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a): 	The One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan for nation-wide portability of the National Food Security Act 2013 (NFSA) benefits, is presently enabled in 33 States/UTs covering almost 86.7% NFSA population (about 69 Crore NFSA beneficiaries) in the country. Delhi being the latest to enable the same from July 2021.........2/--2-(b): 	In the past, Department had regularly pursued with the remaining States to enable the ONORC plan at the earliest for the benefit of migrant NFSA beneficiaries. Further, pursuant to the order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India dated 29-06-2021 directing the States/UT which have not implemented the ONORC plan, the Department has again pursued with all concerned States/UT. As a result, the ONORC plan has been enabled in Delhi from 23.07.2021. (c): 	Under NFSA, sufficient foodgrains are allocated to all States/UTs as per their respective coverage of beneficiaries under the Act. Presently, most of the portability transactions under ONORC are seen with in the States/UTs, and in respect of foodgrain requirement for distribution to inter-State migrant beneficiaries, the States/UTs if require, may lift advance foodgrains from FCI/Central Stocks. Further, a mechanism is in place for periodic reconciliation and adjustment of foodgrains between States/UTs distributed to inter-State beneficiaries under ONORC.  (d): 	As per extant guidelines under the ONORC plan, all States/UTs including Kerala, if require, may lift advance foodgrains to meet any shortfall of foodgrains on account of distribution to inter-State migrant beneficiaries. Such quantities distributed to inter-State beneficiaries are periodically reconciled and adjusted between concerned States/UTs. No additional allocation of foodgrains is made under ONORC.  (e): 	Under NFSA, sufficient foodgrains are available to all States/UTs every month, including Kerala, to adequately meet the requirement for distribution to NFSA beneficiaries in the State/UT, including inter-State beneficiaries. ***
