                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		 	  (SHRI NARENDRA  SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (g):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (g) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.  118  DUE FOR REPLY ON 27th JULY, 2021.(a): 	The Department has commenced the work for creating Agristack in the country. In order to create Agristack, the department is in the process of finalising “India Digital Ecosystem of Agriculture (IDEA)” which will lay down a framework for Agristack. Accordingly, a Task Force has been constituted and in furtherance a Concept Paper on IDEA has already been floated for comments from the general public not only through department’s website but also through emails especially to subject matter specialists, Agro-Industry, Farmers, Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs).The IDEA would help in laying down the architecture for the Agri-stack in the country and that would serve as a foundation to build innovative agri-focused solutions leveraging emerging technologies to contribute effectively in creating a better Ecosystem for Agriculture in India. This Ecosystem shall help the Government in effective planning towards increasing the income of farmers in particular and improving the efficiency of the Agriculture sector as a whole. As a first step in this direction Government has already initiated building federated farmers’ database that would serve as the core of the envisaged Agristack.No private sector companies are involved as far as building of the Agristack is concerned. However, leading Technology/Agri-tech/StartUp companies were identified and invited to collaborate with the Government of India to develop Proof of Concepts (PoC) based on small portions of data from the federated Farmers’ database for certain identified areas (Districts/Village). A public call through the Department’s website has been placed inviting proposals for PoCs. MoUs purely on pro bono basis with selected companies are being signed, for a period of one year to develop PoCs. The PoCs will help in understanding solutions that    can be built using available data and some of them, if found beneficial to the Contd…2/--2-farmers will be scaled up at National level. There is no connection between the MoUs and the IDEA Consultation Paper for which comments were sought from various stakeholders in the country. (b): 	The details of MoUs entered by this Department are given at Annexure.(c) & (d): 	As of now, the federated farmers’ database is being built by taking the publicly available data as existing in the Department and in various data silos in Government and linking them with the digitised land records. This Department in consultation with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is in the process of bringing out a data policy for the agriculture sector. Government would ensure the data privacy of the Farmers’ personal data only for sharing with any private organization.(e): 	Yes, the Government aims to create a federated National Farmers Database and the digitized land records will be used as data attributes for creating this database. To bring dynamism to the farmer’s database, the linkage with digital land record management system is essential. The database is envisaged to facilitate online single sign on facilities for universal access and usher in proactive and personalised services to farmers such as direct benefit transfer, soil and plant health advisories, weather advisories, irrigation facilities, seamless credit & insurance facilities, seeds, fertilizers, pesticide related information nearby logistic facilities, market access information, peer to peer lending of farm equipment etc. The aim is to increase farmers’ income by leveraging the available data and developing solutions based on the data so that the input costs are reduced, ease of farming is ensured, quality is improved and farmers get better price for their farm produce. If any States have already built such system, then, endeavour will be to make use of the same and build on top of that.Contd…3/- -3-(f): 	At present, farmers’ database will include the farmers, who are legal owners of the agriculture land as per the government database and as endorsed by the State Government. In future, the possibility of including others may be considered in consultation with State Governments & other Stakeholders.(g) : 	Once developed, federated national farmer database will help to deliver personalized and proactive services to farmers. Government can make use of the database for targeted service delivery with higher efficiency and in a focussed & time bound manner.
