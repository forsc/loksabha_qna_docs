Some of the important leads are as follows:•	An integrated 2G ethanol technology with onsite enzyme production has been developed at pilot scale from agricultural biomass such as rice straw, wheat straw and bagasse.•	The first indigenous  enzyme technology has been developed for pretreatment of different biomass for 2G ethanol production.  The technology now has been transferred to an oil marketing company for setting up of a commercial scale plant.  •	Technology for production of value added products such as lactic acid, levulinic acid, Poly hydroxyl alkanoids (PHA) from the by-products of 2G ethanol process has been developed.•	Wastewater treatment technology using microalgal biomass to produce bio-crude oil has been developed.(d) & (e) No such proposal to generate bio-energy from waste in existing garbage landfills is under consideration.
