ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a)	to (e) Covid-19 vaccination program for adolescents aged 15 to 18 years started from 3rd January 2022 and as on 31st January 2022, 4,59,99,539 have received the 1st dose of COVID-19 vaccine (62.1%). Covid vaccination is voluntary in nature and the vaccine doses are administered to this population group after providing knowledge regarding the safety, efficacy and possible adverse-reaction of the vaccine to them and their parents. In order to raise awareness about COVID-19 vaccines, address vaccine hesitancy and sustain vaccine confidence among beneficiaries as well as their parents, a communication strategy is in place which is implemented across all States/UTs. Administration of 2nd dose to these beneficiaries has begun after completion of 28 days from the date of administration of 1st dose of Covaxin. Adequate quantity of vaccine doses have been made available to all States/Uts to vaccinate all eligible beneficiaries. The State/UT-wise coverage of adolescents aged 15 to 18 years is attached at Annexure I.****
