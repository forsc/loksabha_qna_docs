                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (SHRI PANKAJ CHAUDHARY)(a) Different Research Institutes/Organisations follow alternate ways to estimate poverty inIndia. However, officially the erstwhile Planning Commission estimated poverty line andpoverty ratio on the basis of Large Sample Surveys on Household Consumer Expenditurecarried out by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) of the Ministry of Statistics andProgramme Implementation. The last data of Large Sample Survey on HouseholdConsumer Expenditure has been collected by NSSO in its 68th round conducted in 2011-12. Based on this data, the erstwhile Planning Commission estimated poverty lines and poverty ratio in 2011-12 following the extant Tendulkar Committee methodology and released through a Press Note issued on 22nd July 2013. According to this Press Note, the number of persons living below poverty line in India has been estimated as 27 crore in 2011-12. No estimates of poverty have been released by the Government thereafter.(b) As per data compiled by the Reserve Bank of India, net financial assets of households increased to 21 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the first quarter of 2020-21, and then declined to 8.2 percent of the GDP in the third quarter of 2020-21.(c) As per the latest Quarterly Statistics on Deposits and Credit of Scheduled Commercial Banks released by the Reserve Bank of India, 159 districts in 25 State/UTs saw a decline in fixed deposits in the fourth quarter of 2020-21 compared to fourth quarter of 2019-20, due to positive growth in private consumption expenditure.(d) and (e) Government has initiated several targeted schemes that aim to reduce poverty, provide social security, income generation and livelihood options, and improve the quality of life of the vulnerable sections of the population in the country. Some of these include Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana, Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission, Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Urban Livelihoods Mission, Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana, National Health Mission, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, Atal Pension Yojana, Aspirational Districts Programme, Pradhan Mantri Kisan Mandhan Yojana, Stand Up India Scheme, Skill India Mission, Start Up India Scheme, One nation one ration card scheme, Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Man-dhan yojana, PM Mudra Yojana, Ayushman Bharat Scheme, AMRUT Scheme, Sansad Adharsh Gram Yojana.*****
