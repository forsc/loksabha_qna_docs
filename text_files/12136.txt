These Committees review the progress of implementation of the scheme periodically to strengthen the coordination and convergence between concerned Departments and suggest modifications required for improving the implementation. Further, PMMVY is implemented through web based Management and Information System (MIS) Software, viz. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana-Common Application Software (PMMVY-CAS) which is used as an effective tool for regular monitoring of the scheme. The PMMVY-CAS is enabled to monitor key indicators like number of beneficiaries enrolled, number of beneficiaries paid maternity benefits, total maternity benefits disbursed to eligible beneficiaries etc. on near-real time basis.The implementation of PMMVY is reviewed periodically through Video Conferences with States/UTs and through National and Regional level workshops. Consequently, the uptake of the scheme has increased and more and more beneficiaries are brought under the ambit of the scheme. PMMVY is a DBT compliant scheme and as on 04.02.2020, maternity benefits of ? 5300.18 crores have been directly credited to the Bank/Post Office accounts of more than 1.29 crores eligible beneficiaries. ***** AnnexureStatement referred to in reply to part (b) of the Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 99 for answer on 07.02.2020 raised by Shri Chandra Prakash Joshi and Shri Manoj Tiwari regarding Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY)State/UT-wise details of funds spent for disbursement of maternity benefits to eligible beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) since inception of the Scheme till 04.02.2020Sl.
