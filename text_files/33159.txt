                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (f) The National Digital Health Mission (now known as Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission) was launched on 15th August 2020 in six Union Territories– Andaman & Nicobar, Chandigarh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu, Ladakh, Lakshadweep and Puducherry, as a pilot. Its aims to create an online platform enabling interoperability of health data within the health ecosystem to create longitudinal electronic health record of every citizen.  The pilot phase of ABDM was successfully conducted between 15th August 2020 to 27th September 2021.Three key registries of NDHM namely Health ID, Health Professional Registry (HPR), Health Facility Registry (HFR) and digital infrastructure for data exchange have been developed and implemented in these UTs. On 27th September 2021, the national rollout of the ABDM has been announced. Till 31st January 2022, Rs 45 Cr has been released to National Health Authority (NHA) for implementation of ABDM. Creation of Health ID is voluntary. NHA is creating awareness among the citizens about the usages and advantages of Health ID to maximize participation from citizen.  The government/NHA is continuously holding extensive consultations to finalize the policy and implementation related aspects of ABDM time to time with key stakeholders like insurance companies, government programmes, licensing authorities, medical councils, officials from central and state governments, development organizations and NGOs and software developers/technical partners, civic society etc.Various consultation papers have also been released in the public domain to seek comments on important building blocks of ABDM like the Health Professional Registry, Health Facility Registry, Unified Health Interface, Health data retention policy. The presentations made to stakeholders during these consultations along with the comments received from various stakeholders are available at https://abdm.gov.in/home/Publications ‘Privacy by Design’ is one of the key guiding principles of ABDM. Under ABDM, no health data is centrally stored and it facilitates secure data exchange between the intended stakeholders duly following a consent framework. Till 25th January 2022, 15,05,92,811 Health IDs (now known as ABHA – Ayushman Bharat Health Accounts) have been created in the country.**********
