                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) and (b) As per the records available in the Wild Life Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), which are based on information received from State/UT Forest and Police authorities, the demand of Star Tortoises as most favoured pets is one of the major threats to their survival. (c), (d) and (e) Star Tortoise is included in Testudinidae family which is listed in Schedule IV of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. Illegal trading of Star Tortoise is punishable under the provisions of the Act.  Protection of wildlife is primarily the responsibility of the States/Union Territories. Under Section 38Z of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, WCCB facilitates collection and collation of intelligence related to organized wildlife crime activities and disseminates the same to State and other enforcement agencies. Investigations into cases of poaching and illegal trade are conducted by the State Forest Departments, Police and Customs authorities. *****
