                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FORMINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYAND EARTH SCIENCES(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a)	A total number of 63 automatic stations, 30 Automatic Weather Station (AWS)+3Agro AWS+30 Automatic Rainguages (ARG)to record rainfall are already functioning in the State of Kerala. These are in addition to 70 manual observatories [Departmental (8)+Part time (4)+Non departmental like that of State Government, schools etc (58)]. Thus a total number of 133 observatories are already there and functioning in Kerala for rainfall monitoring.Two Doppler Weather Radars (DWR) are operational in the State of  Kerala; one at Kochi and another at Thiruvananthapuram which meet the requirements of Kerala; especially the central and southern parts of Kerala. (b)	There is a document published by Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS) in the year 1994 on the number of Non recording/Recording rainguages per Sq. Km. According to this, the requirement of rainguages for Kerala can be computed as given below. The area of Kerala is 38800 Sq.Km, of which 80% is Coastal + Plain land and remaining 20% is with hills.For the 31040 Sq. Km. consisting of Coastal+Plain land, 31040/500=63 Rain stations are needed whereas for the 7760 Sq.Km. hilly terrain, 7760/150 Sq.Km=52 Rain stations are needed. Thus, the number of total Rain monitoring stations as per BIS-1994 is 63+52=115 for Kerala.(c) - (d)	Kerala already have 133 Rain stations at present against the requirement of 115 as per BIS-1994 Standard. There had been a request for installation of 100 more AWS in Kerala out of which 15 AWS have already been installed. With the likely installation of remaining 85 AWS in near future, the number of observatories for rainfall monitoring will become 218.
