ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))a) The Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)- UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21-10-2016 to enhance regional air connectivity from unserved and underserved airports in the country and by making air travel affordable to the masses. UDAN is a market driven Scheme. Interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit proposals at the time of bidding under RCS. As on date, 395 UDAN routes have been operationalized involving 63 unserved/underserved airports including 6 heliports and 2 water aerodromes. b) to e): Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh, figures in the tentative list of unserved airports of the UDAN Document. However, none of the airline bidders have so far submitted their proposal to operate RCS flights from Ratlam  in the bidding conducted under UDAN. An airport which is included in the awarded routes of RCS - UDAN and requires upgradation/development for commencement of RCS operations, is developed under the "Revival of unserved and underserved airports" scheme. Jhabua & Alirajpur airstrips are not available in the tentative list of unserved Airports in the UDAN Document.
