ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) & (b) The Government of India has decided to push electric mobility since it is environmental friendly and also will reduce dependency  on fossil fuel imports.  The aim is to replace 30% of the total vehicle fleet in the country by electric vehicles by 2030.  In this regard, the National E-Mobility Programme has been launched which is being implemented by Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a Joint Venture of PSUs under Ministry of Power, Government of India.  Under this programme, e-cars are being provided by EESL to Government organizations based on their requirement on lease/outright purchase basis to replace the existing fleet of petrol/diesel vehicles taken on lease by them. EESL has aggregated demand of electric vehicles from various government departments.  In order to meet the demand, EESL concluded a tender to procure 10,000 e-cars and 2,125 chargers. Of these, EESL has deployed around 1,510 e-cars and commissioned 300 AC and 170 DC captive chargers across Government organizations in the country.(c) & (d) As per TERI 2018 report sub-sectoral contribution to PM2.5 in Delhi in winter of  2016 from transport was 28%(truck: 8%, tractor :1%, Bus :3%, Cars:3%, Two wheelers: 7%, three wheelers: 5%, LCVs: 1%).  Similarly, sub-sectoral contribution to PM10 in Delhi in winter 2016 from transport was 24 %( truck: 7%, tractor :1%, Bus :2%, Cars:3%, Two wheelers: 6%, three wheelers: 4%, LCVs: 1%).  The battery operated vehicles are considered as zero-emission vehicles. These will help to improve air quality in cities.  There is considerable energy and CO2 savings are associated with the two, three, and four-wheeled e-vehicles and buses covered by FAME II over their lifetime, as well as the potential savings associated with greater adoption levels by 2030.  Several other initiatives have also been taken by the Central Government for abatement and control of air pollution caused by the vehicular emission/transport sectors which includes leapfrogging from BS-IV to BS-VI fuel standards since 1st April, 2018 in NCT of Delhi, in NCR since October 2019 and by 1st April, 2020 in the rest of the country for both fuels well as vehicles.  The adoption of BS-IV heavy duty diesel has resulted 80% reduction in particulate matter (PM) with respect to BS-III and further 50% reduction in PM due to BS-VI as compared to BS-IV.   Operationalization of Eastern Peripheral Expressway and Western Peripheral Expressway, expansion of metro network, promotion of public transport , improvements in roads and bridges have also played bigger role in reduction of vehicular pollution. *****
