ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI THAAWARCHAND GEHLOT)(a) to (e):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.  Statement referred to in Reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No.48 for answer on 25-06-2019. (a)  to (e) :    The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has been revising the schemes from time to time to revamp the major welfare schemes of the Government. This is an ongoing process. The following schemes have been/proposed to be revamped.A.	  Scheduled Caste Welfare Division:1.	Scholarship SchemesUnder the Centrally Sponsored Scholarship schemes for SCs for both Post-Matric & Pre-Matric and Pre-Matric for children of those engaged in occupations involving cleaning and prone to health hazards, Central Assistance is released to the States/UTs for all expenditure over and above their Committed Liability which is fixed at the beginning of every Plan period/ Finance Commission cycle based on the expenditure during the previous Plan period.    Due to the ‘Committed Liability’ concept, maximum part of the financial burden had to be borne by the State Governments/UT Administrations in 2017-18 and 2018-19 and the Central share became minimal.   It has, therefore, been envisaged to change the funding pattern under the scheme from ‘Committed Liability’  to a pre-decided ‘ fixed sharing ratio’  between Centre and the States/UTs.  This will ensure certainty about flow of funds and reduce the financial burden on the State.The total annual expenditure of the Centre and the States will be about Rs.10,000 crores for PMS-SC, Rs.1000 crores for the Pre Matric Scholarship-SC and Rs.100 crores for Pre-matric Scholarship to the children of those engaged in occupations involving cleaning and prone to health hazards respectively.2.	Special Central Assistance to Scheduled Caste Sub Plan; (SCA to SCSP): Under this Centrally Sponsored scheme, 100% Central Assistance is given to the States/UTs as an additive to State Scheduled Caste Sub-Plan for selected income generating activities, skill development and infrastructure development for Scheduled Caste persons.    It is, inter-alia, proposed to increase the maximum level of subsidy for income generating activities from the present Rs.10,000 per beneficiary to a higher more viable level and to change the eligibility criteria from “ persons below poverty line” to “ persons with income upto Rs.2.5 lakhs per annum”.  It is proposed to implement the Scheme within the available budget.  3.	Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana (PMAGY):  The scheme was launched in 2009-10 with the objective of providing gap-filling funds for infrastructure development in SC majority villages.   Upto October 2018, only 2500 villages had been taken up for implementation.    In 2018-19, the scheme was revised to make it more focussed and provisions were added for gap analysis, planning and implementation against 50 identified critical socio-economic monitorable indicators  in 10 domains such as water & sanitation, education, electricity, rural roads and housing etc.  Funds were also arranged for further expansion of the scheme  in convergence with another scheme of the Ministry i.e., SCA to SCSP.   It is now proposed to cover all the SC majority villages having more than 500 total population upto the end of 15th Finance Commission cycle by taking up 3000 to 3500 additional villages every year and also provide them with repeated rounds of funding at fixed intervals so that continuous development can be ensured.An amount of Rs.6000 crore would be required for covering all the villages  considering a Central Government contribution at the current level of Rs.21 lakh per village.    Under the Scheme State contribution is not mandatory, however, State is expected to contribute at least three to four times of ‘gap-filling’ fund from existing Central/State Schemes or with matching grants from State Governments.4.	Equity Contribution to NSFDCShare Capital of NSFDC from Rs.1500.00 crore to Rs.3000.00 crore is proposed to be increased to enable more lending to the State channelizing agencies. .5.	National Survey of Manual Scavengers in 170 Districts 	There was demands from several quarters that all the manual scavengers who were engaged in manual scavenging after the enactment of the “Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013” were left out from identification. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, and NITI Aayog took cognizance of these demands and accordingly, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, with the support of NITI Aayog, initiated National Survey of Manual Scavengers for which National Safai Karamcharis Finance and Development Corporation (NSKFDC) is nodal agency.  It was decided to conduct the survey  in first phase, in 170 districts of 18 States. So far survey reports have been received from 159 of 170 districts and 39,093 manual scavengers have been identified. It is proposed to release One Time Cash Assistance (OTCA) to all the identified manual scavengers. 6.	Allocation for welfare of SCSchemes under AWSC are being monitored regularly as per NITI Aayog guidelines and framework. Now 41 Ministries are participating in the review of the Scheme. Monthly review meeting to enhance the utilization of funds under various schemes is underwayB. 	Backward Classes Division 1.

It is a fund limited Scheme and this department is striving to enhance the budget in the Scheme. 5.	National Fellowship for OBC Students (NF-OBC)Number of intake of Students in the Scheme has been increased from 300 to 1000. Modification in eligibility criteria of making Net qualification mandatory is also being finalized.  This department is trying to enhance the budget in the Scheme. 6.	Equity Contribution to NBCFDCBudget has been enhanced from Rs. 80.00 cr. to Rs. 130.00 cr. owing to higher demand from NBCFDC.C. 	Social Defence Division1.

The Ministry also proposes to provide Skill Development to Transgender Persons in order to make them productive members of the society. 3.
