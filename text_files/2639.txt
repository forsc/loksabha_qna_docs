                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TOURISM (INDEPENDENT CHARGE)(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) to (e):	Promotion and development of tourism including Eco-Tourism and Heritage Tourism is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments/Union Territory Administrations. However, the Ministry of Tourism has taken several initiatives to boost tourism including Eco-Tourism and Heritage Tourism in the country.           The ‘Adopt A Heritage: Apni Dharohar, Apni Pehchaan’, initiative is a collaborative effort by Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Culture and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), State / UTs Governments, for promotion of Heritage Tourism which envisages developing heritage sites and making them tourist friendly, to enhance tourism potential and cultural importance in a planned and phased manner. It aims to encourage public sector companies, private sector companies and corporate citizens / NGOs / individuals to take up the responsibility as a Public Private Partnership (PPP) venture. A total of 11 Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs) have been signed so far which cover Eco Tourism and Heritage Sites under this scheme.            In addition, the Ministry of Tourism has launched the Swadesh Darshan Scheme for the development of tourism related infrastructure and facilities in the country. Under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme, 15 themes have been identified for developing theme based circuits. These themes include Buddhist Circuit, Coastal Circuit, Desert Circuit, Eco Circuit, Heritage Circuit, Himalayan Circuit, Krishna Circuit, North-East Circuit, Ramayana Circuit, Rural Circuit, Spiritual Circuit, Sufi Circuit, Tirthankar Circuit, Tribal Circuit and Wildlife Circuit. The list of projects sanctioned under the Himalayan, Eco-Tourism, North East and Heritage themes are given at Annexure.          The submission of project proposals by the State Governments / UT Administrations under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme is a continuous process. The projects are sanctioned subject to availability of funds, liquidation of pending Utilisation Certificates, submission of suitable Detailed Project Report and adherence to the scheme guidelines for creating tourist infrastructure facilities for public good.*******
