ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (e): Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY) took cognizance of the WhatsApp announcement of its new Privacy Policy stated to be applicable to Indian users from February 2021. To safeguard the interest of Indian users, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has asked WhatsApp to review the proposed privacy policy changes and also to explain the rationale of the same. WhatsApp has communicated that the messages sent by users in their private chats or in private groups continue to be end-to-end encrypted  and other persons or WhatsApp cannot access these messages.(f): Section 43A of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000 provides for safeguards for sensitive personal information collected by a body corporate. The Information Technology (Reasonable security practices and procedures and sensitive personal data or information) Rules, 2011 notified under this section defines sensitive personal information and also mandate that body corporate must provide policy for privacy and disclosure of information, so that user is well aware of the type of personal data collected, purpose of collection and usage of such information. The rules also specify mode of collection of information, disclosure of information, transfer of information, etc. Also section 72A of the IT Act provides for punishment for disclosure of information in breach of the lawful contract.The centralized messaging and voice-over-IP service applications platforms including WhatsApp, Facebook etc, for the user generated content made available on their platforms, are intermediaries as defined in the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000. Accordingly, they  have to observe due diligence prescribed by the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011 notified under section 79 of IT Act, 2000.Further, Government has already moved the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 in Parliament which is presently under the consideration of the Joint Parliamentary Committee formed by Lok Sabha. The Bill provides for safeguards of privacy and interests of the Indian citizens.******
