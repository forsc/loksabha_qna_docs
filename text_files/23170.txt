However, a case was registered and investigations were launched under the provisions of Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) against KIIFB by the Directorate of Enforcement based on a compliant received in March 2020. On summoning, the officers from Axis Bank and KIIFB appeared, submitted some documents and their preliminary statements were recorded. The documents so submitted are under scrutiny. Earlier, the Axis Bank had approached RBI on behalf of its constituent KIIFB, for issuance of Rupee denominated bonds (RDB). RBI had given “no objection” from the angle of FEMA 1999, for raising RDBs.*****
