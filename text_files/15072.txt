                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	Yes Sir, in order to ensure the availability of the Bt. Cotton seed to the farmers at fair, reasonable and affordable prices and curtail the charging of exorbitant price, DAC&FW has promulgated Cotton Seeds Price (Control) Order (CSPCO), 2015, on 07.12.2015. Under this order a committee fixes Maximum Sale Price (MSP) of  BT Cotton Seed every year, considering the seed value, recurring royalty (trait value), trade margins etc. The price of BG-II cotton seed in 2019 was fixed at Rs.730/- including Rs.20/- as trait value.(c) & (d):	No seed firm has informed about this, however, National Seed Association of India has informed that BG-II technology has become ineffective against Pink Boll Worm. However, ICAR has informed that despite the fact that Pink Boll Worm has developed resistance to the cry toxins present in Bollgard II, farmers are cultivating Bt cotton in more than 87% of cotton area and the technology is still good and continues to provide protection against American Boll Worm and Spotted Bollworm.********
