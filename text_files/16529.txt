By imposing country-wide Lockdown, India successfully blunted the aggressive spread of COVID. The period of Lockdown helped the nation to create much required additional health infrastructure. During this time, dedicated isolation beds recorded an increase of 22 times and dedicated ICU beds above 14 times to what existed in March 2020. Similarly, laboratory capacity for testing COVID was increased nearly 10 times during this time. Whereas there was no indigenous manufacturing of Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs), with the requisite standards, at that point in time, the country is now self-sufficient and in a position to export the same. Similarly, very limited indigenous manufacturing capacity was available for masks, ventilators, etc. at the time of Lockdown, was also enhanced to attain self-reliance in this regard. During this period, requirement of various cadres of personnel and volunteers across sectors  and  departments  for  COVID  related  works  and maintenance of-3/...-3-LS.US.Q.NO.256 FOR 15.09.2020other essential medical services were worked out, and trained through resources made available on the website of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and iGOT an online platform (https://igot.gov.in/igot/).It has been estimated that the decision of Lockdown, by slowing down the progress of pandemic in India, has prevented 14–29 lakh cases and 37–78 thousand deaths.
