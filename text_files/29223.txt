However, the Ministry has identified 1,597 Blocks in 255 districts as water-stressed. From the available information, 756 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) have been identified as water-stressed, of which 29 ULBs are in Madhya Pradesh. The names of water-stressed ULBs in Madhya Pradesh is annexed.Depletion of ground water, increase in population, competing demand from other sectors, inefficient use of available water, inadequate operation and maintenance, etc. are some of the reasons for shortage of water supply in cities.Urban development and water supply, are State subjects. To supplement the efforts of States, Government of India provides financial and technical assistance. Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has taken several steps towards sustainable management of water in urban areas through missions such as Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). Under AMRUT, water supply is one of the thrust areas. Out of total approved outlay of Rs. 77,640 Crore for all States/ UTs for the period 2015-16 to 2019-20, Rs. 39,010 Crore (50%) was allocated for water supply and so far, 114 lakh household have been provided tap water connections under AMRUT and in convergence with other schemes.Further, MoHUA has launched AMRUT 2.0 on 1st October, 2021 to provide tap water connections to all households in about 4,800 towns and for universal coverage of sewerage and septage management in 500 AMRUT cities. The mission focuses on water conservation, rejuvenation of water bodies and wells,  recycle/ reuse of used water, and rainwater harvesting along with tap and sewer connections.In Satna city, one water supply project amounting to Rs. 41.50 Crore has been completed under AMRUT benefitting 32,000 households.Government of India is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) in partnership with States, to make provision of potable tap water supply to every rural household in the country by 2024.
