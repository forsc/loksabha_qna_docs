ANSWER




ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) to (c) Under the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2015 (JJ Act), a safety network of service delivery structures alongwith institutional and non-institutional care has been stipulated for children in need of care and protection including  children who have been rescued from sexual abuse and other forms of exploitation, inter-alia. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Rules, 2020 was notified on 9th March, 2020. Section 3(5) of the POCSO Rules, 2020 mandates the respective  Governments to formulate a child protection policy based on the principle of zero-tolerance to violence  against  children,  which  shall  be  adopted  by  all  institutions,  organizations,  or  any  other  agency  working with, or coming in contact with children. The Government implements  centrally sponsored Child Protection Services (CPS) Scheme, for supporting the children in difficult circumstances, including the children who have been rescued from sexual abuse and other forms of exploitation. Fund of Rs.745.46 crores was released to the States/UTs under “Child Protection Services” (CPS) during 2019-20. Under the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, identification, release and rehabilitation of freed bonded labour is the direct responsibility of the State Government/UT Administration concerned.  The Central Government provides funds to the State Governments/UT Administrations for the Central Sector Scheme for Rehabilitation of Bonded Labourers, 2016. *****
