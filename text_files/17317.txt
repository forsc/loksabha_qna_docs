However, impacts of floods & erosion can be mitigated to a certain degree by adopting appropriate structural and nonstructural measures. For the state of Assam, a total of 141 projects costing Rs 2383.11 Cr were approved during XI (100 projects costing Rs 996.14 Cr) Plan and XII (41 projects costing Rs 1386.97 Cr) Plan. Out of these 141 projects, 103 projects were completed during XI and XII Plan. A Central Assistance of Rs 813.75 Cr was released during XI( Rs 748.86 Crore) and XII(Rs 64.89 Cr) Plan. Further a Central assistance of Rs 472.64 Cr during the year 2017-20 has been released. Thus, since start of XI Plan, total Central Assistance released is Rs 1286.39 Cr till date. For the district of Majuli, erosion protection works in different phases has been executed by the Brahmaputra Board.Contd…P/2//2//		Further, with the financial assistance of Rs.207cr from MoDONER another scheme “Protection of Majuli Island from flood and erosion” as per recommendations of Technical Advisory Committee of Brahmaputra Board at an estimated cost of Rs.233.57crores" is being executed by Brahmaputra Board. 	In Addition to above, the Water Resources Department, Assam has also taken up erosion management schemes in the districts of Lakhimpur,Majuli & Diburgarh. A list of such schemes taken up during last three years in appended at Annexure-I.(b) Central Water Commission has installed 54 stations working on Satellite Based Automatic Data Acquisition System in various river basins in Assam. The Water Resources Department, Assam also has a plan to install Real Time Data Acquisition System (RTDS) under National Hydrology project. This will help in acquisition of real time Hydro Meteorological Data from the proposed stations all over the State of Assam.  These stations provide near real time hydro meteorological data such as Water level, Precipitation (Rainfall) etc. This caters to the need of flood forecasting in Brahmaputra & other rivers in Assam.(c) & (d)  Yes, Meetings of the Assam State Committee of Engineers’ are held at regular intervals. Northeast Frontier Railway is a Member of this Committee along with other Stake-holders. Schemes for mitigation of floods and other related infrastructural improvement schemes proposed to be undertaken by Assam Government concerning Railways are discussed in these Meetings.
