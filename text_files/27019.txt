                                                        ), (b), (c) and (d):  Yes, Sir.  Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has initiated the Digital Village Project as a pilot project.  A total of 700 digital villages (One Gram Panchayat/village from each district of each State/ UT) are being covered under the pilot. The project was initiated on 31st October 2018 for a duration of 3 years. The Government is planning to expand through effective utilization of the BharatNet enabled connectivity for transitioning 1 lakh more villages into digital villages. This is envisaged to be achieved by leveraging the grassroot agencies to facilitate efficient delivery of and easy access to services to citizens within their villages. In addition to the 700 villages that are being funded by MeitY for implementation,  4279 villages are being made digital by CSC e-Governance Service India Limited (CSC-SPV) under its own initiative through funds sourced from Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).  The details of the villages/panchayats that have already been covered under the Digital Village implementation so far State/UT-wise is enclosed at Annexure.******* AnnexureNumber of villages that are being funded by MeitY for Digital Village implementation – 700.
