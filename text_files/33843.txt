ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) to (e)  Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell (PPAC) regularly releases data on production of crude oil and natural gas. Details of crude oil and natural gas production during 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 (April-December) are as under:Production	2019-20	2020-21	2021-22(April -December)Crude Oil (Million Metric Tonnes{MMT})	32.17	30.49	22.98Crude Oil production by ONGC (MMT)	20.71	20.27	14.60Natural Gas (Billion Cubic Meter)	31.18	28.67	25.67The decline in production of crude oil was due to natural decline and increase in water cut in wells of matured fields. Covid-19 lockdown restrictions and local/global supply chain disruptions also affected field operations. Production of gas from newer fields of KG-DWN-98/3 has also been started since December 2020. During 2020-21, it has produced 680.76 Million Metric Standard Cubic Meters (MMSCM) of natural gas. Increased production of gas inter alia helps expansion of City Gas Distribution network coverage thereby making available clean fuel to households, industrial & commercial units and vehicles.(f) To spur domestic production and attract new entrants, a large number of policy initiatives have been taken such as awarding new exploration acreage, expediting production from new discoveries; focus on production maximization instead of revenue maximization and generation of geo scientific data.  The Government has also taken various steps towards blending of ethanol which includes allowing use of sugarcane, damaged food grains and maize for conversion to ethanol. Thrust is being given to advanced biofuels such as Second Generation (2G) Ethanol, Bio CNG/ Compressed Bio Gas (CBG), Used Cooking Oil (UCO) based biodiesel etc which can be sourced from wastes such as crop residues, biomass, industrial waste, sewage water etc. *****
