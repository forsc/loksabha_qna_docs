ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) to (g)	Implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission is being regularly reviewed with States/ UTs to accelerate the pace of implementation to make provision of tap water supply to every rural household in the country by 2024. Annual Action Plan (2021-22) of all the States/ UTs were discussed during April–July, 2021, inter alia which included review of progress made so far and detailed planning for implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission to make provision of ‘Har Ghar Jal’ in a time-bound manner.State governments, through the provisions of the Operational Guidelines for the implementation of the Jal Jeevan Mission and during meetings, visits to States/ UTs, have been advised to review the implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission in their respective State/ UTon regular basis to achieve the goal in a time-bound manner.Government of India is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) in partnership with States to provide tap water connection to every rural household in the country by 2024. At the time of launch of Jal Jeevan Mission on 15th August, 2019, out of total 18.93 Crore rural households in the country, 3.23 Crore (17%) households had tap water connections. Since then, 4.63 Crore (24.23%) households have been provided with tap water connections. Thus, as on 02.08.2021, 7.87 Crore (41.15%) households in the country, have provision of tap water supply. State-wise details of households, which have been provided with tap water connections including that of Maharashtra, is annexed.At the time of launch of Jal Jeevan Mission, in Maharashtra, out of 142.36 lakh rural households, 48.44 lakh (34%) households had piped water connections. Since then, 43.77 lakh (30.75%) households have been provided tap water connections, thus provision of tap water supply has increased to 92.21 lakh (64.77%) households. Remaining 50.15 lakh households are planned to be provided with tap water connections by 2024.Presence of contaminants in ground water, sustainability of drinking water sources and systems, lack of regular operation and maintenance resulting into systems becoming defunct, delay in release of the matching State share in some States especially after Covid-19 pandemic, are few challenges being noticed in the implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission. *****
