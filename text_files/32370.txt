ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) to (c) : The news reports published since October, 2020 expressed some concerns relating to Television Rating Points. The Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) had responded stating that apart from action of its Disciplinary Council to maintain panel sanctity, BARC has actively pursued action against those involved in tampering the samples and has filed 11 FIRs through its vendor across many States.    BARC stated that in its commitment to produce robust and credible data of TV viewership in India, its system was able to detect anomalous viewership behaviour and the cases filed are also due to the strong data security and vigilance system that BARC has set up over a period of time.(d) and (e) : In order to study the concerns related to Television Rating Points and address them in the light of fresh recommendations of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), technological advancements / interventions to address the system, a Committee was constituted under the Chairmanship of Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Prasar Bharati with independent members from IIT, C-DOT and IIM.   The Committee was tasked, inter alia, to study any issues related or incidental to the subject and make recommendations on way forward for a robust, transparent and accountable rating system in India.(f) : The existing guidelines have provisions like methodology for audience measurement, panel selection, viewing platform secrecy and privacy, data analysis, transparency and complaint redressal mechanism etc. which are required for a robust, transparent and accountable rating system in India. Notwithstanding the existing provisions in the guidelines and the processes put in place by BARC, reforms are continuous process and policy prescriptions as may be required are made by the government from time to time.
