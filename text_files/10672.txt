ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a) & (b) The Sports infrastructure facilities available with Sports Authority of India (SAI) & Lakshmibai National Institute of Physical Education (LNIPE) have sufficient capacity to cater to the training needs of a large number of athletes including high performance training to elite athletes and hence at present there is no proposal to open any new Training Institute/ Training Centre.(c) & (d) ‘Sports’ being a State subject, promotion and development of sports, rests with the State / UT Governments, hence it is primarily the responsibility of State/ UT to promote the sports, the Central Government supplements the efforts of the State/UT Governments by providing assistance in identification of talented athletes, training of athletes and their participation in competitions besides providing financial assistance to bridge the gaps in sports infrastructure. The training facilities run by the Union Government are available for all talented youth across the country. The number of training facilities run by this Ministry in the State of Madhya Pradesh wherein the youth from the Devas Region could avail the facilities thereof, is at Annexure.(e) Recently, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports in a conference held with Ministers and Principal Secretaries for Sports and Youth Affairs of the State/ UT Governments have requested to share the information on available sports infrastructure in the district and block headquarters of States/ UTs, on the online portal of the SAI for analysing and providing assistance and for bridging critical gaps in the existing Sports infrastructure, through Khelo India Scheme.*****
