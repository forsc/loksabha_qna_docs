                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY & DAIRYING:(SHRI PRATAP CHANDRA SARANGI)(a) & (b) Yes, Sir. Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) commissioned studies during 2012-2019 on impact of climate change on Indian marine fisheries with the funding support of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) under Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. Studies revealed catch reduction of Indian Oil Sardine by 6% in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to continuation of El Nino effects since 2013 along the Indian coast. Studies have also indicated a trend of reducing catches of both Indian Oil Sardine and Indian Mackerel since the onset of El-Nino from 2013. However, it is expected that with ease in El-Nino impact, Oil sardine catch will revive during the coming season onwards.(c) & (d) Government provides assistance to the fishermen during uniform fishing ban period from 15th April to 14th June in the east coast and during 1st June to 31st July in the west coast when fishing is not permitted due to rough weather conditions at sea, breeding season of fish etc under its schemes and programmes. Further, in case of any incidence of cyclones during the rest of the year, fishermen are advised not to venture into the sea during the period(s) of cyclone(s) from safety point of view and as such there is no provision for financial assistance for such a brief period(s) of not venturing into sea. In the event of twelve notified natural calamities including cyclones, under the extant guidelines on items and norms of assistance from State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), the state Governments provides relief to the fishermen in case of loss/damage of their boats, fishing net etc.*****
