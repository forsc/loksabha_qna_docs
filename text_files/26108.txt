ANSWER




                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) to (e) : A statement is laid on the Table of the House.   ****      STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (A) TO (E) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.161 FOR 30.07.2021 BY DR. ALOK KUMAR SUMAN REGARDING ‘PRADHAN MANTRI MAHILA SHAKTI KENDRA SCHEME’ (a) to (c) : The MSK Scheme was approved in November, 2017 as a centrally sponsored scheme to empower rural women through community participation. Under the scheme, capacity building of women was envisaged in not more than 50% of the blocks in aspirational districts to address livelihood needs of women. Besides, block level activities through college student volunteers were envisaged for a maximum of 8 blocks per aspirational district. The MSK scheme was also approved for 38 districts of Bihar including 13 aspirational districts. The scheme is implemented through State Governments and UT Administrations with a cost sharing ratio of 60:40 between Centre and States except for North East & Special Category States where the funding ratio is 90:10. For Union Territories 100% central funding is provided. States contribute their respective shares of funds for implementation of the scheme before seeking releases of subsequent instalments from Government of India under the scheme. The challenges faced while implementing the scheme in the country including Bihar, include non-availability of college faculty members in certain blocks in aspirational districts and difficulties in engaging student volunteers. Other challenges in implementation of the scheme include delays in sanction of matching grants in States. Task Forces are set up at national/ state/ district levels for monitoring and course correction. State Governments have been requested on different occasions to expedite approvals and release of State share of funds. Video conferences, meetings and visits have also been undertaken from time to time to review and expedite the implementation of the scheme. Assessment/ evaluation of the Mahila Shakti Kendra Scheme has been done by NITI Aayog. The main outcomes of that evaluation study have included setting up of District Level Centres for Women in all districts, fresh identification of output indicators, online data repositories and MIS etc. The Ministry has decided to close the Mahila Shakti Kendra (MSK) Scheme in this financial year keeping in view the findings from evaluation study. A  new and more comprehensive Umbrella Scheme for safety, security and empowerment of women under the name ''Mission Shakti'', has been launched, which includes components such as National, State and District level Hubs for Empowerment of Women, Women Help Lines, One Stop Centres, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao etc. for protection and empowerment of women and capacity building in that regard. (d) & (e)  : Under Mahila Shakti Kendra Scheme, District Level Centres for Women (DLCWs) are approved for all districts as per Census of India, 2011.  Funds have been released for implementing Mahila Shakti Kendra Scheme as per approved scheme guidelines, including for different districts of Bihar from time to time.  These have included releases of Rs.25,83,000/- during the year 2018-19 and Rs.48,62,000/- during the year 2019-20 for Bihar including for Gopalganj District, for implementation of the MSK Scheme, including for setting up and running of District Level Centres for Women. ****
