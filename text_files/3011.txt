ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)  (a)	to (c):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 256   FOR ANSWER ON 10th JULY,2019  REGARDING “MERCHANDISE AND SERVICES EXPORT TARGET”.(a) to (c): As per Foreign Trade Policy 2015-20, the Government aims to increase India’s export of merchandise and services from US$ 465.9 billion to approximately US$ 900 billion by 2019-20 and to raise India’s share in world exports (Goods and Services) from 2% to 3.5%. India’s share in world exports (Goods and Services) has increased to 2.1 % in 2017 as per WTO estimates. The value of India’s overall exports (merchandise and services) during last 4 years is as follows:                                                                                                        (Value in US$ Billion)Years	Export	% Change2015-16	416.60	---2016-17	440.05	5.632017-18	498.63	13.312018-19* 	538.07	7.91 Source: DGCI&S & RBI (*Provisional)India’s exports have to be seen in the backdrop of global trade developments and entire trade ecosystem. India’s exports have faced a very challenging period in recent years, on account of developments arising from the global financial crisis of 2008-09, which accentuated after 2013-14, when the world economy experienced a major trade slowdown. Thus, after achieving a turnaround from the initial shock, exports came under immense pressure again in the post 2013-14 period due to accentuation of the global economic / financial crisis in the second phase when countries like China also got adversely affected. However, since then exports have been growing on a secular basis since 2016-17 for almost three years and total exports reached a new peak of more than half a trillion dollars, for the first time.  ***
