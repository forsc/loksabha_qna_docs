The recommendations of National Conference on Safety in Mines are implemented to enhance the safety of mine workers.(ii)	Workers participation and sensitization in matters of safety are ensured through training in safety and by initiatives like observance of safety week and safety campaigns, etc.(iii)	Safety training programmes are organized among Managers and Supervisors for improving safety standards in mines.(iv)	Introduction of Risk Assessment Techniques and preparation of safety management plan aimed at elimination of risks and to ensure safety of workmen.(v)	Introduction of standard operating procedures to avoid unsafe practices in mines.(vi)	Time to time, DGMS Circulars are issued as guidelines for safe operations in identified thrust areas.(d)&(e):	Government has made provisions to deal with the safety issues pertaining to fire in coal, metalliferous and oil mines under regulations 134-142 of the Coal Mines Regulations, 2017, regulations 119-123 of the Metalliferous Mines Regulations, 1961 and regulations 97-101 of the Oil Mines Regulations, 2017 respectively. Compliance of the above provisions in mines by the mine owners/ management is checked during regular inspections carried out in mines by officers of DGMS.		In addition to the above provisions, following detail guidelines have been issued by the DGMS for addressing the hazards through risk analysis based “Safety Management System/Plan (SMP)” and for dealing with the emergency situations in mines, which, among others, are also very much relevant for the fire hazard:i.	DGMS(Tech.)(S&T) Circular No. 13 of 2002 titled “Safety Management System – A guideline for implementation”;ii.	DGMS (Tech)(S&T) Circular No. 02 of 2011 titled “Safety Management System - Provision for auditing and review”;iii.	DGMS (Tech)(S&T) Circular No. 5 of 2016, titled “Integrated approach for development of Safety Management Plan for coal and metalliferous mines”; and iv.	DGMS (Tech)(S&T) Circular No. 8 of 2016, titled “Emergency Management Plan for Indian coal and metal mines”.		The proactive approach of “Safety Management System” enables the mine management to address the site specific dangers by pinpointing the actual problem, which is in line with the present international practices. Also, the concept of “Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan” facilitates reduction in the response time to save life and property in case of emergency.(f):		No separate fund is allocated by the Ministry of Labour and Employment with regard to safety and security of mines in the country. The responsibilities of establishing safety and security systems in mines lies with mine owner/management. However, regular inspection and enquiry in the mines are being conducted by DGMS officials.*****
