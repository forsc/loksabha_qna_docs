                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (d): Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has informed that the American Academy of Pediatrics vide its policy statement titled “Food Additives and Child Health” highlights emerging child health concerns related to:•	The use of colorings, flavorings, and chemicals deliberately added to food during processing (direct food additives) as well as substances in food contact materials, including adhesives, dyes, coatings, paper, paperboard, plastic, and other polymers, which may contaminate food as part of packaging or manufacturing equipment (indirect food additives); •	Reasonable recommendations that the pediatrician might be able to adopt into the guidance provided during pediatric visits; and to propose urgently needed reforms to the current regulatory process at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for food additives. The policy statement states that data about health effects of food additives on infants and children are limited or missing, however, in general, infants and children are more vulnerable to chemical exposures. Children may be particularly susceptible to the effects of these compounds, given that:•	they have higher relative exposures compared with adults (because of greater dietary intake per pound), •	their metabolic (ie detoxification) systems are still developing, and•	key organ systems are undergoing substantial changes and maturation that are vulnerable to disruptions. (Source: Trasande L, Shaffer RM, Sathyanarayana S; AAP Council on Environmental Health. Food Additives and Child Health. Pediatrics. 2018;142(2):e20181408)Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has notified the Food Safety and Standards (Safe food and balanced diets for children in school) Regulations, 2020 on 4.9.2020 to facilitate the promotion of Eat Right habits in schools. This will ensure and promote safe and healthy food in and around school premises, regulating food marketing and advertisement to school children, monitoring and surveillance and overall guidance for providing safe and wholesome food to children.
