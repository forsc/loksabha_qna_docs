                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b)   State/UT-wise details of social audit planned and conducted under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) in the last two financial years 2019-20 and 2020-21 is given at Annexure I. The mandatory processes for the completion of a Social Audit are the conduct of Gram Sabha. In the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, gathering of a large number of people in one place was not encouraged in view of the protection of public health. The States/UTs could conduct the Social Audit only in few pockets where Gram Sabhas could be convened as & when the Covid Guidelines permitted holding them. In such circumstances,  States/UTs conducted concurrent social audits. State/UT -wise details of Concurrent Social Audit under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS for financial year 2020-21 is given at Annexure II.(c)    All reports of findings of Social Audit and the decision taken are available in the official website of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS. (d)   As on 16.03.2022, a total of 375 Ombudspersons have been appointment under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS. Central Government has now linked the recruitment of Ombudsperson with the approval of Labour Budget (LB) of next Financial Year. *****
