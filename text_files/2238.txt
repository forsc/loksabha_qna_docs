ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) and (b): Indian civil aviation sector has shown consistent double digit growth of passenger traffic for more than four years in the past. To create a congenial environment for stakeholders which is also attractive for investors, the roadmap for holistic development of the civil aviation sector has been embodied in the National Civil Aviation Policy 2016. It intrinsically recognises the multiplier effects of the aviation sector on the national economy. As per an International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) study, the output and employment multipliers of general aviation are 3.25 and 6.10 respectively. The roadmap thus aims to provide an ecosystem for holistic and harmonized growth of various aviation sub-sectors, inter alia, through the following:;- strengthened domestic carriers and ground-handling services,;- upgraded and self-reliant maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facilities,;- development of aircraft and component manufacturing in India,;- airport capacity expansion,;- strengthened synergy between air cargo and both foreign trade and e-commerce,;- promotion of air connectivity to regional, heritage and tourism destinations in India through RCS-UDAN (Regional Connectivity Scheme-Ude Desh Ka Aam Naagrik),;- skill development,;- upgraded air navigation, and;- improved safety and security.;;(c): With a view to modernize existing airports so as to establish high standards and ease demand pressures on them, 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) under automatic route has been allowed in brownfield airport projects. This would also facilitate the development of domestic aviation infrastructure. FDI for Scheduled Air Transport Service/ Domestic Scheduled Passenger Airline has been allowed upto 49% under automatic route. For Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), 100% FDI will continue to be allowed under automatic route. Foreign airlines would be allowed to invest in capital of Indian companies operating scheduled and non-scheduled air transport services up to the limit of 49% of their paid up capital. Such investment is subject to the condition, inter alia, that Scheduled and Non-Scheduled Operator''s Permit would be granted only to a company the substantial ownership and effective control of which is vested in Indian nationals.
