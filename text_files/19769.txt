ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR CULTURE & TOURISM (PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL) (a)    Yes, Sir. (b)   The proposal from the Government of Maharashtra was received on 19.11.2013 and forwarded to Linguistic Experts Committee for its consideration on 14.03.2014. (c) & (d) The Committee of Linguistic Experts submitted its report on 06.02.2015. However, in the light of several Writ Petitions filed by Shri R. Gandhi in the Hon’ble High Court of Judicature at Madras on the subject, it was decided to wait for the outcome of the said Writ Petitions. The Hon’ble High Court of judicature at Madras disposed of the Writ Petitions vide common order dated 08.08.2016 declining to interfere in the matter and disposed of all the Writ Petitions.	 The Government nominated two more members i.e. Prof. Arun Diwaker Nath Bajpai (Former Vice Chancellor-Himachal University, Riva University) and Prof. Arunoday Saha (Former Vice Chancellor- Central University, Tripura) to the Linguistic Experts Committee in place of two vacancies caused by resignation of Dr. V.C. Kulandai Swamy and demise of Prof. Bh. Krishnamurti. It is the mandate of the Committee to review the criteria to classify a language as “Classical Language” and also to find out how many other languages are likely to become eligible to be classified as “Classical Language” under the reviewed guidelines.  (e) 	No time frame can be decided to grant the Classical status to Marathi Language.
