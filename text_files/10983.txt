                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)  & (b) As per Indian Nursing Council (INC) records, there are around 8,85,383 Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANM), 21,29,820 Registered Nurses and Registered Midwives (RN&RM) and 56,644 Lady Health Visitors (LHV) in the Country. There are around 8500 Nursing Institutions in the country producing about 3 lakh nursing personnel annually.  The Nurse patient ratio in the Country at present is 1.7 nurses per 1000 population.  However, the nurse- patient ratio varies from State to State, District to District and Institution to Institution. The problem is more of skewed distribution, with dense concentration of work force in some areas and lesser concentration in other areas causing challenges in delivery of services in certain areas.(c) As per the Lancet Series on Midwifery (2014), safe and effective midwifery care can avert 83% of all maternal deaths, stillbirths and newborn deaths. Government of India has rolled out “Midwifery Services Initiative” in the country to improve the quality of care and ensure respectful care to pregnant women and newborns. (d) Nurse Practitioners in Midwifery course has been launched to provide skill in accordance to competencies prescribed by the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM), knowledgeable and capable of providing compassionate women-centred, reproductive, maternal and newborn health care services.(e)  Hon’ble Supreme Court vide judgement dated 29th January, 2016 in Writ Petition(C) No. 527/2011 directed Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to look into the grievances of nurses working in private hospitals/institutions by forming a Committee.  Accordingly, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare constituted a Committee in February, 2016.  The recommendations of the Committee were forwarded to all States/UTs on 20th September, 2016 for making legislation/ guidelines in this regard. However, Health being a state subject, it is for the concerned State Governments to make legislation / guidelines for the purpose. (f) The State-wise details of the total number of diploma/degree schools and colleges with seats imparting nursing education in the country is at Annexure-I. Under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Strengthening/upgradation of Nursing Services  ANM /GNM, the Government has already approved setting up 112 ANM and 136 GNM Schools in the Country. The details are at Annexure-II.(g) Proposals received from the State Governments are examined as per the criteria laid down under the Scheme for upgradation/ strengthening of Schools of Nursing to College of Nursing and subject to availability of funds.   As of now, 2 schools in Gujarat, 3 in Jharkhand, 1 each in Himachal Pradesh, Manipur and Uttar Pradesh, 5 in Rajasthan and 2 each in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal have been approved by the Government of India.
