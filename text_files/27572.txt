Market Access Initiative (MAI) scheme provides financial support to various Export Promotion Councils (EPCs) and Trade Bodies engaged in promotion of textiles and garments exports, for organizing and participating in trade fairs, exhibitions, buyer seller meets etc. ii)	To boost exports in MMF sector, Government has removed anti-dumping duty on PTA (Purified Terephthalic Acid), a key raw material for the manufacture of MMF fibre and yarn and also on Acrylic fibre, a raw material for yarn and knitwear industry. iii)	Union Budget 2021-22 announcements include launch of the scheme of setting up mega investment textile parks. Seven mega textile parks will be set up in next three years. These parks will enable the textile industry to become globally competitive, attract large investment and boost employment generation. The scheme will enable creation of global champions in exports.iv)	The Production Linked Investment scheme of Rs 10,683/- crore over a five-year period covering MMF and Technical Textiles sector has been announced which will create global champions in exports and domestic production in textile sector will also grow substantially and thus boost employment.v)	National Technical Textiles Mission launched in budget announcements in February 2020 with an outlay of Rs. 1480 crore for the period 2020-24, with a view to become a global player in technical textiles and place India as one of the major exporting countries is likely to generate a large number of employment in the textile sector.vi)	In order to bring the import of raw silk to Zero level, indigenous manufacturing and establishment of large scale Automatic Silk Reeling Machine(ARM) has been promoted for the first time since 2016-17. 67 ARMs have been distributed . These will also boost the employment generation.vii)	Marketing/e-Commerce of Handlooms/Handcraft products:To provide marketing facilities for direct selling of products to Government Departments, weavers, artisans, cooperative societies and handloom/handicraft agencies are being facilitated to register on Government e- Marketplace (GeM) in all states. This arrangement would help in marketing of their products and getting reasonable price by eliminating intermediaries.  More than 1.75 lakh weavers and weaving entities, artisans have been registered on GeM web portal.viii)	Formation of Producer Companies: A Nationwide programme has been formulated by Ministry of Textiles to reposition handicrafts and handlooms through aggregation, financial support and market access thereby making local global with  objective to bring resurgence in handicrafts and handloom sector in the country while empowering weaver and artisans, reducing intermediation through  the creation of a network of   Producer Companies.  So far 177 Producer Companies have been sanctioned. ix)	The Virtual Toy Fair:  A virtual toy fair was organized during 27th February 2021 to 4th March 2021, in which 1074 exhibitors / toy manufacturers from the Indian Industry participated, including 215 artisans from these 13 Toy clusters. x)	Research & Development(R&D) has focused to evolve productive bivoltine hybrids and package of practices for production of high quality international grade bivoltine silk in the country. Also, strengthened the R&D system to improve the levels of cocoon production and productivity to develop improved mulberry/host plant varieties, silkworm hybrids and technology packages. xi)	‘’Indian Silk’’ is being promoted as a brand in the global market through generic promotion & with the ‘’Silk Mark Tag’’ to create a Brand image of Indian Silk.In addition, Government is implementing various policy initiatives and schemes for supporting the development of textile industry viz. the Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (A-TUFS), Schemes for the development of the Powerloom Sector(Power-Tex), Schemes for Technical Textiles, Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP), Scheme for Additional Grant for Apparel Manufacturing Units under SITP (SAGAM),  SAMARTH- The Scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector (SCBTS), Jute (ICARE- Improved Cultivation and Advanced Retting Exercise), Integrated Processing Development Scheme (IPDS), Silk Samagra, National Handloom Development Programme, National Handicraft Development Programme, Integrated Wool Development Programme (IWDP), North East Region Textiles Promotion Scheme (NERTPS), National Technical Textile Mission, Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (ROSCTL), Scheme for Production and Employment  Linked Support for Garmenting Units (SPELSGU) etc. The Textile sector is highly unorganized sector; therefore, no such official data of employment generation is maintained. However, the above schemes and initiatives which promote technology upgradation, creation of infrastructure, skill development and sectoral development in the textile sector, create a conducive environment and provide enabling conditions for textile manufacturing in the country and helps in boosting employment generation.As per the latest data available, textile industry accounted for 2.2% of GDP of the country in 2019-20.(e):	Textile is an unorganized/largely scattered sector. Therefore, details of revenue generated are not available. However, details of exports for the period of 2009-10 to 2020-21 are as under:                                                           (Fig. in USD million)Financial year	Total export Textile & Clothing 2009-10	23,1112010-11	28,4672011-12	33,9082012-13	32,6732013-14	36,7472014-15	36,8052015-16	35,6922016-17	35,4722017-18	35,7232018-19	36,5582019-20	33,3792020-21	29,872(f):	There was no specific chapter dedicated to Technical Textiles in Indian Trade Classification (ITC) Harmonized System Nomenclature (HSN) Code published by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade.  As a result, either there was a misclassification of non-technical textiles items being declared as technical textiles or the genuine technical textiles not being correctly promoted as a part of Trade Policy.  The import-export statistics was also not being rightly captured.  The Industry had been demanding a separate classification of Technical Textiles since long time.  In keeping with the benefits of the stakeholder in mind, in January 2019, 207 HSN Codes have been classified and notified as technical textiles with a view to facilitate ease of doing business.         Exports for 207 technical textiles items since 2019 is as under:-   Year	                   Fig. in Rs. Lakh2019-20	14193152020-21	1612353 ***
