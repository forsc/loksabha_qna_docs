                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a)	to (e):	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.2702 BY SHRI PRATAPRAO PATIL CHIKHLIKAR TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 10.03.2021 REGARDING RAILWAY PROJECTS DELAYED DUE TO CORONA PANDEMIC.(a) to (c): Yes, Sir. Due to the adverse impact of COVID 19 pandemic, consequential lockdown and partial operation of passenger services, total traffic revenue of Railways to end of January, 2021 have declined by ` 36,918.86 crore compared to corresponding period of last year (COPPY). The decline is ` 34,750.51 crore in passenger, ` 2427.25 crore in other coaching and ` 298.27 crore in sundry other revenue during the said period compared to COPPY. Though the revenue receipts position has gradually improved in the post lock down phase, Railways have assessed a resource gap of around ` 51,000 cr in Revised Estimates 2020-21. Considering the need to provide adequate budgetary support for incurring inevitable expenditure, the Government has provided a Special Loan to Railways for Covid related resource gap.  The Ministry has been taking measures on a continuing basis to improve the financial position. Apart from restoring passenger services on a progressive basis in the current year, the endeavour comprises of a combination of initiatives aimed at maximizing revenue receipts and minimizing controllable revenue expenses. Revenue enhancing measures, inter alia, include targeting progressively higher traffic throughput, expansion of commodity basket, effective and innovative marketing strategies to capture more and more traffic, creation of additional capacity and optimum utilization of the existing rail infrastructure including rolling stock, enhancement in productivity and efficiency, improvement of passenger interface, periodic rationalization of fare and freight rates and focus on increasing the share of non-fare revenue sources in Railways’ total revenue. Expenditure control measures include strict economy and austerity measures, improved man-power planning, better asset utilization, inventory management, optimizing fuel consumption etc.(d) & (e): Due to the imposition of nationwide lockdown from 25th March’ 2020 on account of COVID-19 pandemic, initially, there was a slowdown in the execution of Railway projects including critical and important projects. However, with the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions, the pace of construction activities gained momentum. Moreover, due to meticulous planning, prioritisation of projects and focused approach of execution, works are now in full swing and Railways has been able to commission 1,740 Kms length of New line, Gauge conversion and Doubling works during the period March’ 2020 to December’2020.*****
