The institutes have developed monoculture of high-valued fishes such seabass, Cobia, Indian pompano, Silver Pampano, Grouper, etc. in cage culture while milkfish, grey mullet and shrimp species are used in polyculture in brackishwater. Further, Integrated Multi-Tropic Aquaculture (IMTA) system of cage culture of fin fishes with seaweed farming in coastal waters has been developed and demonstrated with higher crop yield and water quality improvement.
