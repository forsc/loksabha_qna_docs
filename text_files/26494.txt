Under PMKVY, various processes have been adopted across the training lifecycle to ensure enrolled candidates receive quality training and placement in compliance to the scheme guidelines. These include attendance monitoring through Aadhaar enabled biometric attendance system, candidate verifications through calls, surprise centre visits, virtual verification of training centres, and outcome based financial pay-outs to training centres. The findings through the monitoring mechanisms are further submitted to the Monitoring Committee for due diligence. In case of non-compliance, the training centre is penalized in accordance to the devised penalty matrix. (d) 	Under PMKVY, placement opportunities are being provided to candidates certified under Short Term Training (STT).
