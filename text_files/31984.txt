ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a): The manual titled “Inclusion of Transgender Children in School Education: Concerns and Roadmap” is a training material. It is an academic exercise which has to undergo various stages before it is made a public document and is used for training by different stakeholders.(b) & (c): National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has developed material including training modules for the capacity building of teachers on the issues related to gender in education. NCERT has been training teachers, teacher educators and school heads on gender sensitization with an all-inclusive approach. The concerns related to transgender children are addressed in different textual and training materials/manuals/modules.Department of School Education and Literacy (DoSEL), Ministry of Education is implementing Samagra Shiksha which is an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII and aims to ensure inclusive and equitablequality education at all levels of school education. Samagra Shiksha reaches out to girls, and children belonging to SC, ST, Minority communities and transgender.Further, under NISHTHA (National Initiative for School Heads’ and Teachers’ Holistic Advancement), a nation-wide integrated teacher training program for teachers under Samagra Shiksha, teachers are trained for relevance of Gender Dimensions in Teaching and Learning Process which helps teachers to use and adopt learning activities that foster gender sensitive classroom environment.National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 also identifies transgender children as Socio-Economically Disadvantaged Groups (SEDGs) and provides for equitable quality education, inter-alia, for all such students. This includes provisions for assisting transgender children in gaining access to education, support for community-based interventions that address local context-specific barriers to transgender children’s access to and participation in education, thereby aiming to eliminate any remaining disparity in access to education (including vocational education) for children from any gender or other SEDGs. All material produced by NCERT, including the said academic endeavors, are included appropriately in the National Curriculum Frameworks.*****
