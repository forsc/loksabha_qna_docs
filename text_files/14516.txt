                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (d):     Public health and hospitals is a state subject. The Central Government supplements the efforts of State Government through financial and technical support. The National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) was launched by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare in October 2010 with focus on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, health promotion, early diagnosis, treatment and referral. The Programme is being implemented under the National Health Mission (NHM) for interventions up to District level. NPCDCS has focus on awareness generation for behavior and life-style changes, apart from ensuring early diagnosis, treatment and follow up. Population based screening for common Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) has also been taken up for early detection of NCDs and it also help in generating awareness on risk factors of NCDs.  Under the programme 616 NCD clinics at District level and 3827 NCD clinics at Community Health Centre (CHC)  level have been set up.  In addition 175 Cardiac Care Units (CCUs) and 214 Day Care Centres for Chemotherapy have also been set up.  State/UT-wise details are at Annexure.        To enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer, the Central Government is implementing Strengthening of Tertiary Care for Cancer Scheme, under which setting up of 19 State Cancer Institutes and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres have been approved. Further, Oncology is also one of the focus areas in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar in Haryana and strengthening of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, are also steps in the same direction.  Implementation of the NPCDCS is regularly reviewed with States/UTs at various levels for its effective implementation.
