                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	No, Sir.(b)	Does not arise.(c)  Multi-pronged strategies are being taken by the Ministry of Rural Development to address rural poverty and improve the economic well-being of the people in rural areas with the main focus on increasing livelihood opportunities, empowering rural women, providing social safety net, skilling of rural youth, infrastructure development etc through its programmes viz. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), Deen Dayal Upadhyay – Gramin Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY),  Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), Shyama Prasad Mukherjee National RuRBAN Mission and National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP). Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission(DAY-NRLM) aims to reduce poverty by organizing the rural poor women into Self Help Groups (SHGs), and continuously nurturing and supporting them to take economic activities till they attain appreciable increase in income over a period of time. There are also two skill development programmes for rural poor youth under DAY-NRLM, namely, DeenDayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), and Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs).  Both these schemes are aimed at increasing employability of rural poor youth either for wage or self-employment. Under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) which is a demand driven wage employment programme, at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year is provided to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. It is a demand driven wage employment Scheme. During the current FY 2020-21, more than 324 crore persondays has been generated so far under MGNREGS National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) is a social welfare programme for the aged, widows, disabled and in the cases of death of the primary breadwinner belonging to Below Poverty Line (BPL) Households. It is 100% centrally funded Central Sponsored Schemes (CSS) implemented in the entire country including rural and remote areas.  Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Grameen (PMAY-G) aims to provide a pucca house with basic amenities to all rural houseless households and households living in kutcha and dilapidated house upto two rooms in rural areas by 2022. Besides, the Government of India has rolled out Rural Mason Training (RMT) Programme under PMAY-G. The initiative is being assisted by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC).  Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) was launched in the year 2000 as a measure towards alleviation of poverty in rural areas by providing access to basic services to the rural population by providing them good quality roads. PMGSY has helped in better access of market place for the rural masses and generate employments in various forms.  Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM) is a unique programme, designed to deliver catalytic interventions to rural areas on the threshold of accelerated growth. 300 Rurban Clusters with thematic economic growth points are being developed across the country under this Mission.Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) was launched on 11 October 2014 with the objective of creating model Gram Panchayats in different parts of the country by leveraging leadership, capacity, commitment and energy of the Hon’ble Members of Parliament (MP). Under the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana framework, the development of Gram Panchayats is envisaged through convergence and implementation of existing Government Schemes and Programmes under the administrative control of respective Ministries without allocating additional funds. The Gram Panchayats adopted under SAGY prepare Village Development Plans (VDP) through a participatory process under the guidance of Hon’ble Members of Parliament. The VDP includes prioritised time-bound activities to achieve holistic progress of the village. Further, the VDP is prepared for every identified Gram Panchayat with special focus on enabling every poor household to come out of poverty.*****
