The loan agreement with the World Bank was signed on 02ndFebruary, 2018.2.    	The estimated cost of JMVP of Rs. 5369.18 crore (US$ 800.00 million) is to be utilized as per the following funding pattern:(i)	IBRD Loan- Rs.2,512.00 crore (US $ 375.00 million); (ii)	Government of India Counterpart Funds (budgetary allocation and proceeds from issue of infrastructure bonds: Rs.2,556.00 crore (US $ 380.00 million); and(iii)	Private sector participation under PPP mode: Rs. 301.00 crore (US $ 45.00 million).3.	Detailed Feasibility; Environmental & Social Impact Assessment; and Market Development Strategy Studies were carried out on NW-1 in February 2017, December, 2016 & November, 2017 to determine the development strategy on NW-1.   Further, the detailed engineering for key infrastructure projects such as Varanasi MMT, Haldia MMT, Sahibganj MMT & Farakka Lock were prepared by the Engineering Consultant subsequently. 4.	The following mandatory clearances were obtained in connection with the implementation of JMVP:(i)	Clearance under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 for passage of vessels through the Kashi Turtle Sanctuary, Varanasi on 12th June, 2017.(ii)	Coastal Regulation Zone clearance for the Haldia multimodal terminal on 06th November, 2017.(iii)	Clearances from the Ministry of WR, RD & GR and NGRBA for the new navigation lock at Farakka on 28th February, 2016.(iv)	MoEF&CC confirmed that inland waterways, terminals, jetties etc. are not covered under EIA Notification, 2006 requiring prior environmental clearance on 21st December, 2017.  5.	Consequent to the review held on 10.06.2020 through teleconferencing by Ministry of Ports, Shipping & Waterways under the chair of Secretary (Shipping) with the IWAI, the estimated cost JMVP was revised to Rs. 4,633.81 crore from the original estimated cost of Rs. 5,369.18 crore approved by the CCEA on 03.01.2018, thereby effecting a saving of Rs. 735.51 crore (USD 109.78 million) in the project cost.   The savings comprise of Rs. 387.10 crore (USD 57.78 million) from the IBRD loan component and Rs. 348.41 crore from the counterpart fund component.
