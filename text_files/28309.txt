                                                        MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)  (a) to (e): A statement is laid on the table of the House.        Statement referred to in reply to parts (a) to (e) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No.55 for answer on 01.12.2021 asked by SHRI Y.S. AVINASH REDDY (a) & (b): Due to increased demand of power, less power generation by imported coal based power plants and some interruption in supply of coal due to heavy rains, the coal stock at the power plants depleted to 7.2 Million Tonnes (MT) (sufficient for 4 days) as on 8th October, 2021.  Subsequently with increased coal supplies,  the coal stock has started increasing and has now reached 16.74 MT (sufficient for 9 days) as on 25.11.2021.  Coal India Limited (CIL) has dispatched around 54 MT more coal during April - October’21 in comparison to the same period of last year. It has dispatched 291.72 MT coal during this period, against 237.75 MT during the same period of last fiscal. The coal stock at CIL pithead end was 40.23 MT as on 08.10.2021 and 32.30 MT as on 24.11.2021. (c) & (d):  Yes Sir. Government of Andhra Pradesh had requested for  coal  to meet the power demand of the State. In the current fiscal upto October’21, CIL has supplied 13.24 MT of coal to the Andhra Pradesh based Power Plants in comparison to the supply of 7.18 MT in the same period of last year. In addition to the above, CIL has offered additional quantity of 4.97 Lakh Tonnes through Rail-cum-Road mode from its mines to the state Genco to build up adequate stock at Power Plants end.  (e): Steps taken to improve coal supplies for meeting increased demand in the country are as follows:i. In order to address the issues of coal supplies to power sector, an Inter-Ministerial Sub-Group comprising of representatives from Ministry of Power, Ministry of Coal, Ministry of Railways, Central Electricity Authority (CEA), CIL and SCCL meet regularly to take various operational decisions to enhance supply of coal to thermal power plants as well as for meeting any contingent situations relating to power sector including critical coal stock position in power plants. ii. CIL had offered about 5.2 MT of additional coal from its various subsidiaries to States, Central Gencos for lifting through RCR/ Road Mode.iii. In addition to Annual Contracted Quantity (ACQ), coal has been offered under RCR mode on ‘as is where is basis’ to build up stock at Power house end. iv. The Ministry of Coal has amended Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 with a view to encourage domestic coal production enhancement from captive mines by allowing sale of coal or lignite, on payment of additional amount, by the lessee of a captive mine up to 50 percent of the total coal or lignite produced in a financial year, after meeting the requirement of the end use plant linked with the mine. Earlier this year, the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Amendment Act had been amended to this effect. This is applicable for both the private and public sector captive mines. With this amendment, the Government has paved the way for releasing of additional coal in the market by greater utilization of mining capacities of captive coal and lignite blocks, which were being only partly utilized owing to limited production of coal for meeting their captive needs.                                                            ****
