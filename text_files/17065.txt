                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):	As per National Health Profile, the number of deaths due to Acute Respiratory Infection in the country, State/UT-wise, during the year 2014 to 2018 are available and placed at Annexure. Data for 2019 is not available. From comparison of available data of West Bengal with other States, it may be seen that State of Uttar Pradesh has slightly more deaths than West Bengal.  However, no reasons for relatively higher death in West Bengal vis-à-vis other States can be given, as it is a clinical condition.
