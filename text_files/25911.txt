                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI  R.K. SINGH)(a) : 		Smart meters are being installed under various schemes of Government of India as well as by the State Utilities themselves. Government of India is providing funding to the States for implementation of smart metering under National Smart Grid Mission (NSGM) and Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS). EESL is also implementing smart metering projects being launched by the DISCOMs at their own independent initiative in the States of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Bihar, Rajasthan, A&N Islands, Delhi etc. on OPEX basis wherein EESL is making the initial capital expenditure and DISCOMs are paying back to EESL on monthly rental basis.  Till date, approximately 25.71 lakh smart meters have been installed in various States under the aforesaid schemes of Government of India and the aforesaid projects of the DISCOMs.Further, under the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme approved by the Government of India on 30.06.2021, it is envisaged to install approximately 10 crore prepaid Smart Meters by December 2023.(b) & (c) :  	Government of Uttar Pradesh has reported that no plug and play solutions were available at the inception stage of the project as the project in UP for installation of 40 lakh Smart Meters was the very first and the largest of its kind in the country. The teething problems were encountered in IT components of Smart Metering System. As a result of this, the installation of smart meters has been temporarily put on hold while the technical issues are being resolved. (d) & (e) : 	State Government of Uttar Pradesh has reported that no financial loss was suffered by Power consumers in case of the reported cases of defective meters. The following steps have been taken by State Government of Uttar Pradesh in the matter:i.	Security Audit of IT Infrastructure by ‘Standardisation Testing and Quality Certification’ (STQC) Directorate, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India.ii.	User Acceptance Testing (UAT) of AMI system is being conducted since 29th December, 2020. Total 746 test cases were planned to test and all cases have been tested. UAT is expected to be completed by August, 2021.iii.	Testing of randomly selected smart meters by Central Power Research Institute (CPRI).  Initially one meter each from eight lots were tested.  Three meters passed in the test.  Out of the five lots where the sample meters were not found as per specification, eight meters from each lot (total 40) were tested.  All these 40 meters were found as per specifications.  57 more meters have been further tested and all these 57 meters have been found as per specifications.The situation is being closely monitored not only at the DISCOM level but also in the monthly review at the level of the Ministry.**************
