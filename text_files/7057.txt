ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) FOR NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY,  POWER and MoS for  SKILL DEVELOPMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP(SHRI R. K. SINGH)(a) and (b) Under the Phase I of the Grid Connected Rooftop Solar (GCRT) programme, which was approved by the Government in December 2015, an aggregate capacity of 2100 MW was targeted to be sanctioned in residential, institutional, social and Government sectors with central financial assistance by the year 2019-20 of which about 2098 MW has been sanctioned. Further, as per data captured on the SPIN portal of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), grid connected rooftop solar PV systems of about 1855 MW capacity have been reported installed in the country as on 18.11.2019 (with and without central financial assistance). (c) to (e) The Phase II of GCRT Programme has targeted installation of grid connected rooftop solar projects of cumulative 40 GW capacity by year 2022. In Phase II of GCRT programme, the Central Financial Assistance (CFA) has been restructured. Now  CFA of 40% of the benchmark cost or tendered cost, whichever is lower is provided for residential grid connected rooftop systems upto 3 kW and 20% of the benchmark cost or tendered cost whichever is lower for residential grid connected rooftop systems of capacity 3 kW to 10 kW. There is no CFA for GCRT system above 10 kW in residential sector since solar power for such category is cost effective compared to grid tariffs applicable for such category of consumers. The Phase-II of GCRT programme also provides CFA upto 20% of benchmark cost or tendered cost whichever is lower, for Group Housing Societies/Resident Welfare Associations (GHS/RWA), for supply of power for common facilities. Under Phase II of GCRT programme Electricity Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) have been made as implementing agencies as they have direct access to the consumers, have an organised invoicing/billing/execution system and hence are best suited to manage distributed and relatively independent clients/prosumers. Incentives for the DISCOMs for installing additional capacity above baseline have also been provided for. With these changes, the target of cumulative Rooftop Solar capacity of 40 GW is expected to be achieved by the year 2022.                                    *****
