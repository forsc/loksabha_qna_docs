ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE AND              (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)CORPORATE AFFAIRS?????? ??? ???????? ????? ???????? ??? ?????? ??????                  (???? ?????? ???? ?????)(a) to (c):	Anti-competitive agreements including cartels are prohibited under the Competition Act, 2002 (Act) and the Competition Commission of India (CCI) inquires into such conduct either on the basis of formal Information(s) received from the Parties or from the References made by Central/State Governments or Statutory Authorities.  CCI is also empowered to suo motu inquire into such conduct.  In this regard, CCI through its in-house mechanism constantly and regularly keeps a tab on such behaviour of market participants through examination of miscellaneous complaints/representations filed by the parties or through scanning of media reports/Comptroller and Auditor General of India reports or through processing of information gathered through information sharing protocols with Central Agencies (Financial Intelligence Unit/Central Economic Intelligence Bureau) or by examination of other publicly available information.  The Act also provides for leniency in matters where full disclosures regarding cartels are made and CCI also undertakes proactive advocacy measures through roadshows to spread greater awareness amongst stakeholders.   Market studies are also undertaken as another tool as part of market monitoring exercise which helps in identifying anti-competitive conduct of enterprises as well as structural conditions of the markets, that may be conducive to cartelisation, for enabling initiation of appropriate action.Since the notification of the relevant provisions of the Act, the CCI has examined and penalized cartel participants across various sectors of the economy including bid-rigging/cartels in public procurement. *******
