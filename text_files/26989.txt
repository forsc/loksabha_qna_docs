                                                        (a):    Government of India’s objective is to make India a global leader in the Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) sector. Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) notified Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC) scheme in October, 2012 to provide support for the creation of world-class infrastructure along with common facilities and amenities for attracting investments in the electronics sector. Under Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC) scheme, Nineteen (19) Greenfield Electronics Manufacturing Clusters and Three (3) Common Facility Centres (CFCs) accorded approval in Fifteen (15) states across the country. These EMCs/CFCs are under implementation. Based on further requirement for strengthening of infrastructure for creation of robust electronics manufacturing ecosystem in the country, MeitY introduced Modified Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC 2.0) Scheme on 1st April, 2020. Its objective is to provide infrastructure support for attracting major electronics manufacturers along with their supply chain to set up their production facility in the country through such clusters. Under Modified Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC 2.0) scheme, till now, One (1) application for setting up of EMC project in the state of Andhra Pradesh has been approved.(b) and (e):  Under EMC/ EMC 2.0 scheme, no Electronics Manufacturing Cluster exists/ is being established in the State of Tamil Nadu. However, Tamil Nadu has emerged as a preferred destination for electronics manufacturing as many companies have established their operations in the State and taken benefit from Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS) of Government of India. List of such units is enclosed at Annexure-I. (c):    Details of EMCs comprising the investment received and employment generated are enclosed at Annexure-II.(d):   The details of major electronics manufacturing companies setting up of their units in these EMCs are enclosed at Annexure-III.********Annexure-IS.No.	Name of Unit	Project Location	Products	Proposed Investment (Rs. in Crore)	Approved Incentives (Rs. in Crore)1	Mando Hella Electronics Automotive India Private Limited	SIPCOT Industrial Park, Kanchipuram 	Electronic Control Unit for Antilock Braking System, EPS, Wheel Speed Sensors, Torque Sensor products such asTOS and TAS	338.24	52.642	Mando Automotive India Private Limited	Plot No. S1A & S5,, SIPCOT Industrial Park,Vengadu Village,Sriperumpudur, Kanchipuram 	ABS, Electric Power Steering	901.15	208.853	Salcomp Manufacturing India Private Limited	Unit 1: Nokia Telecom SEZ, SIPCOT, Industrial Park, Phase 3, Sriperumbudur, District of Kancheepuram, (SEZ Unit)	Mobile Phones Chargers, Transformers And Cable Assemblies (Component For Chargers) Battery Pack, Cable Assembly, LED Drivers	614.3	55.73		Unit 2: Plot no.
