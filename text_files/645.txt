ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PG & PENSIONS AND IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE(DR. JITENDRA SINGH):(a) 		Yes Sir.(b)		Currently a ‘Space Activities Bill’ is being processed, which is under pre-legislative consultations. India is a State Party to UN Treaties on Outer Space activities. The obligations under these treaties, such as international responsibility for national activities in outer space and liability for damages caused by its space activities and space objects are to be implemented through national/domestic legislations. The current Bill will enable the formulation of necessary Rules under the Space Activities Act, to deal with damages under the liability provisions and mode of securing financial guarantee for compensating the damages.(c)		Yes Sir. (d)		Does not arise.(e) 	Consequent to enactment of Space Activities Act, space activities of non–governmental sector in India would be authorized through a licence issued by the Government on certain terms and conditions. It would address the liability issues arising from their space activities, in a suitable/ rational manner, at par with international practices.*****
