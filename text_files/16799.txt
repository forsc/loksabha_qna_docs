During the period, India’s ‘Distance to Frontier’ score under ‘Starting a Business’ indicator has jumped from 68.42 to 81.6 indicating India’s advancement towards the global best practices.

One of the major reforms undertaken is the introduction of a new web-form ‘SPICe+ and AGILE-PRO’ which integrates ten different services from three Central Ministries and one State Government. These services are – Name reservation, Company incorporation, registration of – PAN, TAN, DIN, EPFO, ESIC, GST & Profession Tax (Maharashtra); and opening of bank account.
