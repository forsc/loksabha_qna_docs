ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a): The International Air Transport Association (IATA) in collaboration with Airports Council International (ACI) has developed the Airport Development Reference Manual (ADRM) which guides and promotes industry best practices in various areas, including inter alia, planning for new or upgrading existing air cargo air-side and city-side infrastructure. For planning the space allocation at general and express air cargo terminals these guidelines cover aspects such as cargo safety, security, regulatory and communication controls, design considerations, typical cargo flows, nature of cargo - high risk, valuable, perishable, pharmaceuticals, mail, courier, express, live animals, etc. - besides forecasting and sizing parameters. These norms and standards have been circulated by the Government to the public and private sector developers of air cargo facilities at airports.;;(b) and (c): The State Government of Chhattisgarh had conveyed interest in the development of the old passenger terminal at Raipur Airport as an air cargo facility. Airports Authority of India Cargo Logistics and Allied Services Limited (AAICLAS) has created the domestic air cargo facility by converting the old passenger terminal building in an area measuring 945 sqm, which is operational. However, so far the airport has not been Customs notified and international flights have not commenced operations, which are among the important criteria for creation of international air cargo facilities.
