                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                               (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)	 & (b) The Government of India launched Smart Cities Mission (SCM) on 25 June 2015 for developing 100 cities as Smart Cities.  A total of 5,151 projects worth Rs. 2,05,018 crore have been proposed by these Smart Cities as part of their Smart Cities Proposals (SCPs). As per SCM Statement and Guidelines, the Central Government proposes to give financial support to the extent of Rs. 48,000 crore over five years i.e. an average of Rs. 500 crore per city over the Mission period. An equal amount on a matching basis, is to be provided by the States/Urban Local Bodies. Apart from these, rest of the funds would be sourced by SPVs through convergence with other Missions, Public-Private Partnerships, Loans and other sources etc. Since the launch of the Mission, as on 28th February, 2020, Government of India have released Rs.18,810.10 crore to the States/Union Territories. So far, out of 5151 projects, more than 4,500 projects worth Rs. 1,63,844 crore have been tendered of which more than 3,600 projects worth Rs. 1,22,123 crore have been grounded and 1,587 projects worth Rs. 25,926 crore have been completed. The Smart Cities are expected to complete their projects within 5 years from the date of its selection. The overall progress of the Mission is satisfactory.                                               …….
