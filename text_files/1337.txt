                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)  Ministry Of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is currently implementing a scheme namely, National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-systems (NPCA) for conservation and management of identified lakes and wetlands in the country on cost sharing basis between Central Government and respective State Governments/Union Territories. The scheme covers various activities such as interception, diversion and treatment of wastewater, shoreline protection, lake front development, in-situ cleaning i.e. de-silting & de-weeding, storm water management, bioremediation, catchment area treatment, lake beautification, survey & demarcation, biofencing, fisheries development, weed control, biodiversity conservation, education and awareness creation, community participation, etc.(b)   Based on the proposals received from the State Government of Karnataka, this Ministry has sanctioned projects for conservation of five lakes in Bengaluru, namely Vengaiahkere, Nagvara, Jarganahalli, Lal Bagh and Bellandur at a total cost of  Rs.18.68 crores. Central share of ?10.62 crore has already been released to Government of Karnataka for conservation and management of these lakes. Work on all these five lakes has been completed.  		As per Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB), projects totalling to Rs.887.97 crore relating to sewerage system and STPs in Bengaluru have been approved/initiated under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) programme of Ministry of Urban Development. Apart from other benefits, these projects will help in rejuvenating lakes in Bengaluru by reducing the pollution load being discharged into them.(c) & (d)  The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has issued directions under Section 18(1) (b) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 in April, 2015 to all SPCBs/ PCCs, including Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), to make it mandatory for the urban local bodies (including Bengaluru) to set-up sewerage system and STPs of adequate capacity for abatement of pollution of rivers and lakes. Specific directions have also been issued to KSPCB in May, 2015 for controlling the pollution in Bellandur and Varthur lakes of Bengaluru. Further, for more effective conservation and management of wetlands in the country, the Central Government in consultation with the States, Union Territories, Central line Ministries and other stakeholders, have notified the Wetlands (Conservation & Management) Rules, 2017 superseding the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2010. As per the Wetlands Rules-2017, certain activities are prohibited under the provision 4(2), which are applicable to wetlands notified by the Central Government, State Government and Union Territory Administration and to wetlands categorized as ''wetlands of international importance'' under the Ramsar Convention.*****
