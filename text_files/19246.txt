                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):	Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has informed that it has a network of 226 laboratories across the country comprising of 190 primary testing laboratories recognised and notified under Section 43(1) of Food Safety and Standards (FSS) Act, 2006; and 18 referral laboratories for appellate (referral) testing under Section 43(2) of FSS Act, 2006.  Further, there are 18 State Food Testing Laboratories working under transition provision of Section 98 of Food Safety and Standards (FSS) Act, 2006. State/UT-wise number of these laboratories is placed at Annexure.  (b):	Quality and safety standards of frozen food products belonging to different food categories are specified in Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards and Food Additives) Regulations, 2011.  Imported frozen food product are subjected to relevant tests at ports of entry  to ensure adherence to the  prescribed standards(c):	Under National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme (NIDDCP), District IDD Surveys /resurveys are conducted regularly by many States/UTs. Over the years, Total Goitre Rate (endemicity of Goitre) has come down.The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) - 4 conducted by MoHFW in 2015-16 had assessed the consumption of Iodated salt at household level. As per the Report, the National average consumption of Iodated salt at household level was 93%. Further, the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) conducted by MoHFW between 2016 to 2018 across 30 States/UTs of India had estimated median urinary iodine concentration (mUIC) levels of children and adolescents. The results demonstrated that the Urinary Iodine Concentration (mUIC) level in children (1-9 yrs) and adolescents (10-19yrs) was >100µg/Litre (optimal), which indicates adequate level of Iodine intake essential to prevent Iodine Deficiency Disorders including Hypothyroidism.(d):	In order to prevent & control Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD), the Government of India launched a 100 per cent Centrally assisted National Goitre Control Programme (NGCP) in 1962. In August, 1992 the National Goitre Control Programme (NGCP) was renamed as National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme (NIDDCP) with a view to cover spectrum of Iodine Deficiency Disorders.NIDDCP is being implemented in all the States/UTs for entire population with the goals to bring the prevalence of IDD to below 5% in the country and to ensure 100% consumption of adequately iodated salt (15ppm) at the household level. For effective implementation of programme, financial assistance is provided to all States/UTs for establishment of Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Cell and IDD Monitoring Laboratory, conducting district IDD Surveys/ Resurveys, health education and publicity to create awareness about IDD, promoting consumption of adequately iodated salt and monitoring of Iodine content of salt through salt testing kit at the Household/Community level.(e):	All segments of population in all the States/UTs are being benefitted under National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme (NIDDCP).
