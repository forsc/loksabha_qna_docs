ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND PENSIONS AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a) & (b): 	No such Surveys were conducted by any agency at the behest of the Government of India. Further, the Government of India is not aware of the methodology adopted in preparation of such reports, if any. However, even in the Corruption Perceptions Index Report (CPI) 2020 of Transparency International, India ranked better than several countries in Asia.	It has recently been decided to engage with the CPI related data source organizations for identification and sharing of sub-index-wise data-sets/information through an appropriately designed Dash-board; for identification of areas where information exchange, reforms or amendment may lead to improvement in rankings; and for preparation eventually of a Compendium of Good Practices in various Departments/Organizations, for dissemination as part of an appropriate communication strategy.(c): Nonetheless, the Government of India, in pursuance of its commitment to “Zero Tolerance Against Corruption” has taken several measures to combat corruption which, inter alia, include:i.	Systemic improvements and reforms to provide transparent citizen-friendly services and reduce corruption. These, inter alia, include:a)	Disbursement of welfare benefits directly to the citizens under various schemes of the Government in a transparent manner through the Direct Benefit Transfer initiative.b)	Implementation of E-tendering in public procurements.c)	Introduction of e-Governance and simplification of procedure and systems.d)	Introduction of Government procurement through the Government e- Marketplace (GeM).Contd.P.-2/--2-ii.	Discontinuation of interviews in recruitment of Group ‘B’ (Non-Gazetted) and Group ‘C’ posts in Government of India.iii.	Invocation of FR-56 (j) and AIS (DCRB) Rules, 1958 for retiring officials from service in public interest whose performance has been reviewed and found unsatisfactory.iv.	The All India Services (Disciplinary and Appeal) Rules and Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules have been amended to provide for specific timelines in the procedure related to disciplinary proceedings.v.	The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 has been amended on 26.07.2018. It clearly criminalizes the act of giving bribe and will help check big ticket corruption by creating a vicarious liability in respect of senior management of commercial organizations.vi.	Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), through various orders and circulars recommended adoption of Integrity Pact to all the organizations in major procurement activities and to ensure effective and expeditious investigation wherever any irregularity / misconduct is noticed.vii.	The institution of Lokpal has been operationalised by appointment of Chairperson and Members. Lokpal is statutorily mandated to directly receive and process complaints as regards alleged offences against public servants under the Prevention of Corruption Act,1988.In addition, the CVC as an apex integrity institution has adopted a multi-pronged strategy and approach to combat corruption, which encompasses punitive, preventive and participative vigilance.*****
