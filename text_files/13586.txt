ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (d): Airports Authority of India, the Implementing Agency, has awarded 688 valid Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) routes in three rounds of bidding under RCS. Out of these, 262 RCS routes have commenced so far, details of which are attached as Annexure. There are 13 Selected Airline Operators (SAOs) who have yet to start their awarded RCS routes. Major reasons for non operationalization of the awarded routes under RCS-UDAN are as follows:-i) Lack of infrastructure of civil airports due to non-availability of land, delay related to compliance of the regulations by the airport operators, lack of road connectivity to the airports.;ii) Non-completion of the process involved in obtaining Scheduled Commuter Operators Permit by the Airlines.;The SAOs who could not commence RCS flights on awarded routes, where RCS airports are ready for operation of commercial flights, have been issued  notice(s) / RCS routes have been terminated due to non-compliance of SAO Agreement. Implementing Agency has offered these terminated routes in subsequent rounds of bidding under RCS-UDAN.;;Ministry of Civil Aviation regularly interacts with Selected Airline Operators, Airport operators, State Governments etc. to resolve issues for commencement of RCS flights.   ;;(e) and (f): The on time performance is an airline specific issue and is not city specific. Majority of flight delays are reactionary in nature due to delay of connecting flights, passenger/baggage check-in related delays at originating station, late arrival of aircraft from previous sector, availability of crew from another flight, re-routing or aircraft change other than technical, weather, Air Traffic Control (ATC), passengers, ramp, technical, operational and miscellaneous reasons. In order to mitigate delays, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has issued Air Transport Circular 05 of 2017. DGCA also undertakes regular monitoring of flight  schedule from time to time.;(g): Yes, there is a need for capacity expansion at major airports. Following steps have been taken at the major airports :-(i) Delhi- Construction of fourth runway and fourth terminal building has commenced.;(ii) Mumbai- Construction of new green field airport at Navi Mumbai airport has commenced.;(iii) Bengaluru- Construction of second runway has been completed and construction of second terminal building has commenced.;(iv) Hyderabad- Construction/expansion of terminal building commenced.
