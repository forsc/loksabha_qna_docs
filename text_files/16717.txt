ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) to (c):	Out of total cane dues payable of Rs. 75,585 crore for sugar season 2019-20 as on 11.09.2020, about Rs 62,591 crore have been paid to the sugarcane farmers & only Rs. 12,994 crores cane dues are yet to be paid. The state-wise outstanding cane price dues of sugarcane farmers against sugar mills during sugar season 2019-20 & last three sugar seasons as on 11.09.2020 is at Annexure I. ...........2/--2-Fourteen sugar mills of Bajaj Group are operational in the State of Uttar Pradesh. As per the information received from State Government of Uttar Pradesh, out of total cane dues payable of Rs. 5339 crore by Bajaj Group against their 14 mills for sugar season 2019-20, an amount of Rs. 2378 crore have been paid to sugarcane farmers & Rs. 2961 crore are yet to be paid; out of which dues of Rs 992 crore are pending against 3 sugar mills of Lakhimpur district. Mill- wise details of cane dues payable, cane price paid & cane price arrears in respect of sugar mills of Bajaj Group are at Annexure II.(d) & (e): 	Payment of cane price to sugarcane farmers by the sugar mills is a continuous process. However, on account of surplus sugar production during the previous sugar seasons, the sugar prices remained depressed which adversely affected the liquidity of the sugar mills resulting in accumulation of cane price arrears of the farmers. With a view to improve liquidity of sugar mills enabling them to clear cane price arrears of farmers, the Central government has taken various measures in past three sugar seasons viz. extended assistance to sugar mills to facilitate export of sugar; extended assistance to mills for maintaining buffer stocks; extended soft loans to sugar mills through banks to clear cane price dues; fixed Minimum Selling Price of Sugar etc. The Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966 stipulates payment of cane price within 14 days of supply. The Powers to enforce the provisions of Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966 with regard to payment of cane dues of farmers is vested with the State Governments as they have necessary field formation for its implementation. Central Government from time to time issue advisory to the State Governments including Government of Uttar Pradesh for ensuring clearance of cane price arrears of farmers and to take action against defaulting mills and also regularly review the position. As informed by Government of Uttar Pradesh, the Cane Commissioner, Uttar Pradesh has issued notices to defaulting sugar mills including mills of Bajaj Group directing them to clear cane price arrears of farmers; Recovery Certificate has been issued by Cane commissioner against one of its mill viz. Rudhauli, District-Basti, to recover the dues. ****ANNEXURE-I.ANNEXURE REFERRED IN REPLY TO PART (a) TO (c) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 436 FOR ANSWER ON 15.09.2020 IN THE LOK SABHA.
