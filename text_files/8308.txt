In addition, AIR channels are also available on internet  and through “NewsonAir” app on android and iOS platform. (c):	Cable Television Networks Rules, 1994 specify that no cable operator shall carry or include in his cable service any television broadcast or channel, which has not been registered by the Central Government for being viewed within the territory of India. Ministry issues advisory to Multi System Operators (MSOs)/Local Cable Operators (LCOs) asking them not to transmit signals of un-authorized satellite TV channel on their cable network. Violation of guidelines invites action under provisions of the Cable Act/Rules. Also, all the District Magistrates/Collectors across the country, being Authorized Officers, are requested to follow time to time to ensure that no un-authorized TV Channels, are transmitted in their respective Districts by any cable operator in violation of Programme Code and provisions of Cable TV Act/Rules. (d): 	The content on AIR is designed with a view to make radio a means of interactive communication among the various agencies forming a composite society.  The longish formats have been replaced by utility messaging system, dissemination of themes through jingle, short duration musical items, live phone-in-programmes, radio bridges, chat shows etc at proper punctuation points of Fixed Point Chart (FPC) to make the service rendered by AIR largely participatory.
