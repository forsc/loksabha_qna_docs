                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)  (a) to (d): The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) compiles and publishes information on crimes in its publication “Crime in India”. The published reports are available till the year 2019. The data is available on the website of National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), https://ncrb.gov.in. No credible data is available to indicate rising number of child marriage during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 including in the State of Karnataka.             As per the information published in NCRB Report, in the past three years i.e. 2017-2019, the State of Karnataka has reported total 249 cases of child marriage (65 in 2017, 73 in 2018 and 111 in 2019).      The Government has enacted the ‘Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), 2006’. The Government also undertakes awareness drives, media campaigns and outreach programmes and issues advisories to the States/ UTs from time to time to highlight evil effects of this practice. Further, the Ministry of Women and Child Development implements the schemes of ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP)’ in which creation of awareness  on matters pertaining to gender equality and discouraging of child marriage is an important focus area. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) also undertakes awareness programmes and consultations with stakeholders from time to time in this regard.  In addition, Government of India has introduced CHILDLINE 1098, a 24/7 telephone emergency outreach service for children in crisis which answers calls related to any form of assistance a child requires including to prevent child marriages in coordination with  police, Child Marriage Prohibition Officer and District Child Protection Units etc.******
