                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS & SPORTS { SHRI KIREN RIJIJU }(a) The ‘Khelo India – National Programme for Development of Sports’ was launched in October, 2017 with the twin objectives of mass participation and promotion of excellence in sports across the country.

Community Coaching DevelopmentA total of thirty-six ex-sportspersons are involved in the talent identification process of the Khelo India Scheme.(b) Most of the sports coaches in various parts of the country are under the jurisdiction of respective bodies/departments of State/UT Governments. As such, the information about them is not maintained in this Ministry. However, the details regarding sanctioned number of coaches under the facilities of Sports Authority of India (SAI) are as under:-<pre>S. No.	Designation 	Sanctioned Strength1	Chief Coach	1522	Senior Coach	3053	Coach	4574	Assistant Coach	610 	Total	1524</pre>Athletics, being a multiple event discipline, has the maximum number of coaches.(c) Percentage of posts of coaches vacant, hired on contract and full time position under the facilities of SAI are as under:-	1.

The Government insists on observance of the provisions of NSDCI by the NSFs to maintain their recognition on year-to-year basis and become eligible to receive financial and other forms of support from the Government. Wherever any such violations are found, the concerned NSFs are advised to rectify the same.The NSFs are compliant with substantial provisions of the NSDCI particularly with regard to age and tenure restrictions. However, the Ministry has asked the NSFs to carry out requisite amendments in their constitutions and bye-laws for bringing them in conformity with the Sports Code provisions as the matter is being monitored by the Hon''ble High Court of Delhi in a writ petition filed in 2020.(f) and (g) ‘Sports’ being a State subject, the primary responsibility for promotion and development of sports, including up keeping and maintenance of sports infrastructure is that of the State/Union Territory Governments. Central Government supplements the efforts of the State/ UT Governments under its various schemes. An amount of ? 125.85 crore was spent on the upkeep and maintenance of sports infrastructure under this Ministry during the financial year 2019-20. Under the Khelo India Scheme, thirty sports infrastructure projects were sanctioned across the country during the financial year 2019-20. These sporting facilities are for the benefit of all citizens of the country. *****
