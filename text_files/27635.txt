The UDISE+ results are available up to 2019-20.As per UDISE+, the drop-out rates among girls in different levels of school education in Jharkhand and Rajasthan including dropout rates of Scheduled Tribes for the last fiveyears is at annexure-I. As per UDISE+ 2019-20 the dropout rates for girls in the country for the year 2019-20 is also placed at annexure –I.(c):Under Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Samagra Shiksha, which is an overarching scheme for school education covering all levels from pre-primary to senior secondary, financial assistance is provided to the States and UTs for various activities to reduce dropouts at secondary level, which include opening/strengthening of new schools up to senior secondary level, strengthening school infrastructure, setting up, upgradation and running of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBV) upto class 12, setting up of residential schools/hostels named Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Avasiya Vidyalayas, transport allowance, undertaking enrolment drives, seasonal hostels/ residential camps, provision of vocational education and ICT facilities in schools, etc, financial assistance is also provided for aids and appliances for children with special needs.Under Samagra Shiksha, for the first time in 2021-22, financial assistance upto Rs. 2000 per annum has been envisioned for supporting Out of School Children of age group of 16-19 years, belonging to socio economically disadvantaged groups, for completing their education through NIOS/SIOS, for accessing course materials and certification.This Department has developed an online module for compiling the data of Out of School Children (OoSC) identified by each State/UT and their mapping with Special Training Centres (STC) on the PRABANDH Portal (http://samagrashiksha.in).
