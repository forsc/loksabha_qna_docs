ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION (DR. SUBHAS SARKAR)(a) to (c): National Education Policy 2020 envisions that regions of the country with large populations from educationally-disadvantaged SEDGs should be declared Special Education Zones (SEZs), where all the schemes and policies are implemented to the maximum through additional concerted efforts, in order to truly change their educational landscape. Further, it aims to ensure that no child loses any opportunity to learn and excel because of the circumstances of birth or background. It proposes special emphasis to be given on Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Groups (SEDGs).Since education is a concurrent subject, State/UT Governments play a vital role in the implementation of the National Education Policy 2020. A number of initiatives have been taken by the Ministry of Education, University Grants Commission (UGC), All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), other relevant Ministries/Departments, State/UT Governments and other stakeholders towards implementation of NEP 2020 for enhancing the quality of education at all levels.Major schemes/projects/programmes have been aligned with NEP 2020 to improve the standard of education. In 2021-22, funds of Rs. 1214 Crore (approx) have been released to Aligarh Muslim University.***
