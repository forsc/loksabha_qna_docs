                                                                  THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS				 (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)	(a)&(b): Yes, Sir. The Scheme for Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHCs) was approved by the Union Cabinet on July 8, 2020. The target beneficiaries under the scheme are from Economically Weaker Section (EWS)/Low Income Group (LIG) who are urban migrants/poor. They include labour, street vendors, rickshaw pullers, service providers, industrial workers or migrants working with markets/trade associations, educational/health institutions, hospitality sector, long term tourists or any other person of such category. The Scheme is being implemented through two models: Model-1: Utilizing existing Government funded vacant houses to convert into ARHCs through Public Private Partnership or by Public Agencies;Model-2: Construction, Operation and Maintenance of ARHCs by Public/ Private Entities on their own available vacant land.(c): No, Sir. (d): The State/UT-wise details of number of houses constructed for the slum dwellers across the country is at Annexure.(e): Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban (PMAY-U) Scheme Guidelines mandates States/Union Territories (UTs)/Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to carry out demand survey as per the defined eligibility criteria under the Scheme. Thereafter, Housing for All Plan of Action (HFAPoA) and Annual Implementation Plan (AIP) are prepared. Further, para 8.6 of the Scheme Guidelines has provisions to discuss the result of demand survey, draft HFAPoA and draft AIP with the local representatives including Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs) and Members of Parliament (MPs) of that area so that their views are adequately factored in while finalising the plans and beneficiary list.                                 *****
