ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????   (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	 With the rising population and increase in demand for water by various sectors, it is essential that water use efficiency is increased in every water use activity including irrigation for sustaining the food, water and shelter requirement of the human and animal population within finite water availability. Piped irrigation system can curtail irrigation water demand without compromising net irrigation requirement (NIR) by improving water use efficiency in irrigation sector. The estimated overall efficiency with piped irrigation network is of the order of 70-80% which is above the efficiency of conventional canal network system (35-60%).             In this context, Guidelines for Planning and Design of Piped Irrigation Network (July, 2017) has been prepared  by Department of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, Ministry of Jal Shakti. The same is available at  www.cwc.gov.in/sites/default/files/ PIN%2027¬_7 _2017_Uploaded.pdf.           Government of India promotes and supports State Government to implement Piped Distribution System in all the irrigation projects which are proposed or being implemented. Under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), States like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh etc have already started implementing the piped distribution system.********
