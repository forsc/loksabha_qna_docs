In addition, on 21st February 2016, to bridge the rural-urban gap, through stimulating local economic development, enhancement of basic services and creating well planned Rurban Clusters, Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM) has been launched by the Government of India. The goals of the Mission are essentially to develop cluster of villages, while preserving and nurturing the essence of rural community life with focus on equity and inclusiveness without compromising with the facilities perceived to be essentially urban in nature and creating a cluster of Rurban villages. Details of achievement of the Mission is at Annexure II.  (d) & (e) There is no proposal under consideration with the Ministry of Rural Development, at present, on formulation of policy of Smart Villages with all modern amenities.  However, under SPMRM, different modern amenities are being created in rural areas through convergence of funds and resources under Centrally Sponsored, Central Sector and States schemes incentivized by dedicated Critical Gap Fund (CGF). Some important modern amenities, created under 21 components of SPMRM in the Rurban Clusters across the country, include creation of smart classroom, Wi-Fi hotspots, Citizen Service Centres, Solid and Liquid Waste Treatment Plants, Solar Water Pumps, Water ATMs, e-Rickshaw, Digital Library etc. ************
