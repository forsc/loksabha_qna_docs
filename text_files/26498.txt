                                                        (a)       The Government of India had launched Skill Loan Scheme on 15th July, 2015 to provide loan facility to aspirants wanting to do skill development courses aligned to National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF).

Amount of loan varies from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 1,50,000/- depending on the course and has a repayment period of 3 to 7 years. The details of number of loan record and  loan amount disbursed under the scheme – State-wise including Odisha and Madhya Pradesh for FY 2019-20 and 2020-21 are given at Annexure-I and Annexure-II respectively.

(c)        Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS) is implemented through Industrial Training Institutes while Crafts Instructor Training Scheme (CITS) is being implemented through National Skill Training Institutes (NSTIs).  There are 1219 ITIs in Madhya Pradesh including 14 ITIs in Ashok Nagar, 20 ITIs in Guna and 35 ITIs in Shivpuri Districts coming under Guna Parliamentary Constituency.  These ITIs impart training in 137 approved trades.  Further, NSTI (Women) in Indore provides training in 11 different trades, having a seating capacity 272 annually.  The Craft Instructor centers are run under the Scheme namely-Craft Instructor Training Scheme. However, there are no Craft Instructor Training Centers run in the Parliamentary Constituency of Ashok nagar, Guna and Shivpuri. (d)        Pradhan Mantri Yuva Udyamita Vikas Abhiyan (PM-YUVA Yojana), a Pilot Project, initiated in November, 2019 with the aim to create an enabling ecosystem for entrepreneurship development through entrepreneurship awareness, entrepreneurship education, training, advocacy, and easy access to entrepreneurship network, with focus on student/ trainees and alumnae from the skilling ecosystem in 10 states and 2 Union Territories namely Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Telangana, Kerala, West Bengal, Bihar, Assam, Meghalaya, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra.
