Independent 82.77 81.08 82.40 79.27 82.50 82.59</pre>(e) A proposal was received from the NVS for increasing the intake of students at ClassVI level in the JNVs by 10%. NVS has been advised to align it with the provision of theRight of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009.(f) National Leadership Institutes (NLIs) set up in different parts of the country organiseregular in-service training programs for the teachers of the JNVs to enable them toconstantly upgrade their skills. These training programs help the JNV teachers toacquaint themselves with the latest innovations in the field of education, currentreforms, use of ITC in education, etc. A total number of 229 training courses wereconducted during 2018-19 in which 8353 employees participated.(g) The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one JNV in each district ofthe country. Opening of new Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) is a continuousprocess which depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government/UTadministration to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction ofthe permanent building and making available required temporary building, free of rent,to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However, actualsanction and opening of new JNV depends on the availability of funds and approval bythe Competent Authority. One JNV each has been sanctioned in all the districts of thecountry (as on 31st May, 2014). The state of Tamil Nadu has not yet accepted theNavodaya Vidyalaya Scheme.*****
