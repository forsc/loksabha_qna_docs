PMAY-G is being implemented by Ministry of Rural Development w.e.f. 1st April 2016. In urban areas of the country, Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U) is being implemented by Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs w.e.f. 25.06.2015. 	Under PMAY-G, as on 15.07.2019, a total of 82,14,980 houses have been completed. For the financial year 2019-20, 60.00 Lakh houses are targeted for construction against which, States / UTs have been allocated target of 50.54 Lakh. A statement indicating the State/UT wise  houses completed and targets allocated  for FY 2019-20 under PMAY-G is given in Annexure-I.	Under PMAY(U), as on 24.06.2019, the validated demand is around 100 lakhs. A total of 81,03,196 houses has been approved, out of which 26,07,913 houses have been completed. All States/UTs have been requested to saturate their demand of housing during this financial year i.e. 2019-20 so as to complete construction of all the approved houses under the PMAY(U) by 2022. A statement indicating the State/UT-wise details of houses completed under PMAY(U) during last 5 years, i.e. 2014-19 is given in Annexure-II.(b) & (c):	Under PMAY-G, 60% of the targets allocated to the States/UTs including the State of Assam are earmarked for SC/STs subject to availability of eligible PMAY-G beneficiaries. The earmarking only defines the minimum limit that should be achieved and the State/UTs may add to the targets under these categories to ensure saturation.	Under PMAY (U), subject to beneficiaries being from EWS/LIG segments, preference is given to Manual Scavengers, Women (with overriding preference to widows), persons belonging to SC/ST/OBC, Minorities, Persons with disabilities and Transgender.*****
