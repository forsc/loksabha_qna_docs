ANSWER




                                                        (a)          The Directorate General of Shipping, Mumbai has approved 153 Maritime Training Institutes. Out of 153 only 55 colleges are providing Virtual Classes during COVID-19 Pandemic.(b)        List of functioning Maritime Training Institutes State/UT- wise: <pre>Sr. No.	State/UT	Number of Institute01	Andhra Pradesh	0202	Bihar	0103	Uttrakhand	0104	Delhi	0605	Haryana	0306	Kerala	0207	Maharashtra	1908	Tamil Nadu	1109	Uttar Pradesh	0510	West Bengal	05                  Total	55                                            </pre> (c)        During the last three years, the total number of students who have graduated from Maritime Training Institutions are 32,029 and number of Ship Board Training provided to students in last three years is 19,204. Details of Candidates passed and Ship Board Training during last three years is as  follows: <pre>Year	Total No. of candidate passed	Total No. of Ship Board Training2017	11155	85152018	10928	71542019	9946	3535                                  </pre>(d)       The employment details in the maritime sector for  last three years are given below,  which show an increasing trend in the employment opportunities in the maritime sector : <pre>Year	Total No. of seafarers engaged	Growth %2017	1,54349	7.232018	2,08,799	35.272019	2,34,886	12.49                                                   </pre> Following are some of the initiatives taken towards constant enhancement in the employment opportunities  in the maritime sector:-•	The training curriculum for the officers and the ratings was revised in 2016, not only to meet the global standards but also to meet the expectations of the foreign employers.•	The Govt. has also brought major regulatory relaxation for obtaining Indian Continuous Discharge Certificate (CDC), which is a pre-requisite for boarding a vessel for the purposes of employment.  A new liberalized CDC regime was introduced in 2017 which allowed 10th Pass Indian citizens who had completed a 14 day basic maritime course to obtain Indian CDC.  Earlier, they were required to complete at least 6 months training for obtaining CDC.  Further, based  on the previous experience onboard cruise vessels, condition of passing of  10th standard  has been removed.  This has enabled many seafarers having past experience in cruise ships to obtain Indian CDC.  •	A policy shift was made by the regulator by holding the training institutes responsible for on-board ship training of the students.  Further, to release more on-board ship training slots, a decision was taken to allow on-board training of officers and ratings on tugs and offshore vessels also.  These two initiatives have opened additional berths for nearly 4000 trainees. •	Since employment of Indian seafarers is well regulated and their welfare is well protected through Rules and Regulations framed under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, in consonance with the Maritime Labour convention, 2006 as amended, more and more foreign shipowners are engaging Indian seafarers on board their ships.•	Promulgation of new simplified Continuous Discharge Certificate (CDC) Rules in 2017 and making the process of issuance of CDC paperless/online has facilitated an increase in the number of Indian seafarers. (e & f) Yes Sir, two maritime clusters have been identified, one  in Gujarat and another in Goa. The DPR of Shipbuilding Park at Bhavnagar has  been prepared by Gujarat Maritime Board as part of maritime cluster development in Gujarat.  An industrial plot has been allotted and a Special Purpose Vehicle has been formed for development and operation of the Goa Maritime Cluster.                                             ****
