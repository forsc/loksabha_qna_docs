UnderPMKVY 2.0 scheme, as on 17.01.2020, 31.29 lakhs women candidates have been trained.Long term training is imparted to candidates including women under Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS) through a network of 15,697 Industrial Training Institutes across the country. Under thisscheme, 6.23 lakhs women candidates have been trained during the last five years (2014-18). Moreover, there are 19 National Skill Training Institutes (NSTIs) imparting skill training exclusively for women.
