                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c) :   Details of admissible claims amount, claims amount approved and claims amount paid in Maharashtra under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS) are given below:                                                                      (Rs. in crore)Season	Admissible Claim Amount	Approved Claim Amount	Claims Amount paidKharif 2016	2080.12	2080.12	2080.12Rabi 2016-17	236.31	236.31	236.31Kharif 2017	2876.70	2876.70	2876.24Rabi 2017-18	409.91	409.91	409.91Kharif 2018	3941.95	3928.19	3914.17Rabi 2018-19	1557.03	1538.72	1506.07	As per provisions of the PMFBY claims for wide spread calamities like flood, drought etc. or season end yield based claims are worked out and settled by the concerned insurance company on area approach basis, on receipt of yield data arrived through requisite number of  Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) at the end of the harvesting period, from the concerned State Government. Contd…2/--2-	However, losses due to localized risks of hailstorm, landslide, inundation, cloud burst & natural fire and post-harvest losses are calculated on individual insured farm level, based on the report of the joint committee comprising representatives of State Government and insurance company to survey the extent of loss.  Further, there  is also a provision to pay claims towards prevented sowing/failed germination and adhoc claims in case of mid season adversity.  	In respect of recent adverse weather conditions in Kharif 2019 season in Maharashtra, process of joint surveys by State and insurance companies in respect of localized calamities, is on.  The season-end claims, if any, would be worked out and settled by the concerned insurance companies based on the yield data furnished by the State Government.  	Maharasthra State Government has reported that provisionally 4.17 lakh ha. of cropped area  was affected in the State due to flood during  the recent South-West Monsoon, 2019.    However, the data on crops damaged and number of farmers affected is not collected under PMFBY since the scheme is being implemented on area approach basis.	The claims amounting to Rs. 36.57 crore pertaining to prevented sowing in Osmanabad and Latur districts of Maharashtra for Kharif 2019 season have been settled/ paid by the Agriculture Insurance Company of India Ltd.  (d):   	During implementation of the scheme, some complaints about non-payment and delayed payment of claims; under payment of claims on account of incorrect/delayed submission of insurance proposals by banks; discrepancy in yield data, unrealistic assessment of crop loss due to large unit area of insurance; delay in providing Government share of funds etc., have been received in the past in the country including Maharashtra.   Most of the complaints were suitably addressed by the Insurer and the Ministry.	Further, a provision of Stratified Grievance Redressal Mechanism viz. District Level Grievance Redressal Committee (DGRC), State Level Grievance Redressal Committee (SGRC) has been made in the Revised Operational Guidelines of the Scheme to resolve such complaints. 	However, about 32 lakh intimations for the crop damage have been received by the State Government of Maharashtra for recent unseasonal rainfall in Kharif 2019 season.********
