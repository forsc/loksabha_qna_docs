                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI GIRIRAJ SINGH)(a)	to (d)  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. Statement referred to in reply to Parts (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No.104 due for answer on 27.07.2021(a)	The details of the roads constructed since inception of Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) year and state wise are given at Annexure-I. District wise details of roads constructed in the state of Maharashtra under PMGSY are given at Annexure-II.(b)	(i)   PMGSY was launched as a one-time special intervention to provide rural connectivity, by way of a single all-weather road, to the eligible unconnected habitations of designated population size (500+ in plain areas and 250+ in North-Eastern States, Himalayan States and Himalayan Union Territories as per 2001 census) in the core network for uplifting the socio-economic condition of the rural population. Relaxation has been provided to the Tribal (Schedule V) areas and Selected Tribal and Backward Districts (as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the then Planning Commission), and unconnected habitations in these areas with a population of 250 persons and above in the Core Network as per Census 2001 are eligible for connectivity under the scheme. In the critical Left-Wing Extremism affected blocks (as identified by Ministry of Home Affairs), additional relaxation has been given to connect habitations with population 100 persons and above as per 2001 census. The Scheme had also an element of upgradation (to prescribed standards) of existing rural roads in districts where all the eligible habitations of the designated population size have been connected with all-weather road connectivity, though this objective was not central to the scheme. The roads connecting the targeted habitations were taken up for sanction under the new connectivity component of the scheme. Under upgradation component, intermediate link roads, which were not upto the standards of all-weather roads, were taken up for upgradation to the prescribed standards.(ii)    PMGSY-II was launched in the year 2013, with a target to upgrade 50,000 Kms of the existing rural road network to improve its overall efficiency as a provider of transportation services for people, goods and services. The State/UT-wise allocation of targets is given at Annexure-III. District-wise/Block-wise allocation of targets within the overall targets allocated to the States/UTs has been done by the respective State Governments/Union Territories. The selection of roads in a particular district/block has been done by the States/UTs based on the utility value of the eligible roads computed on the basis of their economic potential and their role in facilitating the growth of rural market centres and rural hubs.(iii)   Road Connectivity Project for Left Wing Extremism Affected Areas (RCPLWEA) was launched in the year 2016 for construction/ upgradation of strategically important roads chosen in the 44 worst affected LWE districts and adjoining districts in the 9 States of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Maharashtra, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh. The scheme has twin objectives of enabling smooth and seamless anti-LWE operations by the security forces and also ensuring socio-economic development. As per the programme guidelines of RCPLWEA, the selection of roads is done by the Ministry of Home Affairs in consultation with the Home Departments of the concerned states and the security forces engaged in combating the LWE violence.   (iv)    PMGSY-III was launched in the year 2019 for consolidation of 1,25,000 Km Through Routes and Major Rural Links connecting habitations, inter-alia, to Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs), Higher Secondary Schools and Hospitals.  The State/UT-wise allocation of targets is given at Annexure- IV. District-wise/Block-wise allocation of targets within the overall targets allocated to the States/UTs is done by the respective State Governments/Union Territories. The selection of roads in a particular district/block is done by the States/UTs based on the utility value of the eligible roads computed on the basis of the population served by the road and market, educational, medical and transport infrastructure facilities connected by the concerned road.(c) & (d) From the very beginning, PMGSY has an inbuilt mechanism for consultation with Members of Parliament at various stages of planning and implementation of the programme. Elaborate mechanism has been provided in the programme guidelines to give full consideration to the proposals given by Member of Parliament. Letters have been sent to State Governments to bring these provisions to their attention. In order to ensure that the State Governments give due attention to the laid down provisions of the guidelines regarding giving consideration to the proposals given by the Member of Parliament and public representatives, while submitting the proposals to the Ministry of Rural Development for sanction, the Ministry had issued an advisory to the States on 2nd June, 2020. The State Governments have been advised, inter-alia, to communicate the final list of proposals to Members of Parliament and obtain their consent in writing before the Ministry approves those proposals. A copy of the advisory is attached at Annexure –V.*****
