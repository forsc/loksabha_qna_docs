ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL)(a)	Under Fourteenth Finance Commission, grants to the tune of Rs. 5674.70 cr had been released during 2019-20 to the Gram Panchayats (GPs) of Bihar for delivering basic services and other infrastructural facilities for the people in villages. (b) to (d) Since Panchayat is a State subject, saturation of computerization in the Gram Panchayats (GPs) is primarily the responsibility of States. Hence, no timeline can be fixed by the Ministry for saturation of computerization in the State of Bihar. However, Ministry of Panchayati Raj supplements the efforts of States including Bihar, through its schemes and programmes on a limited scale. Under the scheme of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA), computers for 531GPs have been approved to the State of Bihar. Further, the untied/ basic grants under 15th Finance Commission can also be used by Gram Panchayats for computer in the respective Gram Panchayats. As per information available 547 GPs in Bihar do not have computers. District-wise information is not maintained centrally. ****
