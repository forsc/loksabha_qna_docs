                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d) Yes, Sir. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme was initially started to provide income support to all landholding Small and Marginal landholder farmers’ families across the country, numbering about 12.5 crore, subject to certain excusion criteria relating to higher income status, to enable them to take care of expenses related to agriculture and allied activities as well as domestic needs. The ambit of the Scheme has now been expanded to cover all farmers in the country irrespective of the size of their land holdings, subject to all other existing exclusions. It is expected that an additional 2 crore farmers will be covered. A statement showing the estimated number of State/UT-wise operational holdings is laid on the table of the House.  Contd…2/--2-As per the provisions of the Scheme, the entire responsibility of identifying the eligible beneficiary farmers and uploading their data on PM-KISAN Portal is entrusted to the State/UT Governments only. The financial benefit under the Scheme is transferred to the bank accounts of the identified beneficiaries as and when their correct and verified data is uploaded by the concerned States / UTs on PM-Kisan web-portal.(e) & (f):    Ownership of cultivable land is the basis of the Scheme. The survey of landless farmers has not been conducted, therefore, their exact numbers are not available. However, a Statement showing State-wise number of wholly leased-in operational holdings as per the Agriculture Census 2010-11 is available.   Various schemes run by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers’ Welfare aim at benefitting the cultivators irrespective of the ownership status.
