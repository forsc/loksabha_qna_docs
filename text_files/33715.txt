ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL)(a) & (b) The State/UT-wise details of Rural Local Bodies including Gram Panchayats (GPs) with/without computers including Uttar Pradesh is given at Annexure. (c) Panchayat being a State subject, providing basic infrastructure including computers etc. is primarily the responsibility of concerned State Government/ UT administration. The level of computerisation of GPs varies among States depending upon the availability of electric power supply, internet connectivity, adequate computer- trained manpower, financial resources etc at GP level. (d) & (e) Since Panchayat is a state subject, saturation of computerization in the Gram Panchayats is primarily the responsibility of respective State Governments. However, Government of India supplements the efforts of States in this regard on limited scale through its schemes/programs. Under the erstwhile scheme of Rajiv Gandhi Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (RGPSA), Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) had provided financial assistance to States/ UTs for e-enablement including computers and peripherals upto 2014-15. Under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) being implemented since 2018-19, fund is being provided to States/UTs for provision of computer for e-enablement on limited scale. Further, the untied/ basic grants under 15th Finance Commission can also be used by Rural Local Bodies (RLBs) for computer in the respective Rural Local Bodies. MoPR is implementing e-Panchayat Mission Mode Project (MMP) under which a suite of core common applications have been developed to address various aspects of Panchayats’ functioning including planning, budgeting, implementation, accounting, monitoring, social audit and delivery of citizen services like issue of certificates, licenses, etc. For attaining the vision of Digital India, BharatNet project is being implemented by Department of Telecommunications in phased manner to create network to connect all GPs by broadband in the country. As on 17.01.2022, total 1,70,136 GPs have been made Service Ready under the BharatNet project in the country. The target date for the completion of project is August, 2023.***
