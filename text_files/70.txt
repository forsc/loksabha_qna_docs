                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):	No such data is maintained centrally at GoI level. However, deaths due to diarrhea as per Central Bureau of Health Intelligence (CBHI) data reported in 3 years is annexed. (b):	Under National Health Mission (NHM), the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is implementing various programs to reduce under-nutrition in vulnerable population across the life cycle, such as micronutrients supplementation program, management of sick children with severe acute malnutrition in health facilities, improvement of appropriate Infant and Young Child Feeding Practices, Vitamin A supplementation, National Deworming Day etc. Prevention of Childhood illnesses such as Diarrhoeal diseases in turn prevents childhood malnutrition indirectly. Intensified Diarrhoea Control Fortnight (IDCF) is being implemented for this purpose. Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) which includes provision of free diet for the pregnant mothers and infants during their stay at health facility is another strategy to provide nutritional support.  Ministry of Drinking Water & Sanitation has taken initiatives for safe drinking water supply to the population throughout the country including those areas with high Fluoride and Arsenic content in ground water, along with activities for Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM). Awareness generation activities are also being conducted among general population on importance of use of safe drinking water and hand-washing for prevention of water borne diseases.
