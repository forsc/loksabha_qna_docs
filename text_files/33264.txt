ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(DR. SUBHAS SARKAR)(a) to (d): The passage in one set of question paper in Class X English Language & Literature Exam held on 11th December 2021, was not in accordance with guidelines of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) with regard to setting of question papers. On this basis and on the basis of feedback received from stakeholders, it was decided to drop the passage and the related questions and to award full marks to the students for this question.  As CBSE is committed to excellence in education and promotes inclusiveness and gender sensitivity, the following action has been taken: 1. CBSE has expressed regret for this inadvertent lapse. 2. The passage and related questions were dropped and it was decided to award full marks to all 	the students in both the sets of Question Papers. 3. Paper Setters and Moderators who were involved in the preparation of question papers have been debarred as guidelines for setting of Question Papers were not followed by them. 4. Paper setting process is highly confidential and to maintain secrecy, outside and experienced 	subject experts are engaged for this work and CBSE officials are not directly involved. 5. CBSE has constituted a committee of experts headed by former Controller of Examinations and 	experts from other educational institutions for strengthening the paper setting process to avoid such occurrences. 6. CBSE has sensitised all the external paper setters regarding quality of the question papers. *****
