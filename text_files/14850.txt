Total number of suppliers/producers empanelled with TRIFED as on 31.12.2019 is 1304.(iii)	TRIFED also organizes Tribal Artisan Mela (TAM) at District/Tehsil level as an exercise to reach tribals located in interior tribal areas and source tribal art and craft directly from them. Through this initiative, Tribal Artisans are invited to an exhibition area where they display their art and craft items. (iv)	TRIFED is also engaged in direct sale of tribal products including art & craft items through its network of Tribes India Showrooms, exhibitions, Aadi Mahotsav, online e-commerce portal etc. (c)& (d):	This Ministry has conducted evaluation study for the scheme “Institutional Support for Development and Marketing of Tribal Products/Produce” through Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA) during the year 2019-20.
