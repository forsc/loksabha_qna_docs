ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND PENSIONS AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a):   The appraisal of performance of Government staff, other than officers belonging to All India Services, is governed by instructions issued by the Government from time to time. These instructions provide timelines for recording of self-appraisal, recording of remarks by reporting, reviewing and accepting authorities, if any. (b) & (c):   Adequate safeguards are provided in the instructions issued by the Government for recording of CRs in time.  These instructions, inter-alia, provide for forfeiture of the right of the Reporting Officer & Reviewing Officer to write & review respectively the CRs, now known as Annual Performance Assessment Report (APAR), after the prescribed date. In such cases, a certificate to this effect shall be added in the APAR dossier for the relevant period by the concerned administrative Branch so as not to put such staff into any disadvantageous position.(d) to (f):   No centralized data regarding pendency of promotion of staff due to non-availability of CRs/ APARs is maintained. However, guidelines on the procedure to be observed by Departmental Promotion Committees (DPCs), inter-alia, provide that where one or more APARs have not been written for any reason during the relevant period, APAR of the years preceding the period in question shall be considered and, if in any case, even these are not available, APARs of the lower grade shall be taken into account to complete the number of APARs required for consideration for promotion.*****
