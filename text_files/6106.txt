ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	Forest Survey of India, Dehradun, organization under the Ministry carries out the assessment of forest cover of the country biennially and findings are published in India State of Forest Report (ISFR).  As per the latest ISFR 2017, the total area of dense forests in the country is 4,06,476 square kilometre. The State/UTs details of dense forest cover as per ISFR 2017 is given in Annexure. (b)	The definition of the term “Forest cover” in the ISFR is as given below:“All lands, more than 1 hectare in area, with a tree canopy density of more than 10 percent irrespective of ownership and legal status. Such lands may not necessarily be a recorded forest area. It also includes orchards, bamboo and palm.”Of the above definition of forest cover, dense forests are those that have a canopy density of above 40%. The dense forests are further divided into Moderately Dense Forest (canopy density 40% to 70%) and Very Dense Forest (Canopy density >70%).(c)	No, Sir. As per the latest ISFR 2017, there is an increase of 5104 square kilometre in dense forest cover of the country compared to the data published in ISFR 2015. The main reason for increase in forest cover including dense forests can be attributed to plantation and conservation activities both within and outside the Recorded Forest areas.  (d)	No, Sir. However, forests are necessary to keep the environment and climate of the country clean and healthy. Forests provide various environmental benefits and ecological services. Trees purify the polluted air by absorbing large amount pollutants like carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide by their leaves and releasing oxygen. Trees produce a healthy environment by providing clean air, water and soil. Trees, especially broad leaves trap aerosols and small particles and acts as dust filters. Tree covers absorb rain water and allow the drained water to percolate into the soil thus maintaining ground water table and reduces runoff.(e)	 &  (f)  The Ministry has not formulated any action plan for fixing the required area of dense forests    in each State. However, as per National Forest Policy 1988, the national goal should be to have a minimum of one-third of the total land area of the country under forest or tree cover. In the hills and in mountainous regions, the aim should be to maintain two-third of the area under such cover in order to prevent erosion and land degradation and to ensure the stability of the fragile eco-system.********
