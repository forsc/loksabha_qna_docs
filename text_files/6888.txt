As such conversion/ introduction of trains with LHB stock is also not undertaken on State-wise basis. However, 23 pairs of trains origination /terminating in the stations located in the State of Kerala are running with LHB coaches.(b)  Coaches deployed on trains running over Indian Railways including those serving Southern Railway, which caters to the State of Kerala, are within their respective codal life and fit for operation. (c) With a view to provide safer and more comfortable journey to the travelling  passengers, it has been decided to proliferate/induct modern Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches and convert trains operating with conventional coaches by LHB coaches, in a phased manner.                                                                    *****
