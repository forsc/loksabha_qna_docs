MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a): While no comprehensive study has been undertaken regarding health issues of labourers employed in coal sector, studies have been conducted regarding health facilities in coal mining sector. All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) was entrusted with a study to suggest actions to be taken to improve medical facilities by Coal India Limited (CIL) and its subsidiary companies. AIIMS has since given its recommendations on the matter.          Further, CIL conducts initial medical examinations in respect of newly joined employees and periodical medical examinations for existing employees at prescribed regular intervals. Moreover, coal mine workers have to undergo Medical Checkup every five years as per the provisions of the Mines Rules, 1955.  Those who are more than 45 years old have to undergo medical checkup after every three years as per recommendation of 10th Conference on Safety in Mines.
