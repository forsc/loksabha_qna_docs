                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (e): As per the Child Adoption Resource Information and Guidance System (CARINGS), an Online Portal of Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA), out of total 9860 In-country Adoptions in the last three years, 174 cases of disruption and 05 cases of dissolution have been reported. The details are as follows : Year	No. of In-country Adoptions	No. of Disruption cases reported	No. of Dissolution cases reported2016-17	3210	59	02017-18	3276	60	42018-19	3374	55	1Total	9860	174	5The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules, 2016 and Adoption Regulations, 2017 mandate necessary support to be extended to adoptive parents and children. Functions of the State Adoption Resource Agencies (SARAs), District Child Protection Units (DCPUs) and Specialised Adoption Agencies (SAAs) have been enumerated at Regulations 33, 34 and 29 respectively.  The adoption process is conducted through online platform i.e. CARINGS (Child Adoption Resource Information and Guidance System).  The disruption/ dissolution is mainly observed in cases of placement of older children primarily due to the adjustment issues of the child with the family. Emphasis is being given for the counselling of parents adopting older children and the older children being placed in adoption. Regular awareness programme and training for capacity building of various stakeholders are also organised from time to time to facilitate the adoption process. ****
