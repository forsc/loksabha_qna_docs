ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                              (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)to(c): In pursuance to Government of India’s vision of facilitating Housing for All by 2022, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has been implementing PMAY-U Mission since June 2015 to provide Central Assistance to States/UTs for providing all weather pucca houses to all eligible urban households including slum dwellers. The “In-situ” Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) component under PMAY-U Mission mandates to use land as a resource for providing houses to slum dwellers. This approach aims to leverage the locked potential of land under slums to provide houses to the eligible slum dwellers by bringing them into the formal urban settlement. So far, in 1,742 slums across the country 4,62,146 houses have been sanctioned for slum dwellers under ISSR component of PMAY-U Mission. The State/Union Territories (UTs)-wise details of number of slums, houses sanctioned and houses constructed along with Central Assistance sanctioned and released during last three years and the present year for persons living in slums under ISSR component of PMAY-U Mission are at Annexure.(d): In order to monitor and prevent the misuse of funds under PMAY-U Mission, following mechanisms have been adopted:i.	Beneficiaries under PMAY-U Mission are selected and identified based on Aadhaar/any other Unique Identification. ii.	Projects under the Mission are approved by the State Level Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee constituted under the chairpersonship of Chief Secretary of the concerned State/UT.iii.	Central Assistance is released to the States/UTs after approval of the Central Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee constituted in the MoHUA and based on the physical progress of the projects. iv.	In order to provide flexibility, States/UTs are allowed to release funds on the basis of actual progress of the projects. v.	Under the component for beneficiary-led individual house construction or enhancement, Central Assistance released to States/UTs is further electronically transferred to the beneficiary bank accounts. vi.	Funds released to the city or any other implementing agency by State/UT are kept in a separate account opened for the Mission. Any interest accrued in this account is used for the Mission purpose only.vii.	The progress of individual houses are tracked through geo-tagged photographs to monitor effectively.                                                  *****
