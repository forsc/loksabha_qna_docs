                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a): Yes Sir.  ;;(b) to (d): Government of India, Ministry of Civil Aviation has formulated a Greenfield Airport Policy for development of Greenfield Airports across the country. As per the Greenfield Airport Policy, the applicant proposing to set up an airport would make an application to the Steering Committee in the format prescribed under the said policy. On the request received from project proponent for setting up of a greenfield airport, Government grants two stage clearances i.e. ''Site Clearance'' followed by ''In-principle'' approval. However, no such proposal for setting up of greenfield airport at Rameshwarm has been received by the Government.;;Besides, Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)-Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN) in 2016 for promotion of Regional Connectivity by way of revival of un-served and under-served airports/airstrips, helipads of the State Governments, Airports Authority of India, Civil Enclaves & CPSUs through a Budgetary support of Rs.4500 crores. In the 1st and 2nd rounds of RCS-UDAN, routes have been awarded to various operators for starting flights from 56 unserved airports and 31 unserved helipads in the country. Till date, 39 airports (unserved/underserved) under RCS-UDAN scheme have been operationalized. In 3rd round of bidding under RCS-UDAN version 3.0, M/s Turbo Aviation Pvt. Ltd. submitted the proposal for operation of RCS flights between Chennai & Ramnad (nearest airport to Rameshwaram) with ATR-72 type aircraft.
