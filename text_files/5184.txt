ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c) Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is implementing  its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) through National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), a Public Private Partnership organization. NSDC has facilitated creation of Sector Skill Councils (SSCs) which are industry led bodies to ensure addressing skill requirements of various sectors. The scheme promotes skilling of manpower in various sectors including agriculture through the Agriculture Sector Skill Council (ASCI). There are three kinds of training routes under the scheme: Short Term Training (STT) for fresh skilling of school / college drop outs and unemployed youth, Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) to recognize the existing skills and Special Projects to address skilling requirements of the vulnerable groups and permit certain flexibility in conduct of Short Term Training. RPL under PMKVY has been able to undertake up-skilling of farmers via bridge course training through some of the projects. The beneficiaries have been oriented in skills such as ''Group Farming Practitioner'' which enables farmers to increase productivity and income by establishing market linkages and buy–back arrangements. Beneficiaries are being enrolled pan India including Rajasthan for diverse job roles such as Dairy Farmer, Animal Health Worker, Organic Grower, Floriculturist, Gardener and Pulses Cultivator etc. PMKVY 2.0 (2016-2020), recognizes the needs across various sectors. To promote skill development and entrepreneurship under Agriculture Sector, relaxation has been given on wage employment norms and infrastructure requirements. A total of 71 training centers are on-boarded in Rajasthan to impart training under Agri and allied sector. In Rajasthan, 10,336 candidates (PMKVY-1) and 22,790 candidates (PMKVY-2) have been trained under PMKVY scheme.
