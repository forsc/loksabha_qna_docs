                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING (SHRI PRATAP CHANDRA SARANGI)(a):	The Government, upon receipt of reports of apprehensions of the Indian fishermen, immediately takes up the matter with Pakistan through diplomatic channels and seeks consular access for their early release and repatriation along with boats. Till date Government’s persistent efforts have succeeded in securing release and repatriation of 2080 fishermen along with 57 boats from Pakistan’s custody since 2014. A visit of a team of fishermen representatives was organized to Karachi in March 2016 to assess the condition of 22 other Indian fishing boats in Pakistan’s custody. Steps have been taken by Indian Coast Guard to guide Indian fishermen not to cross-over the perceived International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) through various community interaction programmes for the fishing community. The Indian Coast Guard ships shepherd the Indian fishing boats clear from the perceived IMBL to prevent their apprehension by Maritime Security Agencies of neighboring countries. One Indian Coast Guard ship/ aircraft maintains close surveillance at any given time along the India- Pakistan perceived IMBL.  The Government of Gujarat has specified no-fishing zone of five nautical miles along the national IMBL. (b)	:	The Government is providing financial assistance to the fishermen for construction of new deep sea resource specific fishing vessels, motorization of traditional fishing craft, purchase of safety kits for onboard use, procurement of FRP boats, undertaking fisheries activities as an alternative livelihood, construction of fishermen houses, insurance coverage besides many other fisheries development and welfare activities under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) on Blue Revolution: Integrated Development and Management of Fisheries of this Ministry******
