ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) to (c): The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one Jawahar NavodayaVidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country to provide good quality modern educationincluding a strong component of culture, inculcation of values, awareness of the environment,adventure activities and physical education to the talented children predominantly from therural areas without regard to their family''s socio-economic condition.All the districts (as on 31st May, 2014) of the States/UTs, which have accepted thescheme, have been covered under this scheme. Opening of new JNVs is a continuous processwhich depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government/UT administration tomake available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of the permanent buildingand making available required temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till thepermanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV dependson the availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority.*****
