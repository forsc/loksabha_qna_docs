                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYA NAND RAI)(a)	to (d):  Illegal immigrants enter into the country without valid travel documents in a clandestine and surreptitious manner.  Detection, detention and deportation of such illegally staying foreign nationals is an ongoing process.  Since entry of such foreign nationals into the country is clandestine and surreptitious, it is not possible to collect accurate data of such illegally staying foreign nationals living in various parts of the country and to assess the impact of illegal immigrants on the economy of the country due to their incognito presence.         Central Government has been vested with powers under Section 3(2)(e) and 3(2)(c) of the Foreigners Act,  1946  to detain and deport foreign nationals  staying-2/...-2-LS.US.Q.NO.3732 FOR 17.03.2020illegally in the country. Under Section 5 of The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920, Central Government may also by an Order direct the removal of any person from India who enters India without valid passport.  These powers of the Central Government stand entrusted to all the State Governments since 1958 under Article 258(1) of the Constitution of India.  Similarly, under Article 239(1) of the Constitution of India, the Administrators of all the Union Territories have also been directed to discharge the functions of the Central Government relating to the aforesaid powers since 1958.Consolidated instructions regarding deportation /repatriation of foreign nationals have been issued to all States & UTs on 24.04.2014 and 01.07.2019.Other initiatives taken by the Government to check the influx of illegal immigrants are:(i)   Effective domination of border by carrying out round the clock surveillance by the Borders Guarding Forces.(ii)  Construction of border fencing, roads and floodlighting. (iii)   Setting up of more Border Out Posts (BOPs) along the international borders to reduce the inter BOP distance for effective border domination. (iv) Induction of hi-tech surveillance equipments including night navigation devices.*****
