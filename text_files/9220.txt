                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) & (b)	BharatNet project is being implemented in a phased manner to provide broadband connectivity to all the Gram Panchayats (approx. 2,50,000) in the country. In December 2017, the Phase-I of the BharatNet project was completed by connecting one lakh Gram Panchayats (GPs). A modified strategy to implement BharatNet has been approved by Cabinet on 19.07.2017, which inter alia included the estimated project cost as Rs 42,068 crore and targeted the completion of the project by March 2019.The BharatNet project is under implementation, and as on 22.11.2019, by laying 3,85,754 km Optical Fibre Cable (OFC), a total of 1,42,086 GPs have been connected and out of them, 1,28,990  have been made Service Ready. In addition, 983 GPs have been made Service Ready over satellite media. A total of 2 lakh GPs are targeted to be completed by March 2020.Implementation of BharatNet is very challenging as the project is of mega nature and the GPs are widely dispersed across the country in rural and remote areas. All out efforts are being made to expeditiously implement the project.As of now, no approval has been taken from the Cabinet for upward revision of the project cost for implementation of the BharatNet.(c)	As the BharatNet project is monitored by the Department of Telecommunications, letters have been written to the CMD, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and CMD, Bharat Broadband Network Limited (BBNL) regarding BharatNet Operations & Management and other related issues.  The following steps have been taken for providing stable broadband connectivity from the BharatNet network in Country:•	Network is being monitored through Network Operating Centre (NOC) and its reports are being monitored on a regular basis. •	The Digital Communications Commission (DCC) on 13.06.2019 has approved to award the work of maintenance (i.e. O&M of incremental Optical Fibre Cable network and First Line Maintenance of equipment and supporting infrastructure) in each of  about 1.25 lakh GPs of the BharatNet Phase-I, to CSC e-Governance Services India Limited.•	The Operations & Maintenance (O&M) of BharatNet Phase-II network, is to be carried out mainly through the respective Project Implementation Agencies (PIA).(d)	As per the TRAI Recommendations on “Proliferation of Broadband through Public Wi-Fi Networks” dated 09.03.2017, the World Bank’s World Development Report observed that on an average a 10% increase in internet penetration, is likely to lead to a 1.4% growth in the GDP of an economy. However, the total calculation of the economic loss, suffered by the country due to delay in operationalisation of BharatNet project, seems to be presumptive in nature.For expediting the implementation and operationalisation of the project, the following committees have been constituted for timely resolution of the issues:i)	Empowered Committee under Secretary, DoT.ii)	Steering Committee under Administrator, USOF.iii)	State Level Implementation Committee chaired by Chief Secretary of the State would be set up which would have DoT/USOF/BBNL designated officials as its members.(e)	The transfer and posting of officers is a routine administrative matter in the Department.(f)	As per the information received from BBNL, there is no such report.************
