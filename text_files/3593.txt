ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	and (b)	18 States/Union Territories have issued notifications/orders introducing regulations pertaining to complete ban on plastic carry bags and/or other single-use plastic items. In addition, 5 States/UTs have imposed ban on plastic carry bags of thickness less than 50 microns. The Government of the NCT of Delhi had introduced a manufacture, import, storing, selling and transportation of plastic carry bags in 2012. However, All India Plastic Industries Association filed a petition in the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi for stay. The Hon’ble High Court stayed the matter & transferred the case to Hon’ble NGT in 2016. The Hon’ble NGT passed an interim order wherein the Tribunal issued to ban all plastic carry bags below 50 micron thickness. (c)	The Government has notified Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. As per the Rules, the generators of waste have been mandated to take steps to minimize generation of plastic waste, not to litter the plastic waste, ensure segregated storage of waste at source and handover segregated waste to local bodies or agencies authorised by the local bodies. The rules also mandate the responsibilities of local bodies, gram panchayats, waste generators, retailers and street vendors to manage plastic waste. The rules mandate the producers, importers and brand owners to work out modalities for waste collection system based on the principle of Extended Producer Responsibility.	Further, Hon’ble Prime Minister has announced India’s pledge to Ban all Single-Use Plastic by 2022. In this regard Ministry has issued guidelines and written letters to offices of Central Government and its departments, major PSUs, corporates, etc to prohibit single-use plastic products in their offices.*****
