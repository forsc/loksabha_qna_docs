The Ministry has taken steps for drafting four Labour Codes i.e. the Code on Wages; the Industrial Relations Code, the Occupational Safety, Health & Working Conditions Code & the Code on Social Security by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the relevant provisions of the existing Central Labour Laws.  The 4 Labour Codes address the issues relating to reforms in labour market regulations including statutory minimum wage, social  protection and  healthcare of  workers.  At  present,   the Contd..2/-:: 2 ::Code on Wages, 2019, has been notified on 8th August, 2019 in the Gazette of India.  The rest 3 Codes i.e. the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2019, the Industrial Relations Code, 2019 and the Code on Social Security, 2019 have been introduced in Lok Sabha on 23rd July, 2019, 28th November, 2019 and 11th December, 2019 respectively and subsequently, referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour for examination.

Employment generation coupled with improving employability is the priority of the Government. Government has taken various steps for generating employment in the country like encouraging private sector of economy, fast-tracking various projects involving substantial investment and increasing public expenditure on schemes such as Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) and Deendayal Antodaya Yojana National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM). Promoting entrepreneurship is essential for enabling the youth to productively contribute to the economic development of the country. Accordingly, the Government of India has accorded priority to the entrepreneurship through various measures such as Startup India, Mudra Scheme, etc. so as to train and finance entrepreneurs.
