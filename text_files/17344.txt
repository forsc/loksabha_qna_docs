ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI  & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b) Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has informed that they have neither commissioned nor planned any study to assess environmental impact of restricted human activities on rivers and water bodies.CPCB have also informed that based on water quality monitoring of river Ganga being carried out for pre as well as lockdown period and studies conducted by them, State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) and other agencies to assess the impact of lockdown on the water quality of river Ganga and its tributaries, no definite trend was observed in different water quality parameters for various stretches of river Ganga and its tributaries. However, varying degrees of improvement in a few water quality parameters has been observed as per CPCB & SPCB reports along various stretches of river Ganga and its tributaries, which may be attributed to various factors like increased availability of water due to rainfall in the river catchment, no industrial effluent discharge and reduced human activity such as restriction on bathing, restricted tourism, solid waste dumping, washing of clothes, etc.(c)   No sir.(d) 	 Does not arise.*****
