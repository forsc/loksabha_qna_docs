                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH) (a) to (e):   	Ministry of Power notified Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules, 2020 on 31.12.2020 under the Electricity Act, 2003. These Rules empower the consumers of electricity and emanate from the conviction that the power systems exist to serve the consumers and the consumers have rights to get the reliable services and quality electricity.  An amendment to Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules, 2020 was notified on 29.06.2021 wherein the limit for net metering for solar roof top PV system of a prosumer which includes MSME also, was increased to 500KW from 10KW.****************
