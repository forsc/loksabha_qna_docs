Under this umbrella, the scheme INSPIRE Awards MANAK (Million Minds Augmenting National Aspiration and Knowledge) attracts talented school students at an early age of 10-15 years studying in Class 6-10 to pursue science. One lakh ideas from these students are eligible for INSPIRE Award of Rs. 10000/- each.  In last three years, 801 students from Bihar were given INSPIRE Awards MANAK, which reflects the innovation and creative potential of school students from Bihar.Another component under INSPIRE, Scholarship for Higher Education (SHE) aims to encourage meritorious students to study basic and natural sciences in Bachelor in Science (B.Sc) and Masters in Science (M.Sc) through attractive scholarship and mentorship opportunities. Selections under SHE is based on performance (top 1%) in Class XII examinations of State/Central School Examination Boards and in selected national level competitive examinations like IIT-JEE, etc.  During last year (2019-20), 229 students from Bihar received SHE scholarship, which reflects the merit potential of science students from Bihar.During 27th National Children Science Congress (NCSC), 2019 organized by National Council for Science and Technology Communication (NCSTC), DST at Kerala, 30 school students from Bihar participated to exhibit their creativity and innovation and particularly their ability to solve a societal problem experienced locally using the method of science.Under State Science and Technology Programme (SSTP) of DST, Bihar Council of Science and Technology (BCST) supported,  500  projects  of  Under  Graduate  students  under its Student  Project  Programme (SPP) in 2019-20 to encourage their efforts in science and technology.In order to encourage students for career development in the area of Biotechnology, Department of Biotechnology (DBT), is supporting Postgraduate Teaching Program to ensure high standard of teaching and to generate critical mass of trained manpower in country.
