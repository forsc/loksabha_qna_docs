However, 97 persons have been engaged, on daily wages, on purely temporary basis, for delivery work as per requirement of post offices due to vacant posts. Since, no one has been engaged on contract basis, the question of regularization of service does not arise. Further, vacant posts are filled up as per provisions of the Recruitment Rules.
