                                                    a) the details of National Highway projects running behind their schedule along with the reasons therefor and the extent of cost escalation as a result thereof;(b) the number of projects out of the above that have been put on hold and the number of projects continued due to some budgetary or any other reason; and(c) the steps taken by the Government to prevent such delay and complete the said projects in a stipulated time frame?






ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a)	to (c) There are 566 National Highways projects running behind their schedule however, no project has been put on hold. Delay in completion leads to cost overrun in some projects. These projects are delayed mainly due to land acquisition, utility shifting, non-availability of soil/aggregate, poor performance of contractors, environment/forest/wildlife clearances, ROB & RUB issues with Railways, public agitation for additional facilities, arbitration/contractual disputes with contractors etc. To fast-track these projects, various steps such as streamlining of land acquisition &environment clearances, premium re-scheduling, close coordination with other Ministries, revamping of dispute resolution mechanism, frequent review meetings with project developers, State Government and contractors at various levels etc. have been taken up.*****
