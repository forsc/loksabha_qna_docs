As per the results of PLFS conducted during 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20, the unemployment rate for persons of 15 years and above on usual status basis in the country including Haryana is given at Annexure I.             Employment generation is the priority of the Government. Government of India has taken a number of initiatives for promoting employment generation in the country. Aatmanirbhar Bharat Rojgar Yojana (ABRY) was launched with effect from 1st October, 2020 as part of Aatmanirbhar Bharat package 3.0 to incentivize employers for creation of new employment along with social security benefits and restoration of loss of employment during Covid-19 pandemic. This scheme being implemented through Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), seeks to reduce the financial burden of the employers and encourages them to hire more workers. The terminal date for registration of beneficiaries has been extended from 30.06.2021 to 31.03.2022. As on 20.11.2021, benefit has been provided to 39.43 lakh beneficiaries through 1.15 lakh establishments.            PM-SVANidhi Scheme has facilitated collateral free working capital loan upto Rs.10,000/- for one-year tenure to street vendors, to help them  resume their businesses.            Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) is being implemented by the Government, inter alia, for facilitating self-employment. Under PMMY collateral free loans uptoRs. 10 lakh are extended to micro/small business enterprises and to individuals to enable them to setup or expand their business activities.              In addition, to enhance the employment generation, Government is encouraging various projects involving substantial investment and through public expenditure on schemes like Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), Deen Dayal Antodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM) and Pradhan Mantri Kaushal VikasYojana (PMKVY) run by Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs and Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE), respectively. The details of Employment generated through schemes in the country including Haryana are given in Annexure II.             Besides these initiatives, the flagship programmes of the Government such as Make in India, Digital India, Smart City Mission, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, Housing for All, Infrastructure development and Industrial corridors and Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme are also oriented to generate productive employment opportunities.*****
