ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c) : The retail prices of pulses as on December, 2, 2021, have either declined or remained stable in comparison with the retail prices in the previous week, previous month and previous year, except for masur dal which has recorded an increase over the previous year.(d)       : Government takes various measures from time to time to augment domestic availability and stabilize prices of pulses and other essential food commodities. These steps, inter-alia, include releases from the buffer to cool down prices, imposition of stock limits, monitoring of stocks declared by entities to prevent hoarding as also requisite changes in trade policy instruments like rationalization of import duty, changes in import quota, restrictions on exports of the commodity etc.  In May, 2021 advisories were issued to States/UTs to monitor prices of essential food commodities and to ensure disclosure of pulses stocks held by millers, importers and traders under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955.  Imposition of stock limit on all pulses except Moong was notified on 2.7.21. Thereafter, an amended order was issued on 19.7.21 imposing stock limits on four pulses, namely, Tur, Urad, Masur, Chana for a period up to 31.10.2021. To improve availability and stabilise prices of pulses, Government has allowed import of Tur, Urad and Moong under ‘Free category’ w.e.f  May 15, 2021 till October 31,2021 in order to ensure smooth and seamless imports. The Free regime in respect of Tur and Urad has been extended; the last date for Bill of Lading is December 31, 2021 and for Customs clearance, it is January 31, 2022. This policy measure has been supported with facilitation measures and close monitoring of its implementation by the concerned Departments/organisations. The import policy measures have resulted in substantial increase in import of Tur, Urad and Moong as compared to the corresponding period for the past two years. In order to soften the impact of higher international prices on domestic consumers, the government reduced the import duty on Masur from 30% to 10% from 27th July, 2021. To augment the availability of pulses in the market, 3 Lakh Metric Ton of Chana stock has been released between June and August, 2021 and to curb speculation, futures trading in Chana has been suspended from 16th August, 2021. Supply of pulses from the buffer to State Governments has also been done on an ongoing basis for their nutrition and welfare programmes to stabilise prices.Further, the Government has issued advisory to States/UTs to set up the State-level Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) corpus with central assistance. Central share has already been released to six States and these States have been requested to make appropriate interventions with the fund for cooling down retail prices of essential food commodities.*****
