ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OFSCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND EARTH SCIENCES(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a) Sir, the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) is a consortium of 28 genomesequencing laboratories of the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Department of Science andTechnology (DST), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHF&W), Council of Scientificand Industrial Research (CSIR), Ministry of Education, Indian Council of Medical Research(ICMR) and State Governments. The overall aim of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 GenomicsConsortium is to monitor the genomic variations in the SARS-CoV-2 in India.(b) As per ICMR database there are 1,88,26,913 individuals registered as Covid-19 positivebetween 20-12-2020 to 19-07-2021. Since the inception of INSACOG till now the INSACOGhas sequenced 57,476 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Out of these, 44,334 samples have been analyzedand assigned Pangolin lineage classification and submitted to the National Centre for DiseaseControl (NCDC) for public health correlation.(c) The present sampling strategy does not mandate sequencing 5% of RT-PCR positive samples.The sampling strategy is to sequence 15 samples from every sentinel site in every 15 days fromeach state so that districts are represented from an epidemiological point of view. This is a morediverse sampling strategy as against a random 5% sample sequencing. Also, this is a dynamicprocess and quantum of SARS- CoV-2 genome sequencing depends on the positivity rate, whichhas currently decreased. Efforts in terms of expansion of INSACOG by onboarding moreinstitutes have also been undertaken.*****
