ANSWER




(a) to (b): National  Crime  Records  Bureau  (NCRB)  compiles  and  publishes information on crimes in its publication “Crime in India” which is available on the website  of  NCRB  (https://ncrb.gov.in).  The published reports are available till the year 2020. As per information received from NCRB, the number of cases registered under the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 during 2018, 2019 and 2020 are 12826, 13307 and 10366 respectively. Further, the cases registered under Dowry Deaths during these years are 7167, 7141 and 6966 respectively. The data shows a decline in number of cases both under the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 and Dowry Deaths in the year 2020 over the years 2018 and 2019. (c) :     The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 and the Indian Penal Code (IPC) have adequate provisions to tackle the menace.  Presently, there is no proposal to amend the Act further. (d) :    ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and the responsibility to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens including investigation and prosecution of crime against women rests primarily with the respective State Governments.Further, the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 prohibits and penalizes giving or taking of dowry so as to safeguard women against dowry harassment and the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 which defines dowry harassment within the purview of domestic violence and provides remedies such as protection order, residential order etc. against it. The Ministry undertakes awareness exercise for safety and security of women from time to time. Further, the Government, through institutions like the National Commission for Women and State Women Commissions have been spreading awareness through seminars, workshops etc. to sensitize people about the evils of dowry system, about the various provisions of related laws etc. *****
