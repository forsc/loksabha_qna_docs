                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)	   Flood management schemes are formulated and implemented by concerned State Governments as per their priority. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. Government of India launched “Flood Management Programme (FMP)” during XI Plan period for providing central assistance to the State Governments for taking up works related to river management, flood control, anti-erosion, drainage development, flood proofing works, restoration of damaged flood management works and anti-sea erosion works which was continued during XII Plan. Subsequent to XII Plan a scheme viz. “Flood Management and Border Areas Programme (FMBAP)” with an outlay of Rs.3342 crores is under implementation for the period 2017-18 to 2019-20. FMBAP Scheme is a merger of two ongoing Schemes of this Ministry during XII Plan viz. Flood Management Programme (FMP) and River Management Activities and Works related to Border Areas (RMBA). Central Assistance amounting to Rs. 924.40 crores has been released to State Government of Bihar under FMP component till date. (b)	 to (d)  Currently, the Flood forecasting & Early Warning System of rivers flowing from Nepal to India is in place. Government of India is having continuous dialogue with the Government of Nepal at various levels to mitigate devastation caused by the floods from the rivers coming from Nepal. The management of floods due to these rivers has been a concern. The related issues are discussed in the existing Indo-Nepal bilateral three tier mechanisms comprising of (i) Joint Ministerial Level Commission on Water Resources (JMCWR), (ii) Joint Committee on Water Resources (JCWR) and (iii) Joint Standing Technical Committee (JSTC). Government of India has been regularly interacting with the Government of Nepal for construction of dams on these rivers for mutual benefit of the two countries which includes flood control. Broad outcomes of the dialogues mechanism are given below:  i) 	Pancheshwar Development Authority (PDA) has been set up jointly by India and Nepal for execution, operation and maintenance of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project on river Sharda. The draft final DPR of the project has been prepared by M/s WAPCOS Limited. Implementation of Pancheshwar Project is expected to pave way for other projects in Nepal. ii) 	Survey and investigation including preparation of DPRs of Sapta Kosi High dam Project and Sun Kosi Storage-cum- Diversion scheme proposed in the Sapta Kosi basin in Nepal has been undertaken jointly by India and Nepal. *****
