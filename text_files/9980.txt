All the states were eligible for NCEF support. Subsequently, the Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 which has been notified in April 2017, provides that coal cess, along with some other cess would constitute Goods and Services Tax (GST) Compensation Fund and the same would be utilized to compensate the States for five years for potential losses on account of GST implementation. State wise data of NCEF collection and schemes funded from NCEF is not maintained by Department of Expenditure. For specific requirement of States on renewable energy and peak power, the concerned administrative Ministries/Departments take appropriate action under concerned schemes implemented by them.                                             ***
