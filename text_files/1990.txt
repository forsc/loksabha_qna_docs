Also, during the same period, 253.4 Km length of New Line  & 346.93 Km length of Doubling  got commissioned in the State  and the total Budget Outlay during the same period  was ` 9699 crores for the State.	Total 16 Railway Electrification projects of 3,379 route kilometers, costing ` 3,772 crores are in different stages of planning/execution in the State of Karnataka. Upto March 2019,  386  route kilometers have been commissioned on electric traction. The details of all works in progress and new works including funds spent on each project, allotment of funds and expenditure are made available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in >Ministry of Railways >Railway Board >About Indian Railways >Railway Board Directorates >Finance(Budget) >2019-20_List_of_Works  and are also available in Pink Books presented before the House along with Budget every year.(c): 12 Nos. New Line projects falling fully/partly in the State of Karnataka require 19892.69  acre land,  out of which, so far, only 4507.83 acre land has been handed over to Railways & 15384.86 acre land is still balance, which is yet to be acquired and handed over to Railways by the Government of Karnataka. (e) and (f): The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground & over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological & topographical conditions of area, law & order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions  of working agencies/contractors etc. & all these factors affects the completion cost of the project, which is finally worked out at the completion stage.In the overall interest of the Nation and to ensure that projects are completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, Divisional level, Zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues obstructing the progress of projects.To ensure that projects are completed even before time. Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects.        For important projects, capacity enhancement projects, last mile connectivity etc. institutional financing has been done by arranging loan from M/s Life Insurance Corporation of India Limited for ` 1.5 lakh crores, which has increased Railways’ capacity for committed fund provision for essential projects.*****
