ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): A Statement is laid on the table of the House.Statement referred to in the reply to parts (a) to (c) of the Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 210 regarding "International connectivity of Madurai Airport" to be answered on 05.03.2020;;  (a) to (c): Under the bilateral air service agreement between India and Sri Lanka, Madurai was granted as a point of call to the designated airlines of Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan airlines is currently operating 7 frequencies per week on Madurai-Colombo sector. Also, all the designated Indian carriers are free to mount operations from Madurai to foreign destinations under the ambit of bilateral air service agreements concluded by India with foreign countries as per mutually agreed capacity limits. Indian carriers are presently operating 21 frequencies per week from Madurai out of which 7 frequencies per week are on Madurai-Colombo sector, 7 frequencies per week on Madurai-Singapore sector and 7 frequencies per week on Madurai-Dubai sector.  Further, the grant of any point as a point of call to foreign airlines is based on terms of reciprocity and balance of benefits. Presently, there is an imbalance in this regard in favour of foreign airlines in a large number of Air Services Agreements. As per current practice, the points other than metros are not being granted to foreign countries so that the hubs may be created within India and not outside of India. The Government provides a conducive environment for the growth of the civil aviation sector, however, Government does not interfere in the operational plan of the airlines.
