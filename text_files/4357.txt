No deaths could be attributed to overcrowding in trains including local sub-urban trains in megacities except 05 reported in year 2018 over Chennai Division of Southern Railway (Tamilnadu State).(b):  The following measures including infrastructural measure are being taken by Railways to reduce accidents due to overcrowding in local suburban trains:-(i) 	Indian Railways, subject to operational and availability of resources, endeavors to cater to the travelling needs and augment the carrying capacity of sub-urban sectors by introducing new services and by augmenting to the loads of existing train services. Accordingly, during the year 2018-19, 54 new services of 12 car, 2 new services of 15 car & 1 service of 8 car have been introduced on the suburban sectors of Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai. Besides, 96 services have been augmented from 9 cars to 12 cars and 4 services from 12 cars to 15 cars, during the same period.(ii)	The centre grab poles which are slippery are replaced by knurling type grab pole in Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP) Phase I & II rakes for better grip in order to prevent incidents of falling passengers from local trains.(iii)	One fully air conditioned EMU rake is already running in Western Railway having automatic door closing system thereby enhancing public safety. It has been decided to induct more such air conditioned EMU rakes based on traffic projections and also under MUTP-III and        MUTP-III A. (iv)	Regular announcements are made through Passenger Address System at Railway stations urging passengers not to board/de-board in moving trains.(v)	Various awareness campaigns are organized by Railways to sensitize passengers to avoid foot-board travelling due to overcrowding. (c) and (d): There is a well established system of inspection of bridges on Indian Railways. All the bridges are inspected twice a year, one before the onset of monsoon by supervisors and one detailed inspection after the monsoon by officers. In addition, certain bridges are also inspected more frequently depending upon their condition. Repair/ strengthening/ rehabilitation/ rebuilding of railway bridges is a continuous process and is undertaken in a planned way whenever so warranted by their physical condition as ascertained during these inspections. All bridges are safe for train movement at permitted speed. During the last five years     (2014-15 to 2018-19), a total 4032 bridges have been repaired/ strengthened/ rehabilitated/ rebuilt on Indian Railways. As on 01.04.2019, a total of 4168 bridges have been sanctioned for repair/ strengthening/ rehabilitation etc. on Indian Railways.*****
