                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b) Nipah Virus disease have focal and local presentation previously reported in 2001 from West Bengal and recently in the year 2018 and 2019 in Kerala. Details are placed below:Month /Year	Location	No. of Cases	No. of DeathsFeb 2001	Siliguri (West Bengal)	66	45April 2007	Nadia (West Bengal)	5	5May* 2018	Kozhikode and Mallapuram (Kerala)	19*	17May 2019	Ernakulam (Kerala)	1	0*Index case was not lab confirmed.                Seasonal Influenza A (H1N1) previously known as swine flu is a routine occurrence in the country with seasonal upsurges. The State wise number of cases and deaths due to H1N1 is paced at Annexure I.          State-wise Chikungunya cases reported in the country during the last three years are enclosed at Annexure II. Till date, there is no death reported by any States/UTs directly attributable to Chikungunya.          As per National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research-National Cancer Registry Programme data, there has been an increase in estimated incidence of cancer cases in the country. The estimated number of incidence of cancer cases during the last three years, State/UT- wise is at Annexure III.              The estimated incidence of Tuberculosis in India has been declining over the years. From 289 in the year 2000 it has come down to 204 per lakh population for the year 2017, as per the Global TB report 2018. India accounts for 27.4 lakh estimated new TB cases annually, which is the highest in terms of absolute numbers. However, in terms of incidence of Tuberculosis per lakh population, India ranks 35th in the world.               The State/UT wise number of TB patients’ notification and deaths for the last three years is enclosed at Annexure IV.(c) & (d):     Eradication refers to the complete and permanent worldwide reduction to zero new cases of the disease through deliberate efforts. In case of Nipah virus and H1N1 seasonal influenza it cannot be eradicated due to the virus reservoir in bats and birds respectively. However both the disease can be controlled and contained.                Government of India (GOI) has taken the following steps to prevent Chikungunya in the country during 2019:•	GoI provided Technical Guidelines for prevention and control, case management & effective community participation to the States for implementation.•	Conducted trainings for capacity Building of doctors on case management. •	Monitoring and supervision for early case detection and prevention and control.•	Till date, 7 advisories have been issued and 5 reviews held.•	Free diagnostic facilities are provided through 673 Sentinel Surveillance Hospitals (SSHs) and 16 Apex Referral Laboratories (ARLs) identified across the country.•	GOI supplied 631 chikungunya IgM tests kits (1 Kit=96 tests) through NIV, Pune till date.•	Conduct of IEC/BCC activities to disseminate knowledge for prevention and control.                    The treatment of Cancer in many of States and Central Government institutions is free for BPL patients and subsidized for others. The Central Government supplements the efforts of the State Governments to prevent and control cancer and to provide affordable and accessible care. Some of the steps taken by Central Government are as follows:(i)	The objectives of National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) being implemented under National Health Mission (NHM) for interventions upto the district level includes awareness generation for Cancer prevention, screening, early detection and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. For Cancer, the focus is on three Cancers namely breast, cervical and oral.  (ii)	To enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer, the Central Government is implementing Tertiary Care Cancer Centre Scheme to support setting up of State Cancer Institutes (SCI) and Tertiary Care Cancer Centres (TCCC) in different parts of the country. 35 proposals for setting up of SCIs and TCCCs have been approved.
