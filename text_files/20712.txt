ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)& (b) The Central Government launched a decision support system (DSS) viz. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) on 17th February 2015, which provides site specific information on air quality in near real time and its forecast for the next 24 hours.The SAFAR observational network of Air Quality Monitoring Stations (AQMS) and Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) established within city limits represents selected microenvironments of the city including industrial, residential, background/ cleaner, urban complex, agricultural zones etc. as per international guidelines which ensures the true representation of city environment. The data quality is controlled and the project SAFAR is ISO 9001-2008 accredited and recognized by World Meteorological Organisation (GURME Programme) that establishes the credibility and the veracity of data.(c) The SAFAR system is developed by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, along with ESSO partner institutions namely India Meteorological Department (IMD) and National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF). The implementation of SAFAR is made possible with an active collaboration with local municipal corporations and various local educational institutions and governmental agencies in that Metro city. (d) & (e) Following pilot projects were deployed in Delhi for evaluation of air pollution mitigation technologies:•	Ambient air purification through Wind Augmentation and Purification Units (WAYUs) for pollution abatement at traffic intersections and Pariyayantra filtration units on 30 buses was evaluated. Though minimal improvement in ambient air quality was observed, however, WAYU may be explored for providing improved air quality at localised levels. •	Application of dust suppressant -The effectiveness of the dust suppressant lasted up to 6 hours after which it had to be reapplied. About 30% reduction in dust concentrations was observed up to 6 hours. Advisory has been issued to State Boards to use dust suppressant.•	Research projects are carried out by CPCB in collaboration with premier institutions like IIT, NEERI, etc. under Environment Protection Charge (EPC) funds. •	Regular engagements with technical bodies and experts have been undertaken for knowledge sharing.***
