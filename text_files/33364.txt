(c)        Above reply (b) may be referred to. (d)        Yes, Sir. Under PMKVY, placement opportunities are being provided to Short Term Training (STT) certified candidates, while Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) does not mandate placements as it recognizes the existing skills of candidate. Under PMKVY-STT (since inception, i.e., 2015 till 31.12.2021), 53.89 lakh candidates have been certified; out of which, 23.70 lakh candidates have been provided with the placement in various sectors across the country. The state-wise details are given at Annexure III. (e)        Based on the evaluation studies and learning from the implementation of PMKVY 1.0 and 2.0, Ministry has launched the new and modified version of PMKVY, i.e., PMKVY 3.0 (2020-21) on 15.01.2021. Under the PMKVY 3.0, the informed choices / aspirations of the candidates have been given primacy and it promotes candidates to opt for local skills with local jobs. Demand-driven with bottom-up approach has been adopted under PMKVY 3.0. District Skill Committee (DSCs) is the focal point for implementation of PMKVY 3.0 at the district level. The DSCs are entrusted with district level skill gap and demand assessment, mobilization and counselling of candidates, formation of training batches, post training support and provide handholding support to the candidates after placements, besides addressing the grievances, if any. Further, to improve the monitoring, District Skill Committee (DSC) is being involved and entrusted with the monitoring under PMKVY 3.0. DSC acts as an on-ground monitoring agency for conducting inspection of TCs. (f)        The PMKVY (except PMKVY 1.0 (2015-16) has two components, namely,  Central component being implemented through National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), and State component being implemented through State Skill Development Mission of the State/UT. Under Central component of PMKVY, there is no provision of State-wise funds allocation. Since inception of the PMKVY, i.e., 2015, as on 31.12.2021, an amount of Rs. 8,590.29 crore has been disbursed to implementing agency, i.e., NSDC towards the implementation of the scheme. Under the State component of PMKVY, funds and corresponding physical targets have been allocated to the States for the implementation of scheme through State Skill Development Missions (SSDMs). Since incorporation of State component, i.e., 2016, as on 31.12.2021, an amount of Rs. 1,224.82 crore has been disbursed to States for the implementation of the scheme. The State-wise funds allocated, disbursed and utilized by the State under PMKVY 2.0 and PMKVY 3.0, as on 31.12.2021, is given at Annexure IV. There is no provision of state-wise allocation of funds for imparting training under JSS and ITI.  (g)        Yes, Sir. All schemes of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship are for the skill development of youth including women. The Ministry has undertaken several initiatives to achieve women empowerment through skill development. The National Policy on Skill Development and Entrepreneurship focuses on inclusive skill development, with the objective of increased women participation for better economic productivity. Under PMKVY, in order to increase the participation of women, conveyance cost and boarding & lodging facilities are being provided. Further, the priority group under JSS includes women. Under long term skilling, ITIs exclusively of women have been set up across the country. In addition, 30% of the seats in general ITIs are reserved for women trainees subject to the general reservation policy of the respective State.
