ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) to (c):	Based on structural audit, dismantling of the existing ESI hospital building was recommended.  However, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has denied to issue No Objection Certificate  for carrying out renovations as the hospital is within the protected monuments zone.Alternative site consisting of 5 acres of land for construction of new hospital has been offered by the Government of Odisha at Village Kanheipur, Tehsil Tangi-Choudwar. Though this site is outside the ASI protected monuments zone, but it is situated at a distance of 11 km. from the existing hospital.  Therefore, the Government of Odisha has been requested to provide 5 acres of land just outside the ASI protected area and closer to the existing ESI Hospital, Choudwar, as most of the Insured Persons reside in the vicinity of the existing hospital.*******
