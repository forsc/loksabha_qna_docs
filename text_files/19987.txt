                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a): 	In addition to the  entitlement under National Food Security Act(NFSA) to 81.35 crore persons to avail foodgrains at highly subsidized rates, Government of India (GoI) under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), allocated food-grains @ 5 kg per person per month free of cost for all the beneficiaries covered under Targeted Public Distribution System (Antyodaya Anna Yojana & Priority Households) for a period of 3 months i.e. April-June, 2020. It was extended for a further period of 5 months i.e. up to November, 2020. Further, under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Package (ANBP), this Department made allocation of about total 8 LMT of foodgrains to all the States/UTs for migrants/stranded migrants, who are neither covered under National Food Security Act (NFSA) nor State own Scheme under TPDS, @ 5 kg per person per month free of cost for a period of two months (May & June, 2020).........2/--2-  	To address anemia and micro-nutrient deficiency in the country, Government of India approved Centrally Sponsored Pilot Scheme on "Fortification of Rice & its Distribution under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS)" for a period of 3 years beginning in 2019-20 with total outlay of Rs 174.64 Cr..  The Pilot Scheme is intended to focus on 15 Districts across 15 states, preferably 1 District per State. The scheme is funded by the Government of India in the ratio of 90:10 in respect of North-Eastern, Hilly and Island States and in the ratio of 75:25 in respect of the rest of the States. Fifteen State Governments i.e. Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand & Madhya Pradesh have consented and identified their respective Districts (1 District Per State) for implementation of the Pilot Scheme. So far, Six states namely of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh & Uttar Pradesh have started distribution of fortified rice under the Pilot Scheme.   Mid-Day Meal (MDM) and ICDS are covered under the provisions of NFSA.Ministry of Women and Child Development & Department of School Education and Literacy had agreed to bear the Incremental Cost (Rs 0.73/Kg) for fortification of rice under ICDS and MDM respectively.The procurement policy of Government of India (GOI) is open ended, under which paddy and wheat offered by farmers within the stipulated period (conforming to specifications prescribed in advance by GOI) are purchased for Central Pool at Minimum Support Price (MSP) by Food Corporation of India/ State Governments/State Government Agencies to help farmers get remunerative price and prevent distress sale. However, if any producer/farmer gets better price in comparison to MSP, he/she is free to sell his/her produce in open market. Minimum Support Price operations are given wide publicity through pamphlets, banners, sign boards, radio, TV and advertisements through print & electronic media. Coarsegrains are procured at MSP by State Governments as per the procurement plan prepared in consultation with FCI and approved by the Central Government, subject to its distribution by the State Government under National Food Security Act (NFSA)/Other Welfare Schemes (OWS).............3/--3-(b) & (c): 	The National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) provides a legal entitlement to 81.35 crore persons to avail foodgrains at highly subsidized rates. The Act provides for coverage of 75% of the rural and 50% of the urban population, i.e. about two-thirds of the total population of the country, for receiving foodgrains at highly subsidized prices of Rs.3/2/1 per kg for rice/ wheat/ coarsegrains respectively. The Act also has a provision for food security allowance to entitled beneficiaries in case of non-supply of entitled foodgrains or meals subject to conditions. Accordingly, Government has notified Food Security Allowance Rules, 2015. In addition to this, the Act provides that pregnant women and lactating mothers and children in the age group of 6 months to 14 years are entitled to meals as per prescribed nutritional norms under Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and Mid-Day Meal (MDM) schemes. Higher nutritional norms are prescribed for malnourished children upto 6 years of age.                                            ****
