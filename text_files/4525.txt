The total length of such notified NHs have been enhanced from about 91,287 km as on 31.03.2014 to about 1,32,500 km at present.	The Ministry approved “In-Principle” declaration of about 71,898 km length of State roads as NHs since April, 2014 subject to outcome of their Detailed Project Reports (DPRs). The State/ Union Territories (UTs)-wise details of these are annexed.	Out of these, about 19,170 km length of State roads have been notified as NHs as per Section 2 of the National Highways Act, 1956.	The Ministry considers declaration of some State roads as NHs, through publication of notification in the Official Gazette as per Section 2 of the National Highways Act, 1956, from time to time based on requirement of connectivity, inter-se priority and availability of funds, etc. The same is also applicable for State Roads approved “In-Principle” as NHs.
