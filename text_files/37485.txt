ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (c)  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.4506 BY SHRI NARENDRA KUMAR TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 30.03.2022 REGARDING RAISING HEIGHT OF RAILWAY PLATFORMS(a)  to (c) At present, Railway stations are categorized as Non Suburban Grade (NSG)-1 to NSG6, Suburban Grade (SG)-1 to SG3 and Halt Grade(HG)-1 to HG3. Surajgarh, Chirawa, Nawalgarh, Mukundgarh, Nua and Bissan are NSG-6 category railway stations haivng medium level platforms.Considering the safety aspects, it has been decided to provide railway stations with High Level Platforms irrespective of its category of station on Broad Gauge which was not the case earlier, as only erstwhile ‘A1’, ‘A’ & ‘C’ category stations were provided with High Level platforms. However, priority are accorded to higher category of station over lower category of station while sanctioning and executing the work of raising the height of platforms.  Timelines for execution of these works can not be indicated at this stage.*****
