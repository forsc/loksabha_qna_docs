                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b): As per the Annual Report of Central Pollution Control Board, in 2019-20, the total quantity of solid waste generated in the country was 150761 Tonnes PerDay (TPD) of which 145957TPD of waste was collected,of which, 70881 TPD of waste was treated and 40952 TPD waslandfilled. The state-wise status on solid waste management is given at Annexure. As per Solid Waste Management (SWM) Rules 2016, every waste generator has to segregate and store solid waste in three separate streams namely bio-degradable, non-biodegradable and domestic hazardous wastes and handover segregated wastes to authorised waste pickers or waste collectors as per the direction or notification by the local authorities from time to time. Under Swachh Bharat Mission, 100 % door to door collection is being practised in 86,972 wards in the country.(c): There are two Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators related to Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change for Goal 12 viz. (i) SDG 12.4.1: Whether the country has ratified international Multilateral Environmental Agreements on hazardous waste and other chemicals and (ii) SDG 12.4.2: (a) Hazardous waste generated per capita; and (b) proportion of hazardous waste treated, by type of treatment. As per the latest version of SDG National Indicator Framework (NIF), the progress of India for both the SDG is in positive direction. India has reduced the generation of per capita hazardous waste to 189.47(MT/person) from 201.45 (MT/person) in 2018-19 as compared to 2017-18 and the proportion of hazardous waste treated has increased to 0.56 from 0.51 in 2018-19 as compared to 2017-18.(d) & (e): As per Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, the Central Pollution Control Board prepares and submits the annual report on the implementation of these rules to the Ministry based upon the information received from State Pollution Control Board/Pollution Control Committee.
