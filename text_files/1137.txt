                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (c) Ground water levels in various parts of the Country are declining because of continuous withdrawal due to reasons such as increased demand of fresh water for various uses, vagaries of rainfall, increased population, industrialization & urbanization etc.  Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) carries out ground water monitoring four times a year in different States.  In order to assess the declining/rising trend in water level on a long-term basis, pre-monsoon water level data 2018 has been compared with the decadal average (2008-2017) water level.  Analysis of data indicates decline in ground water level in about 52% of the wells being monitored. State-wise details including Bihar are given in Annexure I.        The annual replenishable ground water resource of the country is also being estimated jointly by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and State Governments at periodical intervals. As per the 2013 assessment, out of the total 6584 assessment units (Block/ Taluks/ Mandals/ watersheds/ Firkas) in the Country, 1034 units in 17 States/UTs have been categorized as ‘Over-exploited’ where ground water extraction is more than net ground water availability and there is significant long-term decline in water levels. 253 units have been categorized as ‘Critical’, 681 units as ‘Semi-Critical’ and 4520 units as ‘Safe’. State wise details are at Annexure II.        Further, water being a State subject, efforts to conserve and manage ground water is primarily States’ responsibility. However, other steps taken by the Central Government to control ground water depletion are at the following URL: http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf.*****ANNEXURE  IAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) to (c) of Unstarred Question No. 1061 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 27.06.2019 regarding “Groundwater Management”S.
