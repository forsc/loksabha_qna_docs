ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	Forest Survey of India (FSI), Dehradun, an organization under the Ministry carries out the assessment of forest and tree cover of the country biennially and findings are published in India State of Forest Report (ISFR).  The definition of the term “Forest Cover” in the ISFR is as given below, which includes plantation:-“All lands, more than 1 hectare in area, with a tree canopy density of more than 10 percent irrespective of ownership and legal status. Such lands may not necessarily be a recorded forest area. It also includes orchards, bamboo and palm.”(b) to (d)  Forests in general act as net carbon sink and contribute to mitigation action. As per India’s second Biennial Update Reports (BUR), about 12% of the country’s Green House Gas emissions are offset by the forestry sector. The Forest Survey of India estimates carbon stock of forest by using National Forest Inventory data collected during forest inventory and forest cover area following the guidelines given by United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The carbon stock for 2017 has been estimated to be 7083 million tones. There is an increase of 39 million tonnes of carbon stock as compared to the estimates of previous assessment. The average annual increase of carbon stock is worked out to be around 35 million tones. ********
