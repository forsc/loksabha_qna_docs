ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF TEXTILES  (SMT. DARSHANA JARDOSH)(a) to (c):	Investment in the textile sector is by and large in the private sector. Financial assistance in the form of grants-in-aid is provided by Government of India to the eligible textiles/handloom/handicrafts agencies/weavers/artisans for raw materials, purchase of looms and accessories, design innovation, product diversification, infrastructure development, skill upgradation, marketing in domestic as well as overseas markets. As such, no state-wise investments data is maintained by Government of India. 	Textile sector is largely an unorganized sector and which is also scattered in rural areas of the country. The role of the government is to create a conducive environment and provide enabling conditions for textile manufacturing in the country through its various textile schemes aimed at promotion/upgradation of textile industries/units. No specific data of textile sick industries is available. 	However, recently, the government has taken following major initiatives/ measures to help ameliorate the conditions in textile sector to boost production, marketing and job opportunities in the sector on pan-India:i)	In order to make the textile sector competitive by rebating all taxes/levies in international market, Government has also given its approval for continuation of Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) on exports of Apparel/Garments and Made-ups till 31st March 2024. The other textiles products which are not covered under the RoSCTL shall be eligible to avail the benefits under Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) along with other products. The remission of duty and tax under RoSCTL and RoDTEP scheme will make our products cost competitive in the international markets.ii)	To boost exports in MMF sector, Government has removed anti-dumping duty on PTA (Purified Terephthalic Acid), a key raw material for the manufacture of MMF fibre and yarn and also on Acrylic fibre, a raw material for yarn and knitwear industry. iii)	Union Budget 2021-22 announcements include launch of the scheme of setting up mega investment textile parks. Seven mega textile parks will be set up in next three years. These parks will enable the textile industry to become globally competitive, attract large investment and boost employment generation. The scheme will enable creation of global champions in exports.iv)	The Production Linked Investment scheme of Rs 10,683 crore over a five-year period covering MMF and Technical Textiles sector has been announced which will create global champions in exports and domestic production in textile sector will also grow substantially.		In addition, Government is implementing various policy initiatives and schemes for supporting the development of textile industry viz. the Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (A-TUFS), Schemes for the development of the Powerloom Sector(Power-Tex), Schemes for Technical Textiles, Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP), Scheme for Additional Grant for Apparel Manufacturing Units under SITP (SAGAM),  SAMARTH- The Scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector (SCBTS), Jute (ICARE- Improved Cultivation and Advanced Retting Exercise), Integrated Processing Development Scheme (IPDS), Silk Samagra, National Handloom Development Programme, National Handicraft Development Programme, Integrated Wool Development Programme (IWDP), North East Region Textiles Promotion Scheme (NERTPS), National Technical Textile Mission, Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (ROSCTL), Scheme for Production and Employment  Linked Support for Garmenting Units (SPELSGU) etc. ***
