                                                        (a) :    Details of the funds released under the Scheme of Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) during the last five years, State-wise, are given at Annexure-I.  (b) :  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is implementing the scheme of ‘Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)’ specifically for all the 75 identified PVTGs among Scheduled Tribes in 18 States and Union Territory of Andaman & Nicobar Island, including Andhra Pradesh. The scheme aims at socio-economic development of PVTGs in a comprehensive manner, while retaining their culture and heritage. The financial assistance is provided to the States/UT under the scheme for the activities like education, housing, land distribution, land development, agricultural development, animal husbandry, construction of link roads, installation of non-conventional sources of energy for lighting purpose, social security or any other innovative activity meant for the comprehensive socio-economic development of PVTGs. All 18 State Governments and the Union Territory of A&N Island are expected to prepare a long term ‘Conservation-cum-Development (CCD) Plan’ for each PVTG based on requirement assessed through Baseline and other specific surveys conducted by them, thus the projects undertaken  under the scheme is essentially state specific and need based.  During the pandemic, Government has taken concerted efforts for the welfare of  PVTGs to ameliorate the difficulties faced by them through various project activities implemented under the Scheme directed at addressing the problems in areas such as health, education and livelihood, etc.   Besides this scheme, other schemes of the Ministry meant for tribal population and schemes of other Ministries and State Government also benefit PVTG communities. Steps have also been taken by the Govt. of Andhra Pradesh through implementing various welfare programs which includes cash disbursals through DBT mode which facilitates the PVTGs to enhance their spending capacity for their livelihoods. (c) :      Does not arise. (d)  :   Details are given at Annexure-II.      (e):       Does not arise.
