ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) & (b) Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs), including KVs in the State of Tamil Nadu, have libraries and laboratories. However, in those KVs functioning in temporary building, including 03 newly opened Vidyalayas in Tamil Nadu, separate space for libraries and laboratories are not available, but the activities are conducted in the classrooms. The State/UT-wise details of KVs, including Tamilnadu, which do not have separate space for libraries and laboratories, are annexed.(c) & (d) e-Granthalaya, a digital platform developed by National Informatics Centre provides a complete ICT solution with integrated library management software, a digital library module and cloud hosting environment. e-Granthalaya software has been installed in the libraries of the KVs in the country. e-Granthalaya software is being used for issue and receipt of library books and maintenance of records of books in digital mode. Science Laboratories in 928 KVs are equipped with modernised laboratory equipments. Upgradation and modernization of laboratories in the KVs is a continuous process and the work is taken up in a phased manner as per requirement.*****
