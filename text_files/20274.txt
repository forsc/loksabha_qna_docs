ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c) All lanes of all the fee plazas of National Highways are equipped with FASTag system.  However, to facilitate movement of over-sized vehicles, one lane on each side has been kept as hybrid lane, which accepts cash. Queues arise in ‘FASTag lanes’ at fee plazas due to vehicles not fitted with “FASTag” or vehicles without valid, functional “FASTag” entering into it. In the hybrid lane, which accepts cash, queues arise because of non-FASTag vehicles. (d) The Government has mandated fitment of FASTag in M&N Categories of motor vehicles sold before 1st December, 2017 w.e.f. 01.01.2021. GSR 298(E) dated the 15th May, 2020, notified that vehicles not fitted with “FASTag” or vehicles without valid, functional “FASTag” have to pay double the applicable fee upon entering a FASTag lane at the fee plaza. Further, GSR 523(E) dated the 24th August, 2020, notified that fee payable towards discounts as under sub-rules (2), (3) and (3A) of rule 9 of the National Highways Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008, shall be paid through pre-paid instruments, smart card or through FASTag or on board unit (transponder) or any other such device.*****
