                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH ANDFAMILY WELFARE(DR BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (d): Avian influenza refers to the disease caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses. These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. Avian flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with avian flu viruses have occurred.  India encountered the first outbreak of H5N1 in the year 2006 in Maharashtra, Gujarat & Madhya Pradesh in poultry followed by subsequent outbreaks in the following years. This year, infections of both the HPAI viruses A/H5N8 and A/H5N1 in several Indian states have been reported since January 2021 onwards.  An 11-year-old boy was detected to be positive for Avian Influenza and died at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi in July 2021. This is the first human case of bird flu recorded in the country.Union Ministry of Health provides required technical support to states/UTs for management of avian influenza. In the year 2021, 7 multi-disciplinary teams were sent from Centre to 6 States namely Gujarat, Maharashtra, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana reporting cases of Bird flu/avian influenza. Teams have assisted the State Health authorities in containment and control activities.Contingency plan for management of human cases of Avian Influenza, Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare was published in 2005.  Department of Animal Husbandry issued the updated National Action Plan for Prevention, Control and Containment of Avian Influenza in 2021 and circulated the same to all states/UTs.NIV has strengthened 6 ICMR VRDL laboratories (at Jodhpur, Tanda, Ahmedabad, Allahabad, Chandigarh and Alappuzha) with testing kits and reagents to test suspect human samples for Avian Influenza.
