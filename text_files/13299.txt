                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.2118 BY SHRI SANJAY JADHAV TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 04.03.2020 REGARDING PENDING RAILWAY PROJECTS(a): Railway Projects are taken up on the basis of remunerativeness, last mile connectivity, missing links and alternate routes,  augmentation of congested/saturated lines, socio-economic considerations etc. depending upon throwforward of ongoing projects, overall availability of funds and competing demands which covers connectivity in backward & rural areas also.  The projects are not sanctioned State-wise, area-wise and district-wise.  Since new lines generally straddle over more than one State, details of ongoing projects are maintained Zone-wise.Presently, Indian Railways have taken up 498 Railway projects of 49,069 km length, costing `6.75 lakh crore, which are in different stages of planning/sanction/execution, out of which, commissioning of 8,979 km length has been achieved upto March, 2019. The above 498 Projects include, 38 Railway projects of 5,879 Km length, costing `73,485 crore, falling fully/partly in the State of Maharashtra. Out of which, commissioning of 797 km length has been achieved and expenditure of `13,172 crore has been incurred up to March, 2019. Project-wise details of Railway Projects are made available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in >Ministry of Railways >Railway Board >About Indian Railways >Railway Board Directorates >Finance (Budget).(b): During the last five years 245 Railway Projects (New Line, Gauge Conversion and Doubling) of length 20,572 Km and costing `2,47,756 crore have been included in the Budget.    (c): The completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions  of working agencies/contractors etc. and all these factors vary from project to project and site to site. Hence, no confirmed time frame can be fixed for completion of projects.*****
