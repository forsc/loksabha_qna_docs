Accordingly, all Panchayat related matters, including the issue of proxy members, come within the purview of States and complaints pertaining to interference by the family members or the spouse in the duties of women public representatives of Panchayats are forwarded to States for redressal. Further, the Ministry of Panchayati Raj seeks to end the practice of proxy members representing the women members and the interference from family members or the spouse of the women members in Panchayat systems. Advisories, in this regard, have been issued by the Ministry from time to time to States/UTs. Also, the Ministry has been encouraging increased involvement of women in the functioning of Panchayats through active participation in the Gram Sabha meetings for preparation of Gram Panchayat Development Plans and various schemes being implemented by the Panchayats. This Ministry has also issued advisories to the States to facilitate holding of separate Ward Sabha and Mahila Sabha meetings prior to Gram Sabha meetings, enhancing the presence and participation of women in Gram Sabha and Panchayat meetings, allocation of Panchayat funds for women centric activities, combating the evil of women trafficking, female foeticide, child marriage etc.***
