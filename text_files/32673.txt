ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a):	No Sir.  Out of all platforms available at Thane station, Mail and express trains are dealt on platforms 5/6 & 7/8 and sub-urban traffic is dealt in other platforms which are congested and having high foot fall. Platforms 5/6 & 7/8 are island platforms and there is no inter-connectivity between platforms through ramps at these platforms. Therefore, movement of Battery Operated Car (BOC) from one platform to another is not possible.  As regards provision of BOC at Navi Mumbai station, this station is a Suburban Grade (SG) category station. BOCs have not been provided due to congestion & high footfall and limitation of inter-connectivity between platforms through ramps.(b):	No, Sir.  At present there is no plan to construct rest room for Motormen at Platform No. 10 of Thane Railway Station.  However, air conditioned running room with all basic amenities has been provided for Motormen at Thane.  In addition, one rest room, between platform No. 9 & 10, is available for Motormen working on trans-harbour line.	(c) to (e): No, Sir.  The entire area is planned to be developed for facilitating Thane Municipal Corporation work of Multi Modal Hub. However, Automatic Ticket Vending Machines (ATVMs) are available on the Foot Over Bridge (FOB) for the convenience of the passengers.	*****
