Further, directions have been issued to all States/UTs for conducting local survey of Anganwadi Centres under their jurisdiction  and get the children of appropriate age enrolled at the AWCs, if not already enrolled. States/UTs were also advised to ensure that any child, pregnant woman or lactating mother, coming to the AWC must be provided age appropriate supplementary nutrition, irrespective of their enrollment at the AWCs.One of the major objectives of launching Poshan Abhiyaan was to focus on converting the agenda of improving nutrition into a Jan Andolan involving panchayati raj institutions/village organizations, to create general awareness among the public, especially women from uneducated and poor households, about the benefits that can be availed under various schemes and to spread good health,  nutrition and sanitation practices through community based events.  ****
