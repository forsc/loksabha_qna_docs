ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a ) & (b):	Yes, SirThe States are primarily responsible to ensure production, availability and distribution of quality seeds to the farmers through its Department of Agriculture, seed multiplication farms, State Seeds Corporation including National Seeds Corporation, State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), Cooperatives  and Private Seed Companies etc.The Government of India supplements the efforts of the State Governments by coordinating seed requirement and availability through the mechanism of Zonal Seeds Review Meetings prior to each sowing season and developing Seed Rolling Plan of State Government.The Government of India is providing financial assistance for production and distribution of seed of High Yielding Varieties (HYVs) of different crops to the States and implementing agencies through various ongoing crop development programmes/ schemes viz.  National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Bringing Green Revolution in Eastern India (BGREI), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Sub-Mission on Seeds & Planting Material (SMSP) under National Mission on Agricultural Extension & Technology (NMAET) etc.Contd…..2/-- 2 -(c) & (d):	The Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode is already in place for development and commercialization of varieties. The private seed companies are contributing their research material (Varieties) for testing under All India Coordinated Research Projects of different crops and these varieties are being released and notified after testing at both public and private sector test locations.On the other hand, commercialization of seeds through PPP model is a successful initiative by the Government of India.  Zonal Technology Management and Business Planning and Development (ZTM&BPD) Units and Institute Technology Management Units of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) Institutes and State Agricultural Universities have successfully commercialized and transferred new seed varieties to farmers’ field via PPP mode. More than 500 Memorandum of Agreements (MoAs) have been signed with private seed companies for licensing the varieties to seed companies for production and marketing the quality seeds for timely availability of good quality seeds at farmer’s door step, which in turn helps in increasing the productivity as well as farmers’ income.*******
