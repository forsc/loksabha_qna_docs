ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF MINES, COAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS  (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a): As per information made available by Indian Bureau of Mines (a sub-ordinate office of the Ministry of Mines), State-wise/Grade-wise details of quantum of deposits of Iron ore available in the country as on 1.4.2015 is annexed.(b): As per information made available by Indian Bureau of Mines (a sub-ordinate office of the Ministry of Mines), the production and domestic consumption of iron ore during the last five years are as follows: (Units in million tonnes) Year 	2014-15	2015-16	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19Production	129.32	155.91	192.08	200.9	206.4Consumption	114.68	122.62	137	154.59	NAIt seems from the above table that there is no shortage of iron ore in the country to meet the current demand/consumption.  (c) & (d): The Government has notified Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2015 to streamline grant of mining leases in order to maintain sufficient availability of raw materials for the various sectors. The most important provisions of the amended Act are as follows: (i)	All mineral concessions will be granted only through auction; (ii)	Uniform lease period of 50 years; no renewals; auction at the end of lease period; (iii)	To ensure the uninterrupted supply of raw material to the industries, section 8A(5) and 8A(6) of MMDR Amendment Act, 2015 provides for deemed extension to non-captive mines upto the year 2020 and captive mines upto the year 2030; To ensure supply of raw material by timely auction of leases expiring in 2020 under section 8A(5) of the MMDR Act, the Central Government has amended the Mineral Conservation and Development Rules, 2017 vide gazette notification no. G.S.R. 289(E) dated 27.03.2018 making it mandatory for the lease holders to carry out G2 level exploration over the entire mineralised area by 1st April, 2019. The State Governments are empowered to carry out auction of mineral blocks under the extant act/rules. As on date, 20 blocks of iron ore have been successfully auctioned with a reserve of 583.057 million tonnes. Additionally, 24 blocks of Iron ore (fifteen in Odisha, eight in Karnataka and one block in Andhra Pradesh) are being prepared by the State Governments to be put on auction during FY 2019-20, which will increase the production of iron ore in the country.(e): No, Sir. There is no such proposal for setting up a mining regulator at both Central and State levels to regulate mining activity and prevent illegal mining from flourishing.(f): Does not arise in view of the reply given to (e) above.***** AnnexureState-wise/Grade-wise details of quantum of deposits of Iron ore available in the country as on 1.4.2015(Unit: in ‘000 tonnes)State	Reserves	Remaining Resources	TotalAndhra Pradesh 	Hematite	29768	311294	341062	Magnetite	0	1392098	1392098Assam 	Hematite	0	12600	12600	Magnetite	0	15380	15380Bihar 	Hematite	0	55	55	Magnetite	0	2659	2659Chhattisgarh	Hematite	1387437	3470687	4858124	Magnetite	11183	42	11225Goa 	Hematite	358239	831075	1189313	Magnetite	4990	261345	266336Jharkhand	Hematite	439372	4847045	5286417	Magnetite	0	10667	10667Karnataka 	Hematite	550247	1916607	2466854	Magnetite	446	7801744	7802190Kerala	Magnetite	0	83435	83435Madhya Pradesh	Hematite	62063	267900	329963Maharashtra 	Hematite	17241	276862	294103	Magnetite	583	302	885Meghalaya 	Hematite	0	225	225	Magnetite	0	3380	3380Nagaland	Magnetite	0	5280	5280Odisha 	Hematite	2572217	4986447	7558664	Magnetite	74	79	152Rajasthan 	Hematite	4658	33745	38404	Magnetite	35423	581493	616916Tamil Nadu	Magnetite	0	507037	507037Telangana	Hematite	509	52673	53181	Magnetite	0	71514	71514Uttar Pradesh	Hematite	0	58000	58000India	Hematite	5421751	17065214	22486965	Magnetite	52699	10736455	10789155Source: Indian Bureau of Mines
