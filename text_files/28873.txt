                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRYAND DAIRYING(SHRI PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a) to (c): Recognizing the importance of Fisheries Sector and its growth potential, for giving sustained and focused attention to the sector, the Government of India has created a separate Department of Fisheries in February 2019 and subsequently created Ministry for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying in June 2019. Department of Fisheries attaches highest priority to fisheries and aquaculture extension among fishers and fish farmers of the country. Currently training and extension is imparted by 2 institutes under Department of Fisheries, i.e. Central Institute of Fisheries Nautical & Engineering Training (CIFNET) and Fishery Survey of India (FSI), 8 Indian Council of Agricultural research (ICAR) instituters with their 31 regional centres, Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) and the respective state directorates alongwith their institutions.     The Central Institute of Fisheries Nautical & Engineering Training (CIFNET) offers comprehensive training programmes covering various disciplines like Nautical Science, Fishing Technology, Marine Engineering, and allied areas, helping to create the technical manpower for marine operation including fishing, navigation and marine engineering and related shore establishments. The Institute is also providing training to marine fishermen of the coastal states under capacity building training programme under Pradhan Manri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY).The Fishery Survey of India (FSI) has the primary responsibility of survey and assessment of fishery resources in the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and adjoining areas for promoting sustainable exploitation and management of the marine fishery resources. The FSI is providing practical training of fishing operatives, fishermen, fisheries officers and students. The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India is providing ocean data, information and advisory services to the fishers, industry, the government and the scientific community. Eight Fisheries Research Institutes and 31 research centres under Indian Council of Agricultural research (ICAR) located in different geographical regions of the country are disseminating need based technologies online and offline to fish farmers, marine fishermen, inland fishermen and other stakeholders for adopting fishery and aquaculture technologies.  The Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) have been functioning as knowledge and resource centre of agricultural technology supporting initiatives of public, private and voluntary sector for improving the agricultural economy including fishery sector of the district and are linking the National Agricultural Research System (NARS) with extension system and farmers. The KVKs are involved in capacity development of fish farmers and extension personnel to update their knowledge and skills on modern agricultural technologies.ICAR-Central Institute of Freshwater Aquaculture (CIFA) has developed and launched app “MatsyaSetu” to educate the fish farmers on breeding, seed production, grow-out technologies and Better Management Practices (BMP) of commercially important fishes on self-learning basis through online materials and short-videos with practical demonstration.Further, Department of Fisheries in collaboration with Agriculture Skill Council of India (ASCI) is developing “Qualifications Parks” for various skills required in fisheries sector to upgrade the skill levels among the workforce engaged in fisheries sector.(d) & (e): Freshwater fishing and aquaculture is increasing fish production in the country as aquaculture in controlled conditions within supplement environment yields better production compared to natural fisheries. It is seen that inland fish production has increased from 7.1  Million  Tonnes  to  10.4  Million  Tonnes in last five years.(f): Technical knowhow about fisheries and aquaculture practices can be extended to fishers and fish farmers in Gujarat through the network of Institutions as mentioned above and the extension wing of State Fisheries Directorate.       *****
