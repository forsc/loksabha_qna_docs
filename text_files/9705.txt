The estimated burden of the disease has decreased from 28.4 lakhs in 2015 to 26.9 lakhs in 2018. Country achieved Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) related to Tuberculosis in 2016-Incidence of TB declined by 28% since 1990.Reporting of TB cases is increasing because of easy availability, accessibility of TB diagnostic centers in rural areas and tribal areas.Year	Number of TB patients in rural and tribal 	Total No. of TB patients2017	          4,70,185 	18,27,9592018	          9,05,246 	21,52,2792019 (Till November)	       11,59,329 	21,46,288(b):  The overall TB incidence in India is on the decline. TB control is also rapidly gaining momentum in rural areas because of the easy availability of microscopy center as per the Government’s decision to establish Designated Microscopy Centres (DMCs) in all Peripheral Health Institutions (PHIs) as per the need. As per the recent norms, one DMC caters to a population of 1 lakh. These norms are relaxed for tribal/hilly/difficult areas where one DMC per 50,000 population is available.The total number of DMCs has increased from 16,600 in 2017 to 20,045 currently.Huge thrust is being given to the transport of sample for easy accessibility of rapid molecular tests to people in the rural areas. All DMCs have been made sputum collection centres and necessary packaging and logistic support has been made available. The Govt has established mechanisms to enable sputum transportation through India Post in addition to other local mechansims such as MoU with courier agencies, human carriers, and private sector/NGO support. Special Active Case Finding campaign of house to house search for TB cases is being carried out among vulnerable population mapped.Because of these efforts, the number of TB patients diagnosed in the rural villages and the tribal areas has increased from 4,70,185 in 2017 to 9,05,246 in 2018, and 11,59,329 in 2019.The Programme has further taken measures to reduce stigma of TB in the community. National, state and district level forums have been set up to provide a platform for TB survivors to voice their views. Network of TB Champions have been created from existing network of 4 lakh treatment supporters and past TB patients and people affected due to TB. With this purpose a standardized curriculum has been developed to support TB Survivors/ to become effective Community TB Mobilizers/Champions.More than 90,000 community members including TB survivors have been sensitized by 305 trained TB Champions in 140 districts in collaboration with REACH (NGO). These TB Champions have also provided patient support services to more than 8000 TB patients.To strengthen the decentralized functioning of TB care, the Programme is also providing ‘informant incentive’ of Rs. 500 and incentive for treatment outcome reporting- Rs. 1500 for Drug Sensitive TB (DSTB) patients and Rs. 5000 for Drug Resistant TB (DRTB) patients, including to ASHAs.Further, all Health & Wellness Centres established under Ayushman Bharat have been earmarked as sputum collection centres and DOTS centres from where TB medicines can be taken.  (c):  Government of India has launched “TB Harega Desh Jeetega Campaign” on 25th Sept. 2019 in which new sets of IEC materials (in which it is clearly mentioned that “Free diagnosis, Free treatment and Nutritional support are available to all Government Hospitals”) have been launched and shared with States/UTs for further dissemination.

The Programme provides quality drugs and free diagnostis to all notified TB patients in the public and private sectors.
