AIBP works of 40 prioritized projects (including phases) have been reported to be completed.  State wise details are at Annexure – I.             Using the remote sensing technology, cropped area assessment has been done by the Bhaskaracharya Institute for Space Applications and Geo-Informatics (BISAG) in the command of the 99 Priority Projects. The cropped area has been assessed as 40.57 L ha and 45.74 L ha during the year 2016 and 2018 respectively.(d)  For efficient distribution of available water, use of pressurized pipe system wherever feasible in the command of prioritized projects is encouraged.  DoWR, RD & GR and Central Water Commission (CWC) has prepared guidelines for proper planning, design and implementation of Piped Irrigation Network and the same were circulated to States for reference during July, 2017. Further, the Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) component of PMKSY mainly focuses on water use efficiency at farm level through precision/micro irrigation.             Detail of the Central Assistance released during 2015-2016 to 2018-19 for the different components of the PMKSY including above measures is at Annexure- II.(e)  In respect of AIBP component, arrangement for funding the Central Assistance (CA) and State Share (SS) has been made through NABARD, so that there are no fund constraints. Further, online MIS has been developed for monitoring the progress of various components of PMKSY.  The progress of the scheme is also reviewed at various levels from time to time.*****	ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) to (c) of Unstarred Question No.829 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 06.02.2020 regarding “PROJECTS UNDER PMKSY”.Number of projects included and completed under PMKSY-AIBP 	No. Of projects included	No. Of Projects Completed1	Andhra Pradesh	8	12	Assam	3	13	Bihar 	2	04	Chhattisgarh	3	25	Goa	1	06	Gujarat	1	07	J&K	4	18	Jharkhand	1	09	 Karnataka	5	210	Kerala	2	011	Madhya Pradesh	14 projects + 7 phases	1112	Maharashtra	26	913	Manipur	2	014	Odisha	8	515	Punjab	2	216	Rajasthan	2	217	Telangana	11	318	Uttar Pradesh	4	1 	Total 	99 projects + 7 phases	40 ANNEXURE-IIAnnexure referred to in reply to part (d) of Unstarred Question No.829 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 06.02.2020 regarding “PROJECTS UNDER PMKSY”.Sl.
