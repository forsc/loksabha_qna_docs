ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b) Water supply is a State subject and the power to regulate the same vests with respective State governments. As per existing guidelines, Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) does not grant ‘no objection certificate’ (NOC) for new packaged drinking water units based on ground water in over-exploited areas. Further, CGWA permits ground water extraction to such industries in semi-critical, critical and safe areas with certain mandatory conditions for ground water recharge.(c) 	States plan and utilize their own resources on water management inter alia which includes on water supply projects. This Department does not maintain information on overall expenditure by States on water supply. However, to enable every rural household across the country to have potable water at service level of 55 litre per capita per day (lpcd) through Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC) by 2024, Government of India has launched Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), with an outlay of ? 3.60 lakh Crore with Central share of Rs. 2.08 lakh Crore. Details of State-wise allocation and amount released to States/ UTs during 2019-20, are annexed.	(d) 	As reported by States/ UTs, as on 04.02.2020, 81.57% rural habitations having 77.20% population have provision of minimum 40 litre per capita per day (lpcd) of potable drinking water and 15.42% rural habitations having 19.42% population have service level of less than 40 lpcd potable water, whereas 3.01% rural habitations having 3.38% population have water sources with quality issues.(e) & (f) As per the WHO, the per capita requirement of clean water ranges from 30-50 lpcd for drinking, cooking, personal washing, washing clothes and cleaning home. Under JJM, the minimum service delivery has been fixed as 55 lpcd and States may enhance the same to higher level.****
