ANSWER




MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a)	    Yes. Potato, Onion and Tomato are produced in Rajasthan. As per the latest data reported by Government of Rajasthan, the area and production of Potato, Onion and Tomato in Rajasthan, and in particular Sikar  District, for 2019-20, is as under:-  (Area in Ha; Production in Metric Tonne)Crops	Rajasthan	Sikar District	Area	Production	Area	ProductionPotato	12996	235236	1	25Onion	74596	1241783	14507	380040Tomato	18340	101983	747	18004contd…2/-(b):    In order to provide farmers remunerative prices for their produce, the Government has taken several steps.        The Government has implemented National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) scheme an online virtual trading platform to provide farmers and Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) with opportunity for transparent price discovery for remunerative prices for their produce through competitive online bidding system.     Through Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) Scheme development of private mandis, direct marketing, declaring  warehouses, silos, cold storages as deemed markets and also developing Gramin Haats into Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs), are promoted.        The Government is now implementing a central Sector scheme namely “Formation and Promotion of 10,000 Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs)” to enhance cost effective production and higher net incomes to the member farmer producers through better liquidity and market linkages for their produce and become sustainable through collective action. In addition to above, to provide additional channels to farmers for marketing of their produce and promote barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade and commerce, the Government has promulgated “The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020” on 5th June, 2020. Now, farmers can sell their produce from their farm-gate, residence to processing units, warehouse, silos, cold storage etc. nearer to their farm-gate. Farmers are getting better price, and also be able to save the transportation cost, unofficial payment of market fee, commission charges and other marketing charges in the existing system of agricultural marketing.   (c) &(d):   Under the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) scheme implemented by this Department, financial assistance is provided for taking up various activities related to development of horticulture including post-harvest management. For the development of post-harvest management including establishment of Pack house, Pre-cooling unit, Cold Storage, Mobile Pre-cooling unit, Cold Room (Staging), Primary/Mobile/Minimal Processing unit, Ripening Chamber, evaporative/low energy cool chamber, low cost preservation unit, low cost onion storage structure, Pusa Zero Energy Cool Chamber, subsidy @ 35% (for general areas) and 50% (for hilly and tribal areas) of capital cost of the project is available for both public and private sector enterprises.       Government of Rajasthan has reported  that in order to preserve Onion, 7710 Low Cost  Onion Storage structure have been  constructed  in the State under the Misssion for Integrated Horticulture  Development (MIDH) and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna (RKVY) schemes, with a Storage Capacity of 192.750 Metric Tonne.  There are approximately 306 such storages in Sikar  District. They have also  reported that 40 Cold Storages have been established  in the State to store Potato and Tomato produce.    Rajasthan has further reported  that no such arrangement is there for Tomatoes in Sikar District, as production is less.      Besides, Ministry of Food Processing Industries, Govt. of India is also implementing “Operation Greens” for integrated development of Tomato, Onion and Potato (TOP) value chain.  Under “Operations Greens”, 50% subsidy is provided for the transportation and storage from surplus producing areas to consuming centres.************
