DDU-GKY guidelines provide for earmarking 50% of the funds for SCs and STs and 15% for minorities. Further, one third beneficiaries of the respective categories under the scheme should be women.DDU-GKY follows a 3-tier implementation architecture for implementation.

Project Implementing Agencies (PIAs), which are mostly private training partners, are responsible for mobilization, training and placements. The details of progress in North-Eastern Region and Jhansi and Lalitpur districts of Uttar Pradesh is given at Annexure-I.(c)       As DDU-GKY is a demand driven schemes, hence there is no State-wise allocation of funds under the scheme, however State-wise funds release status as on 30.11.2021 for North-Eastern region and the State of Uttar Pradesh is given as under: (Rs. in lakhs)S.N.
