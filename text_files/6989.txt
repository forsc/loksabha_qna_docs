ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) is monitored on regular basis to review the progress and to make the course corrections. Selected Airline Operators (SAOs), who are not able to mount operations within specified timeline as per contract, are issued Show Cause notices. In case of wilful default by an SAO, cancellation of routes is done by forfeiting the Performance Guarantee/Proposal Security. As per the scheme document, SAO has to operate at least 70% of the scheduled flights on routes awarded under the SAO Agreement in a specified period. Air services from Jalgaon to Mumbai and Ahmedabad have commenced under RCS - UDAN.;
