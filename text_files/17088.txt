ANSWER




                                                        (a)and (b) Yes Sir, Government has released the results of Swachh Survekshan 2020 on August 20, 2020. The details of ranking of cities along with the criteria for selection of cities, indicators/parameters may be viewed at the following link : https://swachhbharaturban.gov.in under the tab Swachh Survekshan and SS-2020 report. (c) Better rank in Swachh Sarvekshan improves perception about the city and that has many intangible benefits.  However, there is no additional financial incentive other than the Award itself.(d) and (e) Cities which fail to get high ranks are provided assistance to improve their ranks through workshops, advisories, guidelines etc., apart from financial assistance as per Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U) Guidelines to fill up the gap in sanitation infrastructure.                                       *****
