ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)	(b) & (c): 	In the wake of COVID-19 crisis in the country, the PM-GKAY scheme was started in April 2020 to provide additional free foodgrains to all 80 Crore National Food Security Act (NFSA) beneficiaries in the country initially for a period of 3 months from April to June 2020. Later the scheme was extended for further period of 5 months from July to November 2020. Further, in 2021,  the PM-GKAY scheme was resumed for a period of another 7 months from May to November 2021 and further extended upto March 2022.  Thus, under PM-GKAY free foodgrains have been provided to the beneficiaries for a total period of 19 months (8 months in 2020 and 11 months in 2021-22).  		Further, as part of a separate relief measure under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Scheme (ANBS) the Department had provided foodgrains to all States/UTs for free of cost distribution to migrants/stranded migrants and all those not having NFSA or any State PDS ration cards, for a period of 2 months of May and June 2020.  This was done as the lockdown  was in operation in the entire country at that time.The need for the ration card for obtaining the extra free 5 kg foodgrains allocated by the Central Government to the poor is to ensure rightful targeting of the food security during the pandemic, to about 80 Crore NFSA beneficiaries who have been identified as per norms.  The responsibility of identification of eligible beneficiaries and issue of ration cards under NFSA rests with the State/UT Governments.*****
