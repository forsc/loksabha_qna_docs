KRISHNA PAL SINGH YADAV (a) & (b):	Sports and games have always been seen as an integral component in the all-round development of the human personality.  Apart from being a means of entertainment and physical fitness, sports have also played a great role in generation of the spirit of healthy competition and bonding within the community.  Needless to mention that achievements in sports at the International level have always been a source of National pride and prestige. Hence, promotion and development of Sports in the country is undoubtedly one of the priorities for the Government of India. Performance of sportspersons in International events depends on many factors like availability of quality sports infrastructure including state of art equipment, world class trainers, exposure of competitions, financial supports for medical and other emergencies. Achievements of Indian sportspersons and teams in international sports events, including mega sports events, in recent past shows that there has been a perceptible improvement in performance of Indian sportspersons at International sports events. Major Achievements during last 5 Years is at Annexure-I.(c):	National Sports Policy, 1984 was the first move towards developing an organized and systematic framework for the development and promotion of sports in the country, and the precursor of the present National Sports Policy, 2001.

Accordingly, all schemes of the Department have been tailored and reviewed from time to time to achieve these objectives.  Apart, ‘Sports’ is a State subject and the primarily responsibility of promotion/development of Sports rests with the respective State Governments, the Central Government is playing a pivotal role for promoting high performance in sports. Broad-basing of sports and achieving excellence is continuous and progressive process, which may not set up any medal winning targets.

Annual targets for training of athletes for high performance and their participation in competition are approved for different NSFs by this Ministry in the annual exercise of preparing Annual Calendar for Training and Competitions (ACTCs). With the launch of Khelo India Scheme, there has been increased awareness and participation of people in sports and Indian athletes have earned accolades in sports such as archery, athletics, badminton, boxing, hockey, shooting, wrestling, weightlifting, etc. in international events. This Ministry (i) has set up expert training facilities in the Sports Authority of India (SAI) centres across the country in various States; (ii) is supporting athletes for participation in international exposure and competitions through financial assistance to NSFs; and (iii) providing customized support and assistance to high performance medal prospect athletes under the Target Olympic Podium Scheme.(d):	Sports infrastructure and other sports facilities at five stadia of Sports Authority of India (SAI) in New Delhi and Regional Centers of SAI across the country are of International standards, upgradation of sports facilities at SAI stadia and Regional Centers in terms of infrastructure and equipment has been carried out from time to time as per requirement, which is as an ongoing process. The Government is also providing financial assistance from National Sports Development Fund for sports infrastructure, customized training under reputed coaches at Institutes having world-class facilities, participation in international competitions, purchase of equipment and Services of support persons like Physical Trainer, Mental Trainer and Physiotherapist etc. to potential athletes which is also facilitating in preparation for Tokyo Olympics, 2020. The allocation of funds for development of these sports facilities are carried out based on technical feasibility.Through the schemes of the Department of Sports such as Assistance to National Sports Federations (NSFs), Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) the identified promising sportspersons and teams are being provided support of modern sports sciences, exposure abroad under experts of respective sports discipline, participation in International events/ competitions.
