ANSWER




                                                          (a)	: Urban Development is a subject under the State list as per the Constitution. It is, therefore, the primary responsibility of the States to create blueprints for urban development of their cities.  Area-Based and Pan-city development are two strategic pillars of the Smart Cities Mission. The three components of Area-based development are city improvement (retrofitting), city renewal (redevelopment) and city extension (greenfield development). The projects being undertaken by Smart cities as part of their Area-based development strategy act as lighthouses for other cities across the country. (b)	:This Ministry has prepared a draft Model Tenancy Act (MTA) with the aim to balance and protect the interest of both the tenant and owner by regulating renting of premises in an efficient and transparent manner through an adjudicating mechanism for speedy dispute resolution. Considering the vast impact of MTA across various sections of the society, MTA along with a Background Note has been sent to States/Union Territories (UTs) for translation in local/vernacular language to seek the comments of public/stakeholders on revised draft MTA. Thereafter, with approval of the Union Cabinet, MTA will be circulated to States/UTs to legislate/adopt. ( c):	Keeping in mind the urgent need for Indian cities to be developed in a planned manner, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has launched the “Pilot on Formulation of Local Area Plan and Town Planning Scheme (LAP and TPS)” under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). 25 cities across the country have been taken up under the pilot. Capacity building of urban planners is being undertaken to build local   expertise in these planning techniques. The salient objectives of the pilot are:1.	Establish a framework for redevelopment of existing areas through the development of LAP.2.	Enable planned expansion in peri-urban areas through TPS.3.	Support Value Capture techniques to finance infrastructure investments.4.	Create enabling legal framework where required.5.	Training and certification of planners at city and State level to ensure proper implementation of the above strategies.The cost of providing urban infrastructure and amenities under such LAPs and TPS can be financed through Value Capture Financing (VCF) tools such as betterment charges and sale of reserved plots. Ministry has formulated and circulated Value Capture Policy Framework to States/Union Territories for implementation.                                             *****
