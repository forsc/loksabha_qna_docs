                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES (SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a): Yes Sir, The Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) is focusing on building cold chain infrastructure across the country, for seamless transfer of perishables from production to consumption areas, through the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY), which comprises of component schemes namely (i) Integrated Cold Chain and Value Addition Infrastructure, (ii) Mega Food Park, (iii) Creation of Backward & Forward Linkages, (iv) Creation/ Expansion of Food Processing and Preservation Capacities (v) Agro Processing Clusters and (vi) Operation Greens. These schemes aim at arresting post-harvest losses of horticulture and non-horticulture produce by encouraging the creation of cold storages/ primary processing/ and transportation facilities across the country. To fill in the gaps across the value chain and establishing the Cold Chain Grid, the Ministry has also sanctioned 37 Mega Food Parks and 298 Integrated Cold Chain Projects throughout the country. A State/ UT-wise list showing the approved Cold Chain and Mega Food Park projects as on date under the PMKSY is placed at Annexure –I.(b) to (d): Ministry of Food Processing Industries does not establish food processing parks in the country on its own.

The willing entrepreneurs in the country may apply for setting up of Mega Food Parks as per provisions of the guidelines of scheme for Mega Food Park as and when EoI is invited by the Ministry. Selection of suitable proposals for these projects is done as per the Scheme guidelines, based on the merit, through a three tier stringent appraisal process as per the prefixed criteria. The current EoI has last date as 31.03.2020 for submission of proposals.Total 42 Mega Food Parks (MFPs) were envisaged by the Government. As on date, Ministry has approved 37 MFPs in 23 states/UTs which are under various stages of implementation. These 37 Mega Food Park projects have cold storage as one of the components along with other food processing components. In these 37 Mega Food Park projects, the total capacity of Cold Storage is 1,74,470 MT and of Deep Freezers is 39,500 MT.The details of State/UT-wise Cold storage facility in 37 final approved Mega Food Park projects are attached as Annexure-II.*****
