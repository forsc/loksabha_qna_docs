ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b)	 According to information provided by relevant  agencies to the Ministry,  the number of Indians involved in financial irregularities with the banks as well as those who are under criminal investigation from 2015 onwards are 72 and considerable amount of Proceeds of Crime (PoC) are involved in respect of these cases. (c) & (d) 	Efforts are being made proactively for securing presence of these accused in the country by way of issuance of LOC, RCN and Extradition requests. Action under Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018 (FEOA) has also been initiated in suitable cases.  The extradition process is complex as it involves going through the legal process as per the bilateral treaty, if any, with the country concerned and its domestic laws.
