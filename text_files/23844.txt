ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  The Harike Head Works at the confluence of the River Sutlej and Beas, supplies water to the Ferozepur Feeder, Indira Gandhi Feeder (IGF) and Makhu Canal off-taking from it. Head Regulator of IGF at Harike was designed and constructed with a capacity of 15,000 cusecs. However, Indira Gandhi Feeder has been constructed with a designed capacity of 18,500 cusecs.  (b)  Increase in capacity of Harike Head Works to 18,500 cusecs would make the entire system designed for carrying 18,500 cusecs. (c) & (d)  Water resources projects are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves, as per their own resources and priorities. Role of the Union Government is limited to being catalytic, providing technical support and in some cases partial financial assistance in terms with the existing schemes being implemented by the Ministry of Jal Shakti. Further, Government of India also facilitates convergence regarding water resources issues between two or more States, on specific request. In this case, the issue is being resolved mutually between the two States of Rajasthan and Punjab. As informed by Government of Punjab, a model study is being done at Irrigation and Power Research Institute, Amritsar to ascertain whether raising the water level of Harike Pond would make the entire system compliant to the capacity of 18,500 cusec, as against the present capacity of 15,000 cusec of Harike Headworks. *****
