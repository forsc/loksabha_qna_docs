Based on the demand, State Government prepares project proposals under PMAY-U and after due approval of State Level Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee(SLSMC) submits to the Ministry for sanctioning. Against the demand of 1.12 crore housesas validated by States/ UTs, 1.14 crore have been sanctioned by the Ministry under PMAY-U. Out of this, more than 53 lakh have been completed and delivered to the beneficiaries and remaining are in various stages of construction/ grounding. In State of Maharashtra, against validated demand of 13.50 lakh, 13.51 lakh houses have been sanctioned under PMAY-U since inception of Scheme.

Out of this, 4,35,930 have been completed and delivered to the eligible beneficiaries.  During this period, an amount of ?21,279 crore has been sanctioned; of which ?10,381 crore has been released.(e)	In order to achieve the vision of ‘Housing for All’, Ministry monitors progress of the Scheme through periodic review meetings, video-conferences and field visits. Ministry has advised States/UTs including Maharashtrato expedite the construction of sanctioned houses so that these are completed within the stipulated timeline.                                    *****
