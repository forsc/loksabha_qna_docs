                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR )(a) to (d):   The Government allows fertilizers which are enlisted in Fertilizer Control Order (FCO), 1985 for safe use in agriculture.  These fertilizers are tested for their agronomic efficacy, economic viability before their inclusion in FCO, 1985.  Clause 19 of FCO strictly prohibits the manufacture and sale of fertilizer which are not of prescribed standards. Besides, farmers are provided Soil Health Cards which recommends appropriate dosage of nutrients/fertilizers based on soil deficiency in their soil for dominant crops of a particular reason.	Integrated Pest management (IPM) is being promoted and major emphasis is given to train farmers through Farmers Field School (FFS) on safe and judicious use of pesticides based on Agro Eco System Analysis (AESA) decision making so as to avoid unnecessary use of pesticides and protect soil health. 35 Central IPM centers in 28 States and 2 UTs are conducting various activities viz. (FFS); two days and five days HRD programmes and 30 days’ Season Long Training Programmes (SLTP) to educate and train farmers and extension functionaries as well as pesticide dealers on the use of bio-pesticides to manage the crop pests. These practices are able to prevent the soil micro-fauna which conserve soil texture and fertility. *****
