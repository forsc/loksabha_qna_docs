                                                        MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BHUPENDER YADAV)(a) to (c) The statement is laid on the table of the House.***Statement refer to in reply to part (a) to (c) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 353 due for reply on 28.03.2022 regarding ‘Incentive Programmes to Increase Forest Areas’ by Shri Dilip Saikia.(a) Forest Survey of India (FSI), Dehradun, an organization under the Ministry carries out the assessment of forest cover of the country biennially since 1987 and the findings are published in India State of Forest Report (ISFR). The forest cover assessment is a wall-to-wall mapping exercise based on remote sensing supported by intensive ground verification and field data from National Forest Inventory.  The ISFR 2021 has been recently released by the Ministry on 13th January, 2022.  As per the ISFR reports, the change in forest cover w.r.t. previous assessments is increased or decreased in the last decade is given as below:-(Area in square kilometre)S. No. 	ISFR	Total Forest Cover	Change in forest cover w.r.t. previous assessment 1	2011	6,92,027	-3672	2013	6,97,898	5,8713	2015	7,01,495	3,5974	2017	7,08,273	6,7785	2019	7,12,249	3,9766	2021	7,13,789	1,540Hence, the overall increase in forest cover in the last one decade is 21,762 square kilometre.(b)	Various schemes are being implemented by the Central and State Government/Union Territory Administration for increase in forest and tree cover in the country. These includes the National Afforestation Programme (NAP) and Green India Mission (GIM) being implemented by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. National Afforestation Programme is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for regeneration of degraded forest and adjoining areas in the country. The scheme is being implemented through 3 tier institutional setup of State Forest Development Agency (SFDA) at State level, Forest Development agency (FDA) at Forest Division level and Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMCs) at Village level. Now NAP scheme has been merged with Green India Mission.  National Mission for a Green India (GIM) is one of the eight Missions outlined under the National Action Plan on Climate Change. It aims at protecting, restoring, and enhancing India’s forest cover and responding to Climate Change by means of plantation activities in the forest and non-forest areas.  Afforestation activities are also taken up under various programmes/funding sources such as Compensatory Afforestation Funds under Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), afforestation activities under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA), National Agro-forestry Policy and Sub-mission on Agro-forestry (SMAF), National Bamboo Mission and National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture. In addition to above, State and UT Governments have their own afforestation and reforestation programmes. Almost every State has activities under social forestry, which largely focuses on tree planting in the areas outside forests.   The State Governments in the North Eastern region also take up awareness programme to educate people against Jhum cultivation.  The  State  Governments  also  carry  out  plantation  involving  local communities in the Jhum affected areas and provide alternate livelihood for forest fringe communities. The State Government of Haryana has started intensive afforestation  programme for plantation on forest lands, panchayat lands, institutional lands, farm lands, urban areas to increase in forest cover. (c) The India State of Forest Report published by the Ministry shows that overall at the national level forest cover has increased by 21,762 square kilometre in the last one decade. There is no decreasing trend in forest cover of the country.  *****
