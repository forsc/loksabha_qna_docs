ANSWER




ANSWERMINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE &  CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS (DR. MANSUKH  MANDAVIYA )(a) Yes, Sir. The Government has recently made BIS Standard mandatory for some chemical products. D/o Chemicals & Petrochemicals has notified 51 Quality Control Order (QCO) to make BIS standards as mandatory so far. The details is attached at Annexure. (b) Standards of major chemicals & petrochemicals are formulated by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and most of the standards are presently voluntary in nature.  However, sometimes chemicals imported into India  do not meet the quality requirements as per BIS standards. To protect human, animal or plant health, safety of the environment and to improve quality, Government for selective chemical products has initiated an exercise to make BIS standards as mandatory under Section 16 of BIS Act, 2016, so that both domestic manufacturers and overseas suppliers meet the BIS standards and supply quality chemicals. ****AnnexureList of Quality Control Orders notified in Gazette of India for making BIS standard as mandatorySl.
