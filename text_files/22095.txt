ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ?????? (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d) :   Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) envisages use of technology in implementation of the scheme.   As per provisions claims under the scheme are worked out on the basis of yield data furnished by the concerned State Government based on requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) for the notified crops at notified insurance unit level.  This is a manual process and takes time due to which claims of farmers are sometime delayed.     Accordingly, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare through Mahalanobis National Crop Forecast Centre (MNCFC) is doing several pilots to develop technology driven approaches for direct yield estimation at Gram Panchayat level using different technologies for early yield estimation and timely settlement of claims.   Presently pilot projects are also being undertaken by the 7 selected national/international agencies in 100 districts for paddy (rice)  and wheat crops  in Kharif 2020 and Rabi 2021.  These agencies are using various sources of data/techniques like weather, remote sensing, soil moisture, hydrological data including images/data taken through drone to develop models to arrive at yield at Gram Panchayat level.   For this purpose, DGCA has recently given nod for flying of drone to collect the data in 100 pilot districts for paddy (rice) and wheat crops.    On finalization/development of statistically sound and appropriate model, this will help farmers in the form of early yield estimation and timely claims settlement under PMFBY.******
