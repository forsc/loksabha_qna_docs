                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL) (a):	Government incentivizes food processing exporting units through various schemes. Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) provides credit linked financial assistance (capital subsidy) in the form of grants-in-aid to entrepreneurs for setting up of food processing / preservation industries including export-oriented ones under Central Sector umbrella scheme- Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) across the country including Tamil Nadu. Government has also approved the introduction of “Production Linked Incentive scheme” for Food Processing Sector with an outlay of Rs 10,900 Crore to support creation of global food manufacturing champions and support Indian brands of food products in international market. Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) also provides incentives to processed food exporters under its different schemes for Infrastructure, Quality, Market Development etc.  These schemes are implemented across the country, including Tamil Nadu.(b):	Government has taken various regulatory and policy reforms to ensure conducive environment to the food processing investors, including those engaged in exports. These measures include shifting from product to product approval regime to an ingredient based approval system, putting in place an Empowered Group of Secretaries(EGoS) under the Cabinet Secretary and Project Development Cells in various Ministries/ departments including MoFPI; streamlining proposal approval and Grants disbursal process in the Ministry through on-line portal (SAMPADA) etc.(c):	Ministry does not maintain district wise data of Food Processing Industries, engaged in the export of finished products. However, as per information provided by the Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), two units of seafood processing - one each of Chilled Fish Handling Centre and of Live Fish Handling Centre are operational in Cuddalore District of Tamil Nadu. *****
