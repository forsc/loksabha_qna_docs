                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF FINANCE[SMT.

The Central Excise Act is still in force. As per the proviso to Section 3 of CGST Act 2017, the Central Excise officers are deemed to be officers under the CGST Act 2017. Khaki uniform has been prescribed under Chapter 7 of the Central Excise, Circle and Divisional Office Procedure manual, 1975. b)	The CGST officers deal with the tax evasion matters related to Central Excise, Customs and CGST which entails search of a premise/person, stopping a vehicle/vessel, arrest of an offender, border patrolling and guarding of premises. Uniform helps the trade identity of departmental officers and prevents impersonation. It also helps the departmental officers in discharging their official duties. Further, uniform was also prescribed to maintain and encourage a proper sense of discipline and to ensure proper turnout.c)	No order/instructions have been issued by the Department relating to guard of honour and control room duty in the last three years.d)	The Department of Expenditure OM dated 02.08.2017 has prescribed dress allowance to various forces including executive staff of Customs, Central Excise & Narcotics Department (both in summer and summer-cum-winter).  The same has been circulated vide letter F.No. 26017/22/2008-Ad.IIA dated 04.10.2017. Grade-wise officers/employees along with their number who have been provided uniform allowance Year-wise during the last three years is given in Annexure-A.e)	No, sir. However, in terms of guidelines issued vide para 182 of Section 1 of Chapter 7 of the Central Excise Office Procedure Manual, 1975 officers in the rank of Assistant Commissioner and below are required to wear uniform while on duty.
