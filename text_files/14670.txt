ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (b) As per the report ‘United in Science: the high-level synthesis report of latest science information convened by the Science Advisory Group of the UN Climate Action Summit’, published by World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a UN body, the average global temperature for 2015-2019 is currently estimated to be 1.1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial (1850-1900). The 2015-2019 five-year average temperatures were the highest on record for large areas of the United States, including Alaska, eastern parts of South America, most of Europe and the Middle East, northern Eurasia, Australia, and areas of the south of the Sahara. The report finds that meeting the Paris Agreement (PA) requires immediate and all-inclusive action encompassing deep decarbonisation complemented by ambitious policy measures, protection and enhancement of carbon sinks and biodiversity, and effort to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Further, climate and early warning information services should underpin decision-making on climate action for adaptation as the capacities of countries to deliver climate and early warning information services vary across regions.(c) Climate change is a global phenomenon and requires the cooperation of all nations based on the principles of ‘Equity’ and ‘Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities’. For addressing the challenge of climate change, India adheres to the paramountcy of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) processes. It has proactively contributed to multilateral efforts to combat climate change and continues to do so while undertaking its own independent, enhanced initiatives in climate mitigation and adaptation besides meeting all its commitments under UNFCCC, its Kyoto Protocol (KP) and Paris Agreement (PA). Independent studies rate India’s efforts highly and compliant with the requirements under PA.Under the Paris Agreement (PA), India has submitted the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) with the target to reduce the emissions intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 33 to 35 % by 2030 from 2005 level, to achieve about 40% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, and to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tons of CO2eq through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.********
