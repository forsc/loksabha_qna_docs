ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a), (c) and (d):    Lalitpur-Satna-Rewa-Singrauli (541 km) new line project was included in the Budget 1997-98. The latest anticipated cost of the project is `8248.50 crore. An expenditure of `2426.92 crore has been incurred upto March, 2021. An outlay of `733 crore has been provided for this project for the year 2021-22. Till 2013-14, Lalitpur-Satna-Rewa-Singrauli new line project did not get the adequate fund allocation due to overall limited availability of funds, but since 2014-15, adequate funds have been allotted to the project and execution of the project has been speeded up (`239 crore was provided for the project during 2010-11 to 2013-14. Now, `1121.08 crore has been provided for this project from 2014-15 to 2017-18 and `1538 crore has been provided from 2018-19 to 2021-22).Under Lalitpur Singrauli new line project, 1581 candidates those fulfill all the eligibility conditions have been provided employment in lieu of land acquisition.Further, Rewa-Satna (50 Km) doubling project was included in the Budget 2015-16. The latest anticipated cost of the project is `497.45 crore. An expenditure of `234.45 crore has been incurred upto March, 2021. An outlay of `184 crore has been provided for this project for the year 2021-22. Doubling of Rewa-Satna is also held up on account of stopping the work forcefully by land losers of Bagahalo Kothar village demanding for permanent railway jobs. However, railway has withdrawn its policy of providing job to land loser from 11.11.2019. (b): For a Railway project, Railway acquires land through concerned State District Authorities. All the activities in connection with land acquisition like assessment of land area, amount of compensation to land losers, etc. are under purview of them.*****
