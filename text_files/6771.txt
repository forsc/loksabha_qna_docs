                                                    (a) whether the country would need 615 million tonnes of coal in 2018-19 and that would require State-run Coal India Limited to send average 288 rakes per day through Railways;(b) whether it is also a fact that average overall loading has been 270.8 rakes per day, as on August 31, 2019, if so, the details thereof;(c) whether there would be a spurt in demand of coal transport through Railways only; and(d) if so, whether coal supply through road is unlikely to increase significantly?






ANSWER




MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a): For 2018-19, total coal demand was estimated by NITI Aayog at 991.35 Million Tonne (MT). The indigenous coal availability was estimated at 732 MT, out of which production of Coal India Limited (CIL) was 606.89 MT. In 2018-19, CIL has dispatched 608.14 MT of coal at an average rake loading of 280.7 rakes/day. (b): In 2019-20 (up to 31.08.2019), progressive rake loading of coal sourced from CIL has been 263.4 rakes/day. (c) & (d): Railways is the preferred mode of transport for movement of bulk quantity of coal to distant destinations in the country. With the increase in evacuation of coal, transportation through railways mode is expected to grow. CIL aims to optimize transportation of coal through road mode, keeping in view the issues of traffic congestion & environmental concerns associated with it.   ****
