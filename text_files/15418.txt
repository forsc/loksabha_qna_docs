                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (e): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. *****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 4074 BY SHRI DEVJI M. PATEL TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 18.03.2020 REGARDING RAILWAY CROSSINGS(a): There are 24 level crossings (LCs) in District Jalore under Jodhpur Division.  01 consequential train accident took place at unmanned LCs in Jalore district under Jodhpur Division during the last three years (i.e. 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19).(b): 01 consequential train accident took place at UMLC No. C-94 situated in Jalore District on 25.05.2016.  In this accident, 01 person lost his life and 02 persons sustained injuries.  No accident took place at LC No. C-48.(c): The work of Road Over Bridge (ROB) in lieu of LC No. 56 & 109 was delayed due to delay in environment clearance from Forest Department.  Now the clearance from Forest Department has been obtained and work is in progress.  LC No. 48 is situated on National Highway.  ROB at this LC is to be constructed by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI)/Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH). (d) and (e): Manned LC No. C-94 at Bhinmal and LC-113 at Raniwara does not qualify for their replacement by ROB on cost sharing basis as traffic density at these LCs is less than one lakh Train Vehicle Unit (TVU). Moreover, RUBs at these locations are not technically feasible.  However, ROBs at these locations can be constructed on deposit terms provided State Government agrees to bear complete cost of construction and maintenance subject to its feasibility.*****
