The matter of establishment of Agriculture University in Rajasthan has long been   pursued with the Govt. of Rajasthan, at various levels.   As a result, Govt. of Rajasthan communicated vide Letter No. P.1(4)  Agri-3/2014-Past dated 24/12/2017 wherein, it was requested that instead of   opening a new Agricultural University in the state, the strengthening   of one existing Agricultural University, Kota may be considered for funding.
