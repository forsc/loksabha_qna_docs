ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b)  Yes Sir. The Ministry of Rural Development is implementing the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) with effect from 1st April, 2016 to provide assistance to eligible rural households with overall target to construct 2.95 crore pucca houses with basic amenities.  The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is implementing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U) since 25.06.2015 for giving Central assistance to States/Union Territories (UTs) for providing all-weather pucca houses to all eligible urban households.  The Scheme-wise details of Central Assistance released so far since implementation and the number of houses constructed year-wise, State/UT-wise for PMAY-G and PMAY-U is given in Annexure I & II respectively. (c) & (d)   Under PMAY-G, the target of “Housing for All” by 2022 has been affected by various factors including Covid-19 and availability of state funds. Due to this, the PMAY-G has been approved for continuation till March, 2024 to complete the remaining target within the overall ceiling of 2.95 crore houses. As on 16.12.2021, a total of 1.67 crore houses have been completed under PMAY-G.  Further, against the target of 8,17,439 houses for Tamil Nadu, 7,02,430 houses have been sanctioned and 3,17,873 houses have been completed as on 16.12.2021. The Ministry is taking the following initiatives to ensure timely completion of the houses under PMAY-G for achieving the target of Housing for all: i.	Timely allocation of targets to the States/UTs and sanction of houses to the eligible beneficiaries. ii.	Timely release of funds to States/UTs by the Ministry. iii.	The States/UTs have been requested to expedite sanction and completion of houses approved under PMAY-G.iv.	Daily monitoring on various parameters like gaps in sanction of houses, cleaning of PWL of PMAY-G and release of central share/ state matching share from treasury to SNA.v.	Regular follow ups with the states to ensure provision of land to landless beneficiaries in rural areas.vi.	Expeditious resolution of technical issues and other constraints faced by the States.vii.	Steps are being taken to increase the coverage of Rural Mason Training (RMT) programme which would increase the availability of trained masons leading to faster construction of quality houses.viii.	Awards to the best performing States/UTs, Districts based on performance index dashboard, thereby creating healthy competition and motivation among the States/UTs for achieving the set targets. Under PMAY-U, States/ UTs, including State of Tamil Nadu, have undertaken demand survey under the scheme for assessing actual demand of housing. Against validated demand of 1.12 crore houses, 1.14 crore houses have been sanctioned (including 7,19,853 houses sanctioned in Tamil Nadu). Out of this, nearly 90 lakh houses have been grounded and nearly 53 lakh have been completed and delivered to the eligible beneficiaries, so far. States/ UTs have been advised to expedite the construction of remaining sanctioned houses so that all houses are completed within the stipulated period. (e)        Does not arise. *****
