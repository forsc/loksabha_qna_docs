The objective of DILRMP is to develop a modern, comprehensive and transparent land record management system with the aim to develop an Integrated Land Information Management System which will inter alia: (i) improve real-time information on land; (ii) optimize use of land resources; (iii) benefit both landowners and prospectors; (iv) assist in policy and planning; (v) reduce land disputes; (vi) check fraudulent/benami transactions ; (vii) obviate need of physical visits to Revenue/Registration offices  and (viii) enable sharing of information with various organization/agencies. The major components of the scheme are (1) Computerization of Land Records (2) Computerization of Registration (3) Survey/resurvey (4) Modern record rooms (5) Training & capacity building (6) Project Management Unit (7) Computerization of Revenue Courts and their integration with land records (8) Consent-based integration of  Aadhaar number with land record data base. As innovative features and initiatives of the programme, Unique Land Parcel Identification Number (ULPIN) to assign unique ID to a land parcel and National Generic Document Registration System (NGDRS) to provide a generic software for registration of deeds and documents have been rolled out in 14 and 13 States/UTs respectively.As per entry no.18 and 45 of list II (State list) of the schedule VII to the Constitution ‘Land’ and ‘its management’ fall in the domain of states. Statistics with regard to number of agricultural land disputes are not centrally maintained by the Department.Integration of Aadhaar Number with land records which has now been made a component of DILRMP and authentication of identity of executants of deeds /documents using Aadhaar, based on consent, will check impersonation, fraudulent transactions and land grabbing etc.                                                    ****
