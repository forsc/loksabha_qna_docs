ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) to (c): The Hon’ble Members of Parliament from Odisha have identified 22 Gram Panchayats under Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) since 2019. The total number of Gram Panchayats that have been nominated under SAGY since 2019 in Odisha, Member of Parliament-wise, is given in Annexure-I.The Gram Panchayats, adopted under SAGY, prepare Village Development Plans (VDP) through a participatory process under the guidance of Hon’ble Members of Parliament. The VDP includes prioritised time-bound activities to achieve holistic progress of the village. So far three Gram Panchayats out of the 22 GPs mentioned above have uploaded their VDP containing 136 projects, as per the data available on SAGY website (http://saanjhi.gov.in). Out of these, 23 projects have been completed as on 21st July, 2021. None of these GPs mentioned above have substantially executed their VDPs.(d) : The financing of the projects taken up in the Village Development Plan prepared for SAGY GPs is done through convergence of Central and State schemes, Gram Panchayat  own revenue, resources that can be mobilised locally in cash, kind and labour, and resources from private, voluntary and cooperative sectors such as CSR funds and this is facilitated by the State Government.The District Collector is the nodal officer for implementing SAGY. The District Collector conducts monthly review meetings under the leadership of Members of Parliament concerned with the representatives of line departments to facilitate convergence of schemes in the SAGY GP. The Charge officer for each SAGY GP is appointed by the District Collector for coordinating the implementation of SAGY at the local level and assisting the District Collector for the implementation of projects taken up in the Village Development Plans in SAGY Gram Panchayats.  21 such Charge Officers have been appointed in Odisha.A baseline survey is conducted by the State Government in the nominated SAGY GPs to identify the gaps in infrastructure, amenities and services and prepare a plan for future economic and human development. This Village Development Plan is approved by the District level committeeheaded by the District Collector, in the presence of the Member of Parliament. The monitoring of the implementation of the VDP is done by the State Government through regular reviews in SLEC and at the district level by the District Collector.The implementation of SAGY is overseen by the State Government.The Government of Odisha has constituted the State Level Empowered Committees (SLEC) headed by Chief Secretary to ensure seamless convergence of schemes among different Government Departments as per the priority set in the Village Development Plans of respective SAGY GPs.*******
