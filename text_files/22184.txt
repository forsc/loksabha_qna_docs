                                                        MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS                                   (SHRI D. V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a) & (b):     The size of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients and Intermediates market in India is estimated to be Rs. 96,000 crore in FY 2019-20. India imported APIs and Intermediates worth Rs. 24,000 crore in FY 2019-20 and India exported APIs and Intermediates worth Rs. 27,500 crore in FY 2019-20. However, India being one of the largest manufacturers of drug formulations/medicines is heavily dependent on other countries for import of raw material (APIs and drug intermediates) of many critical drugs. India imports around 70% of its total imports of APIs and drug intermediates from China. It is stated that most of the imports of the Bulk Drugs/APIs being done in the country are because of economic considerations. As per Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), many raw materials are imported from China, for manufacturing of medicine. As per available data from the various Port Offices of CDSCO, the details of the percentage of raw materials imported from China are as under:-Year	Percentage (in terms of value)2019	72.40%2020	72.15%(c), (d) & (e):     No, Sir. xxxxx
