ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	The export of spices from India has been steadily increasing in the past few years. Year wise export of spices from India during the last three years is given below:-TOTAL EXPORT OF  SPICES FROM INDIAYear	Export	Quantity (Tons)	Value (Million USD)2017-18 	1096323	31152018-19	1133889	33222019-20	1193441	3621Source: -   DGCISAs shown in the above table, the export of spices has increased from 10.96 lakh MT valued at 3115 Million USD in 2017-18 to 11.93 lakh MT valued at 3621 Million USD in 2019-20, registering an increase of 16.24% in terms of value in USD and 8.86% in terms of quantity.  (b)&(c):  Cardamom does not face an export ban by Gulf countries on account of  high concentration of pesticide.  However, Saudi Arabia Food & Drug Authority (SFDA) had detained a few consignments of cardamom (small) from India due to the detection of pesticide residue above the Maximum Residue Level (MRL) specified by the SFDA, in April-May 2018. Taking up of the matter with the Government of Saudi Arabia has resulted in revision in the   standards and checking protocols faced by Indian small cardamom exporters, in line with Globally accepted Codex Food Standards. As per the revised standards, MRLs are prescribed only for six pesticides in cardamom, as against over 120 compounds initially prescribed by the SFDA. Spices Board mandated a sampling and testing program for export of small cardamom to Saudi Arabia, to ensure   compliance with the Codex standards.        The Spices Board has been conducting a series of campaigns in the major cardamom growing areas, to popularize Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices among cardamom growers and promote the use of bio-control agents for managing pests and diseases in cardamom. The Board is providing bio-inputs to farmers at subsidized rate for promoting the use of bio agents.   The Board has also issued an advisory to cardamom growers, on the judicious application of pesticides and the use of bio-control agents, in managing pests and diseases in cardamom.******
