ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****Statement referred to in reply to Parts (a) to (c) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 222 to be answered on 09.07.2019(a):	The State-wise details of Central allocation and release of funds under the DRDA Administration Scheme by the Centre  during last three years is enclosed at Annexure “A” and  District wise details of the same in respect of the State of Andhra Pradesh  is enclosed at Annexure “B” . (b) & (c):	No specific suggestions/ complaints have been received  to strengthen the DRDAs for its effective functioning and implementation of scheme during the last three years. However, a Committee had been setup under the Chairmanship of Shri V. Ramachandran by Ministry of Rural Development in 2010 in order to review the functioning of the DRDAs in the Country and to make suitable recommendations for its restructuring. The Committee had made certain recommendations for restructuring of DRDA in its report submitted in 2012. The main recommendations of the Committee were as follows: 1.	To set up District Plan Support Unit (DPSU), in each district to assist the District Planning Committee (DPC)/ Zila Parisad in preparations of District Plan etc.2.	To set up a State level supporting unit with identical composition as DPSU.3.	To abolish society status of DRDA.4.	Transitory arrangement may be made for the staff of DRDAs.The total financial implication for implementing the recommendations of the Committee was estimated at Rs.12,671 crore approximately. The recommendations made by the Committee were initially accepted by the Ministry of Rural Development with some modifications and a Note for Expenditure Finance Committee for restructuring the DRDAs was circulated for inter-departmental consultation.  Subsequently, in the backdrop of observations/comments of Department of Expenditure the matter was re-examined in the Ministry of Rural Development. Considering the complexity of the proposal, the volume of financial implication involved and shrunken role of DRDAs in implementation of centrally sponsored schemes, the proposal for implementation of the recommendations of the Committee was dropped. Subsequently, a Committee on Performance Based Payments for Better Outcomes in Rural Development Programmes was setup by MoRD in December 2016 under the chairmanship of Shri Sumit Bose recommended merger of DRDAs with District Panchayats. Subsequently, an  evaluation study of the DRDA Administration Scheme has also been initiated.*****
