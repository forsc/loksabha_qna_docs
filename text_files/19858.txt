                                                        (a)       PMKVY does not mandate the establishment of training centres. Under PMKVY (2016-20) training is being imparted in empanelled training centres (TCs). As on 19.01.2021, 15,124 training centres have been empanelled and presently 1,595 TCs are operational across the country.

The State-wise number of placed candidates under PMKVY (2016-20) is given at column (b) of Annexure I.             Under PMKVY 2.0 (2016-20), placement opportunities are being provided to successfully certified candidates. There is a provision of one-time re-assessment for the candidates who have either failed or did not appear for assessment. Further, under PMKVY, various initiatives are taken to enhance placement of the certified candidates such as organization of Rozgar Melas with the support of Sector Skill Councils; placement linked release of last tranche funds to the Training Centres (TCs); requirement to have dedicated mentorship-cum-placement cells at TCs / Training Providers (TPs) for industry linkage and placement of candidates; incentive to TCs @ Rs. 3000 per trainee if he or she is retained in employment for 12 months; post placement support of Rs. 1,500 per month per trainee for special areas/special groups;  one time placement travel cost upto maximum of Rs. 4,500 per candidate; implementation of employer-led training model; reallocation of target to TCs based on placement performance;   etc.  Annexure I The state-wise no. of empanelled and operational TCs including Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) and candidates placed under PMKVY 2.0, as on 19.01.2021, is given below:S.
