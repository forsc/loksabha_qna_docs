These seed banks supply seeds of short and medium duration crop varieties to the farmers during contingency situations like flood, drought etc. under which one percent of the total availability of seeds of preceding year in the country is kept every year. The implementing agencies are maintaining the seeds on a regional basis keeping in the view of ease movement of seeds to the affected areas.

However, the Government has a policy to encourage conservation of the seeds of local/indigenous varieties of various crops. The National Gene Bank of National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources and its ten regional stations has conserved 3,24,031 local/indigenous varieties and the National Gene Bank of Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmer’s Rights Authority has also conserved 1806 registered traditional/local/indigenous varieties of different crops.
