                                                        MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (e)  A statement is laid on the Table of the House.  Statement referred to in reply to parts (a) to (e) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 209 asked by Shri Rahul Kaswan and Dr. Vishnu Prasad M.K. to be answered on 8th July, 2019 regarding “Uniform Pricing of Petroleum Products”.(a) The prices of petrol and diesel vary across the country due to freight and local taxes/levies.  (b) & (c)  Prices of petrol and diesel have been made market-determined by the Government with effect from 26.06.2010 and 19.10.2014 respectively. Since then, the Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) take appropriate decision on pricing of petrol and diesel in line with international product prices and other market conditions.  The Government continues to modulate the effective price to consumer for Subsidized Domestic LPG and retail selling price of PDS Kerosene. The prices of petroleum products are linked to the prices of respective products in the international market.   Oil Marketing Companies take a decision on retail selling price after considering various aspects including international product prices, exchange rate, tax structure, inland freight and other cost elements.    With an aim to reduce the prices of petrol and diesel and give relief to the consumers, the Central Government reduced the Central Excise duty on petrol and diesel by ` 2 per litre with effect from 4th October, 2017.  The Central Government further reduced the Central Excise duty on petrol and diesel by ` 1.50 per litre with effect from 5th October, 2018 and Public Sector OMCs also reduced ` 1.00 per litre to reduce the overall price of petrol and diesel. The Central Government also requested the State Governments to make a reduction of ` 2.50 per litre in VAT imposed by them on petrol and diesel. Accordingly, 18 State Governments and 1 Union Territory have reduced VAT on petrol and diesel.The prices of petrol and diesel are available on the website of Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) i.e. www.ppac.org.in. and the prices of domestic LPG and PDS Kerosene since 2016-17 are available on the website of IOCL i.e. www.iocl.com (d) The details of subsidies reimbursed by the Government to OMCs on PDS Kerosene and Domestic LPG the during financial years 2017-18, 2018-19 and the current year  are given below:                                                                                                             (`  Crore)Particulars of subsidy reimbursement 	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20(upto June, 2019)PDS Kerosene	8,696	4,296	4,100Domestic LPG	13,122	16,570	21,449Total Subsidy/Under-recovery	21,818	20,866	25,549(e) As mentioned above, the prices of petroleum products are linked to the prices of respective products in the international market.x-x-x-x-x
