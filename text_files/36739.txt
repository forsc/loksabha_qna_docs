Monitoring Cell in the Impact Assessment Division of the Ministry looks into the compliance of EC conditions by the Project Proponent.Central Government lays significant emphasis on implementation of environmental norms and conditions. The Environment (Protection) Act 1986 (EPA) authorizes the Central Government to undertake all the measures for the protection and improvement of environmental quality, control and reduce pollution from all sources, and prohibit or restrict the setting and / or operation of any activity on environmental grounds. While exercising its powers under the EPA, government has framed laws / subordinate legislations with regard to prohibition and restrictions on the location of industries, processes and operations in different areas.
