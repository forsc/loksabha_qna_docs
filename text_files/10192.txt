ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b): There is no delay in issuing Phytosanitary Certificates (PSC) by Plant Quarantine Stations under Directorate of Plant Protection Quarantine and Storage (DPPQS). The Plant Quarantine Stations inspect the insects, diseases, weeds etc. in agricultural commodities.               Perishable commodities such as nursery plants, tissue cultures, fresh fruits, vegetables, cut flowers etc. are certified within a maximum period of 24-48 Hrs and consignments that require fumigation as treatment are certified within 03 days. 	    Delays occur only when the applications are accompanied with incomplete documents or without paying fee, due to change in weight/buyer/destination, non-availability of authentic Phytosanitary requirements of importing countries, consignments not being  ready for inspection, time taken for  completion of fumigation procedures etc. In some cases, samples are sent to laboratories for testing as per the requirements of importing countries.	    Monthly stakeholders meeting involving exporters/ importers/ CHAs /treatment providers are being organized at Station level so that such procedural issues can be resolved. Further, protocol of timelines is also regularly monitored at DPPQ&S.Contd..2/--2-(c): 	As per the report provided by APEDA, details of export of fresh vegetables to EU are as under-Year	Quantity exported (in MT)	Value (in Rs.
