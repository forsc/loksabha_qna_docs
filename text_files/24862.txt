The proposals are forwarded after thorough scrutiny by the State Government and the State Board for Wild Life headed by the respective Chief Ministers. Incomplete proposals are returned to State Governments by the Ministry. The SCNBWL, which also includes eminent ecologists, conservationists and environmentalists, takes informed decisions on the proposals placed for its consideration. While recommending the proposals, the SCNBWL also imposes a condition that the annual compliance certificate on the stipulated conditions for recommended proposals should be submitted by the project proponent to the State Chief Wild Life Warden and an annual compliance certificate shall be submitted by the State Chief Wild Life Warden to Government of India. Further, SCNWBL has decided in the 59th meeting held on 5th October, 2020 that the Integrated Regional Offices (IRO) of the Ministry shall carry out the monitoring of the conditions imposed by the SCNBWL. Accordingly, the IROs have been requested to carry out the monitoring of the conditions imposed by the SCNBWL.
