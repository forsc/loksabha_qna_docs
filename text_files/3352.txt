ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                    (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a):   The Government of India is aware of the existence of slum settlements along the railway tracks. The Ministry of Railways (MoR) has reported that these encroachments on railway land adjacent to railway tracks cause bottlenecks in train operation & track maintenance and thus affect the safety of trains and passengers. The encroachments near the railway track are also a safety hazard to encroachers. As per train accident data available for the last 5 years, no consequential train accident has occurred on account of encroachment on Railway land as per the findings of the inquiry conducted therein. However, no specific data related to accidents involving encroachers is maintained by Railways.The MoR has also reported that Railways carry out regular surveys and take action for removal of encroachment in zonal railways. If the encroachments are of temporary nature (soft encroachment) in the shape of jhuggies, jhopries, squatters, the same is got removed in consultation and with the assistance of Railway Protection Force and local civil authorities. For old encroachments, where party is not amenable to persuasion, action is taken under Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupation) Act, 1971 (PPE Act, 1971). Actual eviction of unauthorized occupants is carried out with the assistance of State Government and police.(b): Housing being a State subject, the MoR has stated that the State Government/ Urban Local Body may include slums on Railway Land in their plan for rehabilitation/ resettlement of slum dwellers of a city.  The MoR has also added that entire cost of such rehabilitation/resettlement may also be borne by State Government or Urban Local Body as Railways may not be able to contribute towards cost of land or rehabilitation/resettlement.	Further, in order to proactively address the housing requirement of eligible urban households including slum dwellers the Government of India through the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has launched the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) {PMAY(U)} Mission on June 25, 2015 to assist States/ Union Territories (UTs) both financially and technically. The PMAY(U) scheme guidelines advocate that Central Government land owning agencies should also undertake “in-situ” slum redevelopment in their lands occupied by slums by using it as a resource for providing houses to slum dwellers.	Pursuant to the issuance of the scheme guidelines, the MoHUA has written to all State Governments and Central Government land owning Ministries/Departments to explore the possibilities of rehabilitation of slums on their land and seek Central Assistance from the MoHUA under the PMAY(U) Mission.                                *****
