                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) to (d):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****    STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2715 BY SHRI GUMAN SINGH DAMOR TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 04.12.2019 REGARDING MHOW-DHAR-JHABUA-DAHOD RAIL LINE(a) to (d): Dahod-Indore via Sardarpur, Jhabua  and Dhar including material modification for change in alignment via Amjhera (204.76 km)  new line project has been included in the Budget 2007-08. The anticipated cost of the project is `1640 crore. An expenditure of                `640 crore has been incurred till March, 2019 and an outlay of `175 crore has been provided for this project for the year 2019-20. Indore-Rau-Tihi (21 Km) section has been commissioned and work has been taken up in balance section, wherever land is available. The project was envisaged to be completed within a period of 5 years from the year of sanction of the project, but got delayed due to inadequate fund allotment till 2013-14, as, the planning of land acquisition and execution of work was done accordingly. However, from 2014-15 onwards, the project has been getting enhanced funds allotment and the work in this project speeded up. Total Budget Allocation for this project during 2014-15 to 2018-19 has been `476.89 crore, which is 399.13% of total Budget allocation during 2009-10 to 2013-14 (`119.48 crore). The land acquisition of 76 km length out of 204.76 km has been completed so far and land acquisition papers for the balance length of 128.76 km of 889.70 hectare land (275.54 hect. Government land, 529.11 hect. private land & 85.05 hect. Forest land) have been submitted to concerned District Land Authorities in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. `111.73 crore have already been deposited to the State Governments against acquisition of land. This project is quite challenging and involves long tunnels and viaducts. The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions of working agencies/contractors etc. and all these factors affect the completion of the project. Hence, no confirmed time frame can be given for this project.*****
