THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI  PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c) : 	As per the latest data available, the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) registered a growth rate of 1.3 per cent during April - September, 2019-20.  Global GDP growth is forecast at 3.0% for 2019, its lowest level since 2008-09 as per the World Economic Outlook of the IMF, October 2019.  However, despite this global downturn, India continues faster (6.1%) than rest of the world, as per IMF. (d):	The production of industries depends on several factors, such as, domestic demand, demand for exports, level of investment and prevailing prices. Government has taken various steps to increase income of informal sectors and rural income  through schemes like: Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) facilitates self-employment by providing collateral free loans upto Rs. 10 lakh, to micro/small business enterprises and to individuals to enable them to setup or expand their business activities. Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-dhan (PM-SYM). Unorganized workers whose monthly income is Rs 15,000/ per month or less and belong to the entry age group of 18-40 years are eligible for the scheme.

Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) aims to provide income support of Rs. 6000/- to the small and marginal landholder farmer families with cultivable land holding upto 2 hectare across the country.Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen KaushalyaYojana (DDU-GKY) scheme is a placement linked skill development programme for wage employment and covers rural parts of all the States of the country.Deen dayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) aims at creating efficient and effective institutional platforms of the rural poor, enabling them to increase household income through sustainable livelihood enhancements and improved access to financial services through Self Help Groups (SHGs) and federated institutions.Pradhan Mantri Kaushal VikasYojana (PMKVY) enable a large number of Indian youth to take up industry-relevant skill training that will help them in securing a better livelihood.ASPIRE is a scheme for promotion of Innovation, Rural Industry and Entrepreneurship.
