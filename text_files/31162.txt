ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a): 	During last KMS, Telangana State was requested for delivery of 24.75 LMT of the surplus CMR in the form of parboiled rice to Food Corporation of India against Rabi crop of KMS 2020-21 and remaining surplus CMR in the form of raw rice.  .....2/--2-On the request of Govt. of Telangana,  Government of India approved for delivery of another 20 LMT par boiled rice to FCI in addition to already approved 24.75 LMT thereby increasing the delivery of parboiled rice to 44.75 LMT for KMS 2020-21 (Rabi crop) and balance in the form of raw rice.State Govt. of Telangana gave commitment vide letter dated 04.10.2021 that no parboiled rice would be delivered by the State Govt. of Telangana to FCI in future.(b) and (c): 	Yes, Sir. In the States/UTs Food Secretaries meeting held on 17.08.2021, procurement estimate of 40 LMT of rice for the State was fixed by Government of India in consultation with the State Government and Food Corporation of India (FCI) considering estimated production, marketable surplus and agricultural crop pattern. Increase or decrease of procurement estimate is decided on the basis of estimated production, marketable surplus, agricultural crop pattern and PDS requirement.(d): 	State Government agencies and Food Corporation of India (FCI) purchase wheat & paddy with prescribed FAQ specifications at MSP   for Central Pool to ensure that farmers get remunerative prices for their produce and do not have to resort to distress sale. However, if producer/farmer gets better price in comparison to MSP, they are free to sell their produce in open market. Paddy procurement and number of farmers benefitted from MSP operations in the state of Telangana are increasing year on year which indicates increased outreach of MSP operations and farmers getting remunerative price of their produce.****
