ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c)	Vocational Training is a concurrent subject. The development of training schemes at National level, the evolution of policy, laying of training standard, norms, conducting of examinations, certification, etc. are the responsibilities of the Central government, whereas, day to day administration including an admission in ITIs rests with the respective State Governments / UTs. Presently, training courses under the Craftsmen Training Scheme are being offered through a network of 15,510 ITIs located all over the country with total trainees enrolled 22.82 lakhs (in the trades of 1 year and 2 year durations) on NCVTMIS portal with an objective to provide skilled workforce to the industry in 138 NSQF compliant trades.	Further, in order to enhance employability of trainees graduating from ITIs, from the session 2019-20, duration of curricula of employability skill has been increased from 110 hrs to 160 hrs in the first year of ITIs. Besides, web based Employability Skills would be of an additional component of 80 hrs in 2nd year. In addition, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY 2.0) 2016-20 on pan-India basis with an objective to provide skilling to one crore people over four years (2016-2020). Under the scheme, as on 11.11.2019, 64.27 lakhs candidates have been trained, out of which 14.43 lakhs have been placed.	The MSDE, through the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), has taken up multiple initiatives to connect with industries for partnership under the Skill India Mission. 38 Sector Skill Councils have been set up as Industry led bodies which help in training need analysis, curriculum development, rolling out of training and assessment and certification.
