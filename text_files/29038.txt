ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a)  	Eight (08) Passport Seva Kendras (PSKs) and thirty eight (38) Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs) are operational in Maharashtra. The list is attached at Annexure I and II respectively.(b) & (c)	Government had announced five POPSKs in the third phase in Maharashtra viz. Akola, Amravati, Baramati, Chandrapur and Madha. All are now functional.  POPSKs in all three Parliamentary constituencies viz. Osmanabad, Parbhani and Ramtek districts are functional.(d) to (f) Expenditure for PSK and POPSKs are met from the budget of Ministry of External Affairs directly without any earmarking of funds for particular States.	In order to enhance ease in obtaining passports and reduce hardship, the Ministry in association with Department of Posts (DOP) had announced in January, 2017 opening of Post Office Passport Seva Kendra (POPSK) at the Head Post Offices (HPO)/Post Offices (PO) in each Parliamentary constituency where there was no Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) or Post Office Passport Seva Kendra (POPSK). Out of 48 Parliamentary (Lok Sabha) Constituencies in Maharashtra, there are 38 POPSKs and 8 Passport Seva Kendras covering 44 Parliamentary Constituencies. Opening of PSK is an ongoing activity and depends on various factors including distance from the Passport Kendras and volume of applications from a particular region.***
