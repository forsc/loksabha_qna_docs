ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a): Yes, in absolute numbers, India has the largest number of individuals suffering from drug resistant TB. However, as per the latest global TB report, India ranks 38th in the number of MDR-TB patients per lakh population (9.6 per lakh population). The estimated number of Multi drug resistant/ Rifampicin resistant TB (MDR/RR TB) patients in India for 2018 is 1,30,000, which contributes to about 27% of the global burden. Further details are annexed at Annexure.Resistance to anti-TB drugs can occur as an outcome of faulty prescriptions which was previously rampant in the private sector, and is now being managed through better engaging the private sector for detection and treatment of TB. Resistance can also occur if the treatment is discontinued before the prescribed time. To address this, the programme conducts IEC activities to increase the awareness in the public regarding.(b):   The Programme recognizes that a delay in treatment initiation may cause adverse outcomes. Hence, since 2016 RNTCP  has shifted from notification at treatment initiation to notification at diagnosis. This helps in following up all the patients who are diagnosed and ensure that they are initiated on treatment. The Govt. has taken several other corrective measures to address timely diagnosis as well:i.	Active Case Finding (ACF) in vulnerable and high risk populations to actively screen symptomatics and detect TB patients. ii.	Private sector engagement to increase notification and provision of public health action: Ensuring availability of free diagnostics and medicines from the Programme to patients seeking care in the private sector as well.iii.	Strengthening sputum collection and transport mechanisms to ensure early diagnosis. The Programme has also tied up with India Post to increase access. Other mechanisms being strengthened at the local level involve MoUs with courier agencies, human couriers.iv.	Increasing the network of rapid molecular diagnostics to ensure detection of drug resistance at the earliest. The Programme has rolled out Universal Drug Susceptibility Testing (UDST) since 2018 as per which resistance testing for Rifampicin is mandatory for all notified TB patients. v.	Communication campaign aimed at raising levels of awareness, reduction of stigma among community, both through mass and mid media.vi.	To reduce stigma of TB in the community, National, state and district level forums have been set up to provide a platform for TB survivors to voice their views. Network of TB Champions have been created from existing network of 4 lakh treatment supporters and past TB patients and people affected due to TB. With this purpose a standardized curriculum has been developed to support TB Survivors/ to become effective Community TB Mobilizers/Champions. More than 90,000 community members including TB survivors have been sensitized by 305 trained TB Champions in 140 districts in collaboration with REACH (NGO). These TB Champions have also provided patient support services to more than 8000 TB patients.vii.	Further, all Health & Wellness Centres established under Ayushman Bharat have been earmarked as sputum collection centres and DOTS centres from where TB medicines can be taken.  viii.	To ensure affordable care, the Revised National TB Control Programme provides free treatment to all TB patients in the country, irrespective of the sector from which the patient is seeking care. The Programme has made provisions under which private sector health centres can also serve as DOTS Centres and provide RNTCP supplied daily FDC drugs to TB patients.(c):     Hon’ble Prime Minister had launched ‘TB Free India’ Campaign on 13th March 2018 to end TB in India by 2025. To pursue the goal Government has been implementing National Strategic Plan (NSP) (2017-25) to End TB by 2025. Active Case Finding is one of the most important strategy being implemented to find the missing cases in the community. In 2017, three rounds were conducted as national campaign, more than 5.5 crore population had been screened and a total of 26781 additional TB cases were diagnosed. In 2018, three rounds were conducted as national campaign, more than 18.9 Crore population had been screened and total 47307 additional TB cases diagnosed. The Hon’ble Health and Family Welfare Minister also launched the TB Harega Desh Jeetega Campaign on 25th September 2019 in which new sets of IEC material have been launched and disseminated to states. An “Accelerator to National Strategic Plan” includes following key components under “TB Harega, Desh Jeetega” campaign:1.	Community Engagement 2.	Advocacy and Communication 3.	Health & Wellness centres and TB4.	Inter-Ministerial collaboration 5.	Private health sector engagement6.	Corporate sector engagement7.	Latent TB Infection Management(d) & (e):   The Govt. offers medicines to TB patients through a decentralized mechanism wherein medicines are provided by treatment supporters who may be member of the community residing in the vicinity of the TB patients, health workers such as  ASHA, or even members of the patients’ family. The patient may also choose to take medicine from the peripheral health facility. Decision on treatment support plan is decided by patient and providers, based on patient convenience and choice. ……………….
