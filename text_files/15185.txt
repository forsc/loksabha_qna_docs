The Coverage under the Act is substantially high to ensure that all the vulnerable and needy sections of the society get its benefit.          Under the Act, households covered under Antyodaya Anna Yojna (AAY) are entitled to receive 35 Kg of food grains per household per month at ?1/2/3 per kg for coarse grains/wheat/rice respectively, and Priority House Holds are entitled to receive 5 Kg of food grains per month at the above prices. At present, the Act is being implemented in all the States/UTs.             The Act also has a special focus on the nutritional support to women and children. Pregnant women & lactating mothers and children upto 14 years of age are entitled to nutritious meals, free of cost, as per the prescribed nutritional standards and in case of non-supply of entitled food grains or meals, the beneficiaries are entitled to receive Food Security Allowance.             In the UTs of Chandigarh, Puducherry and urban areas of Dadra & Nagar Haveli, NFSA is being implemented in cash transfer mode under which cash equivalent of subsidy is being transferred directly into the bank accounts of eligible households to enable them to purchase food grains from open market.               In addition to NFSA, GoI is also allocating food grains under welfare schemes such as Wheat Based Nutrition Programme (WBNP), Mid Day Meal Scheme (MDM), Scheme for Adolescent Girls (SAG), Allocation of food grains under Welfare Institutions & Hostel Scheme and Annapurna Scheme.                 Further, to address anemia and micro-nutrient deficiency in the country, the Government of India has approved Centrally Sponsored Pilot Scheme on ‘Fortification of Rice & its Distribution under Public Distribution System’. Under the scheme, the rice is to be fortified by mixing the normal rice with Fortified Rice Kernels (FRKs) with added micro-nutrients namely Iron, Folic Acid and Vitamin B-12.***
