                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a): 	During Financial Year 2020-21 a total quantity of 548.15 LMT foodgrains have been allocated for all the States/UTs under Public Distribution System(PDS).(b):  	Under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), allocation of foodgrains have been made for around 80 crore beneficiaries of all the 36 States/UTs covered under NFSA (Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) & Priority Households (PHH)) including those covered under Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT).......2/--2-Under Atma Nirbhar Bharat Scheme (ANBS), the Government liberally allocated free of cost foodgrains to cater to about 8 Crore migrants/stranded migrants. All the States/UTs put together, after their overall assessment on the ground, had estimated a total of about 2.8 Crore such migrants/stranded migrants, who did not posses any ration card for assistance under the ANBS. Under the scheme, foodgrains were distributed to an average of about 2.74 Crore migrants/stranded migrants (i.e. nearly 98% of the total estimated number of migrants/stranded migrants). The responsibility of identifying the beneficiaries under ANBS was given to the States/UTs.(c): 	The Targeted Public Distribution System under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013 is operated under the joint responsibility of Central and State/UT Governments. It is the responsibility of the State/UT Governments to identify eligible households/beneficiaries covered under NFSA namely Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and priority households (PHH) as per criteria evolved by the concerned State/UT Government. Issuance of their ration cards and distribution of foodgrains to them as per their entitlement through fair price shops, is also the responsibility of the respective State/UT Govt.(d):  	The ONORC plan which empowers all NFSA beneficiaries, particularly migrant beneficiaries, is enabled in 33 States/UTs, about 69 Crore beneficiaries (almost 86.7% NFSA population) in the country to have an option to lift their entitled foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) by using their same existing ration card. Presently, an average of about 1.3 to 1.5 Crore portability transactions (intra-state/inter-state) are recorded under ONORC every month.****
