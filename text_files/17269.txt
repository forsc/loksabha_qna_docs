It aims to give a push to Indian App ecosystem through shortlisting of the top Indian Apps that have the potential to become global competitors in their respective categories. (b):  The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has blocked 224 mobile apps under the provisions of section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India and security of State.(c):   ‘MeitY Start-up Hub'' (MSH) has been setup under the aegis of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) for promoting technology innovation and start-ups. The vision of MSH is to build a conducive innovation ecosystem by bringing together various technology innovation stakeholders.
