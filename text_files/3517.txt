                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):   The transfer of funds to State Health Societies (SHSs) through Treasury mode was adopted in 2014-15 under National Health Mission (NHM), a flagship programme of the Department of Health & Family Welfare. There are instances where the transfer from Treasury to SHS account does not takes place in a time bound manner. Lack of timely and uninterrupted availability of funds adversely affects   smooth and effective implementation of approved activities under NHM. State Governments have been repeatedly requested to ensure timely release of funds from Consolidated Fund of States to the State Health Societies (SHSs) The Ministry from time to time follows up with the States for timely transfer of funds to SHSs.(c) &(d):   This Ministry had requested to Ministry of Finance for considering the proposal to switch into society mode for transfer of funds under NHM.  In response, the Ministry of Finance has communicated that NHM is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme partly funded by the State Governments, as such in the spirit of co-operative federalism; it may not be desirable to disturb the current arrangement.…………………
