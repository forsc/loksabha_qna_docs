Under this programme, an apex level National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO) at New Delhi and Five Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organizations (ROTTOs) at Chandigarh, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Guwahati have been set up. The Government has released funds to establish State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organizations (SOTTOs) in the States of Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan, Haryana, Goa, Jammu & Kashmir, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar and Gujarat to organize an efficient mechanism for organ and tissue procurement/retrieval to promote deceased organ and tissue donation.Further, to improve infrastructure for human organ and tissue retrieval, storage and transplantation in all parts of the country, following provisions have been made:•	Setting up of National/ Regional/State Bio-material centres;•	Financial support for establishing new Organ Transplant/retrieval facilities and strengthening of existing Organ Transplant/retrieval facilities.•	Training to transplant experts including surgeons, physicians, transplant coordinators, etc.•	Financial support for provision of Transplant Coordinators to medical colleges and trauma centres.		NOTTO, ROTTOs and SOTTOs disseminate relevant information about organ donation in the public. A website www.notto.gov.in and a 24x7 call centre with a toll free helpline number (1800114770) have been made operational. A number of activities, for generating awareness and for imparting training to all those associated with transplant activities including doctors and transplant coordinators, such as celebration of Indian Organ Donation Day, seminars, workshops, debates, sports events, walkathons, participation in marathons, nukkad natak, etc. are organized at different places in the Country. Advertisement in print media, audio-visual messages and talks to promote cadaver organ donation are also telecast on Doordarshan and other television channels from time to time.(c) & (d):	Organs like Heart, Kidney, etc. need to be transplanted immediately after retrieval. However, the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO) has a facility of National Level Tissue Bank (Biomaterial Centre) for storing tissues. Under the National Organ Transplant Programme (NOTP), provision has been made for providing financial support to the States for setting up of Bio- material centre. As of now a Regional Bio-material centre has been established at Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (ROTTO), Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Further, funds have been released to the State of Bihar and Maharashtra for establishment of Bio-material Centres under NOTP.
