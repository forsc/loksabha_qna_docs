ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICUTLRURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ?? ????? ?????? ??????			                  (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	Armour chilli is a high yielding chilli F1 hybrid with tolerance to leaf curl virus (LCV). Armour chilli is the name given to an F1 Hybrid Chilli developed by a Private Company M/s Nunhems Seeds (BASF) Company, registered in Telangana State.As per the company information, Armour is preferred for pungency and fruit drying quality. It is early maturing, has good yield potential and high disease tolerance against leaf curl virus. Fruits are large, straight, green on fresh and attractive red at ripe maturity.However, during 2020, ICAR-IIHR, Bengaluru identified a new chilli F1 hybrid Arka Tejasvi (H41) for release. The hybrid has performed consistently at par with Armour chilli for yield, fruit quality and tolerance to leaf curl virus (LCV) for two years when evaluated at the Institute. This year (2021), large scale seed production of Arka Tejasvi has been taken up for distribution to KVKs and Institutes to study Arka Tejasvi performance across the Country. Arka Tejasvi (H41) has also entered into AICRP (Vegetable Crops) and state varietal trials (MLTs).ICAR-IIVR, Varanasi has also developed few advanced lines of chilli tolerant to leaf curl virus and could be of export potentiality. These lines are used for developing hybrids in chilli. (b)	So far as the price of seed of armour chilli is concerned, there is no mechanism to fix the price of seed of any crop other than BT Cotton Seed. However, average price of armour chilli seeds could be Rs. 900-1200 per 10 g seeds as per the information from company sources i.e M/s Nunhems Seeds (BASF) Company.(c)	The company released this F1 hybrid in 2019. Therefore, 5-year data may not be available with the company.Moreover, Armour chilli is not a notified variety.  Hence it is not in seed production chain.(d)	Armour chilli is not a notified variety, hence it is not in seed production chain. This hybrid is from a private Company and its distribution and supply is coordinated by the Company.(e)	Not applicable.**************
