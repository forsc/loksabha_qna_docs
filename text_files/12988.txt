                                                                                THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE                                 (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a)	Yes Sir. The number of assessees filing Income Tax Returns (ITRs) has consistently increased during 	each of the last three years as well as in the current year.  (b) 	The total number of ITRs filed for the period under reference is as follows: S.No.	                Assessment Year	        Total number of e-Returns                                                (excluding revised returns)                                                         (in Crore) 1	                  AY 2016-17	                  5.18 2	                  AY 2017-18	                  5.32 3	                  AY 2018-19	                  6.28 4	                  AY 2019-20*                     6.35                          (up to 15-Feb-2020)	      * 	The belated ITRs of AY 2019-20 can be submitted up to 31-Mar-2020, therefore, this number will 	increase further. 	State/UT wise details of the ITRs filed along with total income tax liability involved in such ITRs are enclosed as Annexure-A.(c)	The Income Tax Department has implemented the Non- Filers Monitoring System (NMS) which 	assimilates and analyses in-house information as well as transactional data received from third- 	parties, including Statements of Financial Transaction (SFT), Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) and 	Tax Collection at Source (TCS) statements, Intelligence and Criminal Investigation (I & CI) data etc. 	to identify such persons/entities who have undertaken high value financial transactions but have not 	filed their returns. 	The number of non-filers with potential tax liabilities identified in the last three Financial Years are as follows: -            NMS Cycle 6 (AY 2016-17)	:	 32.00 lakhs             NMS Cycle 7 (AY 2017-18)	:	 38.81 lakhs            NMS Cycle 8 (AY 2018-19)	: 	 15.58 lakhs(d)	The State/UT wise details of non-filers are enclosed as Annexure-B. Follow up action in these cases, 	including issue of statutory notices calling for return, making of tax assessment, levy of penalty and institution of prosecution has been taken in appropriate cases.(e)	Several other steps have been taken by the Government to ensure compliance of Income-tax Act by all assessees in the country including:1.	The Income-tax Department has launched ‘Project Insight’ to strengthen the non-intrusive 	information driven approach to increasing tax compliance. Project Insights focus on three goals 	namely: (i)	Promote voluntary compliance and deter non-compliance. (ii)	To impart confidence that all eligible persons pay appropriate tax. (iii)	To promote fair and judicious tax administration.2.	The mechanism for collection and verification of financial information has been broadened to include data in respect of various types of high-value transactions received from banks and financial 	institutions and high-value expenditure received from commercial establishments in the form of 	Statements of Financial Transaction (SFT). 3.	Quoting of Permanent Account Number (PAN) has been made mandatory for specified transactions 	in respect of property, shares, bonds, insurance, foreign travel and, demat account, etc.4.	E-mails and SMS reminders are issued to taxpayers to file their return and pay their due taxes.5.	The Department has set up Taxpayers’ Lounges at various events/ trade fairs/exhibitions to generate tax awareness among the general public. Apart from generating awareness, tax payers services like information of PAN and other services are provided to facilitate ease of tax compliance.6.	The Income-tax Department has launched publicity campaigns on TV Channels, Radio, Print Media, 	Cinema Halls and on Social Media to spread awareness among citizens regarding due dates for filing 	Returns, TDS Return, Payment of taxes and PAN-Aadhar linkage. Brochures have also been 	distributed to the general public through the Department’s Aayakar Sewa Kendras (ASK) all over India to spread awareness and increase compliance.                                               ******
