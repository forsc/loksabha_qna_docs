ANSWER




                                                        The MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a):	The curriculum of the National Law Universities (NLUs) are drawn up by the respective institutions. The nature and the format of the syllabus besides theoretical classes on various laws and jurisprudence also include project assignments practical training, moot courts, interdisciplinary research, clinical courses, internships etc. This intensive exposures given to the students of NLUs has helped in developing their professional abilities to handle litigation of all kinds including corporate litigation, legal advice, conveyancing etc. competently. The Bar Council of India as a part of its statutory responsibility has also framed Rules of Legal Education, 2008 under the power conferred by the Advocates Act, 1961 that deals with determination of quality and standards of legal education and recognition of degree in law. (b) & (c): The NLUshave been established through State enactments. They have benefited from allocations of land infrastructure, financial grants and other development assistance from the State Governments, besides generating their own revenues. The NLUs in spite of being creation of State law, most of them admit students on merit through open competitive examination which determines the profile of the students. Further, in order to enable meaningful and effective law teaching, considerable autonomy has been given to them in matters such as the recruitment of teachers and staff as well as the framing and frequent revision of the curriculum.
