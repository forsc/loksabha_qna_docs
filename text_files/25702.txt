ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU) (a) & (b): As per the Memorandum of Procedure, for the appointment of Judges of High Courts, the Chief Justice of the High Court is required to initiate the proposals in consultation with two senior-most Judges from amongst the eligible candidates from the Bar and concerned State Judicial Service six months prior to the occurrence of vacancies.Filling up of vacancies in the High Courts is a continuous, integrated and collaborative process between the Executive and the Judiciary. It requires consultation and approval from various Constitutional Authorities both at the State and Centre level. Every effort is made to expedite the process of appointment of Judges following the due procedure. A statement showing the vacancy position and appointments made during last 03 calendar years in respect of Supreme Court of India and High Courts is at Annexure-I.	Under Article 235 of the Constitution of India, the administrative control over the members of district and subordinate judiciary in the States vest with the concerned High Court. Further, in exercise of powers conferred under proviso to Article 309 read with Articles 233 and 234 of the constitution, the respective State Government, in consultation with the High Court, frames the Rules and Regulations regarding the issue of appointment, promotion, reservations and retirement of Judicial Officers in the State Judicial Service.  Hence, in so far as recruitment of judicial officers in the States is concerned, respective High Courts do it in certain States, whereas the High Courts do it in consultation with the State Public Service Commissions in other States. The Union Government does not have a role under the Constitution in the selection and appointment of judicial officers in District/ subordinate judiciary. The Supreme Court, in its orders of 04th January, 2007 in Malik Mazhar case, has devised a process and time frame to be followed for the filling up of vacancies in subordinate judiciary which stipulates that the process for recruitment of judges in the subordinate courts would commence on 31st March of a calendar year and end by 31st October of the same year. The Supreme Court has permitted State Governments / High Courts for variations in the time schedule in case of any difficulty based on the peculiar geographical and climatic conditions in the State or other relevant conditions.   Further, in compliance of the above directions of the Supreme Court, Department of Justice forwarded a copy of the Malik Mazhar judgement to Registrars General of all High Courts for necessary action. Department of Justice is writing from time to time to Registrars General of all High Courts to expedite the  filling up of vacancies in subordinate judiciary mandated by Malik Mazhar case. A statement showing the sanctioned strength, working strength and vacancy position of Judicial Officers, State-wise, is at Annexure-II.(c): The approved Judge strength of the Kerala High Court as on date is 47. Presently, 37 Judges (including 4 Judges from other High Courts) are functioning in the Kerala High Court. Thus a total of 10 vacancies is existing in Kerala High Court. As per the information made available by High Courts on MIS portal of Department of Justice, as against the sanctioned strength of 541 Judicial Officers in Kerala, there are 464 Judicial Officers in position and 77 vacancies as on date.******Sl.
