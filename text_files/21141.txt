                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (e):	No such incidence has been brought to the notice of the Government. In general, use of on-farm organic inputs and adoption of Integrated Organic Farming Systems (IOFS), where use of external inputs is minimized to a great extent, result in reduction of input cost. The research studies under ICAR-All India Network Programme on Organic Farming indicate that comparable yield or slightly higher yield to that of conventional management can be obtained in kharif and summer crops in 2 to 3 years, while in rabi crops the yield stabilizes after 5 years.	In compliance to the Organic farming policy 2005, organic farming scheme of Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) has been operational in the country since 2015-16 including the state of Uttar Pradesh for the promotion of organic farming.  Financial Support is provided to the farmers for inputs, certification, post-harvest infrastructure creation and value addition including marketing and branding through the scheme. Under PKVY, an assistance of Rs 8800/ ha is provided to the clusters for marketing, branding, trade etc. In addition, farmers can sell their organic products on jaivikkheti.in portal.	Government of Uttar Pradesh has established two organic outlets in Jhansi & Banda and also eighteen organic outlets have been established at all the eighteen divisional Mandis for the direct marketing of organic produce by the farmers. In U.P., the Jaivik Kisaan Bazar is being organized at Lucknow on 1st & 3rd Saturday & Sunday of every month since September 2018.	To ensure transparency in a fair and easy manner GoI has initiated online Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) certification System in which, PGS Portal captures all stages of production, processing and handling which is further authenticated by transaction certificate for verification by buyers.********
