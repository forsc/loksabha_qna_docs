ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) & (b) Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) generates ground water quality data of the country on a regional scale as part of its ground water quality monitoring program and various scientific studies. These studies indicate the occurrence of contaminants such as Fluoride, Arsenic, Nitrate, Iron and Heavy Metals beyond permissible limits in various States / UTs. The ground water contamination is mostly geogenic in nature and does not show significant change over the years. However, nitrate contamination is mostly anthropogenic and its spread has been noticed in some areas, particularly areas adjoining habitations. Further, nitrate contamination can also be caused by excessive use of fertilizers.  		State-wise details of contamination of ground water in the country including rural areas are given at Annexure. (c) Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management, including its quality is primarily States’s responsibility; however, various steps have been taken by the Central Government for controlling ground water pollution in the country. 		Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in association with State Pollution Control Boards/Pollution Control Committees (SPCBs/PCCs) is implementing the provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control) Act, 1974 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to prevent and control pollution  in  water.  CPCB  has made a comprehensive programme on water pollution for controlling point Contd…P/2//2//sources by developing industry specific standards and general standards for discharge of effluents notified under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for enforcement by SPCBs/PCCs.  		This Department has issued guidelines for control and regulation of groundwater extraction with pan-India applicability notified on 24 September 2020 which include suitable provisions on measures to be adopted to ensure groundwater free from pollution. 		Various efforts have been made in the country to address surface water pollution (leading to groundwater pollution at places) by installing Sewage Treatment Plants, Effluent Treatment Plants and better system of sewage networks etc. Further, the adverse effects of the groundwater pollution can be addressed to a large extent if safe water is made available to public for which central Government in partnership with States/UTs, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) since August, 2019 to provide potable tap water supply of prescribed quality to every rural household in the country by 2024. 		Further, the quality of groundwater can be improved to some extent if concerted efforts are made to improve the groundwater resources through appropriate groundwater recharge/rainwater harvesting. Central Government has taken a number of initiatives in this direction which can be seen at URL:http://jalshakti-dowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Feb2021.pdf.  ***** ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) & (b) of Unstarred Question No. 691 answered in Lok Sabha on 02.12.2021 regarding “Ground Water Pollution”.States Wise Number of Partly Affected Districts with different Contaminants in Ground Water of India.S.No.	State/ UT	Salinity (EC above 3000 micro mhos/ cm)(EC: Electrical Conductivity)	Fluoride(above 1.5 mg/l)	Nitrate(above 45 mg/l)	Arsenic(above 0.01 mg/l)	Iron(above 1mg/l)	Lead (above 0.01 mg/l)	Cadmium (above 0.003 mg/l)	Chromium (above 0.05 mg/l)1	Andhra Pradesh	12	12	13	3	7			2	Telangana	8	10	10	1	8	2	1	13	Assam		9		19	18			4	Arunachal Pradesh					4			5	Bihar		13	10	24	19			6	Chhattisgarh	1	19	12	1	17	1	1	17	Delhi	7	7	8	2		3	1	48	Goa					2			9	Gujarat	21	22	24	12	10			10	Haryana 	18	21	21	15	17	17	7	111	Himachal Pradesh			6	1				12	Jammu & Kashmir		2	6	3	9	3	1	13	Jharkhand		12	11	2	6	1		14	Karnataka	29	30	29	2	22			15	Kerala	4	5	11		14	2		116	Madhya Pradesh	18	43	51	8	41	16		17	Maharashtra	25	17	30		20	19		18	Manipur		1		2	4			19	Meghalaya		1			6			20	Nagaland		1			1			21	Odisha	17	26	28	1	30			122	Punjab	10	19	21	10	9	6	8	1023	Rajasthan	30	33	33	1	33	3		24	Tamil Nadu	28	25	29	9	2	3	1	525	Tripura					4			26	Uttar Pradesh	13	34	59	28	15	10	2	327	Uttarakhand			4		5			28	West Bengal	6	8	5	9	16	6	2	229	Andaman& Nicobar	1				2			30	Daman & Diu	1		1	1				31	Puducherry			1		 	Total	Parts of 249 districts in 18 states & UTs	Parts of 370districts in 23 states & UTs	Parts of 423districts in 23states & UTs	Parts of 154 districts in 21 states & UTs	Parts of 341 districts in 27 states & UTs	Pb in parts of 92 districts in 14 states	Cd in parts of 24 districts in 9 states	Cr in parts of 29 districts in 10 states*****
