                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)	As of now, there is no proposal for establishing new Regional Passport Office. At present, there are 36 Passport Offices in the country including three in Uttar Pradesh.

Further, as on 27 June, 2019, there are 505 Passport Kendras - 93 Passport Seva Kendras (PSK) and 412 Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSK) - operational in the country, including 52 in Uttar Pradesh. The list is at Annexure-II. These Passport Kendras are operational across the country as extended arms of the 36 Passport Offices. Seven more POPSK are to be opened in Uttar Pradesh at Barabanki, Basti, Farrukhabad, Hardoi, Kushi Nagar, Nagina and Robertsganj in near future.	The opening of Passport Kendras in the country, including in Uttar Pradesh, is an on-going activity and depends on various factors, including distance from the existing Passport Kendras and volume of applications from a particular region. (c) & (d) In order to facilitate the passport needs of the residents in and around Agra, including Fatehpur Sikri, two POPSK have been made operational at Achnera and Agra.
