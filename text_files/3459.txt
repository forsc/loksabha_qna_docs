ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FORJAL SHAKTI(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b) Yes Sir.As reported by Ministry of Earth Sciences, Southwest monsoon onset over Kerala (June 8 2019) and its further progress across the country has been delayed by a week due to the formation and movement of the very severe cyclonic storm “Vayu” in the Arabian Sea.Water is a State subject. The identification of water scarce / drought hit areas is done by States. After identification of such areas, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare is approached by States for financial assistance. This Ministry supplements the efforts of State Governments for improving the coverage of rural drinking water supply by providing technical and financial assistance through centrally sponsoredNational Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP).There is no provision under NRDWP to release special assistance to water scarce States specifically.	To take relief measures for restoration of  drinking water supply in water scarce areas, States may utilize up to 25% of NRDWP funds as flexi funds, in case of any natural calamity including drought. States can also take long term measures using NRDWP funds for providing permanent solution to the drinking water problem in such areas.
