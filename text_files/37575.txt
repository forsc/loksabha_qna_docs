                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a)	& (b):	“Public Health and Hospitals” is a State subject, hence, the primary responsibility of providing healthcare services to the people of the country lies with the State Governments. However, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India provides technical and financial support to the States/UTs to strengthen the public healthcare facilities reach to the last mile. Support is provided to States/UTs under the National Health Mission (NHM) for universal access to equitable, affordable & quality health care services to all citizens of the country based on the requirements posed by States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs).Regarding last mile delivery of various health services across the country, the Government of India has launched Ayushman Bharat Yojana in 2018 which has two components namely, Ayushman Bharat-Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs) and Pradhan Mantri Jan ArogyaYojana (PMJAY). Under Ayushman Bharat- Health & Wellness Centres, all the existing sub centres and primary healthcare centres are  upgraded and strengthened as Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs).  These centres are envisioned to provide the 12 packages of Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) including services for maternal and child health, services to address communicable and non-communicable diseases and services for elderly and palliative care, bringing healthcare closer to the homes of people with an expanded range of services to address needs of the entire population in their area, expanding access, universality, and equity close to the community. AB-HWCs also provisioned to provide free essential medicines and diagnostic services, teleconsultation, and health promotion including wellness activities like Yoga. Under Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), a health assurance scheme, Government of India provides a health cover of Rs. 5.00 lakhs per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization to cover 10.74 crores poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries).The Mobile Medical Units (MMU) are supported under NHM to increase the access in remote, difficult, and hard to reach areas.States have the flexibility to deploy more numbers of ambulance and MMUs in hilly, tribal, and remotest areas to provide better coverage of outreach services. Further, to ensure the quality of health services in public health facilities, Indian Public Health Standards guidelines are in place. (c) & (d): COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted unprecedented healthcare demand, requirements and challenges in India, particularly in terms of health infrastructure and laboratory capacity. The schemes namely, India COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health Systems Preparedness Package (ECRP-I), India COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health Systems Preparedness Package-Phase-II (ECRP-II), XV Finance Commission Grants (XV-FC) and PM Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM) has been lunched to manage and deal most efficiently the future similar pandemics in the country without compromising daily economical activities.
