ANSWER




                                                        (a)  The Government of India has developed infrastructure for Ro-Ro & Ro-Pax services,  including dredging of channels  at  Gogha-Dahej,  and Ro-Ro jetties and associated infrastructure to facilitate movement of passengers in coastal States.    Some of the important steps taken  by the Government to develop cruise shipping in India include the following :(i)	Cabotage waived till 5th Feb, 2029 for foreign flag passenger/cruise ships to call at more than one Indian Port.(ii)	Simplified standard operating procedures have been put in place for handling cruise ships across the country. (iii)	New initiatives like e-visa and e-landing card have been introduced by immigration department for quick immigration clearance.(iv)	Modernization of cruise terminals and construction of new cruise terminals.(v)	Guaranteed berths to cruise ships, along with attractive concessions in port related charges. (vi)	Biometrics of passengers exempted in case of e-visa for 3 years for ease of travel.(b)	     Data is maintained only for total number of passengers travelled by sea route and not separately for Indian passengers.  (c)   The following Rules have been notified by the Ministry, in line with the provisions of International Convention on Prevention of pollution from ships (MARPOL) and the provisions of Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, to deal with Marine Pollution:i.	The Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Pollution by Garbage from Ships) Rules, 2009ii.	The Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Pollution by Sewage from Ships) Rules, 2010iii.	The Merchant Shipping (Control of Pollution by Noxious Liquid Substances in Bulk) Rules, 2010iv.	The Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Pollution by Oil from Ships) Rules, 2010v.	The Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Pollution by Harmful Substances Carried by Sea in packaged form) Rules, 2010.          All Indian Ships are periodically surveyed and a certificate issued for compliance with the above Rules.          To prevent contravention of these Rules, surprise inspections are conducted by authorized Surveyors on Indian and Foreign Flag vessels through powers granted under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958. Penal provisions also exist under this Act for any contraventions.           A centralized online portal called “Swachh Sagar” has been developed for request and provisioning of waste reception facility. This portal also monitors whether end disposal of collected waste is in accordance with local laws.         To reduce pollution of air by sulphur oxides, MARPOL, Annex VI (Prevention of Air Pollution) has been amended and it mandatesthat from 1 January 2020 sulphur content of fuel used on board ship should not exceed 0.5% mass/mass. In this regard, the Directorate General of Shipping has issued Engineering Circular 02 of 2019 implementing the same on Indian ships and foreign ships coming to Indian ports..                                          ******
