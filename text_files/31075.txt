                                                        (a): Yes, Sir.  Government of India’s goal is to make India a significant design and manufacturing hub in the Global Value Chain for Electronics as part of its AtmaNirbhar Bharat Economic policies. As part of this, we are broadening and deepening our Electronics Eco-system. In the post COVID-19 global business and trade environment, there are many changes that represent challenges and opportunities for India. Global companies are looking to diversify their manufacturing locations to mitigate the supply chain risks. National Policy on Electronics 2019 (NPE 2019) envisions positioning India as a global hub for Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) by encouraging and driving capabilities in the country for developing core components, including chipsets, and creating an enabling environment for the industry to compete globally.In order to boost electronics manufacturing in the country and attract, incentivize large investments in the electronics value chain and promote exports, following four Schemes have been notified:(i)	Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing was notified on 1st April, 2020. PLI Scheme extends an incentive of 6% to 4% on incremental sales (over base year) of goods under target segments that are manufactured in India to eligible companies, for a period of five (5) years subsequent to the base year (FY 2019-20). Incentives are applicable under the scheme from 01.08.2020. 16 companies have been approved under the first round of PLI Scheme for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing.Over the tenure of PLI Scheme, the 16 approved companies are expected to lead to total production of more than INR 10,50,000 crore (INR 10.5 lakh crore). Out of the total production of INR 10,50,000 crore in the next 5 years, around 60% is expected to be contributed by exports of the order of INR 6,50,000 crore. The companies approved under the scheme is expected to bring an additional investment in electronics manufacturing to the tune of INR 11,000 crore.After the success of the First Round of PLI Scheme in attracting investments in mobile phone and electronic components manufacturing, Second Round of the PLI Scheme for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing was launched on 11.03.2021 for incentivising Electronic Components. Under the Second Round, incentives of 5% to 3% shall be extended on incremental sales (over base year i.e. FY 2019-20) of goods manufactured in India and covered under the target segment, to eligible companies, for a period of four (4) years. 16 companies have been approved under the second round of PLI Scheme for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing.Over the tenure of Second Round, the 16 approved electronic component manufacturers are expected to generate a total production of upto INR 12,432 crore.
