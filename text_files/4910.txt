                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):	Public health expenditure as a percentage of Gross State Domestic Product in select States, as per National Health Accounts Estimates 2015-16, may be seen at Annexure. (b):	The National Health Policy, 2017 envisages increasing State sector health spending to more than 8% of their budget by 2020. (c):	The document ‘Three Year Action Agenda, 2017-18 to 2019-20’ of NITI Aayog states that “Government expenditure on public health should be increased significantly to cover screenings for the entire population, active case detection and disease surveillance including from the private sector. Additionally, evidence-based preventive health interventions like breastfeeding as well as infant and young child feeding during the first two years of life should be mainstreamed through adequate budgetary allocations and plans of action at the national-level”.(d) Under the National Health Mission (NHM), the annual resource envelope of a State is decided based on its population, and a weightage factor derived from the State’s area, health lag and socio-economic backwardness of the State.  The Mission Steering Group of NHM has approved the weightages for financial allocation of funds to States. For UP and Bihar, the weightage is 1.3.
