ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY  (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) :		Government of India had launched Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) in December, 2014 for rural electrification works across the country.  As reported by the States, all the inhabited un-electrified villages as per census 2011 stand electrified on 28th April, 2018 across the country under DDUGJY. A total of 18,374 villages were electrified under the scheme.Under various rural electrification schemes, such as DDUGJY and Saubhagya, 2.817 Crore households were electrified across the country up to 31.3.2021. State-wise details of the households electrified are at Annexure.(b) :		Setting up of a Generation Plant is a de-licensed activity under the Electricity Act, 2003. Utilities take their own decision to retire their old and inefficient unit based on their techno-economic and commercial considerations. However, through a Central Government notification dated 13.03.2021, a framework has been put in place for category wise retirement of Thermal Power plants for emission norms on various dates before 31.12.2025 beyond which an environment compensation of Rs. 0.20 per unit of electricity would be levied from them.(c) :		A series of steps taken by the Government of India has helped to arrest the price hike of electricity in recent past. Such steps include(i)	Government of India announced a Liquidity Infusion Scheme (LIS) through Power Finance Corporation (PFC) Ltd. and Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) Ltd. as a part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan. Under this intervention, REC and PFC are extending special long term transition loans up to 10 years to Discoms. As on 07.12.2021, PFC & REC have disbursed Rs 1,03,387 crore to various Power Discoms. This has reduced the burden of Late Payment Surcharge of Discoms.(ii)	CERC, in accordance with the directions issued by the Government of India under section 107 of the Act, had issued an order to the effect that if any delayed payment by the DISCOMs to the generating companies and inter-state transmission licensees beyond 45 days from the date of the presentation of the bills falls between 24.03.2020 and 30.06.2020, the concerned distribution companies shall make the payment with LPS at the reduced rate of 12% per annum.(iii)	The Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge) Rules, 2021 notified on 22.02.2021 has reduced the rate of Late Payment Surcharge. This will reduce the financial burden of Discoms.(iv)	Discoms have also been permitted to exit from the Power Purchase Agreement of Central Generating Stations which have completed 25 years. This will reduce the power purchase cost of the Discoms.(d) : 		Ministry of Coal has informed that Coal India limited (CIL)has targeted to install around 3000 MW of solar power projects till 2024, in order to offset the current level of power consumption which will help CIL to become Net Zero Energy Company. Further, Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas has informed that ONGC is essentially an exploration and production company and has also implemented few projects on renewable energy.(e) & (f) :	A strong National grid with adequate redundancy already exists in the country and there is no plan to install second national grid. A framework exists for expanding the National grid on a continuous basis to take care of growth in load and generation.**********
