                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (c) The Dynamic Ground Water Resources of the country are being periodically assessed jointly by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and State Governments. As per the 2017 assessment, out of the total 6881 assessment units (Block/ Taluks/ Mandals/ watersheds/ Firkas) in the country, 1186 units have been categorized as ‘Over-exploited’ where the Annual Ground Water Extraction is more than Annual Extractable Ground Water Resource. State-wise details of areas affected by Arsenic and other contaminants viz. Salinity, Fluoride, Nitrate,  Lead, Cadmium and Chromium in ground water, as per data available with CGWB are given at Annexure.Government of India launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan which is a time bound campaign with a mission mode approach intended to improve water availability including ground water conditions in the water stressed blocks of 256 districts in India. In this regard, teams of officers from Central Government along-with technical officers from Ministry of Jal Shakti were deputed to visit water stressed districts and to work in close collaboration with district level officials to undertake suitable interventions.Water being a State subject, efforts to conserve and manage ground water is primarily States responsibility. A number of States have done notable work in this regard.  Of these, mention can be made of ‘Mukhyamantri Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan’ in Rajasthan, ‘Jalyukt Shibar’ in Maharashtra, ‘Sujalam Sufalam Abhiyan’ in Gujarat, ‘Mission Kakatiya’ in Telangana, ‘Neeru Chettu’ in Andhra Pradesh among others.¬¬¬¬¬Further, the important measures taken by the Central Government for conservation, management of ground water and effective implementation of rain water harvesting in the country are at the following URL: http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf.*****ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) to (c)  of Unstarred Q.No. 4014 to be  answered in Lok Sabha on 12.12.2019 regarding “Water Stressed Blocks”.States Wise Number of Partly Affected Districts with different Contaminants in Ground Water of IndiaS.No.	State/ UT	Salinity (EC above 3000 micro mhos/ cm)(EC : Electrical Conductivity)	Fluoride(above 1.5 mg/l)	Nitrate(above 45 mg/l)	Arsenic(above 0.01 mg/l)	Iron(above 1mg/l )	Lead (above 0.01 mg/l)	Cadmium (above 0.003 mg/l)	Chromium (above 0.05 mg/l)1	Andhra Pradesh	12	12	13	3	7			2	Telangana	8	10	10	1	8	2	1	13	Assam		9		19	18			4	Arunachal Pradesh					4			5	Bihar		13	10	22	19			6	Chhattisgarh	1	19	12	1	17	1	1	17	Delhi	7	7	8	2		3	1	48	Goa					2			9	Gujarat	21	22	24	12	10			10	Haryana 	18	21	21	15	17	17	7	111	Himachal Pradesh			6	1				12	Jammu & Kashmir		2	6	3	9	3	1	13	Jharkhand		12	11	2	6	1		14	Karnataka	29	30	29	2	22			15	Kerala	4	5	11		14	2		116	Madhya Pradesh	18	43	51	8	41	16		17	Maharashtra	25	17	30		20	19		18	Manipur		1		2	4			19	Meghalaya		1			6			20	Nagaland		1			1			21	Odisha	17	26	28	1	30			122	Punjab	10	19	21	10	9	6	8	1023	Rajasthan	30	33	33	1	33	3		24	Tamil Nadu	28	25	29	9	2	3	1	525	Tripura					4			26	Uttar Pradesh	13	34	59	28	15	10	2	327	Uttarakhand			4		5			28	West Bengal	6	8	5	9	16	6	2	229	Andaman & Nicobar	1				2			30	Daman & Diu	1		1	1				31	Puducherry			1						Total	Parts of 249 districts in 18 states & UTs	Parts of 370districts in 23 states & UTs	Parts of 423districts in 23states & UTs	Parts of 152 districts in 21 states & UTs	Parts of 341 districts in 27 states & UTs	Pb in parts of 92 districts in 14 states	Cd in parts of 24 districts in 9 states	Cr in parts of 29districts in 10 states*****
