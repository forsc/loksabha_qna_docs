ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b): District Skill Committees (DSCs), under the guidance of respective State Skill Development Missions (SSDMs), are playing a key role in addressing the skill gap and assessing demand at the district level including in rural areas. The DSCs have been entrusted with the development of District Skill Development Plans (DSDPs) to promote decentralized planning and implementation at the grassroots.  To build capacity of the DSCs and to help them manage skill development planning and program delivery, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) attaches Mahatma Gandhi National Fellows with the district administration. The Fellows are posted as part of their academic programme in premier management institutes, which has an in-built component of on-ground practical experience. So far, a total of 512 DSDPs have been received from 31 States/ Union Territories. The DSDPs identify sectors in which employment opportunities and demand for skilling exists. (c): In order to address the skill training requirement of migrant workers identified under the Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan (GKRA), MSDE has taken up district-specific demand-driven skilling/ orientation for sustainable livelihood opportunities for the reverse migrant workers under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY). This program is being implemented across 119 districts of 6 States namely Assam, Bihar, Odisha, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. The total number of migrant workers trained so far under this program is 70,823. While selecting the job roles for training, factors like placement/ job opportunity at the local/ district level, facilitation of bank loan to support self-employment, and matching of existing job roles available at the local Training Centres have been considered.  (d) & (e): The DSDPs developed by the DSCs identify sectors that have potential for employment in the local economy. Under PMKVY 3.0, which was launched on 15.01.2021, skill training has been made demand-driven, with the DSCs identifying the job roles relevant to their district. In the long run, this would have the effect of ensuring that candidates skilled in job roles would increasingly get employed in the same region.
