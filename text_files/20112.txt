In the critical Left Wing Extremism affected blocks (as identified by Ministry of Home Affairs), additional relaxation has been given to connect habitations with population  of 100 persons and above (2001 census). The scheme has also an element of upgradation of existing rural roads in districts where all the eligible habitations of the designated population size have been provided all-weather road connectivity. The mandate of the scheme have been subsequently widened to include new interventions namely PMGSY-II with a target to upgrade 50,000 Kms of the existing rural road network to improve its overall efficiency as a provider of transportation services for people, goods and services and PMGSY-III for consolidation of 1,25,000 Km Through Routes and Major Rural Links connecting habitations,  inter-alia, to Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs), Higher Secondary Schools and Hospitals.  All road works constructed under PMGSY are covered by initial five year maintenance contracts to be entered into along with the construction contract, with the same contractor, as per the Standard Bidding Document. Maintenance of roads beyond 5 years is also done by the State Government. This is limited and does not exist as a regular intervention.

Further release of funds to the programme implementation units (PIUs) at the district level is done by the respective state depending on the projects sanctioned to the district and expenditure plan. As informed by the State Government of Haryana, all works of PMGSY-I and PMGSY-II have been completed physically and financially. The district-wise expenditure towards upgradation of roads under PMGSY-I and II in the State of Haryana are given at Annexure-I & II respectively. The State has been allocated target length of 2,500 km under PMGSY-III, against which 688.94 Km of roads worth Rs. 383.58 crore has already been sanctioned.
