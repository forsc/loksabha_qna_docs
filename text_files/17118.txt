ANSWER




                                                        (a):	In pursuance of the Government’s vision of “Housing for All” by 2022, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) is implementing  Pradhan  Mantri  Awas  Yojana (Urban)  PMAY(U)]      for providing assistance to States/ Union Territories (UTs) for addressing the housing requirement in urban areas.  Out of total 1,07,50,082 houses sanctioned so far under the scheme, 21,73,749 houses have been sanctioned in the past 12 months.(b):	Yes, Sir.  The Ministry has evolved a strategy to meet the funding requirement for PMAY(U) through budgetary resources as well as Extra Budgetary Resources(EBR).  Apart from year-on-year budgetary allocation, the Union Cabinet has approved ?60,000 crore of EBR of which ?48,000 crore have already been raised.(c):   On account of lockdown due to ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, construction activities under the scheme were affected for a short period due to disruption in supply chain of construction materials and non-availability of construction labour. However, construction work has since resumed after the lockdowns were lifted in phases as per advisories issued by Central/State/UT Governments.  All efforts are being made to accelerate the pace of construction and complete the projects within the given timelines.                                       *****
