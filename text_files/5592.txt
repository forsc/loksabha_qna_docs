                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)a)	Government of India has identified 112 districts all over the country which have shown relatively less progress in key social and economic performance indicators. This includes two districts of Gujarat, namely Narmada and Dahod. These districts were selected on basis of a composite index of under-development. This index was composed of databases pertaining to Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC), select data bases of health, nutrition, education and basic infrastructure. List of data sets used for identification of district and weight attached to them is placed on annexure-I. b)	On January 5, 2018, Government of India has launched Aspirational District Programme (ADP) by terming the 112 backward districts including Narmada and Dahod as Aspirational Districts. Under this programme, 49 key performance indicators under health, nutrition, school education, agriculture and water resources, skill and financial inclusion and basic infrastructure have been selected and are closely monitored. Government of India has also nominated a Joint Secretary/Additional Secretary level officer to act as Central Prabhari Officer for each of the district. The strategy of the scheme includes convergence among existing schemes, constant monitoring of identified indicators and ranking of the districts to foster a sense of competition etc. Due to its focused approach, since its inception, the programme has led to significant improvement in identified performance indicators.
