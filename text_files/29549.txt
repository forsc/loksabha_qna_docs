ANSWER




                                                          (a) & (b): Ministry of Tribal Affairs was running a separate Scheme under which funds were provided for running Vocational Training Centres (VTCs) by the State Governments / NGOs. Vocational Training Centres that were run by various State Governments are at Annexure 1. However, as a part of rationalization of schemes of the Ministry, the intervention of Vocational Training Centres has been subsumed under the Schemes of ‘Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS) and Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution from 2018-19 onwards, wherein funds are provided to State Governments for carrying out Skill Development / Vocational Training programmes. These schemes are demand driven. Proposals received from the State Government under these schemes are appraised and approved by the Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) in the Ministry for funding depending upon the availability of funds under the relevant scheme(s).  Besides, Ministry is also implementing Van Dhan Vikas Karyakram with a view to target livelihood generation for tribals by harnessing the wealth of forest i.e. Van Dhan. The programme aims to tap traditional knowledge and skill sets of tribals by adding technology & IT to upgrade it at each stage and to convert the tribal wisdom into a viable economic activity to help them becoming self-reliant and entrepreneurs. Under this Karyakram, tribal community owned Minor Forest Produce (MFP) centric multi-purpose Van Dhan Vikas Kendra Clusters (VDVKCs) are set-up in tribal dominated districts. These Clusters act as common facility centres for procurement and value addition to locally available Minor Forest Produce. Value addition of raw produce results in enhancing the value of the MFP and consequently the income of the gatherers. Van Dhan Vikas Karyakram is primarily the training and development of value chain. (c):      Details of funds provided for skill development and vocational training of tribal persons under the schemes ‘Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS) and Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution during last four years is at Annexure 2. State-wise No. of VDVKCs sanctioned during the last three years with beneficiaries are at Annexure 3. Funds available under these schemes were released to the States / State Implementing Agencies commensurating achievement of defined objectives catering to skill development and livelihood generation for ST people. Ministry of Tribal Affairs has not received any adverse report from any State Government regarding the scheme(s) not achieving its objectives.(d):      The following steps are taken to review/ monitor the implementation of the schemes / programmes administered by the Ministry: (i)     MoTA has developed an online portal “ADI-GRAMS” to monitor effective planning, management and implementation of 5 Schemes/Grants of MoTA i.e. “SCA to TSS”, “Conservation-cum-Development of PVTG”, "MSP to MFP”, “Institutional Support” and “Grant under Article 275 (1) of the constitution. The portal is meant to capture necessary data and information for monitoring of these schemes/grant.(ii)    During Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) meetings the information on the progress on implementation of previous sanctioned projects is discussed in details and updated status is ascertained from the State Government officials.(iii)   Utilization Certificates are insisted upon as a prerequisite for further release of funds as per provisions of GFR.(iv)   Progress reports regarding the status of implementation of schemes are obtained.(v)     Officers while visiting States/UTs also ascertain the progress of implementation of various schemes/ programmes of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.(vi)   Review Meetings/ Conferences are convened at the Central level with State officials for ensuring timely submission of proposals, speeding up of implementation of the schemes/ programmes, and reviewing the physical and financial progress.
