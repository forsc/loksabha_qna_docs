ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b)	The Government has identified “compostable plastic” as one of the alternatives to the regular plastic. The Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016 specify standards/norms for “compostable plastic”. To promote the use of such plastics, the restrictive provision of minimum thickness of fifty microns is not applicable to the carry bags made up of Compostable plastic, conforming IS/ISO 17088. Further, a committee has been constituted by Central Institute of Plastics Engineering & Technology (CIPET) with respect to research and development for Compostable/Biodegradable Technologies on Plastic. A committee has also been constituted by the Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals to explore the possibility of Oxo-biodegradable plastic as an alternative to the regular plastic. The cost of production of cellulose based bio-plastics depends upon the type of raw material used. At present, the compostable plasticare mostly made up of poly lactic acid which in most of the cases is imported.*****
