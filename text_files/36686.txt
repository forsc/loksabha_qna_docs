ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) Central Water Commission maintains a database of large dams in the National Register of Large Dams (NRLD). As per NRLD 2019, total number of large dams in the country is 5,745 out of which, 5,334 dams are completed and  411 dams are under construction. State/UT-wise list of large dams as per NRLD 2019 is given at Annexure. (b) As per NRLD 2019, there are 1,157 number of operational large dams in the country which are between 50 to 150 years old. However, no such dam has been reported by the State Governments or other dam owners to be in obsolete condition or in a condition which may threaten water scarcity. The life of a dam is normally till such time it performs its intended functions without jeopardizing the safety of people living in its vicinity.  (c) to (e) In order to improve the safety and operational performance of select existing dams in the country, Government of India is implementing the Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP) with external funding. Under the World Bank funded DRIP Phase-I programme, which was implemented during April 2012 to March 2021, 223 existing dams located in 7 States have been comprehensively audited and  rehabilitated at a cost of Rs. 2,567 crore. After completion of DRIP Phase- I programme, Government of India has now taken up DRIP Phase-II & III. The scheme envisages rehabilitation and safety improvement of 736 dams located in 19 States, with a budget outlay of Rs 10,211 crore. The scheme is of 10 years duration. DRIP Phase-II has become operational from 12th October 2021, and is being co-financed by the World Bank and the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank. Further, Union Government has recently enacted the Dam Safety Act, 2021 for proper surveillance, inspection, operation and maintenance of the specified dams for prevention of dam failure related disasters. As per this Act, dam owners have to earmark sufficient and specific funds for maintenance and repairs of the specified dam and are required to undertake dam safety related inspections and activities as per the schedule prescribed in the Act. *****ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3581 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 24.03.2022 REGARDING “OLD DAMS”.
