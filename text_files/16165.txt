ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT  (SHRI  RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)   (a) to (f):   The policy of the Government is to promote all Indian Languages including Classical Languages. Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL) works for  the promotion of    -2-  all Indian languages including four classical languages viz. Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam and Odia. There is a separate institute namely Central Institute of Classical Tamil (CICT) which works for the development and promotion of Classical Tamil. The Government of India is promoting the Sanskrit Language through three  Deemed  Universities. Funds are provided to these deemed universities for teaching and research in  Sanskrit language leading to award of degree, diploma, certificate to students and no separate funds are provided for undertaking any work related to classical aspect of Sanskrit.  No funds have so far been provided for promotion of Classical Malayalam and Classical Odia as Centres for these languages, though approved, are yet to establish.    Details of grants released / allocated during the last three years for the promotion of remaining three Classical Languages are as under:-  <pre>          (Rs. in crore) No. Classical Language 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 1. Kannada 0.91 0.92 0.92 2. Telugu 1.00 1.00 0.99 3. Tamil 5.02 10.27 5.45  </pre>Classical languages are promoted on several counts including promoting research on old manuscripts, knowledge texts, their interpretation, digitization and publication, etc.  Classical languages are by default ancient languages having a history of around 1500 years or more. Being dynamic entities, languages keep on changing over time.   Census of India also does not enumerate such data as informed by Central Institute of Indian Language (CIIL).   The funds are allocated to Centres for Classical languages based on their needs and requirements.    ***
