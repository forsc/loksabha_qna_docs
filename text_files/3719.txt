(a)to (c): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN ANSWER TO PART (a) TO (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.303* (3RD POSITION) FOR 15th JULY, 2019 REGARDING CSR FUNDS FOR SAANSAD ADARSH GRAM PANCHAYATS.(a)	to (c) :  Schedule VII of the Companies Act, 2013 (Act) enlists areas or activities that may be undertaken by a company as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). CSR should not be interpreted as a source of financing the resources gaps in Government Schemes. However, under Section 135 (3) & (4) of the Act and rules made thereunder, the Board of a CSR eligible company is competent to take decision on supplementing any Government Scheme, including Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, provided that the scheme permits corporate participation and all provisions of Section 135 of the Act and rules made thereunder are compiled with by the company. Majority of the items under Schedule VII have components of both rural and urban development projects. Panchayat-wise data of CSR expenditure is not captured in the MCA21 registry. Thus, it is not possible to provide spending on Saansad Adarsh Gram Panchayats. Therefore, amount spent by companies under CSR for Saansad Adarsh Gram Panchayat for Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh is not available with the Ministry. All data reported by Companies on CSR is available on National CSR Portal at www.csr.gov.in.  ******
