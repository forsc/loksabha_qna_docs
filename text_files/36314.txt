SINGH)(a) :   		National Smart Grid Mission (NSGM) was established by Government of India in 2015 to plan and monitor implementation of policies and programmes related to Smart Grid activities in India. The primary aim of the Smart Grids is to improve reliability of the Electricity networks and make the grid amenable to renewable energy inputs through distributed generation.  Further, increased efficiencies with Smart Grid and Smart Meters empower the consumers to manage their electricity consumption in a better manner and help them in reducing their bills. In addition, the NSGM also envisages capacity building initiatives for Distribution Sector personnel in the field of Smart grids.(b) :    		So far, 40,19,755 Smart Meters have been installed across the country, as on 11.03.2022 including the ones installed under NSGM. Details of the same are available as Annexure.(c) & (d) : 	The Impact Assessment of smart grid pilot projects including Smart City Pilot at IIT Kanpur and Smart Grid Knowledge Center (SGKC), Manesar was carried out by M/s Quality Control of India (QCI) and it was observed that there is considerable achievement in most of the DISCOMs/utilities with progress being made in bringing down AT&C losses.		Large scale deployment of prepaid smart meters has been done by Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) in Bihar. As per information made available by South Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited (SBPDCL), collections after installation of prepaid Smart Meters have improved to the extent of 20%.**************
