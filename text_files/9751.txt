 MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(Shri Ramesh Pokhriyal ''Nishank'')(a)to (c) 	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 292 FOR 09.12.2019 ASKED BY ADV. ADOOR PRAKASH, HON’BLE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT REGARDING UNREST IN HIGHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTES.(a) to (c) Higher educational institutions of the country are working as per their academic plans and some of them are gaining global recognition for excellence in academic and research activities.Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) is one of the foremost university in India, and a world-renowned centre for teaching and research. It ranks second in the NIRF University Rankings. There has been no change in its tuition fees for the last about two decades, which is less than Rs 300 per year and about 70 percent of its students are in receipt of fellowship / scholarship. It has been learnt from university administration that the rent for its hostel rooms, which were Rs 10 and 20 per month about 40 years ago, have been increased to Rs 300 and Rs 600 respectively.Certain cases of complaints from some universities have come to the notice. Although the universities are autonomous bodies and competent to take decision on its own, however, whenever the situation arises that any help is needed in the matter of redressal of grievances, the ministry extends its help. Recently, JNU has revised the hostel fees after about forty years like other central universities to meet the expenditure on maintenance on no profit no loss basis. But students have complained against this increase. Therefore, the Ministry has constituted a high power committee which is looking for an amicable solution in consultation with all stakeholders and in the meantime JNU has further revised the hostel charges and reduced the same.*****
