The Gross Revenue of two private operators i.e. Airtel and Vodafone/Idea has also reduced in FY 2017-18 and FY 2018-19. For BSNL and MTNL, stiff competition in mobile segment, high employee cost and absence of 4G services (except in few places for BSNL) in the data-centric telecom market is eroding their competitive strength. (c)	Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad and M/s Deloitte were engaged to facilitate the preparation of the revival/restructuring plan of BSNL and MTNL respectively. Pursuant to their recommendations and approval of respective Boards, a comprehensive revival plan for BSNL and MTNL is under preparation.
