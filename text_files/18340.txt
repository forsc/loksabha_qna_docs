                                                        MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR) (a)	to (d): All programmes telecast on private satellite TV channels are required to adhere to the ‘Programme Code’ prescribed under the Cable Television Networks Rules, 1994. In pursuance of the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s Judgement dated 02.08.2018 in the matter of Sampurna Behura vs. UOI & Ors. in WP(C) No. 473 of 2005, this Ministry issued two advisories on 03rd August, 2018 and 31st  August, 2018 advising all private TV channels not to display photo of victims of sexual abuse and to ensure strict compliance of the order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. Necessary action is taken by the Ministry whenever any violation of Programme Code is established. Press Council of India has formulated the ‘Norms of Journalistic Conduct’ for adherence by the print media which include the norm on ‘Right to Privacy’. It has been specifically provided that while reporting crime involving rape, the names, photographs of the victims or other particulars directly or indirectly leading to their identity shall not be published. Press Council of India takes action on any complaint against Print Media for violation of the norms within the provisions under Section 14 of the Press Council Act, 1978 and Press Council (Procedure of Inquiry) Regulations, 1979.      *********
