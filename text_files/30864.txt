ANSWER




                                                        (a) A Committee has been constituted headed by Dr. N. C. Saxena (Retd IAS) to examine and recommend Model Guidelines for Conservation, Management and sustainable use of Community Forest Resources (CFR Guidelines in short) under Forest Rights Act, 2006 for Forest Dwelling Scheduled Tribes(FDSTs) and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (OTFDs) including Vulnerable Tribal Groups’. The above said Committee is already deliberating over a suggestive CFR Guideline for the purpose of providing a clear understanding of the concept pertaining to Community Forest Resource (CFR) / detailed procedural aspects etc. to encourage implementation of the community forest management and conservation regime in the spirit of the Forest Rights Act, 2006 and this is a part of the ongoing process of the implementation of the said Act.  Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) is already seized of the need for conservation, management and sustainable use of Community Forest Resources under Forest Rights Act, 2006 and hence, on 23.4.2015, MoTA issued Guidelines under Section 12 of the Act with regard to  recognition and vesting of Community Forest Resources (CFR) and its management under FRA, 2006 and subsequently, on 22.9.2015, MoTA also issued advisory to all State Governments to make an assessment on the potential CFR area in their jurisdiction and to direct the District Level Committees (DLCs) at the various Districts that necessary steps be taken to ensure that CFR rights are recognized in all villages with forest dwellers. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is committed to ensure implementation of the Act in accordance with the Act and Rules there under. As a part of this commitment, Ministry of Tribal Affairs and Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India have issued a joint communication on 6th July.2021, addressed to all the State Governments, except Mizoram and Nagaland where the FRA is not applicable, regarding the expeditious implementation of the Forest Rights Act, 2006 in accordance with statutory provisions and procedures thereunder. (b)     No, Sir. Ministry of Rural Development, Department of Land Resources (DoLR) is the nodal Ministry at the Centre which plays a monitoring role in the field of land reforms. Land and its management fall under the exclusive legislative and administrative jurisdiction of States as provided under the Constitution of India [Seventh Schedule – List ii (State List) – Entry No. (18)]. Land acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement are done by the State Governments.   *****
