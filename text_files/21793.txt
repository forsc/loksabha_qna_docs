ANSWER




MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) & (b):   Manufacturing activities in the 23 working mills of National Textile Corporation (NTC) Limited were put under suspension pursuant to the imposition of lockdown as a measure to avoid spread of COVID-19 under the national lockdown plan in March, 2020.  Presently, the restoration of mills operation in NTC has been started in a phase manner.  The mill selected for reopening are those which are expected to generate substantial positive cash flow because of their inherent capacity. Considering the market demand and financial constrains, operation in New Bhopal Textile Mills, Bhopal is presently under suspension.(c):     There is no such proposal at present.***
