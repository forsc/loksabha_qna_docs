                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a): In the “Crime in India” report, National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) publishes crime data from all the States/Union Territories under various crime heads which are defined under the Indian Penal Code and Special & Local Laws. No separate data for mob lynching is maintained by NCRB.-2-L.S.US.Q.NO.3089 FOR 22.03.2022(b) to (d):	It is the intention of the Government to comprehensively review the existing Criminal Laws and make them relevant to the contemporary law and order situation as well as to provide speedy justice to the vulnerable sections of the society and create a legal structure which is citizen-centric. The Department–related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs, in its 146th Report dated 23.06.2010, had recommended that there is a need for a comprehensive review of the Criminal Justice System of the country. Earlier the Parliamentary Standing Committee in its 111th and 128th Reports had also stressed upon the need to reform and rationalize the criminal law of the country by introducing a comprehensive legislation in Parliament rather than bringing about piece-meal amendments in respective Acts. Government of India has initiated the process for comprehensive amendments to criminal laws in consultation with all the stakeholders.‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and State Governments are responsible for prevention, detection, registration and investigation of crime and for prosecuting the criminals through their law enforcement agencies. However, the Ministry of Home Affairs has issued advisories to States and -3-L.S.US.Q.NO.3089 FOR 22.03.2022UTs, from time to time, to maintain law and order and ensure that any person who takes law into his/her own hand is punished promptly as per law. An advisory dated 04.07.2018 was issued to the States and UTs to keep watch on circulation of fake news and rumours having potential of inciting violence, take all required measures to counter them effectively and to deal firmly with persons taking law into their own hands. Further, advisories dated 23.07.2018 and 25.09.2018 were issued to the State Governments/UT Administrations for taking measures to curb incidents of mob violence in the country. *******
