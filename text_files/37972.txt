ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(DR. SUBHAS SARKAR)(a) & (b): The University Grants Commission (UGC) has informed that for promotion of equality and empowerment of women, it runs the scheme of “Development of Women’s Studies in Indian Universities and Colleges”. The UGC programme for promotion of women’s Studies envisages financial assistance to Universities and Colleges for setting up centres and cells for Women’s Studies. The Centres/Cells are required to undertake research, develop curricula and organize training and extension work in the areas of gender equity, economic self-reliance of women, girls’ education, population issues, issues of human rights, social exploitation etc. Presently, 159 (84 in Universities and 75 in Colleges) Women’s Studies Centres have been established under the scheme.  (c) & (d): Though the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020 does not specifically mention about Centres for Women’s Studies, it recognizes the special and critical role that women play in society and in shaping social mores. The NEP, 2020 envisions that providing a quality education to girls is the best way to increase the education levels for the Socio-Economically Disadvantaged Groups (SEDGs), not just in the present but also in future generations. The policy thus recommends that the policies and schemes designed to include students from SEDGs should be especially targeted towards girls in these SEDGs. *****
