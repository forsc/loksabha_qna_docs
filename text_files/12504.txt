ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER FOR HEAVY INDUSTRIES & PUBLIC ENTERPRISES(SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR) (a) to (c): A statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** Statement in reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 140* for reply on 11.02.2020 regarding “Decline in Job Opportunities for SCs / STs / OBCs in PSUs” by Hon’ble Member Shri Pallab Lochan Das.(a): Job reservation is available to Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) as per the extant Government policy. The Government follows a policy of disinvestment in CPSEs through Strategic Disinvestment and Minority Stake sale. The Minority Stake sale does not involve transfer of management control of CPSE. Strategic Disinvestment implies disinvestment of substantial stake of government shareholding of CPSEs along with transfer of management control. It is expected that the strategic buyer will bring funds / technology / new management etc. for the optimum development of business potential of the CPSEs under Strategic Disinvestment. The growth of the CPSEs, post disinvestment, would be able to generate higher economic activity including growth of the ancillary industries and will create job opportunities for all including SCs, STs and OBCs.(b & c): Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) being a nodal coordinating Department for CPSEs issues instructions to CPSEs to follow guidelines issued by the Government from time to time in regard to reservation in employment. *****
