                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) & (b) Malnutrition in the country is assessed periodically by specialised National Family Health Survey, (NFHS) being conducted by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. NFHS – 4 and 5 were conducted during 2015-16 and 2019-20 respectively. However, the recently released report of NFHS-5 (2019-20) is available for 22 States/UTs. Further, the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) was also conducted by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare during the year 2016-18. State/UT wise details of stunted, wasted and underweight children under 5 years as per NFHS-4, NFHS-5 and CNNS are at Annexure I which includes states of Bihar and Rajasthan. Prevalence of undernutrition among women is 22.9% which is an improvement from the levels of 35.5% reported in NFHS-3 conducted in 2005-06. State/UT wise details of underweight among women aged 15-49 years, as per NFHS-4 and NFHS-5 are at Annexure II which includes states of Bihar and Rajasthan.(c)        Government of India implements the Anganwadi Services Scheme, Scheme for Adolescent Girls, POSHAN Abhiyaan and Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana under the Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services Scheme (ICDS) as targeted interventions to improve nutritional status of Children, Adolescent Girls and Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers throughout the country. In order to check increasing malnutrition among children and women, Government of India has focussed on building convergence of all Nutrition related Schemes on the target population under POSHAN Abhiyaan. Recently, Government has also taken measures to strengthen nutritional content, delivery, outreach and outcomes with focus on developing practices that nurture health, wellness and immunity to disease and malnutrition. Steps have also been taken to improve nutritional quality and testing, strengthen delivery and leverage technology under the ''Poshan Tracker'', a robust ICT enabled platform, to improve governance with regard to real time monitoring of provisioning of supplementary nutrition for prompt supervisions and management of services. Also, Guidelines on Quality Assurance, Roles and Responsibilities of Duty Holders, procedure for procurement, for transparency, efficiency and accountability in delivery of Supplementary Nutrition have been streamlined. Government has advised States/UTs to ensure that the quality of supplementary nutrition conforms to prescribed standards laid down under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and regulations made thereunder. States/UTs have also been advised to promote use of AYUSH systems for prevention of malnutrition and related diseases. A programme to support development of Poshan Vatikas at Anganwadi centres to meet dietary diversity gap leveraging traditional knowledge in nutritional practices has also been taken up. Mission Poshan 2.0, an integrated nutrition support programme, has been announced in Budget 2021-22. (d)        POSHAN Abhiyaan seeks to convert the agenda of improving nutrition into a Jan Andolan or People’s Movement involving Panchayati Raj Institutions/village organizations, etc. Jan Andolan aims to address the issue of malnutrition through behaviour change by adopting a convergent approach through 18 partnering Ministries/Departments. The Abhiyan focuses on capacity building through training and has provision of incentives and awards for AWWs/AWHs.****Annexure IState/UT wise details of malnourished children as per National Family Health Survey (NFHS) and Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS)S.
