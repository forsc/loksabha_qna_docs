ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c) Land and colonization being a State subject, States / Union Territories are governed by their respective rental laws.   In order to meet urgent need for housing for migrant people and considering the importance of rental housing in realizing the vision of Housing for All, this Ministry has prepared a draft Model Tenancy Act (MTA).  MTA aims to promote rental housing by balancing and protecting the interest of both the tenant and owner by regulating renting of premises in an efficient and transparent manner through an adjudicating mechanism for speedy dispute resolution.                    ******
