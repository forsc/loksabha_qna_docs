ANSWER




                                                                            THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE                 MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                      (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a)to (e): As soon as COVID-19 struck, Smart Cities undertook immediate measures to contain its damage and prepare better for their fight against the pandemic.  Smart Cities responded to the crisis in an agile manner due to their early actions to leverage existing smart infrastructure like the Integrated Command and Control Centres (ICCCs). These ICCCs were converted into COVID-19 War Rooms and became the epicenter of coordinated actions amongst various stakeholders for dealing with the pandemic. These actions can be classified into four broad areas viz. Information, Communication, Management and Preparedness. Some key actions undertaken by Smart Cities are given in Annexure-I.  As on date, out of 100 Smart Cities, Integrated Command & Control Centres (ICCCs) have been operationalized in 76 Smart Cities. All 100 Smart Cities deployed innovative solutions, both using digital technology or otherwise, to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic. No comparative study has been carried out by Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs (MoHUA) on the performance of Smart Cities vis-à-vis other cities in management of COVID-19 pandemic. However, extensive documentation of innovations in Smart Cities during COVID-19 times has been done by MoHUA.  Details of steps taken by these Cities to manage the pandemic have been documented as “The Smart Responses to COVID-19: A Documentation of Innovative Actions by India’s Smart Cities during the Pandemic” which is available on smartnet.niua.org. Apart from this, a document titled “Technology and Data Governance in cities: Indian Smart Cities at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19” comparing pandemic response in India’s Smart Cities and other important cities of the world was published in partnership with the World Economic Forum.Smart Cities implemented integrated solutions through their ICCCs for providing citizens access to emergency medical facilities. Monitoring of hospital beds especially oxygen, ventilator and ICU bed availability; continuous follow-up of reported, recovered, active cases was made possible through solutions deployed in these ICCCs. Cities like Puducherry, Rourkela, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Belgaum, Karimnagar and many other Smart cities created similar solutions. Centralized dashboards and ICT solutions to effectively trace, test, track and treat were deployed by many cities.  Dedicated helplines for telemedicine, e-counseling, and other COVID-19 related complaints/concerns were set up in many Smart cities. Cities like Shimla, Tumakuru, Vellore, Amritsar, Dehradun and many other Smart cities created such helplines for their citizens. Smart Cities deployed innovative solutions to ensure steady supply chain of food, vegetables and other essential services. Mobile services, integrated platforms etc. were accessible to citizens for home delivery of essential supplies, such as food, groceries, medicines, etc. from neighborhood stores.  For example, Agra developed Sarvam Setu App, a one-stop interface to access nearest medical centres, and hyper local suppliers of essentials. Kalyan Dombivali and Kota developed mobile apps for providing doorstep delivery of medicines and other essentials.  More than 30 other smart cities developed similar solutions to help citizens access essential commodities without hassle. During the lockdown, many cities successfully ensured access to shelter, essentials and free food via community kitchens etc. for the poor. In several cases, Smart Cities collaborated with Anganwadi workers, Self-Help Groups (SHGs), local community organizations to deliver food and shelter to the needy.  For example, Surat’s roti-canteens served thousands of rotis daily to the poor.  Bhubaneswar distributed cooked meals/dry ration to migrant workers, daily wage labourers, destitute and the homeless.  Cities such as Agartala, Agra, Ajmer and many others provided food and shelter.  Several cities tied up with food delivery aggregators such as Zomato and Swiggy to ensure delivery of essential commodities at citizens’ doorstep.                                     *****
