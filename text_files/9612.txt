                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b) Different studies project varying impacts of climate change on different sectors. One such report titled “Climate Change and Heat-Induced mortality in India”, which is based on research work of Climate Impact Lab and Tata Centre for Development at the University of Chicago, has made such inference. However, the inference drawn is only a projection based on certain modeling.  (c) to (e) Climate change is a global phenomenon and requires action from all countries based on the principles of ‘Equity’ and ‘Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities’. Reports from various sources including Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlight that the challenges faced due to climate change are mainly from historical emissions of greenhouse gases by developed countries. Limiting the global warming can reduce the magnitude of climate change impactsIndia’s Climate action is embedded in to various programmes and schemes of Government of India. The Government has taken various steps to combat climate change including, inter-alia, the following(i)	India is a Party to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.  Aim of the Paris Agreement is to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Under the Paris Agreement, India has submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) outlining eight (8) targets for 2021-2030, including (i) to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level, (ii) to achieve about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030 with the help of transfer of technology and low cost international finance, (iii) to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. The other targets pertain to sustainable lifestyles; climate friendly growth path; climate change adaptation; climate change finance; and capacity building and technology. (ii)	As part of its climate action agenda, Government of India is implementing National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) comprising eight Missions namely National Solar Mission, National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency, National Mission on Sustainable Habitat, National Water Mission, National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Eco-system, National Mission for a “Green India”, National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture and National Mission on Strategic knowledge for Climate Change.  These missions are anchored by their respective nodal Ministries and are at various stages of their implementation.(iii)	33 States and Union Territories have prepared State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCC) consistent with the objectives of NAPCC to address their State specific action.  This Ministry is supporting adaptation actions of States and Union Territories through a scheme titled “National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change”. (iv)	As an adaptive measure, Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) in collaboration with local health departments have started heat action plan in many parts of the country to forewarn about the heat waves and also advising action to be taken during such occasions.  Heat action plan became operational since 2013. The Heat Action Plan is a comprehensive early warning system and preparedness plan for extreme heat events. The Plan presents immediate as well as longer-term actions to increase preparedness, information-sharing, and response coordination to reduce the health impacts of extreme heat on vulnerable populations. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and IMD are working with 23 States that recorded high temperatures leading to heat-wave conditions to develop heat action plans.  (v)	IMD has started Forecast Demonstration Project (FDP) on heat waves from April 2017 for the hot weather season under which a detailed daily report including realized data of heat waves, synoptic situation leading to the occurrence of heat waves, diagnosis on the basis of Numerical Model outputs and forecast and warnings for five days is prepared. This information is disseminated to all concerned including health departments through a bulletin. From April 2018 onwards, IMD started issuing an additional bulletin on heat wave in the morning (8 a.m.) valid for 24 hours for supporting the planning of activities for the day and this bulletin is also disseminated to all concerned.(vi)	Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare is implementing National Innovations on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) Project with the objective to enhance resilience of Indian agriculture to climate change and climate vulnerability of crops, livestock and fisheries.   ICAR under NICRA project is demonstrating 12 short duration, 15 drought tolerant, 14 flood tolerant, 1 heat tolerant and 3 salt tolerant rice varieties in farmer’s fields across the country.Independent studies rate India’s efforts highly and compliant with the requirements under the Paris Agreement.  *****
