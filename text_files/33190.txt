                                                        MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BHUPENDER YADAV)(a) to (e) The statement is laid on the table of the House.***Statement refer to in reply to part (a) to (e) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 67 due for reply on 07.02.2022 regarding ‘India State of Forest Report, 2021’ by Shrimati Sangeeta   Kumari   Singh Deo and Dr. Jayanta Kumar Roy.  (a) Forest Survey of India (FSI), Dehradun, an organization under the Ministry carries out the assessment of forest cover of the country biennially since 1987 and the findings are published in India State of Forest Report (ISFR). The forest cover assessment is a wall-to-wall mapping exercise based on remote sensing supported by intensive ground verification and field data from National Forest Inventory. The ISFR-2021 has recently been released by the Ministry on 13th January, 2022. As per ISFR 2021, there is an overall increase of 1540 square kilometre of forest cover at the national level as compared to the previous assessment i.e. ISFR 2019. The details of State and Union Territory wise  forest cover are given at Annexure I.  (b)& (c) India is committed to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030 as per Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under Paris Agreement. India is on track to meet Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) targets under Paris Agreement. The Forest Survey of India estimates carbon stock of forest by using National Forest Inventory data collected during forest inventory and forest cover area following the guidelines given by United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The carbon stock for 2021 has been estimated to be 7204 million tones. There is an increase of 79.4 million tonnes of carbon stock as compared to the last assessment of 2019. The annual increase is 39.7 million tonnes, which is 145.6 million tonnes CO2 equivalent. India has already achieved 1.97 billion tonnes of additional carbon sink as compared to the base year of 2005. The remaining target can be achieved by increasing forest and tree cover of the country through implementation of various Central and State sponsored schemes. The Central Government schemes are mainly comprised of Green India Mission (GIM), National Afforestation Programme (NAP), Compensatory Afforestation Funds under Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), afforestation activities under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA), Green Highway Policy 2015, Policy for enhancement of Urban Greens, National Agro-forestry Policy and Sub-mission on Agro-forestry (SMAF), National Bamboo Mission and National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture. In addition to above, State and UT Governments have their own afforestation and reforestation programmes. Almost every State has activities under social forestry, which largely focuses on tree planting in the areas outside forests.                  The State /UT-wise details of fund released under National Afforestation Programme, Green India Mission and Compensatory Afforestation Funds for the last three years are given in Annexure-II, III and IV. (d) “Increasing substantially the forest/tree cover in the country through massive afforestation and social forestry programmes, especially on all denuded, degraded and unproductive lands” is one of the objective of the National Forest Policy, 1988. National Forest Policy further provides a massive need based and time bound programme of afforestation tree planting on all degraded and denuded lands in the country. Considering the policy prescription, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has been implementing various centrally sponsored schemes on afforestation /plantation. The National afforestation programme (NAP) scheme is implemented by three tier institutional setup through the State Forest Development Agency (SFDA) at the state level, Forest Development Agency (FDA) at the forest division level and the Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMCs) at the village level, which are registered societies. The multi-departmental efforts have yielded good results in conserving and developing forest cover as evident from the fact that the Forest cover as reported in the latest India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2021 has increased by 12,294 square kilometre in last seven years (ISFR-2015 to ISFR-2021) .(e)  As per ISFR 2021, State/UT wise details of Recorded Forest Area i.e. reserve forest, protected forest and unclassed forest are given at Annexure V.   **********
