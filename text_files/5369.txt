MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) & (b):	The prices of agricultural produce are determined by supply and demand conditions in the market on a day-to-day basis. Wholesale prices of agricultural produce tend to fall immediately after harvest due to increase in market arrival of new crops. The minimum support price (MSP) and wholesale prices of major agricultural commodities are given below:(Rs per quintal)Crops/	MSP (2018-19)	Wholesale Prices		May-19	June-19Paddy	1750	1793	1787Bajra	1950	2207	2149Barley	1440	1795	1816Gram	4620	4796	4676Jowar	2430	2625	2678Maize	1700	1973	1977Ragi	2897	2690	2731Contd….2/--2-Wheat	1840	2120	2116Arhar Whole	5675	5557	5521Masur Whole	4475	4902	4932Moong Whole	6975	6211	6353Urad Whole	5600	5441	5397Groundnut	4890	5132	5386Copra	7511	10583	10258Safflower/ Kardiseed	4945	4047	4332Mustard Seed	4200	4073	4071Nigerseed	5877	4700	4648Sesamum Seed	6249	9782	9922Soyabean	3399	3742	3701Sunflower Seed	5388	3567	3508Cotton/Kapas	5150	5839	5836Jute	2030	4336	4289Source: Directorate of Economics & Statistics(c):	The Union Budget for 2018-19 had announced the pre-determined principle to keep MSPs at a level of at least one and half times of the cost of production. Accordingly, Government had increased MSPs for all mandated crops with a return of at least 50 percent over all India weighted average cost of production for the season 2018-19. Government has recently increased the MSPs for all kharif crops for 2019-20 season in line with the principle of providing at least 50 percent return over all India weighted average cost of production. Details of MSP, cost and percent return over cost since 2017-18 to 2019-20 is given in Annexure.As and when wholesale prices of MSP crops fall below the MSP, State Governments can put in place procurement operations or Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) for pulses, oilseeds and cotton which are not covered under Public Distribution System/welfare schemes.
