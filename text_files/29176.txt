                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY       (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (f): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (f) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 489 BY SHRI KUMBAKUDI SUDHAKARAN, SHRI KODIKUNNIL SURESH, SHRI BENNY BEHANAN AND SHRI D.K. SURESH TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 01.12.2021 REGARDING RESOURCES FOR ADDRESSING HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES(a) and (b): ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and, as such, State Governments are responsible for prevention, detection, registration and investigation of crime and maintaining law and order etc. on Railways through their law enforcement agencies viz. Government Railway Police (GRP)/District Police. However, Railway Protection Force (RPF) supplements the efforts of GRP/District Police to provide better protection and security of passenger area and passengers and for matters connected therewith. Whenever any case of suspected human trafficking is detected by RPF, the same is reported to GRP/District Police and person(s) apprehended and rescued, if any, are also handed over to them for taking further necessary action as per law. Since RPF plays only supplementary role in this endeavour, no SOP has been issued by Ministry of Railways for curbing and/or investigation of human trafficking through railways and rescue of human trafficking victims.(c) to (f): There is no separate budget allocation for expenditure to curb Human Trafficking activities through railways and for training of Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel on Human Trafficking cases. However, the topic of “Human Trafficking” is included in regular training courses of Railway Protection Force.  The Government Railway Police (GRP) comes under the purview of respective State Governments and the administrative expenses incurred on GRP are shared by Central Government and State Government.*****
