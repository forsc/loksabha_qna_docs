                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a):	Various provisions exist in Labour Acts for securing dignity and security of a woman worker. The Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 provides for payment of equal remuneration to men and women workers for same work or work of similar nature; The Minimum Wages Act, 1948 provides for minimum wages and The Payment of Wages Act, 1936 ensures timely payment respectively to both male and female workers without any gender discrimination. A number of other protective measures have also been provided in various Labour Laws in order to ensure dignity, security and congenial work environment for a women worker. Such measures include child care centers, time-off for feeding children, enhancement in paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks, provisions for mandatory crèche facility in the establishments having 50 or more employees etc.(b):	The Ministry has taken steps for drafting four Labour Codes namely The Code on Wages; The Code on Industrial Relations; The Code on Social Security & Welfare; and The Code on Occupation Safety, Health and Working Conditions by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the relevant provisions of the existing Central Labour Laws without any gender discrimination. The Labour Codes envisage extension of minimum wages and timely payment of wages to all 50 Crore workers, provision of appointment letter, provision for annual medical check-up, extension of safety and other welfare provisions are also stipulated for both male & female workers.******
