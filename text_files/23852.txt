ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI  RATTAN  LAL  KATARIA)(a) to (e) 	Government of India in partnership with States, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) to provide potable tap water supply of prescribed quality to every rural household in the country including Chhattisgarh, by 2024. As per Operational Guidelines for the implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission, BIS–10500 proocol is to be followed by States/ UTs for ensuring potable drinking water to rural households.Under JJM, while planning water supply schemes to provide tap water supply to rural households, priority is given to quality–affected habitations, which inter alia includes habitations having Fluoride contamination beyond permissible limit in drinking water sources. Since, planning, implementation and commissioning of piped water supply schemes based on a safe water source likely to take time, States/ UTs have been advised to install community water purification plants (CWPPs) in such habitations, purely as an interim measure, to provide potable water to every household at the rate of 8–10 litre per capita per day to meet their drinking and cooking requirements.While allocating the funds to States/ UTs in a particular financial year, 10% weightage is given to the population residing in habitations affected by chemical contaminants including Arsenic and Fluoride, as on 31st March of the preceding financial year.In Chhattisgarh, as reported by the State, at the time of launch of Jal Jeevan Mission, 268 habitations were having Fluoride contamination beyond permissible limit in drinking water sources. Now, such 150 habitations are left.  (f) 	The State/UT-wise details of fund allocation, fund drawn and reported fund utilizations under JJM including Chhattisgarh for 2019-20 and 2020-21 is at Annex–I and Annex–II respectively.****
