ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b):	As per Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) -2011, income of household/family was not canvassed in urban areas.  However, ‘Main source of income/earnings’ for the individuals was canvassed in the Schedule comprising individual particulars.Accordingly, as per SECC-2011 data, of the total population of about 30 crore persons enumerated in urban areas in the country including   the    State     of    Madhya    Pradesh, 17.27  crore  persons      have reported no income from any source. Persons reporting no income from any source in urban areas would be inclusive of infants, children, students, housewives, unemployed, other dependants etc. In SECC – 2011, Statutory Towns were considered urban and Census Towns were considered as rural.Government of India has taken up several initiatives for urban poor to provide employment and livelihood opportunities to gain sustainable income, providing benefits to the poor in terms of housing, shelter and other benefits, which are required to live a dignified life.  Government is also implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme namely ‘Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission, in statutory towns of the country including the State of Madhya Pradesh to reduce poverty and vulnerability of urban poor households by enabling them to access gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities. The Mission also aims to build strong grassroot level institutions for the urban poor, provide shelters equipped with essential services to the urban homeless and address livelihood concerns of the urban street vendors.                                       *****
