Further, as informed by the Ministry of Jal Shakti, water resources projects are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priorities. Role of Central Government is limited to being catalytic, providing technical support and in some cases, partial financial assistance in terms with the existing schemes being implemented by them such as Repair, Renovation & Restoration (RRR) of water bodies scheme under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)- Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP).The RRR of water bodies scheme aims at revival of irrigation potential by improvement and restoration of water bodies by enhancing the tank storage capacity along with other multiple objectives such as ground water recharge, increased availability of drinking water, improvement of catchment of tank commands etc.(b) 	While the Central and State Governments take all possible steps for the preservation, conservation and restoration of water bodies, developmental activities and anthropogenic pressures do affect water bodies.(c)	As informed by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), Ministry of Jal Shakti, Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater-2020 has been prepared by them in consultation with States/Union Territories (UTs) which is a macro level plan indicating various structures for the different terrain conditions of the country including estimated cost. The Master Plan envisages construction of about 1.42 crore rain water harvesting and artificial recharge structures in the Country to harness 185 Billion Cubic Metre (BCM) of monsoon rainfall.

The management plans are shared with the respective State Governments for taking appropriate measures/implementation. TheState and UT-wise details are given in Annexure-I.The Ministry of Jal Shaktihas circulated a Model Bill to all the States/UTs to enable them to enact suitable ground water legislation for regulation of its development, which also includes provision of rain water harvesting.
