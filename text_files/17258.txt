ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) Public Health and Hospitals is a State subject. However, to enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer, the Central Government is implementing Strengthening of Tertiary Care for Cancer Scheme, under which setting up of 19 State Cancer Institutes (SCIs) and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres (TCCCs) have been approved. The list of such approved SCIs/TCCCs in the country including in the State of Uttar Pradesh, is at Annexure. In addition, following Cancer Centres under the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India are operational across the country :1.	Maharashtra(I)	Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), Parel, Mumbai(II)	Advance centre for treatment and Research in Cancer (ACTREC), Kharghar, Navi Mumbai2.	Andhra Pradesh(I)	Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital & Research Centre (HBCH&RC), Visakhapatnam3.	Uttar Pradesh(i) 	Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital (HBCH) , Varanasi(ii) 	Mahamana Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya  (MPMMCC), Varanasi4.	Punjab  (i)	Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital (HBCH), Sangrur 5.        Assam (i)	Dr. Bhubaneswar Borooah Cancer Institute, Guwahati Further, Oncology is also one of the focus areas in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar in Haryana and strengthening of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, are also steps in the same direction.  (b) and (c):  The information regarding estimated incidence of cancer cases in the country is based on National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP) of Indian Council of Medical Research. The latest report of NCRP is for the year 2020, which is based on data for the period 2012-16, as compared to earlier report of 2016, which was based on data for the period 2012-14. Also the year 2020 report is based on an increased coverage in terms of more number of Population Based Cancer Registries (PBCRs) or expansion of some existing PBCRs. As a result of above changes, the annual figures of estimated incidence of cancer in the country in the year 2020 report have undergone revision as compared to previous report of NCRP of 2016, and the revised year-wise figures are as under:Year	2017	2018	2019Estimated Incidence of Cancer Cases	12,92,534	13,25,232	13,58,415The cancer patients are diagnosed and treated by different specialties at various levels in the healthcare delivery system including medical colleges, district hospitals and other tertiary care institutions of state and central government. The information regarding the number of persons visiting government hospitals to avail treatment and the average distance that has to be travelled by cancer patients in order to avail treatment is not maintained centrally.(d): Department of Atomic Energy has informed that with an estimated requirement of 2 external radiotherapy machine per million population and 40% to 60 % of patients requiring radiotherapy, there is shortfall in availability of machine in the country. Currently there are around 855 machines in the country.(e): In Government hospitals, treatment is either free or highly subsidized. Treatment of cancers is also available under Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY). Besides this, Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment (AMRIT) Deendayal outlets have been opened at 210 Institutions/Hospitals with an objective to make available drugs and implants at discounted prices to the patients. Under the umbrella scheme of Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi, financial assistance is provided to families living below threshold poverty line for their treatment, including treatment of cancer, in Government hospitals.(f): Cancer is diagnosed and treated at various levels in the Government health care system, as well as in the private hospitals. While doctors with D. M. (Medical Oncology), M.Ch (Surgical Oncology) and M.D. (Radiation Oncology) treat Cancer patients in higher level tertiary care hospitals, Cancer is also being treated in hospitals by other Doctors such as General Surgeons, Gynecologists, ENT Surgeons etc., depending on the type and site of Cancer. In Government facilities, salary is on the basis of post held by the person and the institution they work for. Information regarding salary in private hospitals is not available. (g): The Hub and Spoke model stands for a network of hospitals on two levels. SCIs/TCCCs are envisaged for cancer treatment as Hub and Spoke for providing cancer care, giving support to district hospitals and medical colleges. SCIs serve as the nodal Institution to mentor other Government Institutes. Similarly the TCCC mentor cancer related activities including at the district level and below in their respective areas. SCI acts as hub and TCCCs as spokes, and facilities being created under NHM – District NCD clinics, CHC NCD clinics, Day Care    Centres – as sub-spokes.
