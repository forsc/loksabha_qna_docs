ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d): Dausa-Gangapur City (92.67 Km) new line project has been sanctioned in 1996-97. The latest anticipated cost of the project is `886.41 crore. An expenditure of  `487.03 crore has been incurred upto 31.03.2019 and an outlay of `100 crore has been provided for this project for the year 2019-20.Dausa-Deedwana (35.44 Km) section has been completed. Work has been taken up in balance section of 57.23 Km. Physical possession of 3.64 Hectare land in Kherli village, Bamanwas tehsil, district Sawai Madhopur has still not been given to Railway.The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions  of working agencies/contractors etc. and all these factors affect the completion of the project.Therefore, confirmed timeline cannot be given. However, sincere efforts are being done to complete the project early.*****
