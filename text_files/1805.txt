ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) & (b):	On the basis of forecast bulletins of India Meteorological Department (IMD) on the Cyclone (Vayu) and on  the  requisition made by --2--L.S.US.Q.NO 1586 FOR 02.07.2019State Government of Gujarat /UT of Daman and Diu, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) had deployed 52 teams (Gujarat - 47 teams and Diu - 05 teams) as proactive deployment. (c) & (d):  On 12.06.2019 Union Home Secretary chaired a high level meeting to review the preparedness of State and Central Ministries/Agencies concerned to deal with the situation arising out of Cyclone ‘VAYU’. Senior officers from the Ministries of Home Affairs, Power, Defence, Health & Family Welfare, Communication, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), IMD and NDRF participated in this meeting.  Chief Secretary, Government of Gujarat and Advisor to Administrator, Daman & Diu participated through Video conference. Since adequate funds were available in State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) in Gujarat, no additional fund was allocated by the Central Government. Cyclone “Vayu’’ had weakened from “Very Severe” Cyclonic storm to a “Well-marked low pressure area” when it crossed Kutch/north Gujarat coast, hence, there was no requirement of rescue operation in the State of Gujarat.(e) & (g):  Information  on  the  various  assistance/ funds   allocated  and--3--L.S.US.Q.NO 1586 FOR 02.07.2019 spent by various Departments/ agencies towards the victims of natural calamities is not maintained centrally by this Ministry, since distribution of assistance on the ground is the responsibility of the State concerned in accordance with the magnitude of the ground situation.  However, financial assistance is provided to the affected States from State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) as per laid down procedure. The guidelines and norms relating to SDRF/ NDRF are available on the website of this Ministry; https://www.ndmindia.nic.in.State-wise details of allocation and releases from SDRF and NDRF during the last three years and current are given in Annexure.******
