ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FORJAL SHAKTI(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b) Water is a State subject. As reported by Ministry of Earth Sciences, South west monsoon onset over Kerala and its further progress across the country has been delayed by a week due to the formation and movement of the very severe cyclonic storm “Vayu” in the Arabian Sea. Deficiency of rain has not been predicted for southwest monsoon season 2019 by IMD. Further, Central Ground Water Board (CGWB),  carries out ground water monitoring, four times a year, on regional scale through a network of observation wells in the Country. In order to assess the declining/rising trend in water level on a long-term basis, pre-monsoon water level data 2018 has been compared with the decadal average (2008-2017) water level. Analysis of data indicates decline in ground water level in about 52% of the wells and rise in 48% of the wells being monitored.  ( c)&(d) Initiatives on water management including conservation and artificial recharge to ground water in the country is primarily State’s responsibility. Under National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), this Ministry provides technical & financial assistance to the states to improve the coverage of safe drinking water in rural areas. During 2018-19, under NRDWP, an amount of Rs. 5466.24 Crore was provided to the States including Rs. 167.31 Crore to the State of Tamil Nadu for coverage of rural drinking water supply. In case of drinking water crisis, States may utilize up to 25% of NRDWP funds under flexi component to restore the drinking water supply.  ****
