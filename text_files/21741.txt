ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE; MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MINISTER OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a)&(b) Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) through its constituent laboratories, namely, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute (CSIR-CDRI),  CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CSIR-CCMB), CSIR-Indian institute of Chemical Biology (CSIR-IICB), CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (CSIR-IIIM) etc., has been pursuing R&D activities in the area of cancer. In doing so, CSIR efforts are focused on: understanding the disease biology; disease diagnostics; drug discovery and development; studying the environmental & genetic causes of specific cancers in India; and creating innovative platforms for enhancing the innovation in the domain. The cancer research at CSIR-IGIB is focused to find ways of suppression of telomerase is important with promise in therapy. A protein called telomerase when present in high amounts is known to promote cancer, and spread of cancer (metastasis) in different organs. Research at CSIR-IGIB shows that how telomerase, which otherwise is tightly regulated, gets mis-regulated in cancer cells. New mechanistic understanding enable researchers to design approaches that include small molecules and peptides to decrease telomerase in aggressive cancer cells. These anti-telomerase agents might have potential therapeutic value, which needs to be tested further.The cancer research at CSIR-CDRI is primarily focused on prevention of cancer in women particularly cervical and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). CSIR-CDRI is also exploring on design and synthesis of new clinical entities (NCE) against clinically validated targets in TNBC.  Simultaneously, the institute is involved in basic research in cancer in understanding the disease biology with the objective to discover new targets in breast cancer therapy.CSIR-IIIM has been actively working in the anticancer drug discovery area, with the aim to discover new potent and effective preclinical candidates and take them to human clinical trials. CSIR-IIIM’s extensive efforts in this area, has led to the discovery of IIIM-290, a new chemical entity which display favourable profile in all preclinical studies. The regulatory safety pharmacology (IND-enabling studies) of the lead are completed, and IND filed to DCGI in January 2020. The New Drugs Division of Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), Government of India granted the permission to CSIR-IIIM for conducting the clinical trial of this important drug candidate IIIM-290 in pancreatic cancer patients. Research at CSIR-IICB is focused to address different areas of Cancer mechanism, management and treatment. In the process, CSIR-IICB has been instrumental in garnering novel insights in terms of understanding the biology of the disease and also contributed significantly to paving ways for novel therapeutic approaches in Cancer treatment.CSIR has also been supporting drug research through its infrastructure and facilities as well its creation of trained human resource to carry out drug research in the country.Some ongoing projects at CSIR labs in the area of cancer are provided in Annexure-I.(c)&(d) Yes, Sir. CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (CSIR-IIIM) is developing an anti-cancer drug code named IIIM-290. This candidate has currently reached phase I/II clinical trial in pancreatic cancer patients. IIIM-290 is a new chemical entity which display favourable profile in all preclinical studies. The regulatory safety pharmacology (IND-enabling studies) of the lead are completed, and IND filed to DCGI in January 2020. The New Drugs Division of Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), Govt. of India granted the permission, on 28th May 2020, to CSIR-IIIM for conducting the clinical trial of this important drug candidate IIIM-290 in pancreatic cancer patients. The clinical trial is expected to start soon to assess the safety, tolerability and exposure of the compound in humans along with the early efficacy indicators in pancreatic cancer patients. ***** Annexure-IResearch projects in the area of Cancer Biology are being implemented at CSIR labs are as under:S.
