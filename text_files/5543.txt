                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) 	Promotion of exports of commercial crops is a continuous process. To promote the agricultural exports, including that of commercial crops, the Government has introduced a comprehensive Agriculture Export Policy. The Government has also brought out a new Central Sector Scheme – ‘Transport and Marketing Assistance for Specified Agriculture Products’ - for providing assistance for the international component of freight, to mitigate the freight disadvantage for the export of agriculture products, and marketing of agricultural products. Exports of many of the commercial crops are eligible for assistance under the scheme.The Department of Commerce also has several other schemes to promote exports, including exports of commercial crops, viz. Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES), Market Access Initiatives (MAI) Scheme, Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) etc. In addition, assistance to the exporters of commercial crops is also available under the Export Promotion Schemes of Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), Tobacco Board, Tea Board, Coffee Board, Rubber Board and Spices Board.(b) 	The details of commercial crops exported from the country to various other countries, item-wise, are at Annexure-I.(c) & (d) No foreign country has banned import of any of the commercial crops from India. However, Mexico has suspended import of chilli from India with effect from 23.5.2017 on account of detection of Trogoderma larva, a quarantine pest, in one of the consignments of chilli exported from India. The Spices Board is conducting mandatory testing before export of chillies to all the countries.******** Annexure-IIndia''s Export of Commercial CropsQuantity in thousand units; Value in million USDName of Crop	Unit	 2016-17 	 2017-18 	 2018-19* 	 2019-20 (Apr-May)* 		Quantity  	 Value 	 Quantity  	 Value 	 Quantity  	 Value 	 Quantity  	 Value RICE -BASMATI	TON	       3,985.21 	   3,208.60 	       4,056.85 	   4,169.56 	       4,414.61 	   4,712.44 	        864.03 	    932.20 SPICES	KGS	 10,14,453.31 	   2,851.95 	 10,96,322.85 	   3,115.37 	 10,91,789.68 	   3,322.56 	 2,09,119.92 	    586.77 COTTON RAW INCLD.
