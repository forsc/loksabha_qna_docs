ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER FOR HEAVY INDUSTRIES & PUBLIC ENTERPRISES(SHRI ARVIND GANPAT SAWANT)  (a & b): Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) OM dated 25-10-2017 lays down the general principle for  determination of ‘creamy layer’  criteria in Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs).  As per the said OM dated 25.10.2017 in respect of the CPSEs, the general principle is that all executive level posts i.e. Board & below board level executives are considered as creamy layer subject to the proviso that those executives whose annual income as per criterion given in Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT) OM dated 08-09-1993 is less than Rs. 8 lakhs (as amended vide DoPT OM dated 13-09-2017) will not fall under creamy layer criteria. However, it is for the concerned CPSE to issue the necessary order in accordance with the above mentioned principle for determination of creamy layer criteria in respect of posts in the CPSE. Prior to the OM dated 25.10.2017, the provisions laid down in the DOPT OM No. 36012/22/93-Estt (SCT) dated 8.9.1993 were applicable to CPSEs for determination of creamy layer criteria. Certain representations had been received on the issue of determination of creamy layer criteria which inter alia include request for drawing of equivalence between Group A, B C & D level posts of Central Government with those of the CPSEs, clarification on the status of the non-executive in CPSEs, greater dissemination of information on the provisions of the DPE’s OM, dated 25.10.2017 etc.(c) 	The above mentioned DPE OM dated 25.10.2017 is uniformly applicable to all CPSEs. *****
