ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d) :  The provisions of Article 244 of the Constitution enables designation of certain areas as Scheduled and Tribal Areas and for their administration.  The Constitution provides for two types of areas, areas designated as “Scheduled Areas” in terms of Fifth Schedule of the Constitution and areas designated as ‘Tribal Areas’ in terms of Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. According to the Constitutional provision of Fifth Schedule under Article 244 (1) of the Constitution of India the expression “Scheduled Areas” means such areas as the President may by order declare to be Scheduled Areas.  Specification of a Scheduled Area or modification of an existing Scheduled area is done after consultation with the Governor of that State and through notification issued with the approval of the President of India. The “Tribal Areas” are designated in terms of Article 244(2) of the Constitution of India read with Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India. The State Government of Himachal Pradesh submitted a proposal for notifying entire Trans-Giri area of Sirmour district, Dodra Kwar Sub-Division of Shimla district, 15/20 areas of Shimla and Kullu districts as Scheduled Areas in Himachal Pradesh. For declaration of Scheduled Areas the criteria followed are -  preponderance of tribal population, compactness and reasonable size of the area,   a viable administrative entity such as a district, block or taluk, and   economic backwardness of the area as compared to neighboring areas.  The proposal was examined in the Ministry and could not be considered due to want of requisite criteria, as mentioned above. Accordingly, the State Government of Himachal Pradesh was intimated that the proposal in the current form for declaration of Scheduled Areas could not be considered. (e):  As per available record neither the “Scheduled Areas” under Article 244(1) of Fifth Schedule of the Constitution, nor the “Tribal Areas” under article 244(2) of Sixth Schedule of the Constitution have been notified in the State of Uttarakhand so far.  (f): Same as mentioned against (a) to (d) above. *****
