It is entrusted with enforcement and regulation of mining operations in their respective states including illegal mining. Further, the State Government is empowered under section 23 C of the Mines and Minerals (Development and regulation) Act 1957(MMDR Act) to make rules for prevention of illegal mining, transportation and storage of minerals.  As reported by the Govt. of Maharashtra, details of illegal sand mining activity & action taken by district authorities are as follows:S.No.	Year	No. of Cases reported	Penalty recovered (Rupees in  Lakh)1.	2018-19	1969	1529.9142.	2019-20	2253	1881.333.	2020-21	2358	1619.53(c) The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF & CC) has taken several steps to ensure observance of environmental safeguards during mining of minerals. These include, inter-alia, mandating the requirement of prior environmental clearance under the provisions of Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006, as amended from time to time. MoEF&CC has also issued “Enforcement & Monitoring Guidelines for Sand Mining (EMGSM) 2020 supplemental to the existing guidelines i.e. Sustainable Sand Management Guidelines 2016, which focuses on the effective monitoring of the sand mining, from the identification of sand mineral sources to its dispatch and end-use by consumers and the general public. Further, this document serves as a guideline for collection of critical information for enforcement of the regulatory provision(s) and it also highlights the essential infrastructural requirements necessary for effective monitoring for Sustainable Sand Mining and in controlling illegal mining. The Government has been regularly communicating with the States for implementation of the EMGSM 2020. A national level interaction was also convened by Ministry on 09.07.2021 to review the status of implementation of the EMGSM 2020 and seek feedback on the same. (d) The enforcement of various legal provisions including enforcement of guidelines for sustainable mining, with a view to containing the menace of illegal mining, is purely in the domain of the State Governments and UT’s Administrations.  All representations received regarding illegal mining are duly forwarded to concerned State Authorities for appropriate action. State-wise details of representations received in this regard are enclosed as Annexure-1.
