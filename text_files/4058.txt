ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a)	to (b) The organisational structure of the Police Forces varies from country to country as do the functions & tasks assigned to them.  Many countries do not also have Central Armed Police Forces.  In addition, the number of policemen required is dependent on several variables like volume of crime, societal structures, use of technology and local problems. There are no universal standards to assess the optimal level of police force in a country.  (c) to (e) “Police” is a State subject falling in List-II (State List) of the Seventh Schedule  of  the  Constitution of India and it is, therefore, the responsibility of the -2/…-2-LS.US.Q.NO.3730 FOR 16.07.2019State Governments/UT Administrations to fill up the vacancies in the police force and to bring in the requisite reforms in the Police administrations.  The Centre also issues advisories to the States for filling up these vacancies in the States. 	The Central Government has set up various Commissions/Committees on police reforms and reviewed their recommendations from time to time to make police more efficient, effective, responsive to the needs of the people and accountable to the rule of law.	Further, to encourage implementation of police reforms, since the year 2018-19, under the scheme of “Assistance to States for Modernisation of Police”, incentive funds are provided to the State Governments, which are implementing the police reforms vigorously. For the year 2018-19, ten States, namely, (1) Andhra Pradesh, (2) Gujarat, (3) Madhya Pradesh, (4) Odisha, (5) Punjab, (6) Rajasthan, (7) Tamil Nadu, (8) Telangana, (9) Uttar Pradesh and (10) Uttarakhand have been assessed eligible for award of incentives and grants of Rs. 7.69 crore each, out of total incentive grant of Rs. 76.90 crores. For the year 2019-20, the incentive grant has been enhanced and an amount of Rs.158.26 crore has been earmarked for this purpose.*****
