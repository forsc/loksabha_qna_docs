ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to(f) Yes, Sir. Based on the proposals submitted by the State Government of Kerala, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) has so far released a total grant of Rs. 184.042 lakhs as central share to the State Government, which includes Rs. 86.85 lakhs released during the financial year 2017-18, for conservation and management of Ashtamudi Lake. The grant has been released for conservation activities like Catchment Area Treatment, Institutional Development, Water Management-Pollution Abatement, Biodiversity Conservation, Fisheries Management, Sustainable livelihoods, etc. Since the grant could not be utilized by the State Government during the financial year 2017-18, entire grant was revalidated for the financial year 2018-19. Due to severe floods that affected Kerala during August, 2018, the activities under the Management Action Plan of Ashtamudi Lake could not be achieved. Hence, entire amount was revalidated for the financial year 2019-20. As per the Utilization Certificate dated 19.11.2020 received from the State Government, an expenditure of Rs28.30 lakhs of central share has been incurred. Three wetlands namely Ashtamudi Lake, Sasthamkotta and Vembanad-Kol have been designated as Ramsar Sites in Kerala. In addition to the above said grant for Ashtamudi, an amount of Rs. 88.855 lakhs for Sasthamkotta and Rs. 84.45 lakhs for Vembanad-Kol has so far been released as central share to State Government for conservation and management of these Ramsar sites. Further, the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017 are applicable to Ramsar Sites of the Country including the said three Ramsar sites of Kerala. *****
