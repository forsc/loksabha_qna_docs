ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR TEXTILES  (SMT. DARSHANA JARDOSH)(a):	Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) is mandated to procure raw cotton if prices of raw cotton fall below Minimum Support Price (MSP). Since marketprice of raw cotton has been ruling above MSP right from the beginning of the current cotton year, there has been no need for CCI to undertake MSP operations. However, CCI has deployed adequate manpower at procurement centres to keep a close watch on kapas arrivals, market rates and to meet any eventuality to undertake MSP operations wherever required.(b):	Details of procurement of cotton by CCI since 2014 is annexed.
