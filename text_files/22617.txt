RCS- UDAN is a market driven scheme. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN from time to time. However, no airline has submitted valid bid for operation of RCS flight from Forbesganj, so far. If any bid is received in future rounds, same shall be considered as per the provisions of Scheme Document. An airport, which is included in the awarded routes of RCS - UDAN and requires upgradation/development for commencement of RCS operations, is developed under "Revival of unserved and underserved airports" scheme.
