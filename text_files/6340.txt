                                                        Minister of State (Finance) (ShriAnurag Singh Thakur)(a) to (f):	 As per the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), 2019 in South Asian region India   is placed at 68th position due to faster improvements of several countries previously ranked lower.  The  GCI  measures “national competitiveness” defined as “the set of institutions, policies and factors that determine the level of productivity”. The exercise involves performance review of 141 countries under four broad categories, viz. the enabling environment, human capital, markets and innovation ecosystem.  India is ranked 2nd in shareholder governance and 3rd in terms of market size and renewable energy regulation. It ranks considerably high in  Corporate review of 141 countries under four broad categories, viz. the enabling environment, human capital, markets and innovation ecosystem.  India is ranked 2nd in shareholder governance and 3rd in terms of market size and renewable energy regulation. It ranks considerably high in Corporate Governance (Rank 15th), Macroeconomics stability (Rank 43rd), and Financial Sector (Rank 40th). India performed well when it comes to Innovation Capability (35th), well ahead of most emerging economies and on par with several advanced economies.  However,  as per GCI, India’s rank dropped below 100 in Information, communication and technology adoption (Rank 120th), Health (Rank 110th), Skills (Rank 107th), Product Market (Rank 101st), Labour Market(Rank 103rd) and Financial System Stability (Rank 103rd).  Government has taken a slew of measures to not only boost the economy but also improve upon the ease of doing business and ease of living with programs such as Digital India, Skill India, Make in India, Ayushman Bharat, simplification of Labour Laws into 4 Labour Codes etc.  The desired outcome of these various measures to boost the economy will be tangible only in the longer run.******
