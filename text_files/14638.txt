SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (c):   Provisions of Employees’ State Insurance Act, 1948, Maternity Benefits Act, 1961 and Gratuity Act, 1972 are applicable to formal sector where employer-employee relationship exists. Handloom and Handicraft Sectors are mostly unorganized and decentralized, with characteristics of Cottage Industry. These enterprises are often operated out of home rather than from a purpose-built facility, with very little investment in Plant and Machinery. 	****
