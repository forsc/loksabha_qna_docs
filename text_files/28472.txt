ANSWER




                                                        (a): Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) launched the scheme of ‘Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana (VKY)’ on 28.10.2014 for holistic development of tribal people across the country. The VKY was adopted as a strategic process, which envisaged to ensure delivery of goods and services to the tribal population across the country with outcome-oriented approach while striking at the critical gaps through appropriate convergence of resources and institutional mechanism. Following 14 thematic areas were included under VKY: i.	Qualitative and sustainable employment.ii.	Emphasis on quality education & higher education.iii.	Accelerated economic development of tribal areas.iv.	Health for all.v.	Housing for all.vi.	Safe drinking water for all at doorsteps.vii.	Irrigation facilities suited to the terrain.viii.	All weather roads with connectivity to the nearby town/cities.ix.	Universal availability of electricity.x.	Urban development.xi.	Robust institutional mechanism to roll the vehicle of development with sustainability.xii.	Promotion and conservation of Tribal Cultural Heritage.xiii.	Promotion of Sports in Tribal Areas.xiv.	Security. During the financial year 2014-15, an amount of Rs. 100.00 crore was allocated under VKY. Out of the total budgetary allocation, an amount of Rs. 10.00 Crores were provided to each of the ten States having Schedule V areas as gap filling for carrying out activities commensurating the objective of the Scheme.  During the financial year 2015-16, the gamut of the Scheme was extended to cover all the States having tribal population. Out of the total budgetary allocation to the tune of Rs. 200.00 Crore, funds were released to 21 States against their proposed activities. No fund could be allocated / released to the remaining six States viz. Manipur, Meghalaya, Goa, Uttarakhand, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh due to want of perspective plan and utilization certificate. During 2016-17, token provision of Rs. 1.00 crore was released to State Government of Rajasthan. Since 2016-17, separate allocation of funds under VKY has been discontinued and it has been envisaged that the fund requirement under the VKY strategy will be fulfilled out of the TSP [now called as Schedule Tribe Component (STC) at central level] funds, which caters to sectoral development, including support for education, health, power, roads, sanitation, water supply, livelihood etc. Further, as part of rationalization of Schemes, convergence of schemes / interventions of Ministry of Tribal Affairs has been effected, including the following, as an Umbrella Programme of Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana:(i) Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups.(ii) Minimum Support Price for Minor Forest Produce.(iii) Tribal Festivals, Research Information and Mass Education(iv) Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS)(b) to (f) Receipt of proposals from States including Maharashtra under various schemes of MoTA including ‘Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana’‘and ‘Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-scheme (SCA to TSS)’ is a continuous process. The proposals consist of various projects relating to Education, Health& Sanitation, Drinking water, Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Connectivity, Skill Development etc. Consideration of such projects for approval followed by release of funds to the States are made keeping in view the fund availability in the respective scheme(s), schematic norms, submission of utilization certificate (UC) & physical progress report (PPR) by the States and other relevant financial instructions in vogue. The details of funds released to the State Government of Maharashtra under the scheme of Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana during 2015-16 and under the scheme of Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-scheme (SCA to TSS) during 2016-17 to 2020-21 are as under:(Rs. in lakh) Name of Scheme	2015-16	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana	1400.00	-Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS)	12514.91	9547.00	13760.38	13802.57	11929.09	*0.00Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups	0.00	2077.00	1226.25	1230.26	2510.00	1411.66* During 2020-21, various projects to the tune of Rs.5034.22lakh was approved by the Ministry under the scheme of SCA to TSS.
