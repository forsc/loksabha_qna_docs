As per India State of Forest Report 2017, there is an increase of 8,021 sq km in the total forest and tree cover of the country, compared to the previous assessment in 2015. The total forest and tree cover is 24.39 per cent of the geographical area of the country. In order to increase the forest cover in the country, afforestation programmes have been taken up under various Centrally Sponsored Schemes such as National Afforestation Programme (NAP), Green India Mission (GIM), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP), which from 2015-16 has been amalgamated as the Watershed Development Component of the “Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)” and under Compensatory   Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA). Local people are involved in afforestation activities by the State Forest Departments. For felling of trees for development works under Forest Conservation Act 1980, Compensatory Afforestation is done on equal non-forest land and 1000 plants per hectare are planted by the State Governments. During 2006-2018. Compensatory afforestation has been carried out over 352806 hectare. (c)	& (d)	The objectives of the National Forest Policy is to increase forest and tree cover to 33% of geographical area of the country for the purpose of providing ecological security by improving the quality and biodiversity of forests in India. The working plan of forests is prepared by State Governments by taking into account the trees felled and plantation of saplings to meet with the objective of the National Forest Policy. *****
