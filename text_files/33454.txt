ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI PANKAJ CHAUDHARY)(a) The gross GST collections in the months of October, November & December, 2021 are given below: -(Rs. in crore)Month	GST CollectionOctober, 2021	1,30,127November,2021	1,31,526December, 2021	1,29,780It may be seen from the above table that there is a minor dip in the GST collection in the month of December, 2021 as compared to the months of October and November, 2021 but it touched the highest ever collection of Rs. 1,40,986 crore in January, 2022.(b): No Sir.(c): The average monthly gross GST collection for the third quarter of FY 2021-22 has been Rs.1.30 lakh crore against the average monthly collection of Rs.1.10 lakh crore and Rs 1.15 lakh crore in the first and second quarters respectively. Further, a record GST collection of Rs.1,40,986 crore is reported in the month of January, 2022 and this collection has been the highest since implementation of the GST. Since the Government has been making concerted efforts to raise tax revenue collections which inter-alia includes GST rate rationalization to improve tax compliance, e-invoice system, mandatory e-filing and e-payment of taxes, penalty for delayed payment, extensive use of third-party sources such as State VAT Department, Income Tax etc. for compliance verification, regular enforcement & compliance verification of tax returns, taxpayer education and media campaign etc. and further system based analytical tools and system generated red flag reports are being shared with Central as well as State Tax authorities to take action against tax evaders, therefore, it is expected that the GST collection may remain buoyant in the coming months as well.*****
