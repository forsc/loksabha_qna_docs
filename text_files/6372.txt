ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a): The Committee for the Draft National Education Policy under the Chairmanship of Dr.K. Kasturirangan submitted its report to the Ministry on 31st May 2019.(b): In 2018-19, the Department of School Education and Literacy launched an IntegratedScheme of Samagra Shiksha which subsumed the three erstwhile Centrally SponsoredSchemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan(RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). The new integrated scheme envisages schooleducation as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensureinclusive and equitable quality education. The major interventions are: universal accessincluding infrastructure development and retention; gender and equity; inclusive education;quality; financial support for teacher salary; digital initiatives; entitlements under the rightof children to free and compulsory education (RTE) Act, 2009 including uniforms,textbooks etc.; pre-school education; vocational education; sports and physical education;strengthening of teacher education and training; and monitoring of the scheme. UnderSamagra Shiksha, financial assistance is provided to States and UTs for undertaking variousactivities to reduce dropouts and increase the enrolment at elementary level byopening/upgrading of new schools, construction of school buildings & additionalclassrooms, setting up of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBV), setting up ofresidential schools/hostels, free uniforms, free text books and undertaking enrolment &retention drives.(c) and (d): There is a need to move away from rote learning to competency based learning,improve the numeracy and literacy skills and overall learning outcomes, and promote joyfuland experiential learning in an inclusive classroom environment. To ensure safety andsecurity of children in schools and for dealing with issues related to health and well being ofthe students, the modern day teacher and heads of schools have to be equipped with therequisite skills to handle these issues. These were discussed with States/UTs as well asautonomous organisations. It was recognized that the capacity of teachers must bedeveloped through an integrated training programme with standardized and comprehensivetraining modules. Accordingly, under Samagra Shiksha, a massive Integrated TeacherTraining Programme at the elementary level, covering around 42 lakh participants,including all teachers in the Government elementary schools, Principals and Heads ofelementary schools, faculty of District Institutes of Education and Training (DIETs) andState Councils of Educational Research and Training (SCERTs), Block and ClusterResource Coordinators has been launched. Specific training modules on ‘Developingpersonal-social qualities and creating safe and healthy school environment’ and ‘Health andWell Being in Schools’ have also been developed. The Integrated Programme trains schoolheads and teachers to act as first level counsellors, so that they are alert and responsive tothe needs of the students and the school.**********
