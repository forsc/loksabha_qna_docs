ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) to (c)	The Ministry is primarily responsible for development and maintenance of National Highways (NHs). The development and maintenance of NHs is a continuous process and works on NHs are, accordingly, taken up as per inter-se-priority, progress of ongoing works, availability of funds and traffic density. The Agency-wise [i.e. State Governments /Union Territories (UTs), National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL), Border Roads Organisation (BRO)] allocation of funds for various schemes for development of NHs are made based on the committed liabilities of sanctioned works under these schemes, inter-se-priority, progress of ongoing works and availability of resources. 	Further, the Government allocates funds for the States/ UTs for development of State Roads as per the Central Road Fund (CRF) Act, 2000, amended by the Finance Act from time to time. In view of above there is no specific policy for allocation of funds for States / UTs based on their relative performances.*****
