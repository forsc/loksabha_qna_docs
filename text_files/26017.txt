ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND POWER (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) So far, no irrigation pumps have been converted into solar pumps under PM-KUSUM in the State of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana as the implementation of the Scheme for converting the irrigation pumps in to solar pumps is yet to start in these states.(b) Solar pumps of different types (AC or DC; Surface or Submersible), capacities (in horse power) and heads (depth of water column) have been standardized by MNRE for installation under PM-KUSUM Scheme.(c) Till 30.06.2021, total 34,045 nos. of standalone solar pumps have been installed in Andhra Pradesh under different MNRE Schemes. Further, post bifurcation of the State, 424 nos. of standalone solar pumps have been installed in the State of Telangana.  Under PM-KUSUM Scheme, only existing standalone diesel pumps in the dark zones/black zones can be converted into standalone solar pumps and only existing grid connected pumps in the dark zones/black zones can be solarized provided they use micro irrigation techniques to save water.(d) Under Component-B of PM-KUSUM, farmers can choose to install Universal Solar Pump Controller (USPC) with off-grid solar pumps. When irrigation is not required, the solar capacity installed with pump can be utilized through USPC, to power other equipment such as chaff cutter, floor mill, cold storage, drier and charging batteries for home lighting etc.  (e) Government has not collaborated with any international entity for implementing the scheme.  *****
