Statement referred to in reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No.*7 for answer on 29.11.2021 (a) to (b): Data pertaining to decennial Census, management information system, sample surveys conducted by different Ministries / Departments of Government of India, reveal that over the years there have been considerable improvements in living conditions of the Scheduled Tribes (STs). However, there are still gaps in social indices between STs and all India population. A comparative statement of some social development indicators with reference to India and social group is Annexed.Higher  Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), number of cases of women affected by anemia may not be exclusively due to high dropout rate, lack of education; there may be other reasons like lack of awareness, not attending to institutional medical facilities, distinctive culture, geographical isolation, backwardness.(c): Government is implementing Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP)/Schedule Tribe Component (STC)/Development Action Plan for Development of STs (DAPSTs) for overall development of tribal people across the country. Besides, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, 40 Central Ministries / Departments have been obligated by NITI Aayog for earmarking certain percentage of their total Scheme allocation every year as TSP funds for tribal development. TSP funds are spent by obligated Central Ministries / Departments under their schemes for various development projects relating to education, health, agriculture, irrigation, roads, housing, drinking water, electrification, employment generation, skill development, etc. for accelerated socio-economic development of Scheduled Tribes in the country. State Governments are also supposed to earmark TSP funds in proportion to ST population (Census 2011) in the State with respect to total State Plan.To bridge the gap, Ministry of Tribal Affairs is implementing the following Schemes and Programmes for Tribal population in addition to the initiatives of line Ministries and States under TSP.•	Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS)•	Grants-in-Aid under Article 275(1) of the Constitution of India•	Post Matric Scholarship for ST students •	Pre-Matric Scholarship for ST students •	National Overseas Scholarship for ST students for studying abroad•	National Fellowship & Scholarship for higher Education for ST students•	Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)•	Grant-in-aid to voluntary organizations working for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes.•	Support to Tribal Research Institutes•	Tribal Festivals, Research Information and Mass Media•	Institutional support for Development and Marketing of Tribal Products / Produce•	Support to National/State Scheduled Tribes Finance and Development Corporation•	Mechanism for marketing of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) through Minimum support Price (MSP) and development of Value Chain for MFP.•	Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRSs)  Expenditure made/fund released by obligated Ministries /Departments under TSP during last three years and current financial year is as under                                  Funds released/Expenditure made                                     (Rs in Crore)2018-19	2019-20	2020-21	2021-22 (as on 18.11.2021)35352.77	45856.40	42963.57	53585.90  (d) : To protect and safeguarding the land rights of STs and to address the issue of land acquisition and displacement of tribals, following Constitutional and legal provisions  inter-alia have been put in place: - •	The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA in short), in section 4 (5) states that save as otherwise provided, no member of a forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes or Other Traditional Forest Dweller shall be evicted or removed from the Forest Land under his occupation till the recognition and verification procedure is complete.
