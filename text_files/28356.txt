                                                        MINISTER OF CULTURE, TOURISM AND DEVELOPMENT OF NORTH EASTERN REGION(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a)  to (c)	National Mission on Cultural Mapping (NMCM) is a scheme administered by the Ministry of Culture conceptualized for the purpose of developing a comprehensive data base of artists, art forms and other resources gathered from cultural organizations in the Ministry of Culture, other Ministries and also States including the State of Haryana on a robust IT-enabled platform. Relevant data in respect of 14.53 lakh artists/ artisans has been collected from various sources viz. Ministry of Textiles, Sangeet Natak Akademi, Lalit Kala Akademi, Sahitya Akademi, National School of Drama, Centre for Cultural Resources and Training, Zonal Cultural Centres, Kalakshetra Foundation etc. Since it is a mapping mission, it doesn’t have elements of direct benefits. The benefits will accrue on the basis of mapping itself.   (d)    No villages were mapped. The mapping was done only for artisans and artists under the Mission.(e)	No such proposal is under consideration with the Government.
