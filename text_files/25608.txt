Doubling between Ernakulam – Ambalappuzha has been taken up in three parts viz. Ernakulam- Kumbalam, Kumbalam - Turavur and Turavur - Ambalapuzha.

Details are given below:-Ernakulam-Kumbalam doubling project (7.71 Km)- A Budget outlay of `10 Crore was provided in the Financial year 2021-22 for the project.
