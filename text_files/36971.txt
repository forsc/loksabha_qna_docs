The Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute (CIFRI), Barrackpore also undertook a study during 2019-21 and found no unusual fish mortality in the region. (b) to (d)The Ministry has delineated a detailed procedure for comprehensive assessment of environmental and social impacts of the project/activity including hydro-power and other infrastructure projects in the Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, as amended; which inter-alia provides for preparation of Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Report, Environmental Management Plan (EMP), Disaster Management Plan (DMP) and Public Consultation. The Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC), comprising domain area experts, after detailed examination and deliberation on environmental concerns viz. protection and conservation of natural environment and biodiversity in the region, occurrence of other natural disasters like flood, landslide etc., recommend the project for grant of Environmental Clearance (EC). Suitable mitigation measures are incorporated, like identification of vulnerable Zones/landslide zones, monitoring of e-flow and preparation and implementation of Fisheries Management Plan, Catchment Area Treatment plan (CAT), Reservoir Rim Treatment Plan (RRT), Disaster Management Plan (DMP) comprising installation of Early Warning Telemetric System  (EWTS) in the upper catchment area, Muck Management Plan, Green belt  development etc. to minimize the impacts of such natural hazards. Apart from the above, new/innovative materials and soil nailing technologies are also used for development of all National Highways, including the National Highways in hilly terrain for reducing the landslide events. *****
