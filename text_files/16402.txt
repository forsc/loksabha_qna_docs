MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (c): The National Education Policy 2020 envisions an education system rooted in Indian ethos that contributes directly to transforming India, that is Bharat, sustainably into an equitable and vibrant knowledge society, by providing high-quality education to all, and thereby making India a global knowledge superpower. The Policy envisages that the curriculum and pedagogy of our institutions must develop among the students a deep sense of respect towards the Fundamental Duties and Constitutional values, bonding with one’s country, and a conscious awareness of one’s roles and responsibilities in a changing world. It stipulates that basic ethical reasoning, traditional Indian values and all basic human and Constitutional values will be developed in all students. 		Towards the attainment of a holistic and multidisciplinary education, the flexible and innovative curricula of all HEIs shall include credit-based courses and projects in the areas of community engagement and service, environmental education, and value-based education which includes the development of humanistic, ethical, Constitutional, and universal human values.*******
