ANSWER




                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a): In the ongoing tranche of auction of commercial mining, 67 coal mines have been offered by Ministry of Coal. Details of these mines are at Annexure.(b): As mandated under the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006, under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, coal mining projects are required to undertake EIA studies which include impact of projects on surface/ground water, and prepare Environment Management Plan for obtaining environmental clearances. Project proposals are examined by the sectoral Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of MOEFCC, GOI for their efficacy and adequacy and suitable conditions are imposed accordingly while granting environment clearances to coal mining projects.  (c) to (f): No grievance against coal mines to be auctioned for commercial mining are pending in the Ministry of Coal. Any non-forestry activity including coal mining has negative ecological impact. Whenever a proposal for diversion of forestland is received, it is examined and due diligence is made to avoid the use of forestland, or to keep it bare minimum. In cases where it is unavoidable, the forest area is allowed to be diverted, subject to certain conditions including the Compensatory Afforestation (CA), payment of Net Present Value (NPV) and the protection/afforestation of Safety Zone area as per Forest Conservation Act(1980). Wherever necessary, the additional mitigation measures in the form of Soil and Moisture Conservation works, Wildlife Management plan etc., are also stipulated on case-to-case basis.  *** ANNEXURES.
