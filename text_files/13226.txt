Since  ‘Police’ and ‘Public-2/…-2-LS.US.Q.NO.1968 FOR 03.03.2020Order’ are State subjects as per the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India, the matter essentially lies within the purview of the Government of Kerala.

To curb irregularities/misutilization, the office of Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) regularly audits expenditure under the scheme at the end of police directorates which are submitted to the competent legislatures. In addition, the Ministry of Home Affairs conducts Concurrent Audit of the scheme and release of funds has been linked with submission of Action Taken Report (ATR) on the observations of concurrent audit reports by the State Governments. The details of central funds allocated and released to the Government of Kerala and utilized by the State Government for police modernization under the scheme of “Assistance to States for Modernization of Police” during the last three years and the current year are as below:       -3/…-3-LS.US.Q.NO.1968 FOR 03.03.2020      (in Rs. crore)Year	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20*Allocation  	To State Government 	12.93	17.48	15.27	16.11	For release in kind	2.01	2.20	2.17	Nil 	TOTAL	14.94	19.68	17.44	 16.11Release 	Against allocation	8.23	12.78	14.51	11.39	For supply in kind	 2.01	2.20	2.17	Nil 	Fund for Student Police Cadet (SPC)	0.85	1.1447	1.104	Nil	TOTAL	11.09	16.1247	17.784	11.39Funds utilized 		11.09(entire funds)	16.1247(entire funds)	Utilization Certificates not due *release position as on 27.02.2020*****
