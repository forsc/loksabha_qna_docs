                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) As per the information received from Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), out of total 22,311 industries in 17 approved Industrial areas, 1091 industries are water polluting industries. All water polluting industries have provided Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) and are connected with 13 Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) with a total capacity of 212.3 MLD. The utilization of 13 CETPs at present is 65 MLD only. These CETPs are operated by CETPs societies and are monitored by DPCC. The compliance of CETPs in Delhi has remain a concern as many of these CETPs are non-compliant. As per latest report of State Government (Feb 2022), only 5 CETPs were complaint to the norms. In Haryana, there are 14 Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) with total capacity of 161.5 MLD having discharge in Yamuna basin. As per report of Haryana State Pollution Control Board, all the CETPs are complying with regulatory norms.Under the Namami Gange Programme, the inventory of Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) located in Delhi and its nearby areas having potential to discharge into river Yamuna and its tributaries was carried out in consultation with concerned State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs). Accordingly, the total GPI in Delhi and its nearby area are as under:Sl. No.	State / SPCB	No. of GPIs		2020	20211	Delhi	267	2102	Haryana	832	9243	Uttar Pradesh	551	5104	Uttarakhand	10	11 	Total	1660	1655 (b) & (c) All the operational GPIs have installed ETP and compliance of ETP systems are verified through regular surveillance. In addition to this, units have also been directed to install online connectivity effluent monitoring system (OCEMS) for self-regulatory purpose and connect it to SPCB and CPCB server.  All 1660 GPIs were inspected by joint team of officials from technical institutes and concerned State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) for compliance verification during October 2020 - March 2021. Based on the compliance status, actions were taken by concerned SPCBs/PCCs.Out of total 1660 GPIs inspected, 787 were found complying, 441 self-closed and 432 non-complying. Out of 432 non-complying, show-cause notices were issued to 406 GPIs and closure directions were issued to 26 GPIs. Based on subsequent compliance verification by SPCBs, show-cause notices issued to 343 units were revoked and closure directions were issued to 50 non-complying units and 321 self-closed units. The status of pollution abatement works (sewage/ industrial) carried out in Delhi and nearby area are being regularly monitored at State and Central level by Principal Committee and Central Monitoring Committee both under the Chairmanship of Secretary, DoWR, RD & GR. Stringent monitoring, regulation and enforcement towards compliance of Grossly Polluting Industries against regulatory framework mandated under Consent mechanism issued in respect of provisions of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 is undertaken through CPCB, State Pollution Control Board (SPCBs) and Pollution Control Committees (PCC). Industry specific effluent/emission standards are notified by Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change under Schedule-I: ‘Standards for Emission or Discharge of Environmental Pollutants from Various Industries’ of Environment Protection Act, 1986.  State Pollution Control Boards and Pollution Control Committees in States and Union Territories respectively are to ensure compliance of these standards.Environmental Compensation (total EC amount Rs.12.05 crore) was imposed by DPCC on the 10 CETP Societies and 2 Operators of CETPs at Narela & Bawana on 07.07.2021.  DPCC also issued directions for closure of 1,065 water polluting industries/ units in the 17 industrial areas connected to the 13 CETPs in first week of July, 2021. Financial assistance is also being provided under Namami Gange Programme to industrial clusters to upgrade/ augment their CETPs.  For Yamuna river, upgradation of one CETP project in Mathura for textile industrial cluster has been taken. *****
