ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a) to (c): Plantation workers are covered by the Plantation Labour Act, 1951 which inter-alia provides for the welfare of plantation workers including tea workers and cinchona workers. The Tea Board is also extending certain welfare measures for the tea workers and their wards/dependants, which are supplemental in nature. The labour welfare measures are being undertaken within the ambit of the Human Resource Development (HRD) component under the Tea Development & Promotion Scheme.  The workers are also covered by various industrial and social security legislations such as Employees Compensation Act, 1923, Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, Payment of Bonus Act, 1965, Maternity Benefit Act, 1961, Payment of Wages Act, 1936, Equal Remuneration Act, 1976, Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and Industrial Employment (Standing Order) Act, 1946 as applicable.  The fixation of minimum wages for workers falls under the purview of State Governments, which are the appropriate Government to fix/revise the minimum wages as per the provision under the Minimum wages Act, 1948. Moreover, the wages of tea garden workers are fixed as per agreement reached between producer associations and workers’ unions.  The Central Government has announced a special scheme to be implemented during 2021-22 to 2025-26, with budgetary outlay of Rs.1000 cr. for the welfare of tea workers especially women and their children in the States of Assam & West Bengal(d) & (e): 	Subsidy claims received from Tea growers of the country including Darjeeling, are settled as per the guidelines of the Tea Development and Promotion Scheme. Subsidies related to long term development activities like uprooting & replanting, rejuvenation pruning and infilling, become due for payment after a gap of a few years, which creates some backlog. During the period 2017-18 till February, 2021, the Tea Board has provided financial assistance of Rs. 71.58 Crore in the State of West Bengal, including Rs. 8.31 Crore for the Darjeeling Hills.(f)  In wake of COVID-19 pandemic, the Government/RBI have taken various policy measures to ease the financial stress in various Sectors including Tea by providing relief on debt servicing, improving access to working capital, grant of moratorium till 31st August, 2020 on payment of all installments in respect of term loans, etc. In addition, to ensure that farmers do not pay higher interest during moratorium period, the benefit of 2% Interest Subvention and 3% Prompt Repayment Incentive were also extended to them.**********
