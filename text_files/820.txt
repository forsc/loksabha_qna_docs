ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.  *****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 719 BY  SHRI THOMAS CHAZHIKADAN TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 26.06.2019 REGARDING  COACHING TERMINAL AT KOTTAYAM (a): Based on the announcement made in the Railway Budget speech for the year 2011-12, survey for Coaching Terminal at Kottayam was sanctioned in April 2012. As per the survey report prepared for this proposal during 2014-15, cost of construction of the proposed terminal at Kottayam was assessed ` 148.67 crores with rate return of (-)1.24%. Survey report of the proposed work has been examined. However, this proposal could not be taken forward as development of coaching terminal at  Kottayam is not required from operational point of view.(b): Construction of a new Pilgrim Center costing ` 2 crores is planned along with provision of new Executive Lounge in the existing Pilgrim shelter.(c): The 26.54 Km long doubling work of Kuruppantara-Chingavanam was sanctioned in 2007-08. Latest anticipated cost of this project is    ` 457 crores and expenditure of ` 305.19 crores has been done upto March, 2019. For speedy execution of works on this project, Budget Outlay of  ` 85 crores has been  made during 2019-20. 8 Km long section for Kuruppantara-Ettumanur has been commissioned in March, 2019. The work for acquisition of balance land and construction works in available land have been taken up on Ettumanur-Kottayam-Chingavanam (18.54 Km). Completion of the project is dependent upon many factors such as land acquisition, statutory clearances like forestry clearances and wild life clearances, shifting of services, cutting of trees, construction of road over bridges and road under bridges by road maintaining agencies.Since action for balance land acquisition has been taken up, therefore, fixing the timeline for completion of Ettumanur-Kottayam-Chingavanam doubling at this stage is not feasible.*****
