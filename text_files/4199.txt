                                                        THE MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES & PUBLIC ENTERPRISES(SHRI ARVIND GANPAT SAWANT)(a) & (b):Yes sir, the Government is aware that the auto sector which has been growing at approximately 7-8% per annum has witnessed a sluggish rate of sales in the last two quarters. During period from January 2018-June 2018, 13.39 million vehicles (all categories) were sold and during period from January 2019-June 2019 12.04 million vehicles were sold. Hence a net decline of 10.08% was registered in the rate of automobile sale in the last two quarters.     The Government, as a policymaker, always attempts to kickstart the sluggish economy through a package of measures for comprehensive and continued development of the auto sector as and when required. 			                             *****
