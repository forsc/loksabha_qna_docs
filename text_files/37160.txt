                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)      Rural Roads is a State subject. Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) was launched as a one-time special intervention to provide rural connectivity, by way of a single all-weather road, to the eligible unconnected habitations of designated population size (500+ in plain areas and 250+ in North-Eastern States, Himalayan States and Himalayan Union Territories as per 2001 census) in the core network for uplifting the socio-economic condition of the rural population. Relaxation has been provided to the Tribal (Schedule V) areas and Selected Tribal and Backward Districts (as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and Planning Commission) and unconnected habitations in these areas with a population of 250 persons and above in the Core Network as per Census 2001 are eligible for connectivity under the scheme. In the critical Left Wing Extremism affected blocks (as identified by Ministry of Home Affairs), additional relaxation has been given to connect habitations with population 100 persons and above as per 2001 census.  The mandate of PMGSY has been subsequently widened to include new interventions.  PMGSY-II was launched in the year 2013, with a target to upgrade 50,000 Kms of the existing rural road network to improve its overall efficiency as a provider of transportation services for people, goods and services.  Road Connectivity Project for Left Wing Extremism Affected Areas (RCPLWEA) was launched in the year 2016 for construction/upgradation of strategically important roads chosen in the 44 worst affected LWE districts and adjoining districts in the 9 States of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.   PMGSY-III was launched in the year 2019 for consolidation of 1,25,000 Km Through Routes and Major Rural Links connecting habitations,  inter-alia, to Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs), Higher Secondary Schools and Hospitals.  The main features of PMGSY are decentralized and evidence based planning, standards and specifications as per Indian Road Congress (IRC) and Rural Roads Manual, dedicated  implementation mechanism at central, state and district level, scrutiny of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) at multiple levels, strong IT backbone for monitoring and implementation of the programme, three-tier quality management system, unbroken flow of funds, inbuilt mechanism for consultation with public representatives in planning, selection and monitoring of works, etc. (b)       The details of the central share of funds released, expenditure (including state share) for implementation of PMGSY during the last three years and the current year, State-wise, including Tamil Nadu are given in Annexure (c)       A total of 7,82,723 Km road length has been sanctioned under various verticals of PMGSY, out of which 6,97,837 Km has already been completed as on 24th March, 2022. In the State of Tamil Nadu, 22,458 Km road length has been sanctioned and 21,389  Km completed. The achievement under various verticals of PMGSY in the country and in the State of Tamil Nadu is given below:-                                                         Road length in KmVertical	        Sanctioned	 Completed	       Balance*PMGSY-I	                6,45,478	6,13,808	      16,587PMGSY-II	          49,885	46,669	               2,752RCPLWEA	                  10,231	5,516	               4,679PMGSY-III	          77,129	31,844	              45,092Total	                7,82,723	6,97,837	      69,110 Tamil Nadu                                                          Road length in KmVertical	Sanctioned	Completed	Balance*PMGSY-I	       16,320	        16,168	          00PMGSY-II	2,940	         2,936	          00PMGSY-III	3,198	         2,285	         898Total:	       22,458	        21,389	         898*Balance road length is less than the difference of sanctioned and completed length due to the reasons that some projects were completed with less than the sanctioned length due to reduction in road length, change in alignment, construction of part length by other agencies, etc. The Ministry has given a deadline of September, 2022 for completion of PMGSY-I & II and March, 2023 for RCPLWEA.  The implementation period of PMGSY-III is upto March, 2025.  (d)   PMGSY is being implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development through State Rural Roads Development Agencies (SRRDAs) constituted by the respective State Governments for the implementation of the programme at the State level. There is no role  of Ministry of Panchayati Raj in so far as implementation of PMGSY is concerned.                                     *****
