ANSWER




                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)  (a) & (b): Yes, sir. It is a fact that there is a shortage of coking coal used in steel plants and some part of their requirement is met by the companies from imported coking coal. Steel plants require low ash content of coal for their sustainability with respect to techno-economics as well as environmental aspects. The overall availability of coking coal from indigenous sources is inadequate to meet the requirement of steel plants. The ash content in unwashed indigenous coking coal is typically in the range of 22-35% whereas technological requirement of ash content in coking coal for use in steel plants is normally about 10-12%. High ash indigenous coking coal is washed in coal washeries to reduce ash content. Even after washing, indigenous coking coal typically contains about 18-20% ash. (c) & (d): Six coal mines were allocated to PSU steel plants. Details of these mines are given below:S.No.	Name of coal mine	State in which mine is Located	Allottee	Remarks1	Sitanala	Jharkhand	SAIL	Allottee requested for surrender of mine. Allotment agreement/order was terminated in the year 2018.2	Parbatpur-Central	Jharkhand	SAIL	Allottee requested for surrender of mine. Allotment agreement/order was terminated in the year 2019.3	Rabodih OCP	Jharkhand	RINL	Allotted on the request of Ministry of Steel/RINL under Rule 11(10) of Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Rules, 2014.4	Chasnalla	Jharkhand	SAIL	-5	Jitpur	Jharkhand	SAIL	-6	Ramnagore	West Bengal	SAIL	- (e): Earlier, coal blocks were allotted under the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1973 [CMN Act] through screening committee constituted for screening proposals for allocation of coal/lignite blocks for manufacture of iron/steel, captive production of power and production of cement in the public/private sector. Now, allocation of coal mines are made under the provisions of the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 [CMSP Act] and the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 [MMDR Act]. Allocation is made through e-auction to public and private sector companies. Allocation to Government companies was made through allotment under CM(SP) Act, 2015 and MM(DR) Act, 1957. Recently, coal block allocation for commercial mining through auction has been introduced and the PSUs may participate in the auctions for coal block to meet their requirements.***
