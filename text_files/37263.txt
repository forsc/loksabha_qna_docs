                                                        ANSWER  THE MINISTER OF FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING:(SHRI PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a)	: During the year 2020-2021 due to flight restrictions amid Covid pandemic, a marginal decrease in quantity of fish exported from India has been reported by Government of Telangana. Further, Government of Telangana also reported that there was no loss reported by fishers/ fish farmers, due to non-supply of fish within the country.(b): As reported by the Government of Telangana, no fish farmer was affected due to covid induced restrictions in Telangana.(c) & (d):  The Government of India immediately intervened to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 crisis by announcing a number of immediate relief measures to facilitate uninterrupted supply of inputs like seed and feed to the sector and to promote exports. In order to mitigate hardship faced by fishers, fish farmers, and fish traders, Government of India permitted unhindered operations of the fishing and aquaculture industry including feeding, maintenance & harvesting in the farm, processing, packaging, cold chain, sale and marketing, hatcheries, feed plants, commercial aquaria and movement of inputs, fish/shrimp, fish products and workers. Besides, the Ministry of Home Affairs’ Guidelines dated 10th April, 2020 also allowed operations of the fishing (marine)/aquaculture industry including feeding & maintenance, harvesting, processing, packaging, cold chain, sale and marketing, hatcheries,  feed  plants,  commercial  aquaria,  movement  of  fish/shrimp  and  fish  products, seed/feed and workers. In addition, the Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying has launched a flagship scheme namely Pradhan Mantri Matsya SampadaYojana (PMMSY) as a part of Atma Nirbhar Bharat Package with an estimated investment of Rs. 20,050 crores for implementation in all States/Union Territories over a period of 5 years from Financial Year (FY) 2020-21 to 2024-25. All the efforts of Government have resulted in the mitigation of the impact of Covid pandemic on fisheries sector.  *****
