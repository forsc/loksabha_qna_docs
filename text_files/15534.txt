                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS (KIREN RIJIJU)  (a) Khelo India Games, National and State level competitions in different sports disciplines and success of Indian athletes in international arena help create awareness and increase participation of youth in the country in Olympic sports.  (b)  Sports being a State subject, primary responsibility for promotion and development of sports including creation of training infrastructure for Olympic sports in rural and non-metro areas is that of the respective state /UT Governments. Central Government supplements the efforts of State/UT Governments for bridging sports infrastructure gaps in States through Khelo India Scheme. Further, sports infrastructure and training facilities of international standards are already available at 5 SAI stadia in New Delhi and at regional Centres of SAI across the country.    (c) & (d):  Preparation of Indian sportspersons and teams for international sports events including Olympics is an ongoing process. The Central Government is supporting sportspersons through National Sports Federations (NSFs) for their training, foreign exposures and competitions to enable them to obtain maximum quota for participation in Olympics and enhance their chances of winning medals. High priority category has been created to put focus on and incentivize those sports disciplines played in the Olympics in which India has won medals in the last conducted Asian Games as well as Commonwealth Games or in which India has good chance of winning medals in Olympics. Presently, nine sports disciplines viz., (i) Athletics, (ii) Badminton (iii) Hockey (iv) Shooting (v) Tennis (vi) Weightlifting (vii) Wrestling, (viii) Archery and (ix) Boxing have been categorised as ‘High Priority’ under the Scheme of Assistance to National Sports Federations (NSFs).   Under the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), customized training and allied facilities are also being made available to medal prospects and high achievers. Extensive or special training is being provided to the selected athletes as per their requirements under selected coaches / training institutes in India and abroad.   ****
