ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) As envisaged under Article 243G of the Constitution, the Panchayats function as institutions of local self-governance and implement schemes for economic development and social justice in rural areas. (b) & (c) The subject Panchayats, which is part of “Local Government” is included in the State List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. The implementation of the provisions of Part IX of the Constitution is reviewed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) from time to time through studies and discussions in review meetings with the States. The performance of the Panchayats depends on the extent of powers and resources devolved to them, which varies from State to State. The performance of Panchayats is monitored by the State Governments. MoPR supports States in building capacities of Panchayats for rural governance. It also helps States in developing guidelines for participatory planning by Panchayats and preparation of Gram Panchayat Development Plans; bring in efficiency, transparency and accountability for achieving development objectives. MoPR has also developed a suite of core common software applications, collectively known as Panchayat Enterprise Suite (PES) Applications to aid Panchayats to undertake functions like planning, budgeting, implementation, accounting, monitoring and delivery of citizen services. (d) & (e) The Government has launched the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) in order to strengthen the governance capabilities of Panchayati Raj Institutions to deliver on Sustainable Development Goals. The RGSA scheme is being implemented from 2018-19 to 2021-22 with a total outlay of Rs 7255.50 crore having Central share of Rs. 4500 crore and State share of 2755.50 crore. The Central component is fully funded by Government of India. However for the State component, the funding pattern is 60:40 for all States, except North East and Hill States where Centre and State ratio is 90:10. For Union Territories, the Central share is 100%. The Scheme is applicable to all States and Union Territories of the country with emphasis on convergence with Mission Antyodaya and strengthening of Panchayats in the identified Aspirational Districts.  Funds under RGSA Scheme are sanctioned on the basis of annual plan proposals of States as approved by the Central Empowered Committee of RGPSA. Releases are normally made in two instalments, the first instalment being 50% of the sanctioned amount after deducting the unspent balance available with State at the time of release. The second instalment is released after expenditure of 60% of the total available funds i.e. opening balance and funds released as first instalment.**********
