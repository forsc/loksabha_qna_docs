ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE					(SHRI AJAY BHATT)      IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE(a) to (c): In the Union Budget for 2022-23, an announcement has been made to set up an independent nodal umbrella body for meeting wide ranging testing and certification requirements. The nodal body is envisaged to be an autonomous body to permit, promote, hand-hold, monitor & supervise and act as a Single-Window Nodal agency to enable and regulate the existing facilities of Trial, Testing and Certification of Defence Products, besides creating new facilities. The Government aims to promote transparency, approachability, equitability and timely delivery of all Defence trial, testing and certification activities and related services through this body.(d): During the last three financial years (2018-19 to 2020-21) and current financial year 2021-22 (up to February 2022), 127 capital acquisition contracts have been signed with Indian vendors for capital procurement of Defence equipment for Armed Forces. Out of these, 55 contracts have been signed with PSUs/erstwhile OFB/DRDO and 72 contracts have been signed with Indian private vendors for capital procurement of Defence equipment for Armed Forces.(e): Over the past few years, the Government has initiated concerted steps for providing impetus to capability development planning in the Defence Forces.  Some of these important initiatives are as under:-(i) Defence planning Committee (DPC) The DPC under the chairmanship of National Security Advisor has been constituted in 2018 for facilitating Integrated Planning at the apex level and is focused towards promoting Strategic Planning, Capability Development, Defence Diplomacy and Indigenisation in Defence Sector. The DPC has provided an ideal platform to the Indian Military for working towards addressing its priority capability development needs.(ii) Appointment of CDS The appointment of the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and the creation of Department of Military Affairs (DMA), has resulted in far greater synergy with MoD as also given the twin objectives of ‘Integration/Jointness’ and ‘Resources Optimisation’ within the Services a much needed fillip. In addition, it has resulted in Integrated planning for the Defence Forces.(iii) Long Term Modernisation Planning Factoring the emerging/ futuristic security challenges, and in consonance with the ‘CCS Mandate to CDS’ for implementing the Integrated Capability Development Plan (ICDP), an Integrated Capability Development System (ICADS) has been initiated vide DAP-2020. The ICADS process maximizes resource optimization and infuses much needed jointness/integration in tri-service planning process. (iv) Reorganisation of IHQ of MoD (Army) The recent reorganization of the IHQ of MoD (Army), creating a Deputy Chief for looking after the strategy and planning needs of the Indian Army, further streamlines the planning process within the Indian Army.  *****
