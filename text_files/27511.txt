ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)&(b)	As per the India State of Forest Report (ISFR),2019 published by Forest Survey of India, the Forest cover of 13 Himalayan States/Union Territory Administrations namely Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, Assam and West Bengal has increased by 3.0 square kilometers as compared to India State of Forest Report (ISFR), 2017.   Flood is a natural calamity and is attributed to various factors including  deforestation, wide variation in rainfall pattern, inadequate carrying capacities of rivers, river bank erosion, silting of river beds, landslides, poor natural drainage, snow melts and glacial lake outbursts etc. The deforestation in the catchment area of any river leads to change in morphology and behavior of the river which impacts its discharge and run-off pattern. Rivers of northern Bihar viz Kosi, Kamla and Bagmati have their origin as well as major catchment area in Nepal. Flooding of these rivers in monsoon season cause devastation and damage to life and property.The State Governments formulate and implement the flood management schemes. Central Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas.(c)&(d)	India has bilateral engagement with Nepal in the areas of flood forecasting, data sharing, river training and flood control for cross border rivers. The Government of India is regularly interacting with the Government of Nepal for construction of dams on rivers for mutual benefit of the two countries which will also contribute to flood control. However, this Ministry has not received any proposal regarding assistance for afforestation from the Government of Nepal.  *****
