Currently, a total of 2,028 MRFs, 24 RDFs and 25 WtE plants are operational across all the ULBs, with estimated designed capacity of 42,478 TPD, 12,420 TPD and 3,008 TPD respectively.

At present, centralized 2,285 WtC plants and 99 Bio-methanation plants are operational across the country, with estimated designed capacity of 71,682 TPD and 2,288 TPD respectively. Besides this, ULBs are also implementing non-centralized composting of organic waste at individual household and institutional levels.                                    *****
