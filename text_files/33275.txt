The status of availability of rural health infrastructure, including for the states of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Jharkhand is given atAnnexure I. Public Health & Hospitals is a State subject, the primary responsibility for ensuring the availability of healthcare facilities lies with respective State/UT Government. Further, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India provides financial and technical support to the States/UTs under various health schemes/projects for strengthening the healthcare facilities for provision of equitable, affordable healthcare to all citizens based on the requirements posed by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs). Further, as on date, establishment of 22 AIIMS and 75 upgradation projects of GMCs/Institutes have been sanctioned, out of which6 AIIMS are fully functional. Support is also envisaged to the States for construction of Critical Care Blocks (CCBs) at district level. These CCBs are envisaged to have advanced medical facilities. However, construction of super specialty hospitals in such areas lies in the domain of the respective State Government.The details regarding allocation and utilization of funds under various Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), implemented by MoHFW in the country during the last three years is given at Annexure-II.The effects of the innovative policies and programmes of MoHFW, Government of India for the inclusive growth of its population and the efficient implementation at the grass-root level are evident from the findings of NFHS-5 (2019-21). The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) of the country has reached below the replacement level of fertility. The contraception prevalence rate, antenatal care coverage, institutional deliveries, immunisation coverage have increased since the last round of NFHS (2015-16).
