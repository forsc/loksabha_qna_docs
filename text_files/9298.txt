At State level, Mission implementation is coordinated by the State level High Powered Steering Committee (HPSC) chaired by the Chief Secretary of the State. At the National level, the implementation of Smart Cities Mission is being monitored by an Apex Committee headed by Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA). The Nominee Directors of MoHUA, on the Boards of SPVs, are also monitoring the progress in respective cities on a regular basis. The MoHUA regularly interacts with the States/Smart Cities through video conferences, review meetings, field visits, regional workshops etc. at various levels to assess the performance of the cities and to handhold them for improving the same. Besides, the guidance of domain experts participating in the regional workshops, cities also benefit from peer-to-peer learning during these interactions.  The Smart Cities are also regularly reporting implementation status of projects, including utilization of funds, under SCM through the Online-Management Information System (MIS). In addition, all the Smart Cities have been advised to furnish utilization status of GoI funds on a monthly basis for monitoring the utilization of funds more closely.                                               *****
