                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) :		The total circuit kilometers (ckm) of transmission lines at the voltage level of 220 kV and above in the country is 4,15,517 ckm as on 30.6.2019.(b) :		The transmission lines are allowed to be run to their full capacity wherever it is permissible in accordance with Regulations/standards of Central Electricity Authority (CEA)/Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC).  However, in certain cases, the loading on transmission lines may have to be restricted keeping in view the voltage stability, angular stability, loop flows, load flow pattern and loading of weakest link in the grid.(c) :		Presently, there is no constraint in the Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) for transfer of long term allocated power from various generating stations in Gujarat to different beneficiary States.(d) :		Augmentation of the ISTS network is a continuous process and is being carried out regularly based on implementation of new generations projects, growing power demand, to address operational constraints etc. A number of transmission lines are under implementation which would facilitate power transfer from resource rich Western Region to power deficit areas, the details are as under : 	(i)	Warora-Warangal 765 kV D/C line	(ii)	600 MW, + 800 kV Raigarh – Pugalur HVDC bipole line(iii)	Upgradation of + 800 kV Champa – Kurukshetra HVDC bipole line from 3000 MW to 6000 MW	(iv)	Vindhyachal-Varanasi 765 kV D/C line (e) & (f): 	Based on the proposals of Gujarat, 9 schemes have been approved for which about Rs.400 crores has been sanctioned.		The funds from PSDF are utilized for the categories of projects as given below:•	Creating necessary transmission systems of strategic importance for relieving congestion in Inter-State Transmission Systems (ISTS) and intra-state system which are incidental to the ISTS.•	Installation of shunt capacitors, series compensators and other reactive energy generators for improvement of voltage profile in the Grid.•	Installation of standard and special protection schemes, pilot and demonstrative projects, projects for setting right the discrepancies identified in the protection audits on regional basis, any communication/measurement/ monitoring scheme including installation of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) etc.•	Renovation and Modernization (R&M) of transmission and distribution systems for relieving congestion.•	Any other scheme/project in furtherance of the above objectives, such as, conducting technical studies and capacity building, etc.***************
