The erstwhile Drought Prone Areas Programme (DPAP) along with two other programmes namely, Desert Development Programme (DDP) and Integrated Wasteland Development Programme (IWDP) were integrated into a single modified programme known as Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) in 2009-10 for the development of rainfed / degraded areas. Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) was amalgamated as the Watershed Development Component of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (WDC-PMKSY) in 2015-16. Since the Government is focusing on completion of all on-going projects, no new projects have been sanctioned under WDC-PMKSY w.e.f. 2015-16.During 2009-10 to 2014-15, the DoLR has sanctioned a total of 432 watershed projects in the State of Andhra Pradesh. Out of these, 260 projects have been reported as completed and 59 preparatory phase projects were transferred to State in 2018 for implementation with State budget. The district wise status of Watershed Projects are given at Annexure.( c)	As per the information received from Govt. of Andhra Pradesh, the major thrust of Watershed projects interventions is on Natural Resource Management, Production Systems Improvement under agriculture, livestock development and allied sectors, and providing sustainable livelihoods to the asset less families in the watershed areas through scientific and participatory approaches. There are no specific targets fixed towards resolving drinking water shortage in Andhra Pradesh under Watershed Program. However, as per the information received from State Government of Andhra Pradesh, 1,95,467 water harvesting structures have been created/rejuvenated under WDC-PMKSY from 2014-15 to 2020-21(Quarter 3)                                          *****
