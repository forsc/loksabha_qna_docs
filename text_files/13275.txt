ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) & (b):     Yes Sir.  The Government had prohibited export of all varieties of onions from 29.09.2019 vide Notification No. 21/2015-2020.  Subsequently, the Government had allowed export of Bangalore Rose Onion upto a quantity of 9,000 MT over the period from 28.10.2019 to 30.11.2019 vide Notification No. 27/2015-2020 as well as export of Krishnapuram Onion upto a quantity of 10,000 MT during the period from 06.02.2020 to 31.03.2020 vide Notification No. 46/2015-2020.  However, the Government has allowed export of all varieties of Onions “free” without any conditions with effect from 15th March, 2020 vide Notification No. 49/2015-20 dated 02.03.2020 and the Notification No. 46/2015-2020 related to export of Krishnapuram Onions stands withdrawn with effect from 15.03.2020.  At the same time, the Government has initially imposed stock-limits for storing onions upto 50 MT for Wholesaler and 10 MT for Retailer of all States/ UTs vide Notification S.O. 3540(E) dated 29.09.2019, which has now been removed vide Notification S.O. 9017(E) dated 27.02.2020 in view of moderation in onion prices as well as estimated bumper rabi crop harvests indicating improved arrivals and availability.(c) & (d):  The Government, inter alia, builds buffer stock of onions under Price Stabilization Fund (PSF) Scheme through procurement during peak season so as to make price stabilizing market interventions during lean seasons.  The procurement of Rabi onion under PSF for 2019-20 is 57.23 Thousand MT.  Moreover, in order to address the onion shortage situation, a Crop Weather Watch Group consisting of members from Indian Meteorological Department, Central Water Commission, Department of Consumer Affairs, Department of Fertilizer, Department of Food & Public Distribution and Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare monitors the sowing, growth of onion crop and harvesting time of the crop through meetings and video conferences with the States.  The assistance @ 50% of the cost (Rs. 1.75 lakh/unit) is also provided to farmers for construction of the low cost onion storage (25MT capacity) as per the guidelines of Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture.                                                      ****
