Prasar Bharati network through DD Free Dish (DTH) and other satellite services, cable TV etc. and AIR covers almost 100% area of the country. More than 200 AIR Channels are also made available on “NewsOnAir” mobile app for “android” and “iOS” platform for mobile users and on newsonair.com website for listening globally.(b) & (c)	Requests from State Governments / Public representatives (MPs/MLAs) / Government representatives etc. are received from time to time for new installations. Decision on the same is taken on the basis of scheme guidelines, inter-se priority and availability of funds.****
