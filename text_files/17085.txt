                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE, MINISTER OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY AND MINISTER OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR HARSH VARDHAN) (a)       Consolidation of University Research for Innovation and Excellence in women Universities (CURIE) Programme under KIRAN (Knowledge Involvement in Research Advancement through Nurturing) Scheme is aimed to develop research infrastructure and creation of state-of-the-art research laboratories in Women Universities of the country. Since the inception of the programme, Nine (9) women universities viz. i) Avinashilingam Institute for Home Science and Higher Education for Women, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu; ii) Banasthali Vidyapith, Banasthali, Rajasthan; iii) Sri Padmavati Mahila Vishwavidyalayam, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh; iv) SNDT Women University, Mumbai, Maharashtra; v) Mother Teresa Women’s University, Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu; vi) Karnataka State Akkamahadevi Women''s University, Vijayapura, Karnataka; vii) Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women, New Delhi, Delhi; viii) Rama Devi Women’s University, Bhubaneswar, Odisha and ix) Bhagat Phool Singh Mahila Vishwavidyalaya, Sonipat, Haryana have been supported under CURIE programme. Basic and Applied Sciences Departments of these women universities have been equipped with modern sophisticated instruments through CURIE support. The total financial support of Rs 43 Crore (approx.) has been provided to women universities under this programme. In addition to this, facility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Lab has also been established in Six (6) women universities during 2019-20 to develop pool of AI skilled women workforce for better opportunities in research and employment. Department of Science & Technology has invested Rs. 4.20 Crore to establish AI facilities in beneficiary women universities. With this support, women universities have started various programmes and activities such as Certificate/Diploma/Elective Courses in AI, foundation course on AI for Under Graduate students, summer/winter schools, etc. for training of students in AI field.  (b)       Women Technology Parks (WTPs) are envisaged to act as scientific resource centre where necessary support is made available to train women at grassroots level. During the last five years, 42 Women Technology Parks have been established in various parts of the country. Under WTPs, several capacity building programmes are being conducted for women to improve their skills through Science & Technology (S&T) based rural technologies, livelihood generation, improving the quality of life by reducing drudgery, better resource management through value addition, etc. The infrastructural support is extended to these WTPs for procurement of equipment which are required for training of women beneficiaries. The WTPs are designed for livelihood generation of women at grassroots level, however, women students can also avail the benefit of training programmes conducted in these WTPs. (c)       Women Technology Parks (WTPs) play a major role in identifying demand and appropriate technologies and further to train women at grassroots level in these technologies. This results in increased productivity and income generation of women. The training programmes under WTPs are compliant with National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF) which encourages women to undertake training at WTP.                                                                  *****
