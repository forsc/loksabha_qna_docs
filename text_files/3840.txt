ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (d): The Government has undertaken a detailed exercise in formulating a NewEducation Policy and the Committee for the Draft National Education Policy under theChairmanship of Dr. K. Kasturirangan has submitted its report to the Ministry on 31st May2019. The Draft NEP 2019 suggests several measures to promote multilinguism and developIndian languages including education in mother tongue in early stages of schooling with theaim of promoting multilingual communicative abilities across the various regions of thecountry. This would help raise the status of all Indian languages, the teachers of suchlanguages, and the literature of such languages, and would open positions and increaseopportunities for language teachers across the country; it would of course also truly expandhorizons and enlarge the range of opportunities for graduating students. The draft NEP 2019also suggests that there will be a major effort from both the Central and State governmentsto invest in large numbers of language teachers in all regional languages around the country,and in particular all Schedule 8 languages. It mentions that States may enter into bilateralagreements to hire teachers in large numbers from each other.The Government is committed towards the equal development and promotion of all Indianlanguages.At this stage, the Draft NEP 2019 has been uploaded on MHRD website and also atinnovate.mygov.in platform to elicit suggestions/comments from all stakeholders includingthe public, Government of India Ministries and State Governments. The Government willfinalize the National Education Policy only after considering the inputs/suggestions andcomments of all stakeholders.********
