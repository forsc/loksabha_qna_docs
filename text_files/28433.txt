ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (e) Opening of new Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) is a continuous process. KVs areopened on the basis of availability of Central Government employees, land andtemporary accommodation as per Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) norms. The KVsare opened primarily to cater to the educational needs of the children of transferableCentral Government employees including Defence & Para-Military personnel, CentralAutonomous Bodies, Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and Central Institute ofHigher Learning (IHL) by providing a common programme of education. Proposals foropening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments ofthe Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrationsand committing resources for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from varioussponsoring authorities found fulfilling the mandatory pre-requisites for opening of newKVs have to compete with other such proposals under the “Challenge Method” and alsosubject to approval of the competent authority.Proposals for opening of new KVs at Khinvsar, Parbatsar and Didwana inNagaur, Rajasthan have been received by Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS). Thereare some discrepancies / deficiencies in these proposals which have been brought tothe notice of district Administration, Nagaur by KVS for necessary rectification.Proposals for opening of new KVs at Merta, Nagaur and Hindaun City, Karauli havebeen found fulfilling the mandatory pre-requisites as per norms of KVS. Proposal inprescribed proforma for opening of a new KV at Sujangarh in Churu District has notbeen received in KVS from the State Government of Rajasthan.The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one Jawahar NavodayaVidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country for providing good quality moderneducation to the talented children predominantly from rural areas. All the districts (as on31st May, 2014) of the States/UTs which have accepted the scheme, have beencovered. Opening of new Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) is a continuous processwhich depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government / UTadministration to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction ofthe permanent building and making available required temporary building, free of rent, torun the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However, actual sanctionand opening of new JNV depends on the availability of funds and approval by theCompetent Authority.All the 33 districts of Rajasthan (including Churu and Nagaur districts) have beencovered under Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme and two additional JNVs in Banswara (STconcentrated) & Sri Ganganagar (SC concentrated) districts have also been established.Thus, total 35 JNVs have been established in Rajasthan.(f) State / UT-wise details of teachers and students studying in KVs operating acrossthe country are annexed.*****
