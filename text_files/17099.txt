                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c):	Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) covers deprived families in rural areas and families of workers of identified occupational categories in urban areas, as per the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) -2011 data. Further, all such beneficiary families under erstwhile Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana that do not figure in the targeted groups as per SECC data are also covered under AB-PMJAY.  AB-PMJAY is an entitlement-based scheme and all the entitled families are covered from the day one of the implementation of the scheme in the State/UT. No registration or enrolment of beneficiaries is required for availing the benefits under the scheme.(c):	However, to facilitate easy availing of benefits, after verification of beneficiary, e-cards have been issued. As of 14.09.2020, over 12.55 crore beneficiaries have been verified under the scheme. In Bihar, as of 14.09.2020 53.9 Lakhs beneficiaries have been verified. The States/UT wise details of e-cards issued to the beneficiaries are at Annexure. (d):		To ensure that no eligible beneficiary is deprived of the scheme benefits, the State Health Agencies (SHAs) have been directed to conduct the beneficiary identification in mission mode. SHAs have also been advised to screen all the in-patients in the empaneled hospitals in order to identify the scheme beneficiaries.  Further, a comprehensive media and outreach strategy to spread awareness and empowering the beneficiaries about their entitlements and rights under the scheme has been followed. This includes use of media vehicles such as outdoor media, digital display at ticket counters across various railway stations, announcements at major bus stations, passenger train branding, national and regional press coverage, op-eds and advertorials in print media, radio campaign, telecast of beneficiary testimonials via Doordarshan, mass messaging through SMS, traditional media etc.    To establish/validate the identity of the beneficiary prior to taking treatment, an identification system is put up in place. Upon successful validation of identity of the beneficiary, a paper-based e-card is provided with unique ID for streamlining the delivery of services. (e):	As of 14.09.2020, over 1.23 Crore hospital admissions have been authorized under the scheme. The State/UT-wise details are at the Annexure.At present, there is no provision to include new beneficiary families under the scheme. However, missed-out family member(s) can be added to the existing beneficiary families.(f):	As of 14.09.2020, 545 hospitals, including 374 hospitals of private sector, are empaneled in Haryana.  AB-PMJAY is presently not being implemented in NCT of Delhi. However, since there is portability of benefits across the country, 66 hospitals, including 35 private hospitals, are empaneled in Delhi for providing services to beneficiaries from other States.
