ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (d) The Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)-Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN) on 21-10-2016 to facilitate/ stimulate regional air connectivity and make air travel affordable for the masses. Promoting affordability of regional air connectivity is envisioned under RCS by supporting airline operators through (i) concessions by Central Government, State Governments and airport operators to reduce cost of airline operations on regional routes and (ii) financial support (Viability Gap Funding) to meet the gap, if any, between the cost of airline operations and expected revenues on regional routes.;Under RCS-UDAN version 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0, 106 airports/waterdromes (76 unserved, 20 underserved and 10 waterdromes) and 31 heliports have been awarded. Out of these, 39 RCS Airports (16 underserved & 23 unserved) have been revived /developed for operationalization of RCS flights. The list of these airports is at Annexure A.;;The revival of these unserved/underserved airports is ''demand driven'', depending upon firm commitment from airline operators who operate from these airports as well as from the State Governments who provide the various concessions. RCS-UDAN is monitored on regular basis for timely implementation and corrective steps are taken whenever required.
