ANSWER




MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) & (b):	Budgetary allocation of funds is not made State/UT-wise.  Funds are directly released to the eligible handloom agencies/weavers on receipt of viable proposals duly recommended by the concerned State Governments and subsequent instalment of funds is released on receipt of utilisation certificate of previous released funds.  However, scheme-wise funds released to the handloom agencies/weavers in the last two years for the entire country is as under: -Scheme-wise funds released in the last two years (2018-19 & 2019-20)SN	Name of Scheme	2018-19(Rs. In crore)	2019-20(Rs. In crore)	Total (2018-19 to 2019-20)(Rs. In crore)  1	National Handloom Development Programme (NHDP)	118.72	141.87	260.592	Comprehensive Handloom Cluster Development Scheme (CHCDS)	16.38	16.22	32.603	Handloom Weavers Comprehensive Welfare Scheme (HWCWS)	2.06	8.04	10.104	Yarn Supply Scheme (YSS)	126.84	142.21	269.05 	Total	264.00	308.34	572.34  (c):	Investment by the Government in the handloom sector is through funding to the eligible handloom agencies/weavers in the form of grants-in-aid for implementation of various handloom schemes (Central Sector Schemes) for development & promotion of the sector and welfare of handloom weavers across the country, including the States of Andhra Pradesh & Tamil Nadu.  Details of funds released by the Ministry of Textiles through the Office of the Development Commissioner for Handlooms in the last two years are indicated in answer to part (a) & (b) above. 	Employment generation in the sector is through facilitation under various Government Schemes like Hathkargha Samvardhan Sahayata (HSS), a component of National Handloom Development Programme (NHDP), where weavers are provided looms & accessories and MUDRA loans at concessional rate, a component of NHDP. Also, Handloom workers are provided training for              up-gradation of their skills. During the last six years and the current year (2014-15 to 2020-21 as on   31-01-2021), 56,614 handloom workers have been provided training to upgrade their skill, 52,621 beneficiaries have been provided Looms/Accessories under Hathkargha Samvardhan Sahayata Scheme (HSS) and 2,63,565 number of loans have been sanctioned to handloom weavers under the Weavers MUDRA Scheme. ***
