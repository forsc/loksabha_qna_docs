ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL)(a) Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) has provided the eGramSwaraj (eGS) (https://egramswaraj.gov.in) – a user-friendly web-based portal, which aims to bring in better transparency in the decentralized planning, progress reporting, financial management, work-based accounting and details of assets created. The Panchayats upload the Gram Panchayat Development Plans through the planning module of eGS.So far, 2.54 Lakh GPDPs have been uploaded on eGS for the year 2021-22.  Further, 2,32,190 Panchayats have onboarded e-Gram SWARAJ - PFMS Interface; 1,99,235 Panchayats have done online payments worth a cumulative of more than Rs. 70,000 crores (includes all the onboarded schemes) through e-Gram SWARAJ- PFMS Interface.Further, for ensuring timely audit of Panchayat accounts i.e. receipts and expenditures of Gram Panchayats, MoPR has rolled out an online application – AuditOnline (https://auditonline.gov.in).  This application not only facilitates auditing of Panchayat accounts but also provides for maintaining of audit records. This application streamlines the process for audit inquiries, draft local audit reports, draft audit-paras etc. and thus ensures proper maintenance of accounts by Panchayats to improve transparency and accountability. So far, for audit period 2020-21, 1.65 lakh audit plans have been created and 75,044 audit reports have been generated.(b) and (c) Panchayats have a significant role to play in the effective and efficient implementation of flagship schemes/ programmes on subjects of national importance for transformation of rural India. Gram Panchayats have been mandated for the preparation of Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) for economic development and social justice. The GPDP planning process has to be comprehensive and based on participation which involves full convergence with schemes of all related Central Ministries/Line Departments related to 29 subjects listed in the Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution.To enable the Gram Panchayats for preparation of the GPDP in an evidence based and structured manner, each year People’s Plan Campaign rolled out as Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas from 2nd October to 31st December. During this period structured Gram Sabhas held for preparing GPDP for the next financial year on the basis of evidence based assessment of sectoral gaps as ascertained through Mission Antyodaya survey.As on date, 2,54,070 Gram Panchayat Development Plans for FY 2021-22 have been prepared.***
