                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)  to (c) The Government has notified Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016 for environmentally sound management of plastic waste and to prevent plastic pollution in the country. The generators of waste under the Rules have been mandated to take steps to minimize generation of plastic waste, not to litter plastic waste, ensure segregated storage of waste at source and handover the segregated waste to the local bodies or agencies authorized by them or registered waste pickers or registered recyclers. For proper regulation and sound recycling of plastic, provisions have been made for registration of all plastic recyclers with respective State/UT Pollution Control Boards/Committees.Every Urban Local body has been made responsible for setting up of infrastructure for collection, segregation and processing, including recycling and disposal of plastic waste. The local bodies have also been mandated to create awareness among all stakeholders about their respective responsibilities. For effective implementation of plastic waste management rules, a three pronged strategy has been adopted that include behavioral change, strengthening of institutional system for collection, segregation and recycling of plastic waste and engagement with producer, importer and brand owners through Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR).Further, Hon’ble Prime Minister has announced India’s pledge to phase out Single-use plastic by 2022.India was one the first large country to take up such initiative to combat plastic pollution. As a part of behavioural change, on the call of Hon’ble Prime Minister, a three-phase campaign “Swachhta Hi Sewa” was launched from 11th September 2019, which ended on Diwali i.e. 27th October, 2019.Under ‘Swachhta hi Seva’, common public of the country came together in masses on 2nd October, 2019 and collected Single Use Plastic from the houses, streets etc and the Urban Local Bodies, Gram Panchayats etcmade arrangements for deposit this plastic at a designated location. The start-ups, technical bodies and corporates came forward with their plans to recycle the collected plastic waste. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is implementing Environment Education, Awareness and Training scheme. Under the National Green Corps (NGC) programme of the Ministry, about one lakh schools have been identified as Eco-clubs, wherein, nearly thirty lakh students are actively participating in various environment protection and conservation activities including plastic waste management.The Ministry launched the Green Good Deed (GGDs) movement which is social movement with the aim of bringing about mass environmental awareness in the society at all levels. Further, advisories/instructions were also issued to Chief Electoral Officers in the State during General Election 2019 regarding phase out of Single Use Plastic. Instructions were also issued to Ministries, Departments, Offices under the jurisdiction of the Governments, Regional Offices, Schools, Corporates, Major PSUs, Institutions in 2018 & 2019 to prohibit SUP products including water bottles, take away coffee cups, lunch wrapped in disposable plastic packaging, plastic bags, disposable food containers, plates and containers made of polystyrene foam, plastic straws etc. from their offices. For spreading awareness among the coastal cities and towns, beach cleaning drive was initiated to clean 50 beaches from 11th Nov to 17th Nov, 2019.For strengthening of institutional system, the Ministry had issued “Standard Guidelines for Single-Use Plastic” on 21st January 2019 to all States/UTs and Ministries. The Standard guidelines entailed waste management system improvements, legal options for States/UTs to prohibit SUP items through regulatory measures, eco-friendly alternatives, social awareness and public education. The guidelines also included measures to be taken by government offices. The Ministry has notified Solid Waste Management (SWM) Rules 2016, which inter alia, prescribe door to door collection and segregation of waste at source all ULBs. The rules emphasise to set up Material Recovery Facilities (MRF) by local bodies for sorting of recyclable dry waste including plastic waste. It is estimated that 95% of the wards are covered under door-to-door collection of waste and approximately 72 % of the wards are practicing source segregation.The Rules mandates the Producers, Importers and Brand Owners for collection of used multi-layered plastic sachet or pouches or packaging, who introduces such products in the market. The Rules prescribe them to establish a system for collecting back the plastic waste generated due to their products.Ministry has conducted several meetings with thestakeholders for implementation of the provisions of EPR. Further, stakeholder consultation workshops were also conducted by the Ministry in Bangalore, Ranchi and Chandigarh. ********
