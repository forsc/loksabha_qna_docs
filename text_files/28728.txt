ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (e):	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.LS.US.Q.NO. *24 FOR 30.11.2021STATEMENT REFERRED IN REPLY TO THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *24 DATED 30TH NOVEMBER, 2021(a) to (c): The primary responsibility for disaster management rests with the State Governments.  The State Governments provide financial relief to the affected people in the wake of notified disasters, from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) already placed at their disposal.  However, in the event of disaster of a severe nature, additional financial assistance is extended from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) as per the laid down procedure, which includes an assessment based on the visit of an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT).  The release of funds from SDRF/NDRF and expenditure therefrom are governed by the ‘Guidelines on constitution and administration of SDRF/ NDRF’ and items and norms issued by Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), from time to time. The funds in SDRF are contributed by the Central Government and State Governments in the ratio of 75:25 for general category states and 90:10 for North-Eastern and Himalayan States to undertake the relief measures in the wake of natural disasters.  The Central Government releases its share of SDRF to State Governments in two installments (1st in June and 2nd in December) as per the established procedure.  The responsibility for distribution of relief, to the affected people at the local level, is of the State Government concerned. 	-3/…-3-LS.US.Q.NO. *24 FOR 30.11.2021The 15th Finance Commission (FC) had adopted a new methodology for state-wise allocations of funds, which replaces the expenditure driven methodology. The new methodology is a combination of capacity (as reflected through expenditure), risk exposure (area and population) and hazard and vulnerably (risk index).  In a major departure from the earlier Finance Commissions, the 15th FC had recommended two funds with the nomenclature of State Disaster Risk Management Fund (SDRMF) and National Disaster Risk Management Fund (NDRMF).  SDRMF will consist of two components viz. SDRF and State Disaster Mitigation Fund (SDMF) with the allocation in the proportion of 80% and 20% respectively.  Similarly, NDRMF will also have two components namely NDRF and NDMF with allocation in the same proportion.  The Commission had also recommended that, within the SDRF/NDRF allocations of 80%, there would be three sub-allocations namely, Response and Relief (40%), Recovery and Reconstruction (30%) and Preparedness and Capacity Building (10%).  As such, SDRMF and NDRMF will cover the entire cycle of disaster management – prevention, preparedness, response, mitigation, recovery and reconstruction. (d) & (e): In view of the exigencies, the Central Government can release its share of SDRF, in advance.  During the current financial year i.e. 2021-22, the Central Government has released both the installments of its share of SDRF, amounting to Rs. 17,747.20 crore, in advance, to all States in order to facilitate them to provide assistance to disaster affected people.  Further, in the aftermath of a calamity,  having   severe   impact   and  when  funds   available  with   the  State-4/…-4-LS.US.Q.NO. *24 FOR 30.11.2021Government are not found sufficient; the Central Government provides funds from NDRF, in advance, without waiting for the assessment of IMCT, so as to enable the State to provide immediate relief assistance to the affected people at the local level.  During the current year 2021-22, in the aftermath of cyclones ‘Tauktae’ and ‘Yaas’, funds had been released in advance by the Central Government from NDRF as under:Sl.No.	Name of State	Amount (Rs. in crore)1.
