ANSWER




(a) and (b) Ujjawala scheme is implemented by Ministry of Women and Child Development for combating trafficking, with five specific components- Prevention, Rescue, Rehabilitation, Re-Integration and Repatriation (cross-border) of victims of trafficking. The Scheme has been conceived primarily for the purpose of preventing trafficking on the one hand and rescue and rehabilitation of victims on the other. The scheme provides for rehabilitation of victims by providing food, shelter, counselling, medical care, legal aid and vocational training as well as their reintegration into society. The Ujjawala Scheme, revised with effect from 01.04.2016, has benefitted thousands of trafficked women in different State/UTs. At present, there are 107 Ujjawala Homes with 1838 beneficiaries. The scheme has faced challenges of lack of provision for management and administrative cost, group health insurance and shortage of psychological and legal counsellors which have been taken care of under the new Mission Shakti launched by the Ministry. (c) The details of funds allocated/released and utilized along with the number of beneficiaries under the scheme during each of the three years and the current year in the State of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu is at Annexure-I. (d) Ujjawala Scheme is a demand driven scheme. The proposal under different components of the scheme are received by the State/UT Governments which are examined by the Project Sanctioning Committee at the State/UT level. The recommended projects are sent to the Central Government for consideration and approval as per the scheme guidelines. The funding pattern for the release of funds is shared between the Central Government, States and implementing agencies in ratio 60:30:10, except North Eastern and Himalayan States where the applicable sharing ratio is 80:10:10 respectively and in case of UT administrations the sharing ratio is 90:10 between the Central Govt and implementing agency. (e) and (f) The scheme has been successful in preventing trafficking of thousands of women through social mobilization, involvement of local communities, awareness generation programmes and other measures. Under the new Mission Shakti, it is envisaged to revise the Scheme guidelines to make them more useful for the beneficiaries and spread awareness about these homes through the National Hub for Empowerment of Women. *****Annexure-IAnnexure referred to in reply of part (c) of Lok Sabha Un-starred Question No. 5060 for 01.04.2022 regarding Ujjawala Scheme.
