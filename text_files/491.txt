Thus, the category of ‘other’ would not only include ‘transgender’ but also any person who desires to record sex under the category of ‘other’. It is also possible that some transgender would have returned themselves either male or female depending upon their choice. The population of ‘other’ as per Census 2011 is 4,87,803. The state-wise population of ‘other’ including in Rajasthan as per Census 2011 is placed at Annexure-I.(b) to (d): The details of funds allocated during the last three years is as under:Year	B.E.
