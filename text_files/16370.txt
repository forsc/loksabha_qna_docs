                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR & EMPLOYMENT (SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a)	 (i)As  per  the  results  of  Periodic  Labour  Force  Survey  (PLFS)  conducted  during  2017-18 and  2018-19  by  National  Statistical  Office  (NSO),  Ministry  of  Statistics  and Programme  Implementation  ,  the  estimated  Worker  Population  Ratio(WPR)   on usual status (principal status + subsidiary status) basis for the persons of age 15 years and above to the extent available is given below:Worker Population Ratio (in %)Year & Survey	All – India2018-19(PLFS)	47.3%2017-18 (PLFS)	46.8%(ii) The annual GDP Growth Rate during the three  years at constant (2011-12) prices, is given below:Year	GDP Growth Rate (in %)2019-20	4.22018-19 	6.12017-18	7.0(b) to (d) :  The Government of India has made efforts for evolving a National  Employment  Policy.  The  proposed  policy  inter-alia  purports  to  address macroeconomic  policy  issues,  sectoral  policy  issues,  Labour  policy,  micro  and small enterprises’ issues, skill development issues, issues relating to women and vulnerable  workers  and  incorporate  suggestions  for  improving  employment opportunities.  Consultations  have  been  held  with  various  stakeholders  like Ministries,  State  Governments,  Trade  Unions,  Industry  Associations  etc.  for inputs to the Policy.However, the global spread of the corona virus (COVID-19) followed by lockdowns has affected global economies including India. The outbreak of Novel Corona virus (COVID-19), first in China and now having being spread in most of the countries of the world,  has emerged as a key risk to human health as well as global growth outlook through numerous channels like trade, production and supply chain disruptions; decline in demand; lower tourism and business travel  and productivity losses. Unforeseen problems of a large number of migrant workers, gig workers and loss of jobs have also been observed in India during this period.  Such unprecedented times compel for overall relook into the paper on national employment policy and its alignment with the recent unforeseen developments and different sectoral policies.(e) Central Government has announced an economic package of Rupees 20 lac crores and Hon’ble Prime Minister of India has advocated for a Atamnirbhar Bharat.  A Working  Group of Ministers(GoM) under the chairmanship of Shri Thaawar Chand Gehlot, Hon’ble Minister of Social Justice & Empowerment has been formed to work upon the modalities for skill development and enhancing employment generation in the context new economic situation faced by the country  due to Covid-19 crisis.  	******
