ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b) The interim report of ‘The Economics of Ecosystem and Biodiversity’that was released in 2008 pertains to the global ‘The Economics of Ecosystem and Biodiversity’ (TEEB) initiative that was released during the ninth meeting Conference of Parties of Convention on Biological Diversity in 2008 at Bonn. The said report was the outcome based on the decision of the meeting of G8+5 environment ministers held in Potsdam, Germany in 2007. The study drew on expertise from around the world to evaluate the costs of biodiversity loss and associated decline in ecosystem services, and compared these with the costs of effective conservation and sustainable use. The details of interim report ‘The Economics of Ecosystem and Biodiversity’ that was released in 2008 is available at http://www.teebweb.org/media/2008/05/TEEB-Interim-Report_English.pdf.Subsequently the global TEEB initiative has released a series of report for specific stakeholders that could be accessed on http://www.teebweb.org/. Subsequently, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change initiated a Technical Cooperation project, namely, “Incentives for Sustainable Management of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services”, also known as TEEB India Initiative (TII)  2011-2017.Fourteen  studies  were completed under TII in the areas of forests, wetlands and coastal and marine ecosystems.These  studies  in  forests  deal with issues such as hidden ecosystem services of forests, conflicts between humans and wildlife, and the  economic  consequences  of  species  decline.  In  wetlands,  the  studies  draw  lessons  on  water  resources  management,  community  stewardship  and  equity,  and  the   economics   of   hydrological   regime   changes. In coastal and marine ecosystems, the  studies  explored  the  opportunities  and  economic  efficiency  of  interventions  such as  eco-labelling, seasonal  fishing  bans, mangrove  regeneration,  and  the  challenge  of bycatch in marine fisheries.(c) and (d)	Based on the dynamics of the environment sector and globaland domestic regulatory and jurisprudence issues, the policies made by the Government for theenvironment sector are judiciously formulated, periodically reviewed, suitably revised and updated, from time to time following a process of wide consultations with all the stakeholders including NGOs and take into accountthe global best practices.***
