ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PETROLEUM& NATURAL GAS(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (c): As per Production Sharing Contract (PSC) of the block RJ-ON-90/1, operated by Cairn India Limited, delivery point is the outlet flange of delivery facility which in this case is Barmer, Rajasthan. The crude produced from the block is being processed at Mangla Processing Terminal (MPT) in Barmer. However, PSC also provides that different delivery points may be established for sales to Government and other sales with approval of Government of India. In order to facilitate crude evacuation from the block, as there were no refining facilities in the state of Rajasthan, and after considering various options, Government approved laying of heated pipeline from Barmer to Salaya in Gujarat. Further, in 2009, Government had agreed to shift delivery point from Salaya to Bhogat terminal at Gujarat coast due to ecological consideration and non-feasibility of delivery point at Salaya to facilitate the crude evacuation from Bhogat and set up additional delivery points at Radhanpur, Viramgram in Gujarat. In the absence of refining facilities being available in Rajasthan, the Government agreed to the delivery point outside the state.****************
