                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH ANDFAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (c): The National Medical Commission (NMC) has informed that they have released draft Regulations on Compulsory Rotating Internship for inviting public comments. These draft Regulations have a provision of one week internship in electives exclusive for Indian Systems of Medicine. This part is not mandatory, but elective. The students may choose any elective, provided the discipline is available in the same college / Institution where Internship is being done (Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy, Sowa Rigpa). The rationale behind including this elective is to providing exposure of Ayush disciplines to MBBS students. 	The Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) has informed that as per the Indian Medicine Central Council (Minimum Standards of Education in Indian Medicine), Amendment Regulation, 2016, one-year internship programme for BAMS students is divided into clinical training of six months in the Ayush hospital attached to the college and six months in Primary Health Centre or Community Health Centre or Rural Hospital or District Hospital or Civil Hospital or any Government Hospital of modern medicine. It also provides that where there is no provision or permission of the State Government for allowing the graduate of Ayush in the hospital or dispensary of Modern Medicine, the one-year Internship shall be completed in the hospital of AYUSH college.
