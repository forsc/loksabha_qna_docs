ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d) 	Yes, Sir the scheme of Dual System of Training has had a significant impact on the skilling ecosystem after it was recently revamped. Since the launch of revised guidelines of DST Scheme, by Directorate General of Training (DGT), Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE); there has been a huge jump from the earlier 136 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in the last three years, to now 748 MoUs signed with the organizations in the last six months. The revised scheme guidelines are effective from 2019 session, & applicable to all affiliated Government and Private Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) implementing Craftsman Training Scheme in the country. National Skill Training Institutes (NSTI) under DGT, MSDE, are also eligible to implement DST under Craftsman Training Scheme (CTS).The scheme was introduced in 2016 with the objective of enabling industries and establishments to partner with the Government and Private ITIs for conducting training programmes towards fulfilling skilled manpower requirements. The DST combines theoretical training from ITIs and practical training from Industry Partners thereby strengthening industry linkages and providing hand-on experience to students on industries latest technologies and techniques. The revised DST Scheme meets the industry’s skilled workforce requirements with greater adaptability towards industry expectations and wider coverage of Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs). After the successful completion of training, trainees are awarded National Trade Certificate (NTC) that gives them an edge with regard to employability.The significant changes in the now introduced revamped DST scheme, include:•	Both Govt & Private ITI Principals are empowered to sign MoUs with industry without interference of DGT or States. •	The eligibility criteria for industry participation has been eased for both engineering trades and non-engineering trade,•	 The minimum turnover requirement of industry has been brought down. •	The duration of the practical training of the course has also been made flexible and adaptive to the industry schedule. •	All the 138 courses under Craftsman Training Scheme have been brought under the ambit of DST, as against only 17 courses earlier. The details of the scheme and courses offered is available at link https://dgt.gov.in/Dual_SystemThe consolidate details of MoU signed is placed in Annexure I.
