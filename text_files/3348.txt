                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE  MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                   (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) to (c):	Government of India through the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has launched Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) {PMAY(U)} Mission on June 25, 2015 to provide all weather pucca houses to all eligible urban households including slum dwellers by 2022. “In-situ” Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) component under PMAY(U) Mission mandates to use land as a resource for providing houses to slum dwellers. This approach aims to leverage the locked po¬tential of land under slums to provide houses to the eligible slum dwellers by bringing them into the formal urban settlement. The MoHUA releases funds to States/UTs on the basis of their project proposals received under PMAY(U) Mission. Scheme-wise and State/UT-wise details are at Annexure. (d) & (e): The suggestions/proposals from various States/UTs in this regard have already been considered by the MoHUA and based on the suggestions/proposals of States/UTs, one component namely ISSR has already been incorporated under PMAY(U) Mission. Pursuant to the issuance of PMAY(U) Mission guidelines, the MoHUA has written to all State Governments and Central Government land owning Ministries/Departments to explore the possibilities of rehabilitation of slums on their land and seek Central Assistance from the MoHUA under PMAY(U) Mission. (f): No, Sir.(g): Does not arise.                      *****
