ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFAIRS(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	As the main strategy of the Aspirational Districts Programme is based on convergence of existing schemes which have their own funding arrangement, infusion of additional fund, or any fund known as the Development Grant Fund, is not envisaged under the programme. In order to foster a competitive spirit, and for addressing the critical gaps, additional allocation on the basis of performance is envisaged This is given in the form of a performance grant and it is seen as an incentive to the district concerned with a view to instil a sense of competition among them to perform better. Every month, districts are assessed on the basis of monthly progress and the best performing Districts in overall terms and in each of the five sectors are identified. The first and second rankers in overall terms are awarded ?10 crores and ?5 crores respectively. The first ranker from each of the five sectors is awarded ?3 crores each. Based on the performance grant as mentioned above, districts undertake specific projects to address critical need felt by them. Under this arrangement, District Chitrakoot has received about ?5.99 crore and District Fatehpur has received about ?11.15 crore. As regards Sonbhadra District, while it has performed well on different occasions, no additional fund has been allotted to it as the project guidelines stipulate that districts having District Mineral Funds (DMF) in excess of ?30 crore a year are not eligible for receiving the abovementioned additional grant.(b)	&(c):As per the project guidelines, once the districts concerned become eligible for the additional allocation on basis of performance, they are to formulate a plan of action by listing projects to be funded by such grant. These plans of actions are approved by an Empowered Committee which meets frequently. As of now, all plans of action finalised by the districts have been sanctioned and there is no pendency. *****
