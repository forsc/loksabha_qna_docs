(b)	On 17 Oct 2019, Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) intercepted one Indian boat with three (03) Indian fishermen. After the scheduled Flag Meeting between the border guarding forces, when Indian party was returning, one BSF Head Constable was killed allegedly through firing from a BGB personnel. An enquiry has been constituted by each side separately to look into the circumstances of this incident.	(c)	Government has notified fishermen and the boat owning companies not to venture toward Bangladesh’s waters, especially during months when Bangladesh has a strict ban in force on fishing for high-value “Hilsa” fish, as this ban is enforced strictly within the territory of Bangladesh.	***
