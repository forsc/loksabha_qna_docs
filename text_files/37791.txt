ANSWER




(a) The status of malnutrition (stunting, wasting, and underweight) in the country amongst children under 5 years and women (15-49 years) is provided by the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted periodically by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoH&FW). As per the report of NFHS-5 (2019-21), the nutrition indicators for children under 5 years have improved as compared with NFHS-4 (2015-16). Stunting, Wasting and Underweight has reduced from 38.4% to 35.5%, 21.0% to 19.3% and 35.8% to 32.1% respectively. Further the prevalence of malnutrition among women aged 15-49 years has decreased from 22.9 (NFHS 4) to 18.7 (NFHS 5). (b) As per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS 5), 19.3% children under 5 years are malnourished, whereas, about 7.7% children fall in severely malnourished category. (c) The State/UT wise prevalence of Stunting, Wasting and Underweight among children under 5 years as per NFHS 5 survey is at Annexure I. (d) The State/UT having the highest and lowest prevalence of Stunting, Wasting and Underweight among children under 5 years of age is at Annexure II. (e) The Government has accorded high priority to the issue of malnutrition and is implementing several schemes like Anganwadi Services, Scheme for Adolescent Girls and Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) under the Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Scheme as direct targeted interventions to address the problem of malnutrition in the country. Children with Severe Acute Malnutrition are treated at the Nutrition Rehabilitation Centers established by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. POSHAN Abhiyaan launched on 8th March 2018, aims to reduce malnutrition in the country in a phased manner, through a lifecycle approach, by adopting a synergised and result oriented approach. Mission Poshan 2.0, an integrated nutrition support programme has been announced in budget 2021-2022 for all States/UTs. It seeks to strengthen nutritional content, delivery, outreach and outcomes with focus on developing practices that nurture health, wellness and immunity to disease and malnutrition. Further, Guidelines were issued for transparency and accountability in delivery of supplementary nutrition and to track nutritional outcomes on 13.01.2021. ***** Annexure IState/UT wise prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight among children under five years of age as per National Family Health Survey (NFHS 5)S.
