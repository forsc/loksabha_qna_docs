The recently released report of NFHS-5 is available only for 22 States/UTs which does not cover the State of Punjab.(b)        The data on nutritional indicators is captured under the National Family Health Surveys conducted periodically by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, with International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) being the nodal agency for conducting the surveys using a standardized methodology. To ensure consistent and accurate recording and reporting of the critical programme data, the Ministry has initiated efforts towards quality data collection, analysis for differential planning and supervision for improved action at community level as part of strengthening and systems quality improvement via ICT based application, Poshan Tracker. The Poshan Tracker is built on latest technology for ensuring real-time monitoring and providing real-time information relating to various parameters of service delivery and malnutrition under Mission Poshan 2.0. (c)       Government implements Anganwadi Services Scheme, POSHAN Abhiyaan, Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana and Scheme for Adolescent Girls under the Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services Scheme (ICDS) as targeted interventions for children upto the age of 6 years, Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers and Adolescent Girls, throughout the country. POSHAN Abhiyaan aims to reduce malnutrition in a phased manner, through a life cycle approach, by adopting a synergised and result oriented approach.**** Annexure I Statement referred to in reply to Part (a) of Lok Sabha Un-Starred Question No.3032 for 06.08.2021 by SHRI BHAGWANT MANN regarding Malnurished Women and Children.
