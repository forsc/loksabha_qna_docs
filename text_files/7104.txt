AAI has undertaken the modernisation/upgradation of its airports at Patna, Darbhanga (Civil Enclave), Raxaul and Gaya in Bihar and  Bagdogra (Civil Enclave) and Cooch Behar in West Bengal. Further, State Government of Bihar has also handed over 108 acre of land to AAI for construction of new Civil Enclave (C.E.) at Air Force Station Bihta and AAI has appointed Project Management Consultant (PMC) for terminal building design and city side development.; ; (b) to (d):  Government of India, Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik) in October, 2016 with the objective to facilitate / stimulate regional air connectivity to  underserved and unserved airports. The revival of airstrips/airports is ''''demand driven'''', depending upon firm commitment from airline operators as well as from the State Government for providing various concessions. Sabeya (Hathwa) Airstrip in Gopalganj District of Bihar and Malda airport in West Bengal are available in the list of unserved airports in RCS document. However, no airline has submitted the proposal to operate RCS flight from Sabeya (Hathwa) as well as Malda airstrips under RCS-UDAN so far. As such, no proposal to revive Sabeya and Malda airstrips is under consideration.
