With a borderless cyberspace coupled with the possibility of instant communication and anonymity, the potential for misuse of cyberspace and social media platforms for criminal activities is a global issue. There were media reports about social media platforms being misused to spread various cases of fake news and objectionable videos posted on print, electronic media, social media and video sharing sites.''Police'' and ''Public Order'' are State subjects as per the Constitution of India and States are primarily responsible for prevention, detection and investigation through their law enforcement machinery.
