ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Citizen Engagement was one of the key features for the preparation of Smart City Plans (SCP) where cities were encouraged to decide their aspirations and execute them with support from Central and State Government. During preparation of SCPs extensive citizen engagement was conducted including meetings and discussions in various forums, suggestions and opinions through My-Gov and other social media. More than 15 million people were reached out during the preparation of SCPs by various cities and more than 2.4 million responses were received on MyGov.in, the Indian government’s online citizen engagement portal.(b)	& (c) The objective of Smart Cities Mission is to promote cities that provide core infrastructure and give a decent quality of life to its citizens, a clean and sustainable environment and application of ‘Smart’ Solutions. Smart Cities will have smart components like e-governance, waste management, water management, energy management, urban mobility, tele-medicine, education, incubation/ facilitation cells, skill development centres, climate solutions, etc. As stated in the Smart Cities Mission Guidelines (Section 15.5), “the Smart Cities Mission requires smart people who actively participate in governance and reforms. Citizen involvement is much more than a ceremonial participation in governance. Smart people involve themselves in the definition of the Smart City, decisions on deploying Smart Solutions, implementing reforms, doing more with less and oversight during implementing and designing post-project structures in order to make the Smart City developments sustainable. The participation of smart people will be enabled by the SPV through increasing use of ICT, especially mobile-based tools.”Smart cities use a combination of in-person, media-related and online engagement methods to generate awareness, receive feedback from citizens, and co-create solutions. Citizens were also engaged through focused group discussion, ward-level meetings, on-line engagement, polling and public events. Citizen engagement has been further enhanced by recent improvements in technology which enable cities to use social media and online platforms for engagement.(d) Smart Cities Mission Guidelines have proposed a two pronged strategy for mission implementation i.e. Area Based Development and Pan City Development. The strategic components of Area Based Development are city improvement (retrofitting), city renewal (redevelopment) and city extension (greenfield development). Pan city development envisages application of selected smart solutions to the existing city-wide infrastructure. The three models of Area-based Smart City Development are given below: •	Retrofitting: will introduce planning in an existing built-up area of more than 500 acres to         achieve Smart City objectives, along with other objectives, to make the existing area more         efficient and liveable.•	Redevelopment: will effect a replacement of the existing built-up environment and enable co-        creation of a new layout with enhanced infrastructure using mixed land use and increased         density in an area of more than 50 acres•	Greenfield development: will introduce most of the Smart Solutions in a previously vacant         area (more than 250 acres) using innovative planning, plan financing and plan implementation         tools (e.g. land pooling/ land reconstitution) with provision for affordable housing,         especially for the poor. Smart City Proposals were expected to encapsulate either of the three models of Area-based smart city development and a Pan-city feature with smart solutions.                                *****
