ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI) (a) State/UT-wise number of persons who have been offered employment under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) during the last five financial years 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 is given at Annexure-I. (b)  Details of State/UT-wise and National level average days of employment provided per households under the Mahatma Gandhi NREGS  in the months of April, May, June, July and August in the financial year 2021-22 is given at Annexure-II. (c)   State/UT-wise details of average wage rate per day per person under the Mahatma Gandhi NREGS during the last five financial years 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 is given at Annexure-III. It may be mentioned that payment of wage is linked to the accomplishment of tasks as per SOR. (d)   No, Sir. As per Section 6 (1) of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA), 2005, the Central Government may by notification specify the wage rate for unskilled work for its beneficiaries. Accordingly, the Ministry of Rural Development notifies Mahatma Gandhi NREGA wage rate for every financial year for States/UTs. To compensate the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA workers against inflation, the Ministry of Rural Development revises the wage rate every financial year based on change in Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labour (CPI-AL).  If the calculated wage rate of any State/UT is coming lower than the wage rate of previous financial year, it is being protected by maintaining the previous financial year wage rate. The wage rate is made applicable from 1st April of each financial year. However, State Governments can provide wage over and above the wage rate notified by the Central Government under the Mahatma Gandhi NREGS. (e)&(f)  State/UT-wise number of households, who have been paid  Unemployment Allowance under the Mahatma Gandhi NREGS during the last five financial years 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 is given at Annexure-IV. (g)    State/UT-wise number of new job cards issued under the Mahatma Gandhi NREGS during the last five financial years 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 is given at Annexure-V. State/UT-wise number of job cards deleted under the Mahatma Gandhi NREGS during the last five financial years 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 is given at Annexure-VI. (h)    Mahatma Gandhi NREG Act is to provide at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to each household in rural areas of the country whose adult members volunteers to do unskilled manual work. In addition to this, there is a provision for up to additional 50 days of unskilled wage employment in a financial year in drought/natural calamity notified rural areas. As per Section 3 (4) of the Mahatma Gandhi NREG Act, 2005, the State Governments may make provision for providing additional days beyond the period guaranteed under the Act from their own funds.  *****
