ANSWER




MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE  ???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????             (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a to c):    The Commercial cultivation of fox nut (Makhana) is mainly confined to Bihar with production of 56194.59 MT during the year 2020-21. However, State-wise data for production is not available. The use of fox nut is also increasing in the various food components during the last few years. (d):  The Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) has developed technology for cultivation of Makhana in cropping system mode. A fox nut based integrated farming system has been developed for water surplus ecologies so as to improve the system productivity.          State Government of Bihar has also formulated State sponsored scheme i.e. Makhana Vikas Scheme which is exclusively implemented for holistic development of Makhana in Bihar with special emphasis on increasing production. In addition to this, Makhana growers are supported in Bihar State Horticulture Produce Development Scheme. The productivity has increased from 16MT/ha to 28MT/ha due to high yielding varieties i.e. Swarn Vaidehi and Sabour Makhana-1. *****
