                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)	The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has launched the Anemia Mukt Bharat strategy for prevention and treatment of Anaemia in Pre-School Children (6-59 months), Children (5-9 years), Adolescent Girls and Boys (10-19 years), Pregnant and Lactating Women and Women of Reproductive Age group (15-49 years) in programme mode through life cycle approach.

Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Days (VHSNDs) and Mother and Child Protection Card are the joint initiatives of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and the Ministry of Women and Child Development for addressing the nutrition concerns in Children, Pregnant women and Lactating mothers. Nutrition education during VHSNDs helps to increase awareness on healthy and nutritious dietary practices (including iron rich food) and promotion of breastfeeding.iv.	Mandatory promotion of intake of Double Fortified Salt (DFS) in ICDS, Mid-day meal and Public Distribution System (PDS).v.	 Janani Surksha Yojana (JSY), a national conditional cash transfer scheme incentivises women of low socio economic status for institutional delivery at public health facilities and assists her in fulfilling nutritional needs during pregnancy. Similarly, under Jananai Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK), all pregnant and lactating mothers and infants seeking treatment in public health facilities are provided food, drugs and transport, free of cost as an entitlement.vi.	Under the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK) systematic efforts are undertaken to detect nutrition deficiency including Anemia among children. Similarly, the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) has launched several schemes to tackle malnutrition in the country including Anganwadi Services, Scheme for Adolescent Girls (SAG) and Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojna (PMMVY) to improve the nutritional and health status of Children, Adolescent Girls, Pregnant and Lactating Women. The Anganwadi Services scheme provides supplementary nutrition for children 6 months to 3 years of age, pregnant and lactating mothers.

During the consultation held with States/UTs in the month of July 2020, most of the States had also expressed their inability to open Anganwadi Centres in the light of increasing incidents of COVID-19. However, to ensure continuous nutritional support to Anganwadi beneficiaries, Anganwadi Workers and Helpers have been distributing supplementary Nutrition at the doorsteps of the beneficiaries. Further, Ministry of Women Child Development has issued necessary directions to the States/UTs to ensure distribution of food items and nutrition support by Anganwadi workers, once in 15 days, at the doorstep of beneficiaries. In addition, Anganwadi Workers and Anganwadi Helpers have been assisting the local administration in community surveillance, creating awareness or other works assigned to them from time to time.

Similarly, service delivery in campaign approach for different activities such as National Deworming Day (NDD), Intensified Diarrhoea Control Fortnight (IDCF) and Vitamin A Supplementation programmes were also got affected. In order to address these challenges, the MoHFW  has issued guidance notes to all the States and UTs regarding “Enabling Delivery of Essential Health Services during the COVID 19 Outbreak” on 14th April, 2020 and “Provision of Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, Adolescent Health plus Nutrition services during and post COVID-19 pandemic” on 24th May, 2020 for continuation of service delivery amid COVID-19 pandemic.As per these guidance notes, the States and UTs have been advised to ensure home distribution of Iron Folic Acid supplementation to the target age groups i.e. Pre-school Children 6-59 months, Children 5-9 years, adolescents 10-19 years, Pregnant and lactating Women in the containment zones. In non-containment zones, it has been advised to undertake distribution of IFA supplements through the VHSNDs to be held in the staggered manner while ensuring all the personal protective measures and physical distancing norms by the frontline workers i.e. ASHAs/ANMs/AWWs.
