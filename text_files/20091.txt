ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a)	During the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for marine products in the global market including by the  U.S., China, Japan, EU, etc., has been adversely affected, due to the frequent lock-downs effected in major markets and closure of restaurants, supermarkets, institutional catering, etc. The domestic production and export were also affected due to loss of fishing days, skipping of crops by aqua-farmers and logistics issues including shortage of reefer containers, diminished air-cargo connectivity, non-availability of courier service and delay in documentation and clearance in importing countries. The Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA) has taken a series of steps like digitization of export certificates, release of a COVID-19 protocol booklet and a video to sensitize the marine industry, holding online buyer-seller meets, bilateral engagements in major markets like U.S., EU, China, etc., for increasing marine exports from the country. The Dept.  of Fisheries have also rolled out the flagship programme of Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), targeting creation of critical infrastructure for fishery production with focus on export-oriented species.       b) Month-wise exports of marine products from January 2020 to January 2021 are given below:Month-wise exports of marine products Jan 2020 to Jan 2021(Value in USD Million)Month	2019-20	2020-21	Growth %January 	429.75	427.41	-0.54February	421.78	441.52	4.68March	507.25	368.27	-27.40April	490.14	296.85	-39.44May	525.54	430.12	-18.16June	521.74	497.05	-4.73July	605.33	504.90	-16.59August	609.93	470.11	-22.92September	644.86	675.14	4.70October	729.42	666.17	-8.67November	689.65	496.94	-27.94December	624.88	525.93	-15.83January (provisional)	427.41	406.97	-4.78 (Source: MPEDA)******
