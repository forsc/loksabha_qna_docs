ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) to (e) :    There is no discrepancy in production, transmission and distribution of power in the country.  The installed generation capacity is around 395.6 GW which is adequate to produce electricity to meet the demand of electricity.  The maximum demand during the current year was around 203 GW.  The transmission system is also robust and capable of transmitting the power from generating station to the States / Discoms who in turn through distribution system are able to distribute electricity to the consumers.The robust national grid is facilitating transfer of power from surplus regions to deficit regions without any transmission constraints. The inter-regional transmission capacity has been increased from 35,950 MW as on 31.03.2014 to 1,12,250 MW as on 28th February, 2022. The capacity of the electricity Grid is being expanded on a continuous basis matching with the growth in electricity generation and electricity demand. The transmission systems are mostly built through tariff based competitive bidding route.  However, the Central Government is also funding same Transmission schemes worth around Rs.16,000/- crore in UT of J&K, UT of Ladakh and North Eastern States. The intra-State transmission lines are built by the State transmission companies.In order to meet the growing demand of the electricity consumers, the distribution network also requires upgradation and augmentation on continuous basis, which are undertaken by the distribution companies under the oversight of State Commissions. The Central Government is also assisting the States for creation/augmentation of distribution infrastructure through its various schemes including Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), and Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) to enable them to achieve the objective of providing uninterrupted power supply to all consumers.  The new scheme RDSS has an outlay of Rs.3,03,785/- crore and an estimated gross budgetary support of Rs.97,631/- crore from Central Government. **********
