ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) FOR NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY,  POWER and MoS for  SKILL DEVELOPMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP(SHRI R. K. SINGH)(a) As per data captured on the SPIN portal of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), grid connected rooftop solar PV systems have been installed in 82,487 residential houses totalling 358 MW capacity as on 18.11.2019.(b) and (c) The Phase II of Grid Connected Solar Roof Top (GCRT) Programme approved in February 2019 provides for the Central Financial Assistance (CFA) of 40% of the benchmark cost or tendered cost, whichever is lower for residential grid connected rooftop systems upto 3 kW and 20% of the benchmark cost or tendered cost whichever is lower for residential grid connected rooftop systems of capacity 3 kW to 10 kW. For GCRT systems above 10 kW in residential sector CFA is limited to what is applicable to 10 KW system since solar power for such category is cost effective compared to grid tariffs applicable for such category of consumers. The Phase-II of GCRT programme also provides CFA upto 20% of benchmark cost or tendered cost whichever is lower, for Group Housing Societies/ Resident Welfare Associations ( GHS / RWA), for supply of power for common facilities. Under PhaseII of GCRT programme State Electricity Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) have been made  implementing agencies as they have direct access to the consumers, have an organised invoicing/billing/execution system and hence are best suited to manage distributed and relatively independent clients/prosumers. Incentives for the State DISCOMs for installing additional capacity above baseline have also been provided for.(d)&(e) Regulatory frameworks have been notified by all State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERC)/Joint Electricity Regulatory Commissions (JERC).                                         *****
