ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c) During the period April, 2019 to February 2020, a solar capacity of 6.23 GW was added in the country as against 5.5 GW added during the same period in Financial Year 2018-19. Further, as on 29.2.2020 a cumulative grid connected solar power capacity of 35.07 GW had been installed in the country with additional 21.35 GW under various stages of implementation and 31.27 GW under various stages of bidding. The details of solar energy capacity installations during each of the last three years and the current year are given below:Year	Capacity added during year(MW)	Cumulative capacity(MW)2016-17	5525.98 MW	12288.83 MW2017-18	9362.67 MW	21651.46 MW2018-19	6529.20 MW	28180.66 MW2019-20	6884.68MW	35065.34 MW (as on29.2.2020)(d) Major challenges in solar power development include, land acquisitions and transmission infrastructure. This apart, delays in payments by Distribution Companies in some States, delays in adoption of tariffs by concerned State Electricity Regulatory Commissions, reopening of PPAs by State Government of Andhra Pradesh, etc. have also been noticed. (1) To address these two most critical elements of land and transmission infrastructure in setting up of solar parks and projects, a new mode (Mode-8), namely, Ultra Mega Renewable Energy Power Parks (UMREPP) has been introduced in the Solar Park Scheme.  Under MREPP mode, central and state PSUs will form Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) and take up large projects.*****
