Under PMKVY-STT, placement is linked with payout to training providers. The last tranche, i.e., 30 percent of total payout is disbursed to training providers only on ensuring placement of the candidates.Rozgar Melas are organised with the support of Sector Skill Councils, training providers and implementing agencies to directly link the candidates with the potential employers. Also, captive placements of the trained candidates are being promoted under special project of PMKVY.             Further, based on the learning from implementation of PMKVY 1.0 (2015-16) and 2.0 (2016-20), the orientation of the scheme has been changed from being supply driven to demand driven under PMKVY 3.0. Further, under PMKVY 3.0, placement is being facilitated through the involvement of District Skill Committees and Sector Skill Councils. In addition, Ministry has launched Aatmanirbhar Skilled Employees Employer Mapping (ASEEM) portal, which acts as a central directory of skilled workforce registered and certified under Skill India Portal (SIP), across all schemes at central and state level. (b) and (c)      Under PMKVY-STT, since inception i.e. 2015 as on 31.12.2021, 1.12 lakh candidates have been placed in the State of Telangana. The district-wise and year-wise candidates placed are given at Annexure.
