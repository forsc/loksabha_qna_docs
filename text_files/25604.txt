                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a)	&(b)The growth rate of services sector during the last eight quarters is given in the table below. The service sector Gross Value Added (GVA) after contracting for the first three quarters of 2020-21, had a positive growth of 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020-21. The contraction of the services sector was largely due to COVID-19 pandemic.Table: Growth rate (Year on Year) of Gross Value Added at constant (2011-12) prices of services sector 	2019-20	2020-21	Q1	Q2	Q3	Q4	Q1	Q2	Q3	Q4Services 	7.2	8.2	7.0	6.4	-21.5	-11.4	-1.2	1.5Trade, Hotels, Transport, Communication & Services related to Broadcasting	6.2	6.8	7.0	5.7	-48.1	-16.1	-7.9	-2.3Financial, Real Estate & Professional Services	8.8	8.9	5.5	4.9	-5.0	-9.1	6.7	5.4Public Administration, Defence & Other Services	5.6	8.8	8.9	9.6	-10.2	-9.2	-2.2	2.3Source: National Statistical Office, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation(c) Asper the latest available quick estimates of Index of Industrial Production, during the month of May 2021, the index for the manufacturing sector was 113.5, which is lower than the index during the month of April 2021 which stood at 125.4. Manufacturing sector recorded a growth of 34.5 percent in May, 2021 as against a growth of -37.8 percent in May, 2020. The nationwide lockdown and other measures implemented to restrict the spread of COVID-19 pandemic from the end of March 2020, had led to a majority of the establishments not operating in May 2020 and consequently, there were many units which reported ‘Nil’ production, affecting comparison of the indices for the months of May 2020 and May 2021.(d) & (e)Government is taking various measures to boost manufacturing and services sector related activities in the country. Some of them are enumerated below: •	Steps to boost manufacturing sector activities through initiatives such as Startup India, Business Reform Action Plan, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy and sectoral schemes/programmes. •	Simplification and progressive liberalization of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy and procedures. •	Improving ease of doing business (EoDB) in the country. This has led to improvement of ranking as per World Bank’s EoDB Report from 142 in 2014 to 63 in 2020.•	As part of the vision of becoming ‘Aatmanirbhar’ and for enhancing manufacturing capabilities, an outlay of Rs. 1.97 lakh crore has been announced in Union Budget 2021-22 for Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for key sectors.•	Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order has been revised on 16.09.2020 with the objective of maximizing usage of Made in India products in public procurement and to promote local manufacturing.•	The National Industrial Corridor Programme (NICP) has been conceived to promote world class manufacturing facilities and develop futuristic industrial cities.•	A new scheme, RoDTEP (Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products), for re-imbursement of currently un-refunded Central, State and Local Taxes and Duties incurred in the process of manufacture and distribution of exported products has been put into effect from01.01.2021.•	Steps to improve business activity in services sector, such as Loan Guarantee Scheme for COVID affected sectors which includes health and tourism, free one-month tourist visa to 5 lakh tourists once visa issuance is restarted, and financial support to tourist guides and other stakeholders. •	Structural reforms such as higher Foreign Direct Investment limits in defence and space sector, creating level playing field for private sector for various space related services, simplification of the Other Service Provider (OSP) guidelines under telecom have been undertaken. •	‘Action Plan for Champion Sectors in Services’to give focused attention to  identified Champion Services Sectors to support sectoral initiatives of nodal Ministries/Departments identified for these sectors. ***
