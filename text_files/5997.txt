                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)to (d)  Pollution load in rivers has increased over the years due to discharge of untreated/partially treated domestic and industrial effluent as result of  rapid urbanization and industrialization. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in association with the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) is monitoring the water quality of rivers on a regular basis including Andhra Pradesh. As per report of CPCB published in September 2018, five polluted stretches on rivers namely: Kundu (Nandyal to Madduru),Tungabhadra (Manthralayam to Bavapuram), Godavari (Rayanpeta to Rajahmundry), Krishna (Amravathi to Hamsala Deevi), and Nagavali (Along Thotapalli),have been identified in Andhra Pradesh, based on Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) level in rivers (a key indicator of organic pollution). This Ministry supplements the efforts of the State Governments by providing financial assistance for taking up works relating to  interception & diversion of raw sewage, laying of sewer lines, setting up of sewage treatment plants, low cost sanitation facilities, improved wood crematoria, river front/bathing ghat development, etc. Project proposals are received from the State Governments from time to time for taking up pollution abatement works in towns along various rivers, and are considered for financial assistance under the NRCP subject to their conformity with the scheme guidelines, pollution status, prioritization, appraisal by independent institutions and availability of Plan funds. Under NRCP, for pollution abatement of river Godavari at Rajahmundry town in Andhra Pradesh, schemes pertaining to interception & diversion of sewage, sewage treatment plant, low cost sanitation, river front development and crematoria have been implemented at a sanctioned cost of Rs. 21.79 crore and sewage treatment capacity of 30 mld (million litres per day) has been created in the town under the NRCP. Further, under National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-systems(NPCA), Ministry has so far released an amount of  Rs. 249.57 lakhs to the State Government for conservation of  Kolleru lake in Andhra Pardsesh for various activities undertaken like eco-development, eco tourism, removal of weeds, catchment area treatment, monitoring, public awareness, etc.To ensure proper treatment of municipal sewage before discharge into the rivers, CPCB has issued directions under Section 18 1(b) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 to all the SPCBs/Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) in the country, including Andhra Pradesh, regarding setting up of sewage treatment plants in their respective States. CPCB has also issued directions in October, 2015 to municipal authorities of 184 towns (66 metropolitan cities and State capitals + towns along Ganga) under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for proper treatment and disposal of sewage generated to control pollution in rivers.(e) & (f)   A budget allocation of Rs.196.00 crore has been made in the current financial year for taking up river pollution abatement works against sanctioned projects in various States under NRCP. However, no proposal has been received from Government of Andhra Pradesh for financial assistance for pollution abatement works for identified polluted river stretches under the NRCP scheme.*****
