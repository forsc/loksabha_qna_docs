A brief note on the redesigned Samagra Shiksha is available at https://samagra.education.gov.in/docs/samagra_shiksha.pdf .The Scheme is implemented as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme through a single State Implementation Society (SIS) at the State level.The scheme also has an inbuilt comprehensive monitoring and evaluation mechanism to ensure optimum implementation of interventions, which, inter-alia, includes, Performance Grading Index (PGI), Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE+), PRoject Appraisal, Budgeting Achievements and Data Handling System (PRABANDH), National Achievement Surveys (NAS), Audit Mechanism, Comprehensive Review Mission (CRM), Social Audit, Third Party Monitoring through Monitoring Institutes and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).The Samagra Shiksha Manual on Financial Management and Procurement contains detailed procedures on fund flow arrangements, accounting, financial reporting, internal control and audit, external audit, procurement procedures, etc. Annual Reports of the State Implementing Societies for implementation of the scheme at State / UT level are also laid on the Table of the Parliament every year.Further, the Ministry of Education convenes periodic meetings with State Education Ministers and Secretaries to review the programme implementation.*****
