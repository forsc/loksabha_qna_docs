The RTE Act, 2009 also prohibits ‘physical punishment’ and‘mental harassment’ and makes it a punishable offence. The RTE Act, 2009, interalia,place a duty on the appropriate Government and the local authority to ensurethat the child belonging to weaker section and the child belonging to disadvantagedgroup are not discriminated against and prevented from pursuing and completingelementary education on any grounds. So far as the College students areconcerned, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has framed guidelines onStudent’s Entitlement and other student related services and simplification ofprocedure for settlement of such claims / entitlements for compliance by all HigherEducation Institutions.(b) & (c) Education being a subject in the Concurrent List of the constitution andsubstantial majority of schools are under the jurisdiction of State/UT Governments, itis for the respective State/UT Governments to take note of the incidents ofharassment of students and take appropriate action to prevent such incidents. So faras Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) affiliated schools are concerned,the CBSE follows directions given under the RTE Act and the Rules framed thereunder as well as other Rules and directions issued by the Central/State/UTGovernments in this regard.
