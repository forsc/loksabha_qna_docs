ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) For the development of rural, backward and tribal areas, various programmes and schemes are being implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development in the country including the States of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Assam. The details of these Centrally Sponsored Schemes and flagship schemes of Ministry of Rural Development are given below:(i) The Department of Rural Development (DoRD), Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS), Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), Deendayal Antayodaya Yojana- National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM), Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETI) and Shyama Prasad  Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM).  (ii) The Department of Land Resources (DoLR), Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Watershed Development Component (WDC) of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) in 28 States (except Goa) which is principally development of rainfed portions of net cultivated area and culturable wastelands.  (b) to (d) The State/UT-wise details of the total funds sanctioned/released/utilized during the last five years and the current year including that of North Eastern States, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar along with the information in this regard for the two districts of Uttar Pradesh namely, Jhansi and Lalitpur and the three districts of Bihar namely, Jehanabad, Arwal and Gaya, wherever maintained, are given at Annexure-I. The State-wise details of targets set and achieved are given at Annexure-II.(e) The overall budget of the Department of Rural Development schemes has not been reduced.  In case of PMGSY, Budget Estimates/Revised Estimates is decided on the basis of unspent balances with the states, works in hand and execution capacity of the states which keeps on varying from year to year, accordingly some deduction was made in the scheme.  However, schemes like MGNREGS, DDU-GKY and RSETI are demand driven programme in which funds are released based on the actual demand and according to the approved action plan.Financial allocation to States / UTs under WDC-PMKSY of DoLR is made as per the Operational Guidelines of PMKSY based on Annual Action Plan submitted by State Level Nodal Agency after getting approval of State Level Sanctioning Committee headed by Chief Secretary of State. Sometime, reduction in financial allocation to States / UTs are due to availability of unspent balance and lack of timely submission of complete documents for release including Utilization Certificate, delay in release of matching State share etc. (f)  Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) accords emphasis on proper implementation of all its rural development schemes. In order to ensure that the programme benefits reach the rural poor, the Ministry has evolved a comprehensive multi-level and multi-format system of monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of rural development programmes, including Performance Review Committee Meetings, District Development Co-ordination and Monitoring Committee (“DISHA”) meetings, National Level Monitors (NLMs), Area Officers Schemes, Common Review Mission, Concurrent Evaluation and Impact Assessment Studies. Social Audits are also conducted by some Schemes like Mahatma Gandhi NREGS and PMAY-G. Third-Party evaluation of the Schemes is also carried out regularly and actions, as appropriate, are taken on the findings. In addition to above, steps have also been taken to strengthen transparency and accountability using transaction based IT systems for MIS which include geo-tagging of assets, Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), National electronic Fund Management System (Ne-FMS), Aadhaar Based Payment System (ABPS), Software for Estimate Calculation using Rural rates for Employment (SECURE) and establishment of independent social audit units and appointment of Ombudsman. State specific reviews of States/UTs are also undertaken from time to time.*****
