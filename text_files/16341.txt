With effect from 10th December, 2015, the erstwhile Production Grant Scheme was merged with Cultural Function Grant Scheme (CFGS) and the scheme was renamed as Cultural Function and Production Grant (CFPG).(b)	Under the scheme component of CFGS, financial support was provided for organizing Seminars, Conference, Research, Workshops, Festivals, Exhibitions, Symposia, Production of Dance, Drama-Theatre, Music etc. and small research projects on different aspects of Indian Culture.  The maximum financial support that could be provided was upto Rs. 5.00 lakhs. However, w.e.f 4th September, 2013, the quantum of assistance could be enhanced upto 20.00 lakhs in case of exceptionally deserving project proposals, with the approval of HCM. The grant is being released in 02 instalments of 75% and 25%.

The scheme of Cultural Function and Production Grant   which is being implemented w.e.f. 10.12.2015 consists of same provisions as erstwhile CFGS except that the Organization should have been functioning and registered under the Societies Registration Act (XXI of 1860), Trusts Act, Companies Act or any Central or State Act for at least 03 years.
