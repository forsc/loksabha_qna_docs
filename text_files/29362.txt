Nature of adverse implication on human health depends on the nature of adulteration. Cancer is a multi-factorial disease, the risk factors of which, inter alia, include ageing population, sedentary lifestyle, use of tobacco products, unhealthy diet and air pollution.To ensure availability of safe food products, States/UTs regularly conduct surveillance, inspection and random sampling of food products and where samples are found to be non-conforming to the provisions of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and Rules and regulations made thereunder, penal action is taken against the defaulting FBOs as per the provisions of FSS Act, 2006, and Rules and Regulations made thereunder.……………………
