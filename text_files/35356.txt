                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2483 BY SHRI A.K.P. CHINRAJ TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 16.03.2022 REGARDING IMPLEMENTATION OF COURT JUDGEMENT(a) to (d): LAOP No. 88/2008 to 115/2008 are the cases for enhancement of payment for land acquired in Thengalpalayam village of Namakkal District for construction of Salem-Karur New line. The Hon’ble court has passed the order. But the necessary working sheets for arranging payment have not been received from Revenue Authorities in spite of regular follow up at various levels. Even though working sheets for arranging payment for LAOP No. 88/2008 to 115/2008 is not received from Revenue Department, to avoid accrual of interest, Railway itself had prepared the working sheet for a value of           `5,76,97,263 and submitted to Special Tahsildhar/Namakkal on 28.12.2021 for scrutiny  and returning  back, in order to Honour Hon’ble Court Judgement for making payment and avoid accrual of interest but the same is yet to be received by Railways. As regards to LAOP NO. 220/2002 to 237/2002, these are the cases for enhancement of payment for land acquired in Anniyapuram village of Namakkal District for construction of Salem-Karur New Line. In this regard, it is submitted that the Hon’ble Principal Sub-Ordinate Judge/Namakkal verdict has been honoured by depositing cheque for an amount of `11,46,30,358 (which covers LAOP No. 205/2002 to 237/2002) to Revenue Department (Special Tahsildar/Namakkal) on 01.02.2022 for submitting to Hon’ble Principal Sub-Ordinate Judge/Namakkal for further disbursement to the parties. Interests are being paid as per the Judgement of Hon’ble Court and concerned Land Acquisition Act. However, every effort is being made to make the payment within minimum period after receipt of working sheets from Revenue Department so as to avoid accrual of interests.The main reason for the delay in arranging payment is delay in receipt of working sheets along with Government pleader’s opinion on Hon’ble Court Judgement from Revenue Authorities. However, Railway has been repeatedly requesting/following up the cases at appropriate level in order to arrange early payment and avoid accrual of interest. In order to make timely payment of LAOP cases, Railways have been following up with State Government at various levels for timely submission of working sheets. *****
