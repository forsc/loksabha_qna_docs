                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) to (c) Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP) is a State sector scheme formulated to  bridge the funding gap and provide urgent finance to States for repair and maintenance of Dams. The scheme closed on 31st March, 2021. It facilitated loans from World Bank to participating states. Andhra Pradesh did not choose to be a part of the first phase of DRIP programme.        Next phase of DRIP i.e. DRIP Phase – II & III approved by the Union Cabinet, is at an advanced preparatory stage. Government of Andhra Pradesh has expressed willingness to be a part of DRIP Phase-II & III and submitted an estimate for Rs.667 Crore to rehabilitate 31 dams. However, no funds have been released as yet. Funds will be considered for release only after fulfillment of certain criteria prescribed for disbursement of loan.*****
