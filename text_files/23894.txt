ANSWER




THE MINISER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                                (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) & (b): No, Sir. A statistical compendium on Slums in India was released by National Buildings Organisation (NBO) in 2015, a subordinate office of Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), Government of India, which is based on the data collated through Census of India and National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). (c): ‘Land’ and ‘Colonisation’ are State subjects and therefore, it is the responsibility of the State/Union Territory (UT) Governments to frame policies and implement schemes for the people living in slums. However, the Government of India through its various programmatic interventions has been making overarching efforts by assisting States/UTs both technically and financially to address their housing shortage including slums. In pursuance to Government’s vision of ‘Housing for All’ by 2022, MoHUA has been implementing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) Mission since June 25, 2015 to provide Central Assistance to States/UTs for providing all weather pucca houses with basic civic infrastructure like water, sanitation, sewerage, road, electricity, etc. to all eligible urban households including slum dwellers by the year 2022. “In-situ” Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) component of PMAY-U Mission mandates to use land as a resource for providing houses to slum dwellers. This approach aims to leverage the locked potential of land under slums to provide houses to eligible slum dwellers by bringing them into the formal urban settlement which is environment-friendly.                                           *****
