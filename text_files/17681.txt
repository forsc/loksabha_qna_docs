The issue of Social Security Schemes for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) was discussed in the meeting of Central Advisory Board (CAB) on disability in its last meeting held on 19.09.2019. As per the decision of the CAB, the States/UTs were advised to develop schemes for Social Protection of PwDs in terms of Section 24 of Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016 vide Department’s letter No. 34-07/2019-DD-III (Pt. B) dated 22.11.2019.          Ministry of Rural Development has informed that under their National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) for persons belonging to Below Poverty Line households i.e. for the aged, widows, disabled includes provision for one time assistance in case of death of the primary bread winner. The National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) at present includes five sub-schemes as its components:a.	Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme (IGNOAPS)b.	Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension Scheme (IGNWPS)c.	Indira Gandhi National Disability Pension Scheme (IGNDPS)d.	National Family Benefit Scheme (NFBS)e.	Annapurna Scheme   In this regards, an evaluation study namely “Concurrent Evaluation Study of National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP)” has been assigned to Centre for Market Research & Social Development Pvt. Ltd. The broad terms of reference of the study include, inter-alia, the documentation of best practices and to bring about uniformity in the implementation of the scheme in all States/UTs and to suggest changes in assistance and criteria of these schemes under NSAP.    Ministry of Women and Child Development has informed thatno such study has been conducted for Social Security Schemes for widows. However, in pursuance of the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court dated 14.8.2015 in W.P. (C) No. 659 of 2007, W.P. Civil No. 133 of 2012 and W.P. (Civil) No. 168 of 2012‘Krishna Kutir’, a Home for Widows fully funded by Government of India, Ministry of Women and Child Development has been constructed at Vrindavan as a special case in order to ameliorate the conditions of widows.  It has been constructed with a total cost of Rs. 57.48 crore to accommodate 1,000 widows and to provide them a safe and secure place of stay, health services, nutritious food, legal and counseling services at Sunrakh Bangar, Pargana Vrindavan, District Mathura, Uttar Pradesh.  It has been constructed on 1.4 hectares of land through National Building Construction Corporation (NBCC). The design of the Home has been prepared in consultation with Help Age India and is also old age friendly. The Home consists of ground plus three floors with the facilities of ramp, lifts, and supply of adequate electricity, water and other amenities for meeting the requirement of elderly women and women with special needs. The facility is also equipped with a large modern kitchen and a skill-cum-regular medical checkup. The above facilities to abandoned and shelterless women will not only reduce their difficulties but will help them live a dignified life with a sense of confidence.  This Home is the largest shelter home for widows in the country.A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed on 29.5.2018 between the Government of India, MWCD and the Government of Uttar Pradesh for operation and management of the Home.Year wise details of Home for Widows (Amount in Crores)Year	BE	Expenditure2018-19	8.00	1.572019-20	12.00	0.002020-21	5.00	1.00 Ministry of Women and Child Development has also informed that no such study has been conducted for Social Security Schemes for orphans. However, the Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing a centrally sponsored Child Protection Services (CPS) scheme (erstwhile Integrated Child Protection Scheme) for supporting the children in need of care and protection (CNCP) including orphan/abandoned/surrendered, etc. The primary responsibility of implementation of the scheme lies with the state/UTs. Under the schemes institutional care of CNCP and children in conflict with law is provided in Child Care Institutions (CCIs). The scheme also provides for non- institutional care wherein support is extended for adoption, foster care and sponsorship.*****
