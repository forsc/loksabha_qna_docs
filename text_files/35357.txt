ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (g): Road Over Bridges (ROBs) in lieu of level crossing (LC) No. 28 at Km. 266/4-5 at Kishangarh  on  Phulera-Ajmer  section and LC No.  5  at   Km. 306/4-5 on Ajmer-Palapur section were completed in 2012.  As per the approved General Arrangement Drawings (GADs) of these ROBs, which were jointly prepared and approved by Railway & State Government officials, no provision of stairs was  kept  in the ROBs.           Maintenance of roadway and approaches  of these ROBs is to be done by State Govt..  Therefore, retro-reflective signboards and thermoplastic road marking for pedestrians on these ROBs are to be provided by the State Govt.         Additional facilities of stairs at the ROBs can be considered by Railways on deposit terms provided State Government agrees to bear 100% cost of construction and maintenance subject to its feasibility. Further action will be taken after receipt of proposal from State Government.*****
