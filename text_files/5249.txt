(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (e): 	The Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare has taken a number of measures to improve Automation of Services in its divisions. Some of the steps taken include: Technical support and coordinating implementation of e-Office System is being provided in the Department. Under e-Office System, files and receipts can be sent/ transferred, on-line, within the Department through e-office accounts of the users.  Online Portal has been developed to process the proposals of export and import of seeds and planting material. Kisan Suvidha mobile application has been  developed to facilitate dissemination of information to farmers on the critical parameters viz., Weather; Market Prices; Plant Protection; input Dealers (Seed, Pesticide, Fertilizer) Farm Machinery;  Extreme Weather Alerts; Soil Health Card; Cold Storages & Godowns, Veterinary Centres and Diagnostic Labs.  mKisan Portal (www.mkisan.gov.in) has also been developed for sending advisories through SMSs on various crop related matter to the  farmers registered on mkisan portal. Contd…2/--2-           Farmers are being provided direct income support of Rs.6000/- per year under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAmman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme, in three 4-monthly installments of Rs.2000/-, through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode while effectively utilizing modern Information Technology tools with combined synergies of various agencies like the National Informatics Centre (NIC), the Public Finance Management System (PFMS), the National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI), etc.                  Under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana the Government has developed a National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP) which is the online platform for enrollment of farmers and for all the stakeholders like State Governments which are implementing the scheme, insurance companies, banks and Common Service Centre (CSC). The NCIP dashboard provides for State wise access of real time data for all seasons which includes real time information like total farmers enrolled, number of applications, sum insured, area insured, gender and category wise data, total premium etc. Availability of such information on the dashboard helps in easy access of real time data to all, including different divisions of the Ministry.

For registration of pesticides, online system has been strengthened to dispense with requirement of physical submission of documents and encourage paper less working, in which applicant can submit his application online along with supporting documents. The Directorate of Plant protection, Quarantine & Storage has implemented PQIS (Plant Quarantine Information System) and CROP (Computerized Registration of Pesticides) online system. The PQIS is a workflow process from online application submission to processing of forms and issuance of certificates has been computerized, whereas, the CROP is a Work-Flow based Online Pesticide Registration System.(f):    CPGRAMs and RTI portals are being maintained by Department of Administrative Reforms, Public Grievances & Pensions (DARPG)/Department of Personnel & Training (DOPT) and LIMBS portal by Department of Legal Affairs. These portals are being monitored by this Ministry for redressal of public grievances/ RTI matters/ Court cases.  ******
