MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a)	During the last five years i.e. 2015-16 to 2019-20, 134 Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) have been opened in the country. State / UT-wise and place-wise details are annexed. (b)	Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) has informed that the newly opened KVs start from class I to V. These KVs grow year to year up to class XII. Accordingly, the sanction of staff is done every year and is dynamic in nature. The recruitment of staff is not done on school basis. The vacancies of all the KVs are assessed periodically and recruitment is done on all India basis. The year-wise details of 1217 posts of various categories of teachers sanctioned in 134 KVs set up during the last five years i.e. from the year 2015-16 to 2019-20, are as under:-YEAR	PGT	TGT	PRT	Total2015-16	-	03	175	1782016-17	-	53	98	1512017-18	07	38	306	3512018-19	07	75	112	1942019-20	12	61	270	343Total	26	2309611217(c) & (d) The contractual teachers in KVs are engaged against vacant posts which arise on account of opening of new KVs, transfer, promotion, leave vacancy, retirement etc. The data is dynamic and varies from school to school.(e)	Filling up of vacancies is a continuous process and action is taken from time to time as per the provisions of the relevant recruitment rules.  As the process of filling up of vacancies involves various methods of recruitment such as promotion, Limited Departmental Examination, Direct Recruitment etc. Teachers are also engaged on contractual basis for temporary duration by KVS to ensure that the teaching-learning process is not hampered. The organizations functioning under the Ministry of Education such as KVS, Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti, National Institute of Open Schooling, Central Board of Secondary Education and National Council of Educational Research and Training have been advised to fill up their vacancies in order to increase quality and efficiency.******
