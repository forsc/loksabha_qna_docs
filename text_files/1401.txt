                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c):  As per information provided by Medical Council of India (MCI), there are a total 11,57,771 allopathic doctors registered with the State Medical Councils/Medical Council of India as on 31st January, 2019. Assuming 80% availability, it is estimated that around 9.26 lakh doctors may be actually available for active service. It gives a doctor-population ratio of 1:1457 as per current population estimate of 1.35 billion, which is lower than the WHO norm of 1:1000. Besides, there are 7.88 lakh Ayurveda, Unani and Homeopathy (AUH) doctors in the country. Assuming 80% availability, it is estimated that around 6.30 lakh Ayurveda, Unani and Homeopathy (AUH) doctors may be actually available for service and considered together with allopathic doctors, it gives a doctor population ratio of 1:868. Further, the State / UT wise data regarding doctor – population ratio is not maintained centrally. However, the details of number of allopathic doctors registered with the State Medical Councils / MCI is at Annexure. The Government has taken several steps to increase the number of doctors in the country. These include:For increasing UG Seats:-(i)  Enhancement of maximum intake capacity at MBBS level from 150 to 250.(ii)  Relaxation in the norms for setting up of Medical College in terms of requirement of land, faculty, staff, bed/bed strength and other infrastructure.(iii) Strengthening/ upgradation of existing State Government/Central Government   Medical Colleges to increase MBBS seats.(iv) Establishment of New Medical Colleges attached with district/referral hospitals   preferably in underserved districts of the country.For increasing PG Seats:-(i)   The ratio of teachers to students has been revised from 1:1 to 1:2 for all MD/MS disciplines and from 1:1 to 1:3 in subjects of Anesthesiology, Forensic Medicine, Radiotherapy, Medical Oncology, Surgical Oncology and Psychiatry in all medical colleges across the country. Further, teacher: student ratio in public funded Government Medical Colleges for Professor has been increased from 1:2 to 1:3 in all clinical subjects and for Asso. Prof. from 1:1 to 1:2 if the Asso. Prof. is a unit head. The same has also been extended to the private medical colleges with certain conditions. This would result in increase in number of PG seats in the country.(ii)    DNB qualification have been equated with MD/MS/DM/M.Ch qualifications and recognized for appointment as faculty in medical colleges. (iii)   Enhancement of age limit for appointment/ extension/ re-employment against posts of teachers/dean/principal/ director in medical colleges  upto 70 years. (iv)   Strengthening/ upgradation of State Government Medical Colleges for starting new PG courses/Increase of PG seats.    (v)   By amending the regulations, it has been made mandatory for all medical colleges to start PG courses within 3 years from the date of their MBBS recognition / continuation of recognition.(vi)   Colleges are allowed to apply for PG courses in clinical subjects at the time of 4th renewal it will serve to advance the process for starting PG courses by more than 1 year.(d):      The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme namely ‘Establishment of new Medical Colleges attached with existing district/referral hospitals’ with fund sharing between the Central Government and States in the ratio of 90:10 for NE/special category States and 60:40 for other states.
