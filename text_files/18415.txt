                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	Yes, Sir. (b)	The Annual Plan of Operation of Telangana, State Forest Development Agency (SFDA) for 2016-17 under National Afforestation Programme (NAP) could not be approved as the mandatory documents required as per the guidelines of NAP were not submitted by the State. Further, no proposal has been received from SFDA beyond 2016-17 under NAP. Under Green India Mission (GIM) also no proposal has been received from Telangana for release of funds. (c)	The State is required to submit proposal under respective scheme for release of fund. However, Ministry on 24th March 2020 has advised all States and UT Governments to step up afforestation drive to maximize tree planting by all concerned departments in the State/UT. Ministry has also announced implementation of Nagar Van Scheme for creation of urban forests in cities with a view to increase urban green cover. Besides, the funds released under Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) to States/UTs are also utilized for carrying out afforestation activities, which increase green cover. Government of India has disbursed an amount of Rs.47, 872.31 crore from National Fund to 30 State/ UTs as share of respective states including Rs.3110.38 crores to the state of Telangana as per Compensatory Fund Act, 2016. *****
