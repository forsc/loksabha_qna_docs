ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a):		 Under the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, both the Central and the State Governments are appropriate Governments to fix, review and revise the minimum wages of the employees employed in the Scheduled employments including agriculture  under   their   respective   jurisdictions.    The Central Government and the State Governments are mandated under section 3(1) (b) of the Act to revise the Minimum Rates of Wages payable to the employees engaged in the Scheduled employments including agriculture in their respective jurisdictions at intervals not exceeding five years. Accordingly, the minimum rates of wages in the Scheduled employments in the Central sphere were last revised by the Central Government in 2017. The details of periodic revision of minimum rates of wages in the Scheduled employments in the State sphere are not centrally maintained. Contd..2/-::  2  ::Besides, the revision of minimum rates of wages every five years, the Central Government, in order to take care of the rising prices, revises the Variable Dearness Allowance (V.D.A) on basic rates of minimum wages every six months effective from 1st April and 1st October every year on the basis of Consumer Price Index for Industrial workers. V.D.A. was last revised w.e.f. 01.10.2021. A statement showing increase in the rates of wages on account of increasing V.D.A payable to the employees engaged in the Scheduled employments including agriculture in the Central Sphere is at Annexure-I.      (b) & (c):	Enforcement of the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, including payment of the minimum wages, is a continuous process done by the authorities statutorily appointed for the purpose by the appropriate Governments, i.e. the Central Government and the State Governments, in their respective jurisdiction. The enforcement in the Central sphere is secured through the inspecting officers of the Chief Labour Commissioner (Central) commonly designated as Central Industrial Relations Machinery (CIRM) and in the State Sphere through the State Enforcement Machinery. The designated inspecting officers conduct regular inspections and in the event of detection of any case of non-payment or under-payment of minimum wages, they direct the employers to make payment of the shortfall of wages. In case of non-compliance, penal provisions prescribed under Section 22 of the Act are taken recourse to. The details in regard to enforcement of the minimum wages in the Scheduled employments in the Central Sphere are furnished at Annexure-II. Details of enforcement of the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, in the State sphere are not centrally maintained.(d) & (e):	The provisions of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, have been rationalized and amalgamated in the Code on Wages Act, 2019, passed by the Parliament and notified on 08.08.2019. The Code on Wages, 2019, provides for universal minimum wage and floor wage across employments in organized and unorganized sector. Besides the minimum rates of wages to be fixed/revised by the Central Government and the State Governments in their respective jurisdiction, the Code mandates the Central Government to fix floor wage applicable across the Central and the State sphere.  Section 9 of the Code lays down that the minimum rates of wages fixed by the appropriate Government under section 6 shall not be less than the floor wage. The said provisions of the Code on Wages, 2019, have not come into force.* *                                                   *******
