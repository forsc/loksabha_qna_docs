ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b) : 	As per provisions of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) admissible claims are generally paid by the insurance companies within two months of completion of Crop Cutting Experiments/harvesting period subject to availability of yield data and release of total State share of premium subsidy from concerned State Government within time.  However, settlement of claims in some States gets delayed due to reasons like delayed transmission of yield data;  late release of their share in premium subsidy by some States, yield related disputes between insurance companies and States, non-receipt of account details of some farmers for transfer of claims and National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) related issues, etc.  However, this Department is regularly monitoring the implementation of PMFBY including timely settlement of claims.  	To bring down the claim settlement time, many steps in addition to regularly monitoring the implementation of PMFBY, have been taken by the Government.    These steps include use of imporved technology, revision of Operational Guidelines wherein provision has been made for timely release of State Govt. share in 3 instalments and settlement of claims by insurance companies without waiting for final/3rd installment by the States and advancement of 15 days in seasonality discipline for early settlement of claims. Penalty provisions for late settlement of claims by insurance companies and late release of funds by State Governments have also been stipulated under these guielines.(c) :   	 As per the operational guidelines of PMFBY, vide letter dated  September 25, 2019,  an interest penalty of Rs. 3.30 crore, Rs. 0.09 crore, Rs. 0.51 crore, Rs. crore and Rs. 0.16 crore has been imposed on Agriculture Insurance Company of India Ltd., Cholamandalm-MS General Insurance Company Ltd., ICICI-Lombard General Insurance Company Ltd., New India Assurance Company Ltd. and SBI General Insurance Company Ltd. respectively.   In reply they have submitted their explanations requesting for review. A meeting has been called to discuss the explanations submitted by the insurance companies.	Apart from this, State Governments have been advised to impose penalities on insurance companies themselves.  Accordingly, some State governments like Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Haryana have also imposed punitive interest on insurance companies and have deducted the interest money.	A letter has also been issued to 5 States namely, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Talangana, Jharkhand and Rajasthan who defaulted in release of state share of subsidy reminding them about the provison of penal interest on States.(d) & (e) :	 18 companies including all the 5 public sector companies have been empanelled for implementation of the scheme in country by the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare.  But all the companies are not participating in bidding process in each State/each season.  During last year i.e. 2019-20 four companies namely, ICICI-Lombard General Insuance Company Ltd., Tata-AIG General Insurance Company Ltd., Cholamandal-MS General Insurance Company Ltd. and Shriram General Insurance Compay Ltd. have not participated in fresh bids due to non-availability of reinsurance arrangement and non-approval by their respective Board of Directors etc.(f) : 	State-wise details of premium and claims under PMFBY during last two years i.e. 2017- 18 and 2018-19 are given in Annexure.
