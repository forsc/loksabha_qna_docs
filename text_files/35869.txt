                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS (SHRI AJAY KUMAR MISHRA)(a) to (e):   With the enhanced use of cyber space, the number of cyber crimes is also increasing, including those against women. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) compiles and publishes statistical data on crimes in its publication “Crime in India”.  The latest published report is for        the year 2020.   As per the data published by the NCRB, details of       cases registered under the head  cyber  crimes  against  women  (involving communication devices as medium/target) for the years 2019 and 2020 are at the Annexure.‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects as per the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The States/UTs are primarily responsible for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of crimes through their law enforcement agencies. The law enforcement agencies take legal action as per the provisions of law against persons involved in misuse of social media for impersonation of women and cyber harassment. The Government has launched the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (www.cybercrime.gov.in) on 30.08.2019 to enable public to report all types of cyber crimes, with special focus on cyber crimes against women and children. Cyber crime incidents reported on this portal are routed automatically to the respective State/UT law enforcement agency for further handling as per the provisions of law. A Toll-free Helpline number ‘1930’ has been operationalized to get assistance in lodging online cyber complaints. As per the data maintained, since its inception, 904061 cyber crime incidents have been registered upto 28.02.2022 on the portal.  However, specific data regarding cases of “cyber harassment and impersonation of women on social media” is not maintained separately on the portal. -3-LS.US.Q.NO.3143 FOR 22.03.2022To spread awareness about the Portal and Toll-free Helpline number, the Government has taken several steps that inter-alia includes dissemination of messages through SMS, I4C social media account, i.e., Twitter handle (@Cyberdost), Facebook (CyberDostI4C), Instagram (cyberdosti4c), Telegram (cyberdosti4c), Radio campaign, engaged MyGov for publicity through multiple media, organizing Cyber Safety and Security Awareness Weeks in association with States/UTs, etc. The States/UTs have also been requested to carry out publicity of the Toll-free Helpline number and the Portal to create mass awareness.*****
