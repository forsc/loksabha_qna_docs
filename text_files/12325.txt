ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STEEL			   (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a)&(b): On a media report published by an organization known as First Construction Council (FCC), informing that 18 out of 26 TMT bar brands in the country failed in quality parameters during their testing of samples.BIS requested FCC to share the details such as lab which had conducted the testing, source of samples, names of the manufacturers. FCC informed that the samples were drawn from the open market in Delhi and tested by Shriram Institute for Industrial Research, Delhi (SIIR).In order to validate the test results reported by the FCC, BIS approached the lab i.e. SIIR, and requested them to re-test the remnants of the samples. The lab was also requested to share the copies of the test requests and declaration of samples such as the grade, size and brand name of the samples provided by FCC, Mumbai for the testing of these samples.However, the lab informed that the consent of the booking party would be required to allow the same. BIS had then approached the FCC to give the consent for re-testing the remnants of the sample. FCC has not given the consent.(c)	BIS could not find any substance to the claims of FCC in their report regarding the quality of TMT bars.(d)&(e): Ministry of Steel has implemented quality control order on 66 steel and steel products including the TMT bars Standard IS 1786 : 2008. The steel quality control orders are applicable for both domestic productions as well as imports. The implementation of Steel Quality Control Order ensures availability of quality product to the industry and public at large.BIS periodically checks the performance of manufacturing units holding a license to use BIS Standard Mark (ISI Mark) on High Strength Deformed Steel Bars and Wires for concrete reinforcement as per IS 1786:2008 (which are also known as TMT bars) through surveillance audits and testing of samples drawn from the factory and the market.********
