                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) & (b): Central Government attaches highest importance to the safety and security to every citizen of the country including journalists. The existing laws for protection of citizens also cover journalists. ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India and State Governments are responsible for prevention, detection, registration and investigation of crime and for prosecuting the criminals through their law enforcement agencies. The Ministry of Home Affairs has issued advisories to the States and UTs, from time to time, to maintain law & order and to ensure that any person who takes law into his/her own hands is punished promptly as per law. An advisory specifically on safety of journalists was issued to States/UTs on 20th October 2017 requesting them to strictly enforce the law to ensure the safety and security of media persons, which is available on the Ministry’s website : www.mha.gov.in.*****
