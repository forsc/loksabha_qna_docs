                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a): 	No Sir, There was no target fixed by this Department. Since no data on actual or estimated number of migrants/stranded migrant persons across the country was available with the Department, initial liberal estimate of about 8 Crore (80 Million) migrants/stranded migrant persons was made. This Department had liberally allocated foodgrains to cover maximum migrants/stranded migrants in the country (upto 10% of total approx. 80 Crore NFSA population) and allocated about approx. 4 LMT foodgrains per month (10% of monthly approx. 40 LMT allocated under NFSA) i.e. a total of approx. 8 LMT for a period of two months i.e. May and June 2020. Responsibility of identification of beneficiaries, under this scheme was entrusted with States/UTs. States/UTs indicated about 2.8 crore total migrant population. Until 31.08.2020, about 2.67 LMT of foodgrains have been distributed under the scheme to about 2.67 crore persons (i.e. 94.6% of estimated beneficiaries by States/UTs) per month for the months of May and June. Since identification of migrants took time, Govt of India extended the distribution period of the foodgrains (lifted upto 25th June, 2020) upto 31st August 2020.(b) & (c): 	Does not arise.                         ****
