Under the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) project of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, the Erosion line projected to the next 100 years based on the annual rate of erosion computed from high resolution aerial photographs and satellite images has been delineated over the entire coast line covering the mainland coastal states / UTs, by the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), Chennai in co-ordination with the Survey of India (SoI), as part of Hazard line mapping carried out by the SoI. 2. The Government has notified the CRZ Notification 2011 with the objectives of protection of livelihoods of fisher folk communities, preservation of coastal ecology and promotion of economic activity that have necessarily to be located in the coastal regions. The notification also provides for ‘No Development Zones’ (NDZ) along various categories of coastal areas to protect India’s coastline from encroachment, erosion and accretion. 3. The Government of Tamil Nadu has also formulated a comprehensive “Shoreline Protection Management Plan for Coast of Tamil Nadu” for effective erosion control along the coastline of Tamil Nadu.******
