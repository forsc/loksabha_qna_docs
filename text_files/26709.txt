                        Will the Minister of





FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING


                        be pleased to state:-















                                                    a)   whether the Government of India has devised any measure to check the price fluctuation of fish products as the fish prices fluctuate widely across the day, season and regions, which is very high because of the uncertain nature of the fish harvest, its perishable nature, and variation in the short-run supply, besides, the fish supply being highly inelastic, a bumper catch can slash down the fish prices and a small catch will boost the prices to a very high level; and b)  if so, details thereof?






ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(SHRI PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a) and (b):  Fish is a perishable item and the price of fish products is market driven and dependent on several factors like demand, arrival of fish in market, fish size, species, type, season, accessibility, consumption pattern and region etc. The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying through the National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB) is implementing a Fish Market Price Information System (FMPIS) for collecting price details of different commercially important fish species from different fish markets. Based on these details, an analytical report is uploaded on the NFDB website on a weekly basis. This aims at promoting trading of commercially important fish species. FMPIS facilitates better marketability (fisher/seller) and accessibility (consumer/buyer). ****
