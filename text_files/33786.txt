(b)	The Government’s funding for research in terms of National Gross Expenditure on R&D (GERD) to GDP figure remains around 0.7% during last 5 years.The Government has taken several steps to encourage research in private sector by incentivizing investment by the private sector to increase GERD. The government has been offering various financial incentives that fall under the category of direct incentives in the form of funding programmes for the private sector to contribute to the national R&D ecosystem through R&D programmes being implemented by various ministries and their associated departments. It also offers indirect incentives in the form of tax incentives on R&D investments to the private sector. Government has already allowed the corporate sector to make R&D investments under their mandatory Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). There are specific investment incentives offered such as Location-based tax incentives that lead to 100% deductions of profits generated from establishing and doing business in North- Eastern states of India for a period of 10 years. The government has also taken specific steps towards ease of doing business, IP management, and procurement policies, that will aid in stimulating the private sector’s participation in the national R&D ecosystem. Council of Scientific and Industrial Research is implementing New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative (CSIR-NMITLI) program. Under CSIR-NMITLI, soft loan @3% interest is being provided to industry/ies to carry out research and development. Partnering public institutions are provided grant-in-aid under the program. (c)	As on date, there is no plan to set up a new research centre like Raman Research Institute.
