AMI scheme is a demand driven, back ended credit linked subsidy scheme in which rate of subsidy provided is 25% and 33.33% based on the category of eligible beneficiary and provided on capital cost of the project.  Assistance under the sub-scheme is available to individuals, agri-preneurs, group of farmers/growers, registered Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), cooperatives and state agencies etc. 	Since inception and up to 30.06.2020, a total of 39,416 storage infrastructure projects with storage capacity of 665.3 Lakh MT have been assisted under AMI scheme benefiting number of agri-preneurs including farmers.

The scheme has been formally launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister of India on 09.08.2020.  So far, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has received 3055 proposals including that of warehouse facilities from Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) through state cooperative banks in 22 states for which in-principle sanction of Rs. 1568 crore has been accorded.
