ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE  IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO) (a) and (b) The number of clearance processed through PARIVESH is 2663 since its inception. A total of 272 Expert Appraisal Committee meetings were conducted during the last two years. During these meeting 37 violations were detected.(c) A total of 202 number of sittings have been made by Regional Empowered Committees (RECs) in ten regional offices during last two years.  After the sitting of Regional Empowered Committee, its recommendations are processed for obtaining the approval of Competent Authority in the Ministry. Thereafter these decisions of this Ministry are conveyed to concerned State Govt./UTs for necessary action. (d) United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) declared India as the Global Host for the World Environment Day, 2018.  Being the Global Host, event was celebrated across the length and breadth of the country and outside India also through our Embassies / Missions abroad (MEA was requested to sensitize our Missions / Embassies for the same).  Invitations were extended to all the Missions / Embassies in New Delhi as also the Environment Ministers of the countries with whom India has close relations in the field of environment, to participate in the main plenary event on 5th June, 2018 at Vigyan Bhavan.  As a result a number of Ambassadors / High Commissioners of various Embassies / Missions / High Commissions participated in the plenary function.   It is not possible to quantify the specific names and number of such participants.  The event was not confined to one particular day, but was celebrated over a few months.  Approximately Rs.30 crores was spent on the conduct of World Environment Day 2018.***
