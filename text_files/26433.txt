MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) & (b): As per Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) 2019-20 the secondary school dropout rates among boys belonging to General, OBC, SC, and ST categories are 11.6%, 17.5%, 19.8% and 25.5% respectively and the secondary school dropout rates among girls belonging to General, OBC, SC, and ST categories are 10.3%, 15.4%, 17.4% and 22.5% respectively. As per the Report of National Statistical Survey (NSS) 75th Round, the reasons for not attending or dropping out of school, inter-alia, include poverty/economic reasons, child not interested in studies, children engaged in domestic activities or in economic activities.(c) to (e): Government of India launched Samagra Shiksha - an Integrated Scheme for school education, w.e.f. 2018-19, as an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education. Under CentrallySponsored Scheme of Samagra Shiksha, financial assistance is provided to the States and UTs for various activities to reduce dropouts, which include opening/strengthening of new schools up to senior secondary level, construction of school buildings & additional classrooms, setting up, up-gradation and running of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBV) for girls belonging to disadvantaged groups such as Scheduled Castes(SC), Scheduled Tribes(ST), Other Backward Classes, Minority and Below Poverty Line(BPL), setting up of residential schools/hostels named Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Avasiya Vidyalayas in hilly terrain, small and sparsely populated areas for children without adult protection who are in need of shelter and care, free uniform to all girls, and boys belonging to SC, ST and BPL at elementary level, free text books to all children, transport allowance, undertaking enrolment drives, residential as well as non residential trainings, seasonal hostels/ residential camps etc. Financial assistance is also provided for aids and appliances for children with special needs.Under Samagra Shiksha, for the first time in 2021-22, financial assistance upto Rs. 2000 per annum has been envisioned for supporting Out of School Children of age group of 16-19 years, belonging to socio economically disadvantaged groups, for completing their education through NIOS/SIOS, for accessing course materials and certification.This Department has developed an online module for compiling the data of Out of School Children (OoSC) identified by each State/UT and their mapping with Special Training Centres (STC) on the PRABANDH Portal (http://samagrashiksha.in). The concerned State/UT validates the child wise information of the identified OoSC and STC uploaded by the concerned Block Resource Centre of the State for monitoring the progress of mainstreaming of OoSC. Also, Bridge Course Modules have been developed by National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) for bridging the learning gaps of Out of School Children studying in Special Training Centers (STC) under the provision of RTE Act, 2009.Also, under National Means-cum-Merit Scholarship Scheme scholarship is awarded to meritorious students of economically weaker sections to arrest their drop out at class VIII and encourage them to continue the study at secondary stage.*******
