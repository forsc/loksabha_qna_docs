                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)&(b)	Yes, sir. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) compiles annual data w.r.t. the generation of solid waste, plastic waste, e-waste, construction & demolition (C&D) waste, bio-medical waste (BMW) and hazardous waste (HW) in the country. The data is collected from the respective State Pollution Control Board/ Pollution Control Committees (SPCBs/ PCCs) in line with the provisions contained in various rules notified under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The State/ Union Territory-wise details of waste generation data from 2015 to 2021 are placed at Annexure-A. Further, based on the studies undertaken by CPCB on Hazardous waste and data compiled in respect of other wastes, the average annual increase observed in generation of wastes is as below:•	Hazardous Waste – 2%•	Biomedical Waste – 5.8%•	Solid Waste – 0.1%, and•	Plastic Waste – 21.8%(c)	The CPCB had received a total of 23 public complaints during 2016-2021 on unscientific/ illegal disposal of BMW from across the country. The State/ UT-wise break-up of complaints is as below:•	Rajasthan – 5•	Delhi – 4•	Tamil Nadu – 3•	Jharkhand -2•	1 complaint each from Bihar, Punjab, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Puducherry, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh(d) The State/ UT wise details of solid waste generation and collection efficiency from year 2015 to 2020 are placed at Annexure-A.(e) For tracking BMW, the CPCB had developed ‘COVID19BWM’ application for tracking of COVID19 biomedical waste generated by the healthcare facilities, isolation centres/ camps, sample collection centre, laboratories, Urban Local Bodies (for home care/ home quarantine) and CBWTFs. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has informed that various Urban Local Bodies have deployed technological options for real time tracking of the Garbage collection vehicles in cities and towns based on their population size, geographic extent, fleet size of vehicles and other factors.(f) The typical costs incurred on ‘landfills with capping’ include initial cost of setting-up facility, annual operating costs, cost for landfill closure, post-closure monitoring costs, costs towards emergency failure of landfill (if applicable). Such costs are variable in nature and depend on the location of site, quantity of waste material handled, logistics involved, topographical features of the site, climatological profile of the area and other socio-economic factors. Further, operators are required to undertake the efficient operation and maintenance of landfills through post-closure monitoring for30 years, as per CPCB guidelines, which include the following:•	Groundwater monitoring around TSDF;•	Leachate collection, analysis and its treatment;•	Gaseous emissions (Volatile Organic Compounds and Hydrogen Sulphide) monitoring from vents of secured landfills;•	Ambient Air quality monitoring around the disposal facility•	Green-belt development and maintenance;•	Provision for contingencies like insurance;•	Remedial measures in case of adverse impact on the environment*****
