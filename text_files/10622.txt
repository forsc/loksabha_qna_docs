ANSWER




                                                        (a):	The State/ Union Territories (UTs)-wise details of slum households and slum population, as per Census-2011, are at Annexure-I. (b): The State/UT-wise details of basic amenities, as per Census-2011, are at Annexure II to VI.(c): ‘Land’ and ‘Colonisation’ are State subjects and therefore it is the responsibility of the State/ UT Governments to implement schemes to provide houses to shelterless families including slum-dwellers. However, the Government of India through various programmatic interventions has been assisting States/ UTs both technically and financially to address their housing shortage. In this regard, the Union Government has been implementing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban (PMAY-U) Mission since June, 2015 to provide all weather pucca houses to all eligible urban households including slum dwellers by the year 2022.  The “In-situ” Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) component under PMAY-U Mission mandates to use land as a resource for providing houses to slum dwellers. This approach aims to leverage the locked potential of land under slums to provide houses to the eligible slum dwellers by bringing them into the formal urban settlement. Slum redevelopment grant of Rs. 1.0 lakh per house is admissible for all houses built for eligible slum dwellers under ISSR component. The details of physical and financial progress of PMAY-U Mission and especially under ISSR component of the Mission are at Annexure-VII.                                             *****
