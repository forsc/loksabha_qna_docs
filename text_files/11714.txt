ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)	As per available information, 275 Indians, including fishermen are presently believed to be in Pakistan’s custody. However, as per the lists shared on 1 January 2020, Pakistan has acknowledged the custody of 262 of them. In addition, there is the issue of 83 missing Indian defence personnel, including Prisoners of war, whose custody has not been acknowledged by Pakistan, so far.	The Government, upon receipt of reports of apprehension of Indian prisoners and fishermen, immediately takes up the matter with Pakistan through diplomatic channels and seeks consular access and their early release and repatriation. Government’s persistent efforts have succeeded in securing release and repatriation of 2133 Indian prisoners, including fishermen from Pakistan’s custody since 2014. This includes release and repatriation of 20 Indian fishermen on 6 January 2020.(c) & (d)	The Government has asked Pakistan to provide consular access as also release and repatriate remaining Indian prisoners and fishermen in Pakistan’s custody. This includes 110 Indian civilian prisoners and fishermen whose nationality has been confirmed and have completed their sentences. Pakistan has also been requested to facilitate the visit of a team of Indian medical experts to meet prisoners of unsound mind, who are believed-to-be Indian nationals, with a view to facilitate their nationality verification and subsequent repatriation. Pakistan has not responded so far.
