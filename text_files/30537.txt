ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE AND CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS(DR.  MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a)	& (b):  No Sir, no such incidence has been reported by any State Government. However, in between the season, some states highlighted shortfall of DAP fertilizers, particularly in few districts. Accordingly, based on the requests of State Governments, DAP rakes were moved to meet the requirement. Further, the overall availability of Di- ammonium Phosphate (DAP) fertilizer in the country is comfortable during the ongoing Rabi season 2021-22.  (c) :	The following steps/measures have been taken to ensure adequate & timely availability of DAP & NPK fertilizer in the country:i.	An attempt has been made to assess the field requirement in consultation with the states and accordingly, the district wise micro planning has been done which is being executed on daily basis.ii.	24x7 interactions with the state governments, companies and railways have been established through web platforms/control room.iii.	The stake holders viz., manufacturers, ports, railways have been sensitized to operate on maximum capacity to produce load, and move the fertilizers to the targeted destinations.iv.	State Governments are impressed upon to use i-FMS dashboard stock figures for district wise stock availability and suitable interventions. Same source is used by DoF so as to be on board with states and closely oversee the recommended movement for each district rake point.v.	The loading and voyage time of imported fertilizer shipments are being monitored on daily basis and required suitable interventions are being made from time to time.vi.	Every day there is a close monitoring 24x7 and regular interaction with states, fertilizer companies and railway board. As 90% of the fertilizers are moved through railway rakes, so the loading and movement of these rakes is being executed in a very targeted manner (in consultation with respective state governments), so as to address the field demand.vii.	Necessary directions are issued time to time to State Governments to check overpricing and black marketing of the Di-ammonium Phosphate(DAP) and Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium (NPK) fertilizers as per FCO, 1985. (d):   The volume of DAP and NPK fertilizer needed and delivered to States/UTs during current Rabi season, State/UT-wise is annexed at Annexure-A & B.******* ANNEXURE-ADAPState Wise Requirement,
