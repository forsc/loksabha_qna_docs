ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (e):    With a view to provide a simple and affordable crop insurance scheme to ensure comprehensive risk cover for crops against all non-preventable natural risks from pre-sowing to post-harvest, and to provide adequate claim amount and timely settlement of claims, a yield based scheme namely Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), and weather index based scheme, namely, “Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS)”, have been launched from Kharif 2016 by the Government.   The scheme is mandatory for farmers availing seasonal agricultural operations loans/Kisan Credit Card loans for notified crops in notified areas. Requests/representations have been received from various quarters including farmer organizations, States etc. by the Government to make the scheme voluntary/optional for all farmers.    Based on these representations, all the State Governments have been requested to furnish their views on voluntary coverage of all farmers under PMFBY.  The basic objective of the scheme will not be affected by making the scheme voluntary, as the benefit of the scheme for insured farmers will remain same.Further, the revisions/improvements in the crop insurance schemes is a continuous process and decisions on suggstions/representations are taken from time to time after consultation with various stakeholders.     ********
