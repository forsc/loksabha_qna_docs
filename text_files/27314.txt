                                                                  THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                         (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a) & (b):	 Sanitation is a State subject and function of its Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and it is the responsibility of State Governments/ ULBs to plan, design, execute and operate sanitation projects in the urban areas of the country.       In urban area, 140,980 MT (metric tonne) Municipal Solid Wastes (MSWs) are generated per day.   Further, as per Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) report on “National Inventory of Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs)” published in March, 2021, the sewage generation from urban centres is estimated at 72,368 MLD (million litre per day).       Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs facilitates in framing broad policies, advisories and guidelines on sanitation system and provide Central Assistance under various programmes/ missions taken up from time to time. Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U) and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) are such Missions, which provide funds for Solid Waste Management and Sewerage and Septage construction for waste water treatment.	SBM-U, encourages 100% door to door collection and segregation at source of MSW in every ward, adoption of decentralised composting of Bulk Waste Generators in ULBs, along with setting up of centralised composting plants, scientific land filling and land remediation, management of plastic waste and the Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste in integrated manner.  Till date, the scientific processing of MSW has increased to 68% from 18% in 2014.	Under AMRUT, Sewerage and Septage Management is one of the thrust areas. So far,States/UTs have taken up 872 Sewerage and Septage Management projects worth Rs.33,322 crore. Of these, 839 projects worth Rs.32,742 crore have been grounded including 323 completed projects worth Rs.7,213 crore. These projects will lead to overall development of Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) capacity of 6,067 MLDof which 1,634 MLD capacity has already been created.  Further, 79 lakhs sewer connections have been given under AMRUT or in convergence with the other schemes.(c) &¬ (d): 	Under SBM-U, an amount of Rs.7,365.82 crore have been allocated for Solid Waste Management, of which Rs.6,220.64 crore have been released to States/UTs so far.       Under AMRUT, States/UTs  have taken up STP projects worth Rs.18,176.37 crore and expended Rs.10,352.63 crore so far. (e) & (f):	Under AMRUT, implementation of projects in States/ UTs are trackedthrough dedicated web portal. States/UTs are required to update data on the web portal on regular basis. For assessment and monitoring of work done in the States/UTs, dedicated Independent Review and Monitoring Agencies (IRMAs) have been appointed for each State/UT. The release of funds to States are based on the satisfactory report of IRMAs.	Under SBM-U, overall progress is assessed and evaluated through a national Management Information System (MIS) portal, which captures the physical and financial progress of all States/UTs and cities.State-wise progress of STPs being constructed under AMRUT is given at ANNEXURE-IState-wise progress in processing of Municipal Solid Wastes in Urban Areas is given at ANNEXURE-II                                                   *****
