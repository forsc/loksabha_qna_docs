ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; AND MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING[SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR](a) At present there are 251 Community Radio (CR) Stations operational across the country, including Rajasthan. A State-wise list of these CR Stations is available on Ministry’s website www.mib.nic.in.(b) Setting up of CR Stations in India is a voluntary effort, involving community participation. The procedure involves clearance from M/o Home Affairs, M/o Defence and availability of frequency spot given by Wireless Planning & Coordination Wing, D/o Telecommunication. The cost of setting up of CR Station is approximately Rs. 10-15 lacs. A large number of potential organizations find it difficult to arrange enough financial resources to establish and sustain CR Station.(c) Policy Guidelines for setting up of Community Radio Stations in India, along with subsequent amendments are available on Ministry’s website www.mib.nic.in.(d) To simplify the application process, Ministry decided that Government Universities, Deemed Universities (Central and State), Government Colleges, Government Schools and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (run by the Government) will have single window clearance. In addition, the Ministry has launched an online portal i.e. www.broadcastseva.gov.in, which enables potential applicants to apply for CR permission online. This in turn encourages transparency and reduces postage time and costs.*****
