ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                          (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) & (b): Government of India has created Ministry of Jal Shakti integrating the erstwhile Ministry of Water Resources River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation and Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation with an aim of integrated water resources management under one umbrella so that the issues relating to water are dealt with in a holistic manner.     National Water Policy, 2012 formulated by the erstwhile Ministry of Water Resources states that safe water for drinking and sanitation should be considered as pre-emptive needs, followed by high priority allocation for other basic domestic needs (including needs of animals), achieving food security, supporting sustenance agriculture and minimum eco-system needs. Available water, after meeting the above needs, should be allocated in a manner to promote its conservation and efficient use."        Water supply is a State subject and it is the responsibility of the State Governments/Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to plan, design and execute water supply scheme for the urban area of the country. Government of India supplements the efforts of the States through its flagship Missions. Government of India has launched the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) on 25thJune, 2015 in 500 cities across the country for a period of five years, i.e. from 2015-16 to 2019-20, with focus on development of basic urban infrastructure in the Mission cities. Water supply is one of the priority sectors under AMRUT, wherein projects related to augmentation of existing water supply, water treatment plants, rehabilitation of old water supply systems, rejuvenation of water bodies specifically for drinking water supply and recharging of ground water etc. can be taken up by the States/Union Territories to enhance water supply in the Mission cities. In the water supply sector, contracts for 1,137 projects worth Rs.34,026 crore have been awarded including 280 completed projects worth Rs.2,332 crore.  An advisory has been issued by the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation on 20th May 2019 to the States on water conservation and to meet the drinking water requirements of rural areas, on priority, during scarcity.A meeting of the State Ministers of Water Resources and Water Supply was held under the chairmanship of the Minister of Jal Shakti on 11th June 2019 in which comprehensive review of the activities taken up by the States for addressing the concerns arising out of the current situation were reviewed. Hon’ble Prime Minister has personally addressed a letter to all sarpanches in the country motivating them to take up water conservation activities like de-silting and cleaning of water bodies and rain water harvesting, etc. with people’s participation. Government have launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) on 01st July 2019. JSA is a time-bound, mission-mode water conservation campaign. The JSA aims at making water conservation a ‘Jan Andolan’  through asset creation and communication campaign. (c) & (d): A total of 5151 projects have been proposed by selected 100 Smart Cities in their Smart Cities Proposals at an estimated cost of Rs. 2,05,018 crores, which also includes proposals for Smart Water. As on 11thJuly 2019, 38 projects of Smart Water worth Rs.1,226 crore have been completed, work order have been issued for 129 projects worth Rs.10,492 crore and tenders have been issued in 43 projects worth Rs.4,620 crore.                  *****
