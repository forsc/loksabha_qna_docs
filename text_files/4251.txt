ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a)&(b): Under List-II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India, regulation of mines and mineral development is subject matter of State Government. Further different State Acts provide that the ownership of mines and minerals vest in the State Governments. However, Entry 54 of List-I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution provides that regulation of mines and mineral development can be taken over by the Central Government to the extent declared by the Parliament by law to be expedient in public interest. In terms of this provisions, the Parliament has made the statutes like the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act, 1957 and the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015. Thus Government of India has partial control over coal mines located in the country to the extent provided in the central statutes. As per information available with the Coal Controller’s Organisation, the details of the locations of coal mines in the country are as follows.STATE WISE LIST OF COAL MINES (PUBLIC AND PRIVATE) AS ON 31.03.2018 State	Public	Private	TotalArunachal Pradesh	1	0	1Assam	4	0	4Chhattisgarh	52	3	55Jharkhand	111	9	120Jammu & Kashmir	2	0	2Madhya Pradesh	58	3	61Maharashtra	56	2	58Odisha	25	1	26Uttar Pradesh	4	0	4Telangana	49	0	49West Bengal	71	1	72All India	433	19	452 (c): Coal produced in India are broadly categorized as coking and non-coking coal. Non-coking coal is classified into various grades based on GCV (Gross Calorific Value) starting from G1 to G17 grades and coking coal is classified as Steel Grade (ST) – I & II and Washery Grade (W) – I to VI.(d) (e) & (f): As per the provisions of the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, and the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulations) Act, 1957, coal mines are allocated to Private Companies by way of auction. Allocation under these Acts gives right to the private companies to obtain coal mining lease from the respective State Governments.  So far, no coal mine has been transferred from the Government to Private hands. ****
