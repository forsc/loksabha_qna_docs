                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) 	The objective of SAGY is holistic development of the identified Gram Panchayats by leveraging the leadership, capacity and commitment of the MPs .Under the SAGY framework, the development of Gram Panchayats is envisaged through effective convergence and implementation of existing development schemes of Government under the administrative control of respective Ministries without allocation of any additional fund. The Gram Panchayats adopted under SAGY prepare Village Development Plans (VDP) through a participatory process under the guidance of Hon’ble Members of Parliament. The VDP includes prioritised time-bound activities to achieve holistic and integrated development of the villages.Out of the 2,043 Gram Panchayats identified under SAGY, 1,571 Gram Panchayats have uploaded their VDPs containing 77,248 projects on SAGY website (http://saanjhi.gov.in) and implementation of 48,774  projects has been completed as on 3 March 2021. (b) 	The post-project evaluation of the Gram Panchayats identified under SAGY has been done by nine Universities across the country.  The major observations from the reports shared by the Universities are reproduced in Annexure-I. (c) 	The Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) is reviewed periodically by the Ministry of Rural Development. The Ministry has evolved a comprehensive multilevel and multi-tool system of monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of its programmes which includes review by the Minister of Rural Development, Performance Review Committee meetings, Common Review Mission and Concurrent Monitoring. Concurrent monitoring mechanisms include the progress updated by States/Districts through SAGY website (MIS) regarding the identification of the Gram Panchayats, progress tracking of Village Development Plans (VDPs), and the field visits by Ministry of Rural Development officials. The State Governments have been requested to appoint Charge Officers for every constituency to facilitate the adoption of Gram Panchayats by the Honorable Members of Parliament.Ministry has organised training programmes on the preparation of Village Development Plan through participatory planning in related areas of SAGY across India in collaboration with NIRD&PR, Hyderabad. The programme was attended by more than 350 State Team of Trainers, State Nodal Officers and Charge Officers from across the country in 2020-21.  (d) 	The Ministry has documented many success stories from SAGY Gram Panchayats based on inputs shared by the respective State Governments and made them available for public access on the programme website. The third-party evaluation of the Gram Panchayats identified under SAGY has indicated that the components covered under the scheme and the activities proposed were very much relevant in overall development of villages and it succeeded in improving the accessibility to basic amenities/institutions at Gram Panchayat and village levels. (e) 	No sir, the department has not received any requests for special provision for Aspirational Districts under the scheme so far.(f) 	The broad framework for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is provided under Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 and in  Schedule VII of the Act and Companies (CSR Policy) Rules, 2014. Schedule VII of the Companies Act, 2013 enlists areas or activities that may be undertaken by a company as CSR (as referred in Annexure-II). Item no. (x) of Schedule VII of the Act includes ‘Rural development projects’. Under the CSR provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder, the Board of the company is competent to take decision on supplementing any Government Schemes provided such schemes permit the corporate participation subject to compliance of the Act and rules made thereunder. So there are no earmarked funds of Corporate Social Responsibility towards the scheme. *******                                                                         Annexure-IAnnexure I referred in point (b) of reply to Lok Sabha  UnStarred Q.No. 2459 regarding ‘Implementation of SAGY’ scheduled for answer on 9 March 2021Observations from the reports of 9 Central Universities on the Post-project evaluation of SAGY Gram Panchayats 1.	General observationsa.	It was considered to be of immense privilege and pride for people for their GP being chosen under SAGY for adoption by the Hon’ble Member of Parliament. This has given them (the villagers) recognition in their vicinity. (Source: Report on post-project evaluation study of SAGY in Gujarat and Rajasthan by Sardar Patel University)b.	The community perception was influenced by the value added to the existing services that had been initiated after SAGY. For eg., the posting of a Doctor or a Staff Nurse to the Primary Health Centre in the village was in many places attributed to the selection of Gram Panchayat under SAGY. Similarly, the installation of a Transformer in the village that had improved the regular supply of power to the villages was attributed to the initiative. (Source: Report on post-project evaluation study of SAGY in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu by Mysore University)c.	The impact of SAGY is visible in those GPs where the stakeholders have taken interest and made frequent visits to the adopted GPs. (Source: Report on post-project evaluation study of SAGY in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala by Osmania University)2.	Overall progress made by the SAGY GPs after their adoptiona.	The progress made in each SAGY GP is unique while the degree of progress, drawbacks and achievements are also different. The chosen GPs show various degrees of progress in terms of various aspects. (Source: Report on post-project evaluation study of SAGY in Gujarat and Rajasthan by Sardar Patel University)b.	The components covered under the scheme and the activities proposed were very much relevant in overall development of villages. Further, the scheme has succeeded in improving the accessibility to basic amenities/institutions at Gram Panchayat and village levels. (Source: Report on post-project evaluation study of SAGY in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala by Osmania University)c.	Significant improvement in the health and hygienic practices among the villagers a reduction in anaemia and other health hazards. 100% immunisation of children below 6 years ages in all gram panchayats. Distribution of school uniforms among all the children in all GPs. The cases of school drop-outs have been zero in all the gram panchayats. The numbers of SHGs have increased significantly in all the gram panchayats. (Source: Report on post-project evaluation study of SAGY in Jharkhand by RKMVERI) 3.	Modalities of planning and impacta.	SAGY project has been a useful exercise in preparation of VDPs which have immense potential to enhance the quality of life of the people in the selected villages. Many GPs were found to have professionally prepared meticulous VDPs. Villagers were aware of the SAGY programme and various departments coordinated to bring about the activities listed under the Village Development Plan of SAGY. In Punjab, the VDPs in general were found to be comprehensive in terms of all heads including subheads related to all aspects of functional development of the GP. It was observed that a wide variety of works were undertaken under the VDPs. (Source: Report on post-project evaluation study of SAGY in Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab and Uttarakhand by Guru Nanak University)b.	The guidelines for SAGY has categorically and very minutely described the modalities for preparation of VDP. The VDPs were very meticulously prepared by the Panchayat itself or by young professionals in some of the GPs. (Source: Report on post-project evaluation study of SAGY in North-Eastern States by Tezpur University)4.	Inclusivity of progress and community participationa.	In most of the GPs it was found that efforts were made to improve participative decision making and involve people in the process of development. This improved social esteem and therefore would contribute to improvement in social values among the population as well. (Source: Report on post-project evaluation study of SAGY in Gujarat and Rajasthan by Sardar Patel University)b.	It is observed that in most of the GPs, VDP was prepared through discussions in Gram sabha and a democratic process was followed. (Source: Report on post-project evaluation study of SAGY in Gujarat and Rajasthan by Sardar Patel University)c.	The main reasons for an improved economic development and livelihood in best performing GPs are mainly due to the diversified occupations along with agriculture and the initiatives made to improve animal husbandry, horticulture and skill development training and starting up of microenterprises through SHGs. (Source: Report on post-project evaluation study of SAGY in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu by Mysore University)5.	Effect on upgrading social valuesa.	It could definitely be said by visiting the adopted villages that the scheme has created pride in the minds of the villages as the Hon’ble MP has selected their village as SAGY. Through focus group discussion with the prominent citizens of the village, it could be seen that there is an upgradation in social values by way of reduction of alcoholism, practice of playing cards/gambling etc. Villagers became very much cautious about the SAGY status of the village and in most of the cases; they have stopped behaving in any improper way that would lead to a bad name for the village. (Source: Report on post-project evaluation study of SAGY in North-Eastern States by Tezpur University)b.	The GPs have also taken measures for improving the quality of education in the schools and increasing enrolment and attendance. The participation and commitment of teachers and GP officials in this regard is highly commendable. (Source: Report on post-project evaluation study of SAGY in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu by Mysore University)c.	Broadly, social security indicators show a satisfied level amongst the respondents. (Source: Report on post-project evaluation study of SAGY in Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab and Uttarakhand States by Guru Nanak University)6.	 Sustainabilitya.	The SAGY GPs have shown mixed results in terms of the extent of its success, but is nevertheless a scheme worth continuing with and focus should be on efforts to transform GPs to self sustaining institutions. The spirit of SAGY goes beyond physical projects being completed. (Source: Report on post-project evaluation study of SAGY in Gujarat and Rajasthan by Sardar Patel University)b.	SAGY is a very well-conceived programme with robust guidelines. The development of the village is very scientifically designed with a bottom-up approach. The continuance of the programme is strongly recommended. However, it is to be noted that the leadership skill and dedication of the Hon’ble MP are keys to the success of the programme. (Source: Report on post-project evaluation study of SAGY in North-Eastern States by Tezpur University)                                                                          Annexure-IIAnnexure II referred in point (f) of reply to Lok Sabha  UnStarred Q.No. 2459 regarding ‘Implementation of SAGY’ scheduled for answer on 9 March 2021Schedule VII of the Companies Act, 2013Activities which may be included by companies in their Corporate Social Responsibility Policies Activities relating to:—(i) Eradicating hunger, poverty and malnutrition, promoting health care including preventive health care and sanitation and making available safe drinking water.
