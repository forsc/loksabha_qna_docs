ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PG & PENSIONS AND IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE(DR. JITENDRA SINGH):(a)	ISRO strives towards long term sustainability of the space environment by following all the UN guidelines for space debris mitigation as well as the guidelines of the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC), an international governmental forum for the worldwide coordination of activities related to the issues of man-made and natural debris in space. The guidelines include post-mission disposal of satellites and rocket bodies efficiently so that the space debris (space waste) produced by India does not stay in orbit. At the end of each mission, the space debris or the satellite/rocket at the end of its operational life is de-orbited quickly with a series of carefully planned maneuvers.(b)	Yes Sir. Due to the post-mission disposal activities carried out by ISRO, the only space debris (space waste) left after any mission is the final-stage rocket-body which is deorbited to a lower orbit to aid natural orbital decay due to atmospheric drag. The space debris later re-enters the Earth’s atmosphere naturally within 20 years and burns due to aerodynamic heating caused by air friction. ISRO has also initiated research and development activities on active debris removal to extract space debris from space.(c)	Does not arise.****
