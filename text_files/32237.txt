Initially the Scheme was available for exports effected from 1.03.2019 to 31.03.2020 and was later extended for the exports effected up to 31.03.2021.Further continuation of the Scheme, for the exports effected up to 31.12.2023, has been approved with some modifications to the scheme. 	Promotion of agricultural exports is a continuous process. Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) provides assistance to its registered exporters and other stakeholders under Market Development component of its scheme "Agriculture & Processed Foods Export Promotion Scheme” of APEDA. Under the scheme component, assistance is also provided for participation in buyer-seller meets, trade delegations, international trade fairs/exhibitions etc. Assistance is also provided for new product/ market development through conducting feasibility studies, trial shipments, and registration of brands abroad. Under this component, assistance upto 50% of the total cost subject to a ceiling of Rs. 10 lakhs per study per beneficiary is available. further, the assistance will be upto 75% of the total cost subject to a ceiling of Rs. 10 lakhs per study per beneficiary if conducted	by Trade Associations/ Indian missions   abroad/  Central / state Govt. agencies/ exporters  belonging to North - Eastern States, difficult areas namely Himalayan and land locked states, Island    Union Territories, SC/ST and women beneficiaries. For activities initiated by APEDA the funding shall be 100%. APEDA  also disseminates trade data and market intelligence to its registered exporters. Steps have also be taken to develop packaging standards and transport protocols for specific products/ markets. 	Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare is implementing Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) under which financial assistance is provided for various horticulture activities including post harvest management activities wherein subsidy is provided for the purchase of Refrigerated Transport vehicles through State Governments. The component is demand/ entrepreneur-driven from among entrepreneurs, private companies, cooperatives, farmers groups etc through commercial ventures for which assistance at the rate of 35% of admissible project cost in general areas and 50% in hilly and scheduled area is available as credit linked back ended subsidy. 	Government had also introduced Kisan Rail trains to enable speedy movement of perishables including fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, fishery and dairy products from production or surplus regions to consumption or deficient regions. Kisan Rail enables farmers to utilize the vast railway network to gain access to distant, bigger and more lucrative markets. Since the launch of first Kisan Rail service on 7th August, 2020 and upto 28th November, 2021, Indian Railways have operated approximately 1,642 Kisan Rail services. The State wise breakup of Kisan Rail trains is at Annexure-I. 	 Further, Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) has extended the 50% subsidy for transportation of any fruits  and   vegetables   through any type of train service provided by Indian Railways under Operation Greens- Tomato, Onion and Potato (TOP) to all notified fruits & vegetables (TOTAL) during 2020-21. 	Krishi UDAN Scheme was launched in August 2020, on international and national routes to assist farmers in transporting agricultural products so that it improves their value realisation. The scope of the Krishi Udaan Scheme was expanded by including more districts/airports across the country with an aim to extend benefit to the farmers. The Krishi UDAN is ongoing Scheme and agriculture products have been transported from the various destinations in the country. Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the incentives to the freighters and passenger to cargo flights carrying Agri- produce in the selected airports under Krishi UDAN 2.0. Krishi UDAN 2.0 primarily focuses on transporting perishable food products from the hilly areas, northeastern states and tribal areas. The scheme aims to ensure seamless, cost-effective, time-bound air transportation and associated logistics for all Agri-produce originating especially from Northeast, hilly and tribal regions of the country.
