State/UT-wise details are at Annexure I & II. The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare administers a Centrally Sponsored Scheme  for “Establishment of new medical colleges attached with existing district/referral hospitals” for establishment of medical college by upgrading the district hospitals in districts which do not have either a government or a private medical college. Under the scheme 157 new medical colleges approved in three phases. Funds to the tune of Rs.7541.1 crores, Rs. 3675 crores and Rs. 5519.11 crores have been released under Phase – I, II and III respectively. As informed by the State/UT governments, fund of Rs. 3238.09 Cr, Rs. 365.23 Cr. and Rs. 200 cr. have been utilized by them under Phase – I, II and III respectively. Out of 157, 47 medical colleges have become functional. (b): The norms for establishment of medical colleges have been specified under the Establishment of Medical College Regulations, 1999. The National Medical Commission(NMC) has also framed Minimum Requirement Regulations, 2020 which provide for minimum standards viz. requirement of land, infrastructure, faculty, residents, equipments for the medical colleges. The applicant medical college must fulfil these requirements in order to obtain permission from the NMC as mandated under the NMC Act, 2019. The permission is granted only after physical verification of the infrastructure, human resources and other facilities.(c):  During the last academic session 2020-21, no medical college has been derecognised.
