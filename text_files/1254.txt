ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; AND MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING(SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR):(a) to (c):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT AS REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (c) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.*112 FOR REPLY ON 28.06.2019(a) to (c): The Committee of Experts constituted under the Chairmanship of Shri Shyam Benegal submitted first part of its report in April, 2016 and final part in June, 2016. The report submitted by Committee of Experts was examined clause wise in the Ministry. The Committee of Experts has, inter-alia, recommended that there should be no system of imposing excisions, modifications and changes to the film and that the CBFC functions purely as a certification body. The Committee has recommended new categories of certification, viz. UA12+, UA15+ and AC (Adult with Caution) and suggested that the scope of CBFC should largely only be to decide what category of audiences can watch a particular film, unless the film violates provisions of Section 5B(2) of the Cinematograph Act, 1952 or exceed the limitations defined in the highest category of certification recommended by the Committee.Majority of the recommendations contained in the report require amendment in the Cinematograph Act and Rules. It was felt that implementation of the recommendations, especially those requiring important amendments in the Act/Rules, be done after further consultations.A Consultation meeting between the then Hon’ble Minister of Information and Broadcasting, Minister of Law and Justice, Minister of Finance and Minister of Human Resources Development was held on 16th March, 2017 to deliberate on the issue of repeal/amendment of the Cinematograph Act.  Another round of consultation in this regard by the then Hon’ble Minister with Hon’ble Chief Minister of Maharashtra and the representatives of Film Industries was held on 06.06.2017 at Mumbai. However, due to intricate complexities involved in the matter no decision has been taken by the Government.  ***
