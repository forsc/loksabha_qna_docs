ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTHAND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a)	& (b): ‘Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package (PMGKP): Insurance Scheme for Health Care Workers Fighting COVID-19’ was launched on 30.03.2020 to provide comprehensive personal accident cover of Rs. 50 Lakh to 22.12 lakh health care providers including community health workers and private health workers who may have been in direct contact and care of COVID-19 patients and may be at risk of being impacted by this. Further, on account of the unprecedented situation, private hospital staff/ retired/ volunteer/ local urban bodies/ contract/daily wage/ ad-hoc/ outsourced staff requisitioned by states/ central hospitals/ autonomous hospitals of central/ states/ UTs, AIIMS & Institute of National Importance (INI)s/ hospitals of Central Ministries specifically drafted for care of COVID-19 patients are also covered under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package: Insurance Scheme for Health Workers Fighting COVID-19 subject to fulfilment of the laid down conditions.The scheme is being implemented through an insurance policy from M/s New India Assurance Company Limited, a public sector insurance company under Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Finance. 1016 claims have been settled and paid as on 04/08/2021.  (c)	& (d): The implementation of the insurance scheme in the states/UTs is regularly reviewed in Ministry of Health & Family Welfare jointly with officers of Ministry of Finance. During these reviews it was noted that in some cases payment of claims was getting delayed on account of receipt of in-complete claim documents/delay in receipt of documents from States/UTs. As a result, it was decided to further streamline and simplify the process of settlement of claims so as to ensure expeditious payment to the claimants. With effect from 28/05/2021 a new system of claim settlement has been implemented as per which, claim papers are now being examined by District Collectors. On the basis of certificate furnished by District Collectors and counter signed by State Nodal Officer, the insurance company is mandated to make payment to the claimants within 48 hours.
