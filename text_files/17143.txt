Forest Survey of India, Dehradun, carries out the assessment of forest cover of the country biennially and the findings are published in India State of Forest Reports (ISFR). As per ISFR 2011, the total forest cover in the country was 6,92,027 square kilometre. Between ISFR-2011 and ISFR-2019, an increase of 20,222 square kilometre of forest cover has been observed. The State/UT-wise details of forest cover in 2011 and 2019 are given in Annexure.   (c) to (e)  As mentioned in part (a), the ratio between land under forest/open green (recreation) and other uses is prescribed in the URDPFI Guidelines, which is advisory in nature.
