                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) & (b):	As per the estimates of National Income released by Central Statistics Office (CSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), the growth rate of Gross Value Added (GVA) of agriculture & allied sectors for Quarter 4 of  2019-20 (January-March) and Quarter I of 2020-21 ( April – June) at constant (2011-12 ) prices are detailed below:           (in %)Year/ Quarter	Growth rate of  GVA of Agriculture & allied sectors at constant (2011-12) pricesQ4 (January to March) of 2019-20 	5.9Q4 (April – June) 2020-21 3.4    Source: CSO , MoSPIContd….2/-(c) & (d):	As per the fourth advance estimates, total production of foodgrains was 296.65 million tonnes in 2019-20 as compared to  285.21  million tonnes during the agriculture year 2018-19 (final estimates).	 Government of India is committed for the development of the agriculture sector and Ministry of Agriculture implements various schemes to increase production and productivity. Kharif sowing has also been high compared to last year because of the various steps taken by the Government of India. The Government had made efforts in procurement operations to facilitate the farmers in marketing the agriculture produce with better returns. This has facilitated the farmers for better investment in next crop production. The Government had purchased 203.68 lakh metric tonnes of Wheat, 83.08 lakh metric tonnes of Rice and 6.22 lakh metric tonnes of Pulses and Oilseeds during 2019-20. During the Rabi marketing season 2020-21, 342.60 lakh metric tonnes of wheat have been so far been procured. During COVID- 19 pandemic, the Government paid special attention on procurement of Rabi crops, which has largely benefitted the farmers. 	The trade policy has been amended from time to time for various agricultural commodities in response to domestic availability and price situation. As per the latest data available, during March-July 2020, value of exports of wheat has increased by about 9% over the same period last year, while exports of rice, spices and other major commodities have shown a downward trend. 	A “Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for phytosanitary inspection and certification activities in wake of COVID-19 situation” was prepared and circulated to facilitate the export and import of agricultural commodities. To promote the agricultural export, another NSPM 23 (Guidelines for Phytosanitary Service Agency and Phytosanitary Service Provider for Inspection of Plants/ Plant Products & other Regulated Articles in Export) on outsourcing of inspection were finalized in June 2020. (e):	Government maintains foodgrains stocking norms (buffer stock) of rice and wheat for the Central Pool. The Actual stock of foodgrains in the Central Pool as against the foodgrains stocking norms for Central Pool are as under-                                 									( in lakh  tons) AS ON	W H E A T	R I C E	T O T A L	Actual stock	Food-grains Stocking norms	Actual stock	Food-grains Stocking norms	Actual stock	Food-grains Stocking norms1.10.2019	393.16	205.20	249.16	102.50	642.32	307.701.01.2020	327.96	138.00	237.15	76.10	565.11	214.101.04.2020	247.00	74.60	322.39	135.80	569.39	210.401.07.2020	549.91	275.80	271.71	135.40	821.62	411.20 Source: Department of Food and Public Distribution   These norms are maintained for the Central Pool without any State-wise bifurcation. No allocation towards ‘buffer stock’ is made to any of the States. However, in order to ensure smooth supply of foodgrains, stocks are moved from surplus State to deficient States. The current stock position (State-wise) as on 01.09.2020 is at Annexure-I. Apart from this, balance stock of pulses procured under Price Support Scheme (PSS) and under Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) as on 10.09.2020 is at Annexure-II.
