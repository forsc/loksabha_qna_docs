The other steps/measures  taken to boost the growth of food processing sector in the country are: creation of a special fund of ? 2000 crores in National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) to provide affordable credit to food processing industries, classification of food & agro-based processing units and cold chain as agricultural activity for Priority Sector Lending (PSL); lower Goods & Services Tax (GST) rates for majority of food products, 100% exemption of income tax on profit for new food processing units, 100 percent income tax exemption from profit derived by FPOs having annual turnover of Rs.100 crore for activities such as post-harvest value addition to agriculture, concessional import duty for plant and machinery under project imports benefit scheme, import duty exemption on import of raw material under advance authorization scheme  etc. (c):	The Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution (Department of Consumer Affairs) has not considered removal of Essential Commodities Act, so far. The Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (DAC & FW) has no proposal to remove the Agricultural Produce Market Committee. However, in order to provide better marketing facilities to the farmers, the Government has released a new model "The Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2017" in April 2017 for its adoption by States/ UTs. The Provisions therein provide for better Marketing channels such as setting up of private markets, direct marketing, farmer-consumer markets, special commodity markets, to facilitate farmers in marketing their produce at competitive & remunerative prices. This will help in strengthening Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee in making them efficient.*****
