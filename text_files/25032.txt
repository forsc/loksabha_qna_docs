For prevention and control of industrial pollution, the Government has taken various steps like notification of industry specific emission and effluent standards under the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 and their enforcement through consent mechanism, regular monitoring, issuance of directions for  installation of online effluent and emission monitoring systems for continuous check on pollution levels, categorization of industries based on their pollution potential, issuance of various directions under Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, etc.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has identified 17 categories of highly polluting industries, and is carrying out inspection of these industries based on computer generated alerts from Online Continuous Effluent/ Emission Monitoring System (OCEMS) since 2016-17. Industries for inspection are selected on the basis of Short Message Service (SMS) alerts generated from the online monitoring systems.The State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) issue consent to establish/ consent to operate and authorization to the industries in the States. The SPCBs/PCCs also  monitor the compliance of industrial emissions/effluent discharges and other operational activities according to the prescribed standards. For strengthening monitoring mechanism and effective compliance through self-regulatory mechanism, CPCB has directed all 17 categories of highly polluting industries, GPIs of Ganga basin, CETPs, biomedical waste management facilities and common hazardous waste facilities to install Continuous Effluent/ Emission Monitoring Systems for constant vigil on pollution levels.There are total 4,354 highly polluting 17-categories of industries in the country. Out of which, 3,708 units are operational and 646 are self-closed. Out of 3,708 operational units, 3,386 units are complying with the prescribed environmental standards and 322 units are non-complying. Show-cause notices to 190 units and closure directions to 88 units were issued for non-compliances. Legal actions were initiated against 6 units State-wise status of 17 categories of highly polluting industries is Annexed  .  	Further, in compliance to NGT order non-compliances observed during compliance verification / inspection are subjected to environmental compensation with the provision of NGT Act 2010 by CPCB/SPCBs/ PCCs *****
