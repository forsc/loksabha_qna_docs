                                                        THE MINISTER OF NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND POWER (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) to (e) A Committee was constituted by NITI Aayog under the chairmanship of Secretary, MNRE with the mandate inter-alia to propose an action plan to evolve a circular economy in solar panel through reuse/recycling of the waste generated. The draft report of the Committee has been submitted to NITI Aayog.Solar Panels generally have a lifetime of 25 years. Considering that most of the solar power capacity in the country has been installed from 2010 onwards, significant quantum of solar panel waste is not expected to be generated until the year 2035.However, some panels may also fail before end of life due to various reasons. Data for waste generated as a result of such failures is not being maintained separately.*****
