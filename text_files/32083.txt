ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) to (e):	For the first time, the definition of ‘gig worker’ or ‘platform worker’ has been provided in the Code on Social Security, 2020.  The Government has launched e-Shram portal on 26.08.2021 which allows a person to register himself or herself on the portal on self-declaration basis.  As per e-Shram portal, the number of gig workers registered in the country including Maharashtra and Odisha as on 14.12.2021 is as under: Contd..2/-:: 2 ::Country/State	Male	Female	Transgender	TotalAll India	381,675	346,222	24	727,921Maharashtra	11995	6799	0	18794Odisha	27335	24781	7	52123The Code on Social Security, 2020 envisages social security benefits through formulation of schemes for gig and platform workers and can be implemented through Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) and Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) which hitherto provides social security benefits to organised sector workers.  It is provided in the social security code 2020 to set up social security fund and  one of the sources of fund, is contribution from aggregator between 1 to 2% of annual turnover of an aggregator subject to the limit of 5% of the amount paid or payable by an aggregator to such workers.  However, no scheme has been finalized as the provisions under the Code relating to gig and platform worker have not come into force. For the purposes of complaints, there is no definition of gig workers in the existing central labour laws. ********
