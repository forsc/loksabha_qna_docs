ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (SHRI PANKAJ CHAUDHARY)(a) & (b) Status of indebtedness in rural and urban households is estimated by the All-India Debt and Investment Surveys (AIDIS) conducted by the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO). Latest available data on the percentage of indebted households is as per the 77th round of NSSO (2018). State/UT wise details of indebtedness as per the last two rounds of AIDIS are given in Annexure 1. NSSO Round	Urban indebted households(%)	Rural indebted households(%)70th (2012)	22.4	31.477th (2018)	22.4	35.0(c) & (D) To address the problem of indebtedness, Government has taken various measures to improve financial inclusion in the country and improve the financial condition particularly of the vulnerable sections. Some of these measures include:i.	Government initiated the National Mission for Financial Inclusion (NMFI), namely, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) in August 2014 to provide universal banking services for every unbanked household. As on 24 November 2021, a total of 43.90 crore beneficiaries have benefited through PMJDY accounts. ii.	To provide credit to Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), MUDRA Scheme was launched by the Government with the aim of financing of small business enterprises in manufacturing, trading and service sectors. The scheme was launched on 8 April 2015. The loans were categorized into 3 categories to ensure that the credit reaches all kinds of borrowers: Shishu (up to Rs.50,000), Kishore (Rs.50,000 to Rs.5,00,000) and Tarun (Rs. 5,00,000 to Rs.10,00,000). Out  of the total disbursements so far, 87% of loan accounts under the scheme are in Shishu category indicating that the scheme has well targeted the small businesses. About  68% of these loans have been sanctioned to women entrepreneurs and 51% to Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe/Other Backward Classes category of borrowers.iii.	To provide credit support to Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and Women Entrepreneurs from the vulnerable section, Stand Up India scheme was launched in 2016. As on 22.11.2021, credit support of Rs.28211.19 crore have been sanctioned under the scheme.iv.	Under the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme, government provides interest subvention of 2% and Prompt Repayment Incentive of 3% to the farmers, thus making the credit available at a very subsidized rate of 4% per annum. Since February 2020, starting of the KCC Saturation Drive for the PM Kisan beneficiaries as a part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Package, over 2.6 crore farmers have been covered under the scheme, with a sanctioned credit of Rs.2.78 lakh crore.v.	Low-cost insurance schemes have also been launched to ensure that  indebtedness resulting from catastrophies may be avoided. Under Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) a renewable one-year accidental death-cum-disability cover of Rs.2 lakhs is offered to all subscribing bank account holders in the age group of 18 to 70 years for a premium as low as Rs.12/- per annum per subscriber. Another insurance product with one-year term life cover of Rs.2 lakhs under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) is made available to all subscribing bank account holders in the age group of 18 to 50 years for a premium of Rs.330/- per annum per subscriber.   vi.	To take care of financial needs in old age, a pension product named Atal Pension Yojana (APY) guaranteed by the Government of India has also been made available, thereby reducing the vulnerability of the old-aged people to indebtedness.(e) Question does not arise.
