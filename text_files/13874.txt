                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) India is committed to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030 as per Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under Paris Agreement. India is on track to meet this Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) target under Paris Agreement. The Forest Survey of India estimates carbon stock of forest by using National Forest Inventory data collected during forest inventory and forest cover area following the guidelines given by United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). As per India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2019, the total carbon stock in forest is estimated as 7,124.6 million tones. There is an increase of 42.6 million tonnes of carbon stock of the country as compared to the last assessment of 2017. The average annual increase of carbon stock is worked out to be around 21.3 million tonnes which is 78.1 million tones of CO2 equivalent.Further, to increase the forest cover in the country, Ministry has been taking several initiatives. These include ongoing Centrally Sponsored Schemes of the Ministry such as National Afforestation Programme, National Mission for a Green India and Development of Wildlife Habitats. Compensatory Afforestation Fund Rules, 2018 also contain provisions for taking up assisted natural regeneration, artificial regeneration and silvicultural operations in forests which contribute to increase in forest cover. Afforestation activities are also taken up by other Ministries under various programmes/funding sources such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana and under the schemes/plans of States and Union Territories (UTs).(b)& (c) Control and prevention of illicit felling in forest areas is primarily the responsibility of state   Governments/UT administrations who take appropriate action as per relevant provisions under Indian Forest Act, 1927, State Forest Acts and rules made thereunder.Tree felling is also taken up in the forest areas in which non-forestry activities are permitted under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. In the last three years (2016-17 to 2018-19), 76,72,337 number of trees have been stipulated for removal under different proposals approved under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and plantation of more than 7,87,00,000 trees have been stipulated under compensatory afforestation.(d) & (e)The State/UTs-wise details of funds released under Compensatory Afforestation Funds, Green India Mission and National Afforestation Programme for the last three years are given in Annexure-I, II and III respectively.****
