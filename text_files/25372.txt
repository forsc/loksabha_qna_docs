(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a): The procurement of pulses, oilseeds and copra at MSP under Price Support Scheme (PSS) are done by the central nodal agencies through State nominated agencies directly from the pre-registered farmers. For MSP procurement of wheat and paddy for central pool, Government is encouraging States for introduction of biometric authentication of farmers in order to eliminate middlemen. Accordingly, most of the State Governments have already developed their own Online Procurement System/Portal. All the payments to the farmers for their produce are made directly into their bank accounts by the concerned procuring agencies. (b) & (c): The State-wise details of procurement of MSP notified crops for Kharif Marketing Season (KMS) 2020-21 and Rabi Marketing Season (RMS) 2021are at Annexure A, B &C.
