(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change provides financial assistance to States/Union Territories under Centrally Sponsored Schemes of ‘Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats’, ‘Project Tiger’ and ‘Project Elephant’ for management of wildlife and its habitats in the country. The activities supported under the schemes inter alia include construction/erection of Physical barriers, such as barbed wire fence, solar powered electric fence, bio-fencing using cactus boundary walls etc. to prevent the entry of wild animals into crop fields. As regards quantum of loss, the Ministry has not received any information from the States.(c):	In order to control the menace of wild/stray animals the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is taking following steps:?	The Ministry has approved a project for undertaking ‘Immuno-contraceptive measures’ for controlling the population of wild animals responsible for damage and destruction of crops.Contd…2/--2-?	A network of Protected Areas namely, National Park, Sanctuaries, Conservation Reserves and Community Reserves covering important wildlife habitat have been created all over the country under the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 to conserve wild animals and their habitats.?	To mitigate wildlife conflict along the linear infrastructure like rail tracks, roads/highways and power transmission lines passing through the protected areas and other wildlife rich areas, Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife has recommended that all linear infrastructure development Agencies shall submit wild animals passage plan based on the WII Guideline “Eco-Friendly Measures to Mitigate impacts of linear infrastructure on Wildlife”. These guidelines suggest for modification in the design of the linear infrastructures by way of providing eco-friendly structure which will ensue safe movement of wildlife across these linear infrastructures.(d) & (e):	In the revised operational guidelines of the ‘Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana’ (PMFBY) from Rabi 2018-19, States have been given liberty to consider providing add-on coverage for crop loss due to attack by wild animals wherever the risk is perceived to be substantial and identifiable.*********
