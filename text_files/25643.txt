ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a& b) The concept of Agricultural Export Zones (AEZs) was introduced in 2001 to promote export of produce from contiguous areas and adoption of end to end approach for integration of activities across the entire supply chain. 60 AEZs were notified by the Government having a time span of 5 years from the date of notification. Details may be seen at Annexure-I. Based on the recommendations of a peer group review in 2005, it was decided not to consider approval of any new AEZ unless there are strong compelling reasons. No new AEZ has been notified by the Govt. after 2005 and all the notified AEZs have completed their intended time span of 5 years.(c& d) At present there are no AEZs in existence. However, the Agriculture Export Policy (AEP), brought out by the Government in 2018 aims at promoting agriculture exports at state and district levels. The Government has introduced several schemes such as the One-District One-Product (ODOP) of the Ministry of Food Processing Industries; cluster development under the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare; and the District as Export Hub Scheme of the Department of Commerce, which aim at providing support for infrastructure and logistical needs for quality production and export of agriculture and processed food products at district levels.********* ANNEXURE-ILIST OF NOTIFIED  60 AGRI EXPORT ZONES IN 20 STATESState	S No	AEZ Project	DistrictsAssam (1)	01	Fresh & Processed Ginger	Kamrup, Nalbari, Barpeta, Darrang, Nagaon, Morigaon, KarbiAnglong and North Cachar districts.Andhra Pradesh including Telangana (5) 	02	Mango Pulp & Fresh Veg.
