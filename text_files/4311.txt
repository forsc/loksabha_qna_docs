ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (e) :	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) TO (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3997 BY SHRI ACHYUTANANDA SAMANTA TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 17.07.2019 REGARDING KHURDA-BOLANGIR  RAILWAY  PROJECT.(a) & (b):  Khurda Road-Bolangir New Line was sanctioned in 1994-95.  The total length of the project is 289 Km.   and the sanctioned cost of the project is `3798.80 crore.  So far Khurda Road-Nayagarh Town (65.38 Km) and Bolangir-Bhainsapalli (14.58 km) sections of the project have been completed and commissioned.   The expenditure incurred upto March 2019 is `1057.25 crore and an outlay of `350 crore has been given during  2019-20.  The work of balance land acquisition has been taken up and construction work has also been taken up wherever land is available.The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, cooperation and zeal of State Government for early completion of project, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions  of working agencies/contractors etc.  All these factors affect the completion cost and time of the project.   Since complete land including forest clearances has not been handed over to Railway, no confirmed time-frame can be given for completion of project at this stage.In the overall interest of the nation and to ensure that projects are completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various level (field level, divisional level, zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues obstructing the progress of projects.To ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects.        (c) & (d):  At present there is no proposal to extend the track by another  99 Kms. (e):   At present, there is no proposal to introduce any special or express train for Kolkata and Visakhapatnam through Balangir-Khurda Road section.  However, presently on the commissioned portions of the section viz. Khurda-Narayangarh Town and Balangir-Bhichhupali section, 2 pairs of passenger train services each are being operated.*****
