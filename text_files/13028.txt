ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d): The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA), 2005 is a demand driven wage employment programme.  Hence, no  allocation is made State/UT-wise. Fund release to the States/UTs is a continuous and dynamic process and Central Government is committed to making funds available keeping in view the demand for work. The Ministry releases funds to the States periodically in two tranches with each tranche consisting of one or more installments based on agreed to Labour Budget (Persondays), opening balance with the State, pace of utilization of funds, pending liabilities of the previous year, if any, overall performance and submission of requisite documents by the State.The Ministry seeks additional fund for implementation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS from the Ministry of Finance as and when required for meeting the demand for work on the ground. The States/UTs-wise release of funds by the Central Government under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) during the last three financial years is given at Annexure.(e): At present, there is no proposal to provide additional working days over and above the guaranteed 100 days as provided in the Act. However, an additional 50 days of wage employment is provided over and above 100 days in the notified drought affected areas or natural calamity areas in the country on recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare. Annexure referred in reply to parts (a)to(d) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.1944 dated 03.03.2020
