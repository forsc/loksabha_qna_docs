ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) to (c)   Rivers in the country are polluted mainly due to discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage from cities/towns and industrial effluents in their respective catchments, problems in operation and maintenance of sewage/effluent treatment plants, lack of dilution and other non-point sources of pollution.It is the responsibility of States/Union Territories (UTs) and local bodies to ensure required treatment of sewage and industrial effluent, before discharging into recipient water bodies or land for prevention and control of pollution therein. This Ministry, through the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP), has been supplementing efforts of the States/UTs by providing financial and technical assistance in abatement of pollution in identified stretches of rivers excluding river Ganga and its tributaries, on cost sharing basis.Under NRCP, pollution abatement schemes for conservation of five rivers in Maharashtra namely Krishna, Panchganga, Godavari, Tapi and Mula Mutha, were sanctioned at a total cost of Rs.1182.86 crores. With the implementation of these schemes, sewage treatment capacity of 260 million litres per day has been created so far in the towns of Karad, Sangli, Kolhapur, Nanded, Nashik, Triambakeshwar and Prakasha.Proposals for pollution abatement works in the towns along polluted river stretches are received from the States/UTs from time to time for consideration under the NRCP, and sanctioned based on their prioritization, conformity with NRCP guidelines, availability of Plan funds, etc.*****
