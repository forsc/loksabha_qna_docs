In order to enhance professional skills and to update their medical knowledge, such CMEs must be attended by medical practitioners for at least 30 hours every 5 years, organized by reputed professional academic bodies or any other authorized organizations. Further, no such data is maintained centrally with regard to the medical practitioners who have not submitted information about their participation in professional meetings as a part of CME.………………………..
