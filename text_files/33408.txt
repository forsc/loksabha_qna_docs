ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) The Government of India has articulated and put across the concerns of developing countries at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Glasgow, United Kingdom. As a part of its overall approach, India emphasized the foundational principles of equity, and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and called for climate justice in global climate action. It also highlighted that all countries should have equitable access to the global carbon budget, a finite global resource, for keeping temperature increase within the limits set by the Paris Agreement. All countries must stay within their fair share of this global carbon budget while using it responsibly. India  alsocalled  on the developed countries to undertake rapid reductions in emissions during the current decade so as to reach net-zero much earlier than their announced dates, as they have used more than their fair share of the depleting global carbon budget.India also highlighted that the transfer of climate finance and low-cost climate technologies have become more important for the implementation of climate actions by the developing countries. The ambition on climate finance on the part of developed countries cannot remain same as it was at the time of the Paris Agreement in 2015. It was also emphasized that just as the UNFCCC tracks the progress made in climate mitigation, it should also track climate finance. Further, India presented the following five nectar elements (Panchamrit) of India’s climate action: (i)	Reach 500GW non-fossil energy capacity by 2030.(ii)	50 per cent of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030.(iii)	Reduction of total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes from now to 2030.(iv)	Reduction of the carbon intensity of the economy by 45 per cent by 2030, over 2005 levels.(v)	Achieving the target of net zero emissions by 2070.The major decisions at COP26, as reflected in the ‘Glasgow Climate Pact’, pertain to mitigation, adaptation and finance required for meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement.(b) All decisions at the annual Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC are arrived at by consensus and hence the question of India being directed to undertake any action by such decisions does not arise. India, for its part, abides by commitments to the UNFCCC in letter and spirit. India with more than 17% of the global population has contributed only about 4.37% of the global cumulative greenhouse gas emissions between 1850 and 2019. Even though we are not part of the problem, India is committed to being part  the solution and has done far more than its fair share. The Government stands committed to combating climate change through its several programs and schemes.India’s commitment to emission intensity reduction of the economy isan economy-wide target and not specific to any sectors including transport and Land Use, Land Use Change,and Forestry (LULUCF) sectors. The Government is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC),which is the overarching policy framework and comprises of national missions in specificareas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan eco-system,sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. Further, 33States/Union Territories have prepared State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs)consistent with the objectives of NAPCC.(c) The total expenditure required for dealing with environmental issues as well as the allocation thereof are determined according to the extant norms and procedures followed by the Government for budgeting and financial allocation. (d)and (e) India announced that by 2030 it would reduce one billion tonne from its projected cumulative emissions. It is estimated that such reductions will result from a variety of mitigation efforts undertaken in different sectors of the economy including, LULUCF. Many  such efforts are underway and include, inter-alia initiatives to accelerate the renewable energy transition, decarbonisation of transport and adoption of electric mobility,etc. The government has announced the launch of the National Hydrogen Mission with the goal to make India a global hub for Green Hydrogen production and export. The Government, under the Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme, notified production linked incentive scheme for manufacturing advanced chemistry cells and for automobiles &auto components. India has leapfrogged from Bharat Stage-IV (BS-IV) to Bharat Stage-VI (BS-VI) emission norms by April 1, 2020, which was earlier to be adopted by 2024. India’s current share of non-fossil sources based installed capacity of electricity generation is more than 40%. Under Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All (UJALA) scheme, a total of 36.79 croresLED bulbs have been distributed to enhance energy efficiency as on date. India has announced a voluntary vehicle scrapping policy to phase out old and unfit vehicles, which will help in encouraging fuel-efficient and environment-friendly vehicles. Indian Railways has taken a number of initiatives including setting up Dedicated Freight Corridors, further railway electrification, improving energy efficiency in traction, and increasing the share of renewable energy. Indian Railways has set a target of making itself ‘net zero’ by 2030. The effects of all such intiatives will enable us to meet the pledge of one billion tonne reduction from projected cumulative emissions by 2030.*****
