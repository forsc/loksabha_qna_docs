                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b) : The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has released a Report titled “Food Wastage Index Report 2021” in the month of March, 2021. As per this report, household food waste estimate in India is 50 Kg/ capita/year which is less than that in many developed countries. (c) to (f) : 	To reduce food wastage in government offices, canteens, food outlets, etc,. Government has carried out publicity campaigns through print and electronic media from time to time to sensitize people against food wastage. In addition, States/UTs were advised by the Central Government to include a chapter on prevention of food wastage in the school syllabi in order to inculcate awareness among young students and sensitize them on the subject.  Further, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has launched a social initiative known as “Sava Food Share Food” to help promote donation of surplus food and reduce food waste by integrating various food distribution agencies and other stakeholders. FSSAI has also notified Food Safety and Standards (Recovery and Distribution of Surplus Food) Regulations, 2019 which specify the responsibilities of food donors and surplus food distribution organizations so that the donated food remains safe for human consumption. *****
