ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR HEAVY INDUSTRIES(SHRI KRISHAN PAL GURJAR)(a) to (c):	No, Sir. At present, there is no proposal in Ministry to set up facilities for making lithium-ion batteries by the Government in India including Andhra Pradesh. Further, the Government on 12th May, 2021 approved a Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for manufacturing of Advance Chemistry Cell (ACC) in the country.  The total outlay of the scheme is Rs. 18,100 Crore for a period of 5 years.  The scheme envisages to establish a competitive ACC battery manufacturing set up in the country (50 GWh).  Additionally, 5GWh of niche ACC technologies is also covered under the Scheme.  The scheme proposes a production linked subsidy based on applicable subsidy per KWh and percentage of value addition achieved on actual sales made by the manufacturers who set up production units.  This scheme will facilitate reduction of import dependence of ACC battery.  Recently, the Ministry of Heavy Industries, on 22nd October, 2021, has issued request for proposal inviting proposals from domestic and international manufacturers for setting up manufacturing facilities for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) battery storage in India. The last date of submission of proposals under this scheme is 31st December, 2021.*****
