                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY) (a)	In order to improve the functioning of the police, the Union Government has set up various Commissions/Committees.  National Police Commission was constituted on 15.11.1977. The Commission submitted its 1st report on 07.02.1979 and 8th and last report on May, 1981. Ribeiro Committee was constituted on 25.05.1998. The Committee submitted its 1st report on 28.10.1998 and 2nd and last report on 18.03.1999. Padmanabhaiah Committee was   constituted  on  05.01.2000.   The   Committee   submitted   its   report  --2--L.S.Q.NO. 4396 FOR 23.03.2021on 30.08.2000. Malimath Committeeon Criminal Justice was constituted on 24.11.2000. The Committee submitted its report on 28.03.2003. Further, the Government constituted a Review Committee headed by Shri R.S. Mooshahary to review the recommendations of the previous Commissions and Committees on Police Reforms on 21.12.2004. The Committee submitted its report on 23.03.2005. The Committee shortlisted 49 recommendations.   The status of implementation of the recommendations is at Annexure.(b) to (d) The recommendations of the Review Committee have been sent to State Governments and Union Territory Administrations for taking appropriate action as “Police” is a State subject falling in List-II (State List) of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. Police reforms are ongoing process and it is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments/UT Administrations to implement police reform measures to make the police force efficient & capable and its functioning more effective, transparent and accountable. Ministry of Home Affairs included a component of “incentives for police reforms” in the implementation structure of the scheme of “Assistance to States   for   Modernisation   of  Police”.   It   has   been   decided  to   keep  a --3--L.S.Q.NO. 4396 FOR 23.03.2021certain amount each year for providing incentive/grants to State Governments for implementation   of  Police  Reforms.   To   incentivize  the implementation of police reforms as recommended by the various committees, originally a provision of keeping up to 10% of the total annual allocation of the scheme was made.  This incentive component has been increased to ‘up to 20%’ of the total allocation from the year 2019-20.Ministry of Home Affairs has also introduced a system for ranking of Police stations since 2018. It is a two stage process where 3 Police Stations from States having more than 750 police stations, 2 each from all other States and Delhi and 1 each from Union Territories are selected from more than 16,000 Police Stations in the country on the basis of rate of conviction in cases of crimes against women, crimes against SCs/STs, property offences and missing persons, unidentified found persons & unidentified dead bodies. In the second stage, performance measurement is done based on parameters like crime prevention and proactive measures, disposal of cases, maintenance of public order, infrastructure assessment and citizens feedback. Personal visits are made by the surveying team to the selected police stations for this purpose.--4--L.S.Q.NO. 4396 FOR 23.03.2021The guidelines provide for awarding two sets of awards i.e. one for the top 3 best police stations in the country and another for the best police station in each State/Union Territory. In the last DsGP/IsGP Conference held on virtual mode in December 2020, the best 3 police stations in the country were awarded Shields. Certificates have been provided to the top police stations of the State/UT.  This initiative has worked as a demonstration effect for Police Stations in the country to raise their standard of performance.******
