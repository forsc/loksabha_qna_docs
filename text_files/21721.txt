                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE; MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MINISTER OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN) ????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????, ??????? ?? ???????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ??????? ????????. ???? ?????(a)     The Government is implementing “Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE)” to attract, motivate, nurture and train talented and meritorious students to study science subjects and opt for careers in Research and Development (R&D) to build a pipeline of quality manpower, thereby widening the R&D manpower base of the country. During the Current year, 22,166 students received INSPIRE Scholarships for Higher Education (SHE) to pursue B.Sc. and M.Sc. courses in Basic and Natural Sciences. The University- wise list is in Annexure. SHE scheme is implemented online and is Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) Compliant scheme.(b)     There has been no delay in the release of INSPIRE scholarships to the students as they receive the scholarship within 60 days from the date of uploading of requisite documents viz. Utilization Certificate, Statement of Expenditure and Progress Report. (c)     Yes, Sir. The Government is taking concrete steps for distribution of all the national fellowships on time. The National Fellowship Schemes namely, Department of Science and Technology (DST)-INSPIRE Fellowship; DST- INSPIRE Faculty Fellowship; Department of Biotechnology (DBT) Junior Research Fellowship (JRF); Department of Biotechnology(DBT) Research Associateship (RA) and National Eligibility Test For Junior Research Fellowship (NET JRF Fellowship); National Fellowship for OBC Students; National Fellowship for SC Students; Maulana Azad National Fellowship for Minority Students schemes of University Grant Commission (UGC) are implemented online and are Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) compliant schemes. Science and Engineering Research Board(SERB), a statutory body of the Department of Science and Technology (DST) has been implementing a National Postdoctoral Fellowship (NPDF) Scheme. The research grant, including fellowship for a year is released as a lump-sum in advance to the respective host institutions so that systematic distribution of fellowship is ensured every month. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) releases fellowship amount in Direct benefit Transfer (DBT) mode to its research fellows upon receipt of the duly signed grant - in- aid fellowship claim bill from the host institutes along with the attendance certificate in respect of the research fellows. Online implementation of these schemes has ensured the release of Fellowships on time. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) also releases Fellowships to Agricultural Universities in advance so that systematic distribution of fellowship, through host Agricultural Universities, to the scheme beneficiaries is ensured every month. (d)     Fellowships under the DST-INSPIRE Fellowship; DST- INSPIRE Faculty Fellowship; Department of Biotechnology (DBT) Junior Research Fellowship (JRF); Department of Biotechnology (DBT) Research Associateship (RA) schemes have been released annually through Public Financial Management System (PFMS) Portal to host institutes/Universities where the fellows are working for PhD and Post-Doctoral training and the institute/Universities in-turn disburse the fellowships on monthly basis based on the attendance and progress of the Fellows/Researchers. Fellowship under the National Eligibility Test For Junior Research Fellowship (NETJRF Fellowship); National Fellowship for OBC Students; National Fellowship for SC Students; Maulana Azad National Fellowship for Minority Students schemes of University Grants Commission (UGC), is being paid on monthly basis after receipt of updated confirmation from the host institutions. Necessary provisions and systems are put in place by the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) to ensure timely disbursement of fellowship to the beneficiaries of National Postdoctoral Fellowship (NPDF) scheme. This includes release of research grant including fellowship in lump sum for a year in advance so that systematic distribution of fellowship is ensured every month through the host institution. The CSIR releases the fellowships through in-house portal on Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode.
