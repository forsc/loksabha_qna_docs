THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)  Currently only Emigration Check Required (ECR) passport holders seeking employment to UAE and other ECR countries (18 in total) need to compulsorily obtain clearance for the same through the eMigrate portal. Hence their cases automatically get registered in the system. In case of Emigration Check Not Required (ECNR) passport holders going for employment, such clearance is not mandatory. They can voluntarily register at present in the eMigrate.(c ) & (d)	Does not arise.(e)	The Government, through the media campaign “Surakshit Jao Prashikshit Jao” in All India Radio, Doordarshan, National Film Development Corporation, Lok Sabha TV, Rajya Sabha TV and State Government TV in Hindi and regional languages, conducts awareness campaigns on safe and legal migration, and to make the people aware of the precautions to take while emigrating abroad. Hoardings in Hindi and regional languages have been installed in the  offices of Regional Passport Offices (RPOs) and Protector of Emigrants (PoEs) Offices for educating the people on safe and legal migration.***
