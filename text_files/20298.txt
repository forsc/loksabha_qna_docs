ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING (RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a)   As per data received from 481 constituencies  of Lok Sabha and 169 Nodal Districts  of Rajya Sabha, in respect of ex and incumbent Members of Parliament by the Ministry during November - December 2020, the funds available in the accounts of Nodal Districts is Rs. 1619.42 crore. (b) The funds available in the accounts of Nodal Districts in respect of the States of Rajasthan and Maharashtra based on the above assessment is at annexure.   (c) Yes Sir. (d)   There is difference between the data of funds available in the accounts of Nodal Districts as per MPLADS web portal and the data collected by the Ministry directly through Nodal Districts / State Authorities, which is provisional in nature and it is due to delayed updation of data by Nodal Districts on web portal. This provisional difference is reconciled as and when Nodal Districts update the data on web portal. Further, in terms of Para 4.18 of the MPLADS Guidelines incorporated vide the Ministry’s Circular dated 03.01.2018, all District Authorities and Implementing Agencies have to mandatorily carry out expenditure under MPLAD Scheme using Expenditure, Advance and Transfer (EAT) module of Public Financial Management System (PFMS). Ministry has been pursuing for implementation of PFMS- EAT module and timely updation of data on the web portal with the nodal districts, so that there may not be likelihood of any difference in the details of the funds available in the district and PFMS report. (e) Yes Sir. (f)  The Government has issued instructions to Nodal District Authorities for settlement and closure of Savings Bank accounts of Members of Parliament which are not yet closed even after elapse of stipulated time period of 21 months from the date of demitting office; and transfer / re-distribution of uncommitted balance to incumbent Members of Parliament, so that uncommitted balance can be used by the respective constituencies / states where funds are required, as per MPLADS guidelines.                                              *****
