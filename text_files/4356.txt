ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a)	& (b) Railway have presently 483 over saturated sections out of 1245 sections. Over saturation of line capacity has resulted in stiff competition from other transport modes in maintaining the freight and passenger modal share. Hence, speedy execution of capacity enhancement works and availability of commensurate financial resources are one of a few main challenges before Indian Railways, which cater to length & breadth of this fast developing country.(c) Yes, Sir. Many remote hilly regions have remained devoid of railway connectivity. A number of network expansion projects, even though unremunerative, have been taken up by Railways to provide connectivity to such areas. There are 31 New Line, Gauge Conversion, Doubling etc. ongoing projects for hilly areas in India which are under different stages of planning/approval/execution.(d) No, Sir.(e) & (f) Do not arise.  *****
