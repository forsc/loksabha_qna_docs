                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)      Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is a demand driven wage employment scheme with bottom up planning. The works are identified, approved and prioritized out of shelf of work by the Gram Panchayat, recommended by Gram Sabha in each State/UT as per the provision of the Act. Accordingly, the works are approved and taken up by Panchayat or other implementing agencies as per the demand. The planning of works is done as per the estimated person days to be generated for the work in a financial year at the time of assessment of Labour Budget (LB). The details of category-wise completed and ongoing works  along with expenditure under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS in the State of Uttar Pradesh  in the current financial year 2021-22 (as on 26.11.2021) is given at Annexure. (b) to (d)   The responsibility of implementation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGA is vested with the Government of States/UTs. The Ministry has a comprehensive system of monitoring and review mechanism for Mahatma Gandhi NREGS. Some of the important elements of the above framework are listed below:(i). The Ministry regularly reviews the performance of the implementation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS in States/UTs through various fora viz., Mid-Term Review, Labour Budget meetings, Labour Budget Revision meetings, Programme Review meetings. Central Employment Guarantee Council and State Employment Guarantee Councils periodically monitor implementation of the programme.(ii). National Level Monitors, Common Review Missions and Officers of the Ministry visit States/UTs at regular interval to review implementation of the programme. After the field visits, the findings/shortcomings and recommendations are shared with the States/UTs for appropriate action at their end.(iii). Auditing Standards for Social Audit have been issued and States/UTs have been advised to establish independent Social Audit Units, conduct Social Audit as per Audit of Scheme Rules, 2011 and training of village resource persons for conducting Social Audit etc. Internal Audit Teams of the Department also conduct regular audit.(iv). Steps have been taken to strengthen transparency and accountability which include geo-tagging of assets, Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), National electronic Fund Management System (NeFMS), Aadhar Based Payment System (ABPS), Software for Estimate Calculation using rural rates for Employment (SECURE) and appointment of Ombudsperson in every district of States/UTs. (v).  Steps have been taken for establishment of State Technical Cell at various level fo qualitative monitoring and supervision of works under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS.(vi). In order to ensure higher level of monitoring and oversight, National Mobile Monitoring System and Area Officer App have been introduced. In the former, attendance of workers on a particular work, where more than 20 workers are employed is taken daily along with a geo-tagged & time stamped photograph of theirs. The latter has been designed to ensure that field officials do conduct inspections in the requisite numbers and look into all the relevant aspects of the scheme. (vii). In addition Central and State Employment Guarantee Councils, District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committees (DISHA) as also PRIs do also take up the monitoring and oversight of the Programme.  *****
