                                                                      THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE   MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                             (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a):	Yes Sir. Progress of implementation of Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT)  in the State of Kerala is periodically reviewed and monitored through regular video conferences, webinars, workshops etc. by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. There is a dedicated AMRUT web portal for tracking the implementation of AMRUTprojects in the States/Union Territories (UTs) including Kerala. States/UTs are required to update data on the portal on regular basis. National Mission Directorate is also providing handholding support to the States/UTs and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) from time to time to resolve issues and eliminate bottlenecks for timely completion of projects. For assessment and monitoring of work done in the States, dedicated Independent Review and Monitoring Agencies (IRMAs) have been appointed for each State/UT. M/s WAPCOS Limited has been appointed as IRMA for the State of Kerala.  The release of funds to States  are based on the satisfactory report of IRMAs.     Against the State Annual Action Plan size of Rs. 2,359 crore approved for the State of Kerala for the entire Mission Period, works worth Rs.2,032 crore have been grounded including completed works worth Rs.570 crore. Projects worth Rs.176 crore are under tendering.(b) and (c):There is no proposal to extend AMRUT in more cities or municipalities than the 500 cities /towns, where the scheme is already being implemented.                                             *****
