In order to provide enhanced user safety as also accountability of social media platforms, Government has released the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 under the Act. These Rules require that the intermediaries follow certain due diligence as prescribed. The intermediaries are required to publish privacy policy, rules and regulations and terms and conditions.  They are also expected to remove any unlawful content as and when brought to their knowledge either through a court order or through a notice by appropriate government or its agency.Further, section 69A of the IT Act, 2000 empowers Government to block any information generated, transmitted, received, stored or hosted in any computer resource in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above. Government takes action on social media accounts and specific information within the scope of section 69A of the Act, following the process defined in the Rules notified under this section.Further, ''Police'' and ''Public Order'' are State subjects as per the Constitution of India and States are primarily responsible for prevention, detection and investigation through their law enforcement machinery. The Law Enforcement Agencies take legal action against the cyber-crime offenders as per the provisions of applicable laws.******
