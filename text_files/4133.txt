                                                         MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) to (d): 		Public Distribution System (PDS) is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and State/UT Governments. Central Govt. is responsible for procurement, allocation and transportation of foodgrains upto the designated depots of the FCI. The operational responsibilities for allocation and distribution of foodgrains within the States/UTs, identification of eligible beneficiaries/families, issuance of ration cards to them and supervision and monitoring of functioning of Fair Price Shops (FPSs) rest with the concerned State/UT Government. Instructions have been issued to State/UTs and Food Corporation of India (FCI) to ensure supply of good quality foodgrains under PDS. Therefore, as and when complaints are received by the Government from individuals and organizations as well as through press reports, they are sent to State/UT Governments concerned for inquiry and appropriate action. A statement indicating State-wise number of complaints on TPDS received in the department from 2016 to 2018 is at Annexure..........2/--2-	An offence committed in violation of the provisions of TPDS (C) Order, 2015 is liable for penal action under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Thus, the Order empower State/UT Governments to take punitive action in case of contravention of relevant provisions of these Orders.  	Streamlining and upgradation of Targeted Public Distribution System [TPDS] is a continuous process. Department of Food & Public Distribution  is implementing a Scheme on ‘End-to-End Computerisation of TPDS Operations’ on cost sharing basis with the States/UTs. The Scheme consists of activities namely, digitization of ration cards/beneficiary and other databases, computerisation of supply-chain management, setting up of transparency portals and grievance redressal mechanisms and installation of ePoS devices at Fair Price Shops.	As per provisions of the notification issued vide SO No. 371[E] dated 8/2/17 [as amended from time to time], by the Department of  Food & Public Distribution,  Government of India, all the eligible beneficiaries entitled to receive subsidised foodgrains or Cash Transfer of Food Subsidy under National Food Security Act [NFSA] 2013 who do not possess Aadhaar number or,  are not yet enrolled for Aadhaar, but are desirous of availing subsidised food grains or Cash Transfer of Food Subsidies under NFSA, are required to make application for Aadhaar enrolment by 30/09/2019. The notification provides that till the Aadhaar is assigned to beneficiaries/households, benefit of subsidized food grains or Cash Transfer for Food grains under NFSA shall be given to such beneficiaries/households subject to the production of Ration Card, and either Aadhaar Enrolment ID Slip, or copy of his/her request made to State Government for Aadhaar Enrolment along with any of the 8 documents listed in the said notification (i.e. Voter ID Card, PAN Card, Passport, Driving License, Certificate of Identity with photo issued by Gazetted Officer/Tehsildar on official letter head, Address card having Name and Photo issued by Department of Posts,  Kisan Photo Passbook and any other document as specified by State/UT Governments). Seeding of Aadhaar number with ration cards and biometric authentication helps in tackling leakages and diversion.The National Food Security Act (NFSA) covers 75% of population in the rural areas and 50% in the urban areas and thereby covering 2/3rd population in the entire country.***ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (d) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.3811 DUE FOR ANSWERED ON 16.07.2019 IN THE LOK SABHA.STATEMENT:   COMPLAINTS ON TPDS RECEIVED  IN THE DEPARTMENT FROM INDIVIDUALS, ORGANISATIONS & THROUGH MEDIA REPORTS ETC FROM 2016 TO 2018  S.
