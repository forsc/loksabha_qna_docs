                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ?????? 		(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (e) : The admissible claims under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) are generally paid by the concerned insurance companies within two months of completion of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs)/harvesting period and one month of notification for invoking the risks/perils of prevented sowing, mid-season adversity and post harvest losses subject to receipt of total share of premium subsidy from concerned Government within time. However, settlement of few claims in some States including Odisha got delayed due to reasons like delayed transmission of yield data; late release of their share in premium subsidy, yield related disputes between insurance companies and States, non-receipt of account details of some farmers for transfer of claims to the bank account of eligible farmers and National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) related issues, erroneous/incomplete entry of individual farmers data on National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP), delay in remittance of farmers share of premium/non-remittance of farmers share of premium to concerned insurance company etc.   This Department is regularly monitoring the implementation of PMFBY including timely settlement of claims through weekly video conference of stakeholders, one to one meetings with insurance companies/States etc.  Further, penalty provisions for late settlement of claims by insurance companies and late release of funds by State Governments have also been stipulated under the revised/revamped operational guidelines of the scheme.  Insurance companies have to pay penal interest @12% per annum to the farmers for the period beyond the stipulated period in the PMFBY Guidelines from the date of receipt of final yield data from the State Government and completion of crop damage survey.Further, this Department is regularly reviewing the schemes in consultation with State Governments and other stakeholders to streamline the process for early settlement of claims and to provide timely and adequate benefits to the eligible farmers under the scheme.State-wise details of pending claims including Odisha, for the years 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 are annexed.
