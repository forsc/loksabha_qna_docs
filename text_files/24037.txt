ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): Ministry of Civil Aviation launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21-10-2016 to stimulate regional air connectivity and making air travel affordable to the masses. The primary objective of RCS is to facilitate / stimulate regional air connectivity by connecting unserved/underserved airports/heliports/water aerodromes. ;However, UDAN is a market driven mechanism. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN from time to time. ;325 RCS routes have already operationalized connecting 49 RCS airports, 2 water aerodromes & 5 heliports so far.  Airports Authority of India (AAI), the implementing agency, has identified four airports, namely, Bokaro, Dumka, Jamshedpur and Hazaribagh in the state of Jharkhand for development and operation of UDAN flights.Air connectivity especially from Ranchi to Varanasi, Patna does not come under the purview of UDAN as these routes are non-RCS routes.Bhagalpur Airport is available in RCS document. None of the airline have submitted  proposal to operate RCS flights from Bhagalpur airstrip till 4th round of bidding under UDAN. However, if any bid is received in future rounds of bidding under UDAN, the same shall be considered as per the provisions of Scheme Document.
