SUBHAS SARKAR)(a) to (d) Due to the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, schools in States and Union Territories (UT) were closed as a precautionary measure to protect the students. This has interrupted the learning of students from pre- school to grade 12. During the pandemic, Ministry of Education has held several consultations with the States and UTs to assess the various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. After discussion with the States and UTs, a multi-pronged approach has been adopted for leveraging technology to reach the students in States/UTs. A comprehensive initiative called PM eVIDYA has been initiated which unifies all efforts related to digital/online/on-air education to enable multi-mode access to education. The initiative includes, the following components: ?	DIKSHA the nation’s digital infrastructure for providing quality e-content for school education in states/UTs:  and QR coded Energized Textbooks for all grades (one nation, one digital platform) ?	One earmarked Swayam Prabha TV channel per class from 1 to 12 (one class, one channel)?	Extensive use of Radio, Community radio and CBSE Podcast- Shiksha Vani?	Special e-content for visually and hearing impaired developed on Digitally Accessible Information System (DAISY) and in sign language on NIOS website/ YouTube Under ICT component of centrally sponsored scheme of Samagra Shiksha; Rs. 998.80 crore for 2020-21 and Rs 1960.60 crore for 2021-22 have been approved for States/UTs for ICT and smart classes. In the state of Maharashtra, Rs. 35.00 crore for 2020-21 and Rs.21.30 crore 2021-22 have been approved. Where the digital facility (mobile device/ DTH television) is not available, Ministry of Education has taken many initiatives like Textbooks, worksheet supplied to residence of learners, Handbook on 21st Century Skills and community/mohalla classes are organized. Innovation Funds of the Department are used to set up mobile school, virtual studios, virtual class rooms in schools, Continuous Learning Plan (CLP) for States/UTs has been initiated in all States/UTs, pre-loaded tablets under Samagra Shiksha in various states and UTs are effectively used in remote/rural areas where online classes are difficult. Further in order to provide continuous professional development opportunities to the teachers at the elementary level, this Department launched the National Initiative for School Heads'' and Teachers'' Holistic Advancement (NISHTHA) online training programme using DIKSHA platform in October 2020. NISHTHA online for elementary level covered 18 modules in 11 languages, including use of ICT in teaching-learning. Similarly, NISHTHA 2.0 and NISHTHA 3.0 have been launched for teachers at secondary and primary level respectively. ******
