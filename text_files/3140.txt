MURALEEDHARAN](a) 	No. e-Migrate registration is mandatory only for all Emigration Check Required (ECR) passport holders going for employment to the 18 ECR countries.

Therefore, such persons automatically get registered in the e-Migrate system. For Emigration Check Not Required (ECNR) passport holders, registration in the e-Migrate is currently voluntary.(b)	Does not arise.(c)	The total number of ECR passport holders registered in the    e-Migrate system, country wise are as follows: <pre>Sl.No.Name of Countries20162017 20182019 (30.6.19)1Afghanistan00002Bahrain1196411516914236603Indonesia01101004Iraq00005Jordan27422341194118786Kuwait723845638057613232647Lebanon3161101091348Libya00009Malaysia106041400216370441310Oman6323653332360371443411Qatar3061924759344711273812S.
