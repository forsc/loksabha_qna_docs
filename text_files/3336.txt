ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                         (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) & (b): The Government of India has launched Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) on 25 June, 2015 with focus on water supply, sewerage & septage management, storm water drainage, parks & green spaces and non-motorized urban transport in 500 Mission cities across the country.The details of financial assistance provided to States/Union Territories (UTs) during each of the last three years and the current year under AMRUTis at Annexure-I.(c)& (d):Yes, Sir. As part of the National Housing and Habitat Policy 2007, States are required to prepare a State Housing and Habitat Policy. In this backdrop, Ministry had constituted an Affordable Housing Task Force (AHTF) in 2010 which submitted its report in Financial Year 2012-13.  In order to take forward the recommendations of the AHTF, this Ministry had organised a number of consultations at the National level and also engaged separately with the State/UT Governments, academic institutions, various associations, and the civil society, among others.  Based on the inputs received and in view of the various policy developments, it was decided that the housing sector needs to be addressed as a whole rather than focusing on specific policy prescriptions for the affordable housing segment. It was therefore decided that the Ministry will focus on finalizing a ‘Template for Preparation of State Housing Policy for Urban Areas’ with a guidance note on various conceptual frameworks, including good practices available across the country. The scope of different policies undertaken by the Ministry was also examined.A Guidance Note on the ‘Template for Preparation of State Housing Policy for Urban Areas’ was subsequently prepared and shared with States/UTs for their adoption.(e): Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) is implementing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) [PMAY(U)] for providing assistance to States/UTs in addressing the housing requirement of the people belonging to Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), Lower Income Group (LIG) and Middle Income Group (MIG) categories in urban areas including the Metro Cities.A total 83,62,975 houses have so far been sanctioned under the Scheme, out of this 26,07,913 are completed. In Metro Cities (Million Plus Population), a total 19,93,424 houses have so far been sanctioned under the Scheme, out of this 7,50,637 are completed.                                *****
