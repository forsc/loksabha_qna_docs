                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) & (e):  The supply of medical oxygen to hospitals is determined by contractual arrangements between the concerned hospital and the medical oxygen supplier. However, due to unprecedented surge in demand of medical oxygen across the country during the second wave of COVID-19 – the demand in the country peaked to nearly 9000 MT as compared to the peak requirement of 3095 MT during the first wave. It was in this context that the Central Government stepped in and took all possible measures to increase production and to facilitate equitable distribution to the States. The daily liquid medical oxygen (LMO) production, which was about 5700 MTs per day in August 2020 was increased to a high of 9690 MTs as on 13 May 2021. On 28th May, 2021 the Central Government was able to allocate 10,250 MTs to the States. As an urgent measure, a total quantity of 1385 MT of LMO in several consignments was imported into the country from UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Singapore, etc. and was made available to the States/UTs. Oxygen Express Services of Indian Railways delivered 35,500 MT of LMO as on June, 30th, 2021. Indian Air Force conducted 1630 domestic sorties and 229 international sorties to airlift tankers. (b), (c) & (f) - A total of 1222 Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants with capacity of 1771.76 MT have been sanctioned. The State/UT- wise list is placed at Annexure. Out of these, as on 20th July, 2021, 245 plants have been commissioned. Apart from this, 351 PSA plants are being installed by different Ministries in different public health facilities. The National Medical Commission has amended the Regulations to make a PSA plant compulsory for every Medical College. The States have also been asked to install oxygen generation plants in all requisite public health facilities and also facilitate their installation in private health facilities. As per the data uploaded by the States on the concerned portal, States are setting up 1023 PSA plants from their own funds. (d) - As on 15.7.2021, 1244 Liquid Medical Oxygen Tankers are available in the country. Out of which, 225 Liquid Medical Oxygen Tankers added after March 2020.

Rs. 8147.29 crore have been released to the States/UTs and supply of essential materials (in kind) to the tune of Rs. 3389.7 crore such as PPEs, N95 masks, ventilators, etc has been made to the States/UTs.
