ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a): The information regarding estimated incidence of cancer cases in the country is based on National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP) of Indian Council of Medical Research. The latest report of NCRP is for the year 2020, which is based on data for the period 2012-16, as compared to earlier report of 2016, which was based on data for the period 2012-14. Also, the year 2020 report is based on an increased coverage in terms of more number of Population Based Cancer Registries (PBCRs) or expansion of some existing PBCRs. As a result of above changes, the annual figures of estimated incidence of cancer in the country in the year 2020 report have undergone revision as compared to previous report of NCRP of 2016, and the revised year-wise figures for India, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are as under: Year	2016	2017	2018	2019India	12,60,427	12,92,534	13,25,232	13,58,415Andhra Pradesh	64,371	64,839	67,370	68,883Telangana	43,129	44,230	45,335	46,464 As per ICMR report “India: Health of the Nation’s States”, Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) rate related to chronic kidney disease increased by 12% between 1990 to 2016. ICMR has undertaken a study on prevalence of Chronic Kidney Diseases in the Indian population in a multi-centric project initiated at 7 centres of the country viz. Delhi, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Bhubanshwar, Kolkata, Guwahati and Mumbai. The initial trends of data indicate a community prevalence of CKD on first screening, ranging from 5.5% to 18.2% with an average prevalence of 11.4 % on first screening. (b): Public Health and Hospitals is a State subject. The Central Government, however, supplements the efforts of the State Governments to prevent and control cancer and to provide affordable and accessible care. To tackle the challenge of Non Communicable Diseases (NCD) the Government is implementing National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), with focus on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, health promotion & awareness generation, early diagnosis, management and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. Besides setting up of NCD Clinics at the District and Community Health Center (CHC) levels, activities under NPCDCS also include population level initiative for prevention, control and screening for common NCDs (diabetes, hypertension and common cancers viz. oral, breast and cervical cancer). Screening of common NCDs including three common cancers i.e. oral, breast and cervical is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres. Tertiary Cancer Care facilities are being strengthened through setting up of State Cancer Institutes (SCI) & Tertiary Care Cancer Centres (TCCC) under NPCDCS and setting of new All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar in Haryana and strengthening of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, are also steps in the same direction. For free dialysis services to Below Poverty Line (BPL) patients, Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Programme (PMNDP) is being implemented as part of National Health Mission (NHM) for which States/UTs are supported through their Programme Implementation Plan (PIP).(c) and (d): As informed by Department of Science and Technology, various projects have been undertaken under Indo-US Science & Technology Forum  (IUSSTF), focusing on cancer and kidney disease. Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and Cancer Research UK (CRUK) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for a Cancer Research Initiative, “Affordable Approaches to Cancer”.
