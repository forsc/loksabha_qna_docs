                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):	Yes, Sir. During last three years (2016-2018), the ICAR has developed and released 886 high yielding, eco-friendly, improved quality, agro-climatic zone specific field crop varieties of various crops through its Institutes, All India Coordinated Research Projects (AICRPs) and State Agricultural Universities  as per the details given below:-Crops	Year-wise no. of varieties 		    2016  2017	2018	  TotalCereals	    152	   116	 200	   468Oilseeds     50	    28	  49	   127Pulses	     43	    32	  47	   122Fibre Crops  33	    15	  29	    77Forages	     20	     8	  28	    56Sugarcane     9	     8	  18	    35Others	      0      0	   1	    01Total	     30     207	  372	    886Efforts were made to breed bio-fortified varieties wherein 35 bio-fortified varieties of different crops viz., wheat (11), rice (6), maize (4), pearl millet (5), lentil (2), mustard (2), soybean (1) and horticultural crops (4) have been released with higher nutritional quality. Moreover, among these 886 varieties/hybrids developed during last 3 years, 736 varieties/hybrids are climate resilient, with enhanced ability to combat abiotic stresses.Availability of good quality seeds of high yielding varieties is the key to raising crop yields. ICAR is mandated to produce breeder seed of all released and notified varieties (as per the indents received from Department of Agriculture, Co-operation and Farmers Welfare) which in turn are converted to other classes of seeds viz., foundation and certified seed through multiplication by different agencies for further availability to the farmers. During 2018-19, under Attracting and Retaining Youth in Agriculture (ARYA) programme, 3474 rural youths were provided skill development training in entrepreneurial activities through 220 training programmes. As a result of the training, 2497 rural youths adopted ARYA enterprises and are running the entrepreneurial activities in sustainable manner by establishing 1022 micro-enterprise units at village level. In addition, 13.42 lakh farmers including youths were trained for updating their knowledge and skills on modern agricultural technologies.  Agri-business Incubation Centres established in ICAR institutes are facilitating entrepreneurs for their agri-business related technical needs by organizing various agri-business related programs at institute/zonal/national level. *******
