This is because chemical and petrochemical sector is a highly capital-intensive sector having long gestation period for starting operations. Shortage of feedstock/raw materials at competitive prices and high factor costs of production as compared to neighbouring countries are same of the factors which have led to increase in imports to meet the demand.(d) Yes, the Government is considering attracting investments in this sector and following measures are being taken:i. Chemicals & Petrochemicals Sector is broadly de-licensed and de-regulated. 100% FDI is permissible under automatic route.ii. Four Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Regions (PCPIRs) have been notified in the country to give boost to the sector.iii. Various other schemes are implemented and initiatives taken to promote investments in the sector for boosting domestic production.(e) To boost the domestic production of chemicals and petrochemicals and cut down imports and make India a manufacturing hub for the sector, the “Vision document 2024” of Department of Chemicals & Petrochemicals has been prepared to meet the growing domestic demand of chemicals and petrochemicals.*****
