                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a)  Jal Shakti Abhiyan -I (JSA-I) was launched in 2019 in 1592 blocks out of 2836 blocks in 256 water stressed districts of the country in two phases from 1st July to 30th September, 2019 and from 1st October to 30th November 2019. Under Jal Shakti Abhiyan – I, officers, groundwater experts and scientists from the Government of India have worked with State and District officials in these water stressed districts of the country to promote water conservation and water resource management by focusing on accelerated implementation of five target interventions, viz. water conservation & rain water harvesting, renovation of traditional and other water bodies/tanks, reuse and recharge of bore wells, watershed development and intensive  afforestation. With this campaign, huge awareness has been generated and various stakeholders have started taking steps for water conservation.  The outcome of JSA-I is improved water conservation.(b) & (c)   No separate funds were allocated for JSA-I. However, under above mentioned interventions, funds were utilized by convergence of different Central and State Government schemes to achieve the goal. Jal Shakti Abhiyan – II could not be taken up due to COVID-19 restrictions in 2020. However, Ministry of Jal Shakti has taken up the “Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain” (JSA:CTR) with the theme “Catch the rain, Where it Falls When it Falls” covering both rural as well as urban areas of all districts  in the country, during the pre-monsoon and monsoon period- ieupto 30th November 2021. The “Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch The Rain” campaign was launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on 22 March 2021, the World Water Day. The focused interventions for JSA:CTR  include creation/maintenance of water conservation & rainwater harvesting structures; renovation of traditional and other water bodies/ tanks; reuse and recharge of bore wells; watershed development; and intensive afforestation.  Another important activity of the JSA:CTR is the  preparation of district-wise geo-tagged inventory of all water bodies, its ground-truthing and preparation of scientific water conservation plans based on it. The details of state-wise progress made in the Jal Sahkti Abhiyan: Catch The Rain campaign upto 26.07.2021 along with the funds spent is attached as Annexure-I, as uploaded on JSA:CTR Portal (jsactr.mowr.gov.in) by the Central stakeholder Ministries/ Departments in respect of their Key Performance Indicators.  State Governments have also been requested to upload the information regarding works undertaken by them with state and local funds under JSA:CTR campaign.  Details of works done under JSA:CTR in Karauli and Dhaulpur districts upto 26.07.2021 are  attached as Annexure-II.***** ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred to in reply to part (b) & (c) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. †1716 to be answered on 29.07.2021 on ‘TARGET AND OBJECTIVES OF JAL SHAKTI ABHIYAN’.
