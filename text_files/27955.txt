ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY DAIRYING(SHRI PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a) & (b) Effective fisheries management calls for conservation and optimum utilization of fishery resources to ensure sustainable livelihood of traditional fishermen in long run. This consists of various measures such as prevention of juvenile fishing and complete ban on destructive fishing practices and ban on fishing during the breeding season. Paired Bottom Trawling or Bull trawling is an ecologically destructive practice as it damages the fish habitat and also nets the juvenile fish and such other non-targeted species. Accordingly, this practice has been banned in Indian EEZ beyond the territorial waters in India. Central Government has advised the Coastal States and Union Territories from time to time to issue necessary Orders to prohibit destructive fishing methods including pair/bull trawling. In addition, the uniform fishing ban is implemented in the Indian EEZ for a period of 61 days as per the following details:East Coast: From 15th April to 14th June, (both days inclusive) (61days)West Coast: From 1st June to 31st July, (both days inclusive) (61 days)However, the traditional non-motorized fishing vessels are exempted from this uniform fishing ban imposed in the Indian EEZ beyond territorial waters.(c) The activity “Livelihood and nutritional support for socio-economically backward active traditional fishers’ families for conservation of fisheries resources during fishing ban/lean period” is implemented under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana, wherein financial assistance is provided to the fisher families during the fishing ban/lean period.*****
