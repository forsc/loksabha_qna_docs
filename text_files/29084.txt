ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE AND CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS (SHRI MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a) & (b): The situation in global market scenario post Covid-19 has been closely monitored by the Government. In October 2021, rates under NBS scheme have been increased as a special package on DAP and most consumed NPK grades to ensure their affordable, reasonable and timely availability as well as for viability of their indigenous production. Besides, Government constantly engages with the fertilizer sector and other Ministries/Departments to ensure regular and sufficient supply of raw materials/intermediates for facilitation of indigenous fertilizer industry. The Potash Derived from Molasses (PDM) has been included under the NBS with subsidy proportionate to its nutrient content to encourage its domestic production and availability under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat (ANB) Mission.(c) & (d):   Sir, the Government had announced New Investment Policy (NIP) – 2012 on 2nd January, 2013 and its amendment on 7th October, 2014 to facilitate fresh investment in the urea sector and to make India self-sufficient in the urea sector. Under NIP – 2012 read with its amendment, Matix Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd. (Matix), Chambal Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd. (CFCL) and Ramagundam Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd.(RFCL) have set up new urea plants of 12.7 Lakh Metric Ton per annum (LMTPA) Capacity each at Panagarh-West Bengal, Gadepan-Rajasthan (Gadepan-III) and Ramagundam-Telangana respectively. Matix-Panagarh and RFCL-Ramagundam units are greenfield units while the CFCL-Gadepan-III unit is a brownfield unit.In addition to above, revival of 2 closed units of Fertilizers and Chemicals India Ltd. FCIL namely Gorakhpur and Sindri and 1 closed unit of Hindustan Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd. (HFCL) at Barauni by means of setting up of new greenfield urea units of 12.7 LMTPA at each of the locations is also included under the NIP-2012 read with its amendment. For the revival of Talcher unit of FCIL by setting up a new greenfield urea plant of 12.7 LMTPA an exclusive policy has been notified on 28th April 2021.The Government of India has also notified the New Urea Policy (NUP) – 2015 on 25th May, 2015 for existing 25 gas based urea units with the objective of maximizing indigenous urea production; promoting energy efficiency in urea production; and rationalizing subsidy burden on the Government. NUP-2015 also envisages the provision to incentivize beyond Re-assessed Capacity (RAC) production which has led to additional production from the existing gas based urea units due to which the actual production of urea has increased by 20-25 LMTPA in comparison to the actual production during 2014-15.Government has also implemented Nutrient Based Subsidy Policy w.e.f. 1.4.2010 for Phosphatic and Potassic (P&K) Fertilizers.  Under the policy, a fixed amount of subsidy, decided on annual basis, is provided on subsidised P&K fertilizers depending on their nutrient content. Under this policy, MRP is fixed by fertilizer companies as per market dynamics at reasonable/affordable level which is monitored by the Government. Government is implementing Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme since 2015 to provide soil test based fertilizer use recommendations to the farmers. Soil Health Card provides nutrient status of the soil along with prescription about balanced and integrated use of inorganic and organic fertilizers to maintain good soil health that results in increase in production.	Demonstrations about balanced use of fertilizers based on soil health card recommendations and training to the farmers on proper and integrated use fertilizers are integral part of the scheme. The State/UT wise expenditure incurred under Soil Health Card Scheme during last three years and current is enclosed as Annexure – A.******                                                                             Annexure- ADetails of State-wise funds released and expenditure on scheme being implemented by the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare during 2018-19 to 2021-22 (Up to November, 30th 2021NAME OF THE SCHEME: SOIL HEALTH CARD(Rs.
