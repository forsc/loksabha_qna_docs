The Government of India has always upheld the basic tenets of tripartism.  ILO has not commented  about  India’s lack of   compliance        Contd..2/-:: 2 ::with ILO Convention -144 on Tripartite Consultations in implementing the four Labour Codes. The four Codes, namely, the Code on Wages, 2019, the Industrial Relations Code, 2020, the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code on Social Security, 2020 have been notified in Gazette of India. Prior to that the Government had done extensive consultations inviting all Central Trade Unions, Employers’ Associations and State Governments. The Government had undertaken nine tripartite consultations on all the four Codes on 10.03.2015, 13.04.2015, 06.05.2015, 14.07.2015, 06.10.2015, 04.10.2017, 22.11.2018, 27.11.2018 and 05.11.2019 inviting all Central Trade Unions, Employers’ Associations and State Governments. All these Codes were also placed on the website for inviting comments from all stakeholders including general public.Further, all the Codes were referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour for examination.

The reports of the Committee were taken into account before these Labour Codes were considered and passed by the Parliament.

Third tripartite meeting was held on 20th January, 2021 in physical mode.  (f):		No, Sir.
