Under AB-PMJAY, States have the flexibility to choose the mode of implementation. They can either implement it in insurance mode, or through a trust or in a mixed mode i.e. both the insurance and trust mode.          The States implementing scheme through Insurance mode select Insurance Companies through open tender process. The States implementing scheme through trust mode, may engage Third-Party Administrators (TPAs)/ Implementing Support Agencies (ISAs) for     implementing the scheme through open tender process. The Government of India has no role in selection of such TPAs/ISAs.…………………
