ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES (SHRI RAMESWAR TELI) (a) & (b): The study on All India Cold-chain Infrastructure Capacity (AICIC-2015) conducted by NABCONS reported that 35 million tones cold storage capacity is required against the existing capacity of 32 million tones.  Though the Government does not setup such storage facilities at its own, it has been making efforts towards bridging the gap between demand and supply. Government is extending financial support for setting of such facilities through its scheme namely “Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH)” of the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DoAC &FW) and "Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojna (PMKSY)" of the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI).  These schemes are demand/entrepreneur-driven from among entrepreneurs, private companies, cooperatives, farmers group etc.    *****
