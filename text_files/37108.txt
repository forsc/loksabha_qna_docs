                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES & PENSIONS AND PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR.JITENDRA SINGH):    (a)&(b)There are presently twenty two (22) reactors with a capacity of 6780 MW in operation and eleven (11) reactors with a total capacity of  8700 MW under construction / commissioning at various stages (including KAPP-3 (700 MW) connected to the grid and PFBR being implemented by BHAVINI). In addition, the Government has accorded administrative approval and financial sanction for ten (10) reactors with an aggregate capacity of 7000 MW. The Capital investment for the nuclear power projects is being funded with a debt to equity ratio of 70:30. The equity part is funded from internal resources of NPCIL and Government Budgetary Support. Government of India has amended the Atomic Energy Act, 1962 in 2015 to enable Joint Ventures of Public Sector Enterprises  to set up nuclear power projects to boost domestic investment.  Joint Ventures have been formed by NPCIL with public sector majors viz. National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) and Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL).	As stated above there is a consistent increase in number of operating reactors based on successful methodology adopted. 	(c)&(d)The present policy (Consolidated FDI Policy of Government) puts atomic energy in the list of prohibited sectors.  However, there is no restriction on FDI in the nuclear industry for manufacturing of equipment and providing other supplies for nuclear power plants and related other facilities.(e)&(f)The Government has accorded ‘In-Principle’ approval for setting up six nuclear power reactors of 1650 MW capacity each in cooperation with France at Jaitapur site in Ratanagiri district of Maharashtra.  *****
