(b)	& (c):     The Government is implementing a Scheme on ‘Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi’during 2021-22. At present the Government has approved the continuation of scheme upto 30th September, 2022 during 2022-23. Under the scheme, financial assistance is provided to the farmers for purchase of identified crop residue management machinery and to the Cooperative Societies of Farmers, Farmers Producers Organization (FPOs), Registered Farmers Societies and Panchayats for establishment of Custom Hiring Centers (CHCs) of identified crop residue management machinery.
