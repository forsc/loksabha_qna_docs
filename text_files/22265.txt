ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY) (a) to (d):	Under the 1974 ‘Bilateral Protocol on Visits to Religious Shrines’ between India and Pakistan, there are four occasions every year on which visit of Sikh Jatha to Pakistan are held viz. Baisakhi, Martyrdom’s Day of Guru Arjan Dev Ji, Barsi of Maharaja Ranjit Singh Ji and Birth Anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji.  The proposed jatha to Nankana Sahib, Pakistan on 18/02/2021 was not covered under the 1974 Bilateral protocol.  Further, as per information available,  no such  Jatha  had  gone to Pakistan in the past on such occasion.  --2--L.S.US.Q.NO. 3221 FOR 16.03.2021Keeping in view the increasing number of cases of Covid-19 in Pakistan, threat to the safety and security of the large number of Indian citizens during the visit and the ongoing suspension of cross-border traffic due to Covid-19 pandemic, permission was not accorded to the said jatha. On the occasion of the 551th birth anniversary of Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji, a Jatha of Sikh Pilgrims visited Nankana Sahib, Pakistan from 28.11.2020 to 01.12.2020 under the 1974 ‘Bilateral Protocol on Visits to Religious Shrines’ between India and Pakistan.  However, due to COVID-19 pandemic related restrictions, the number of pilgrims was restricted.*****
