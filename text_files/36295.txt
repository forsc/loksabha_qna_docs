As reported by the States, all the inhabited un-electrified census villages across the country including Balangir and Jalpaiguri districts of Odisha and West Bengal respectively, stand electrified on 28th April, 2018 under DDUGJY. Government of India had launched Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana – Saubhagya in October, 2017 for electrification of rural and urban poor households in the country to achieve universal household electrification of all households in the country including Balangir and Jalpaiguri districts of Odisha and West Bengal respectively.Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) was also launched in December, 14 for strengthening and augmentation of sub-transmission & distribution infrastructure, metering of distribution transformers/feeders/consumers and IT enablement of distribution sector.Scheme-wise details of funds released in Odisha & West Bengal are at Annexure.(c) & (d) :     In Balangir district of Odisha, a total of 1,40,034 households have been electrified under DDUGJY, XII plan and Saubhagya. In Jalpaiguri district of West Bengal, a total of 14,218 households have been electrified under DDUGJY and Saubhagya. As reported by the States of Odisha and West Bengal, all the unelectrified inhabited census villages of district Balangir and Jalpaiguri have been electrified.(e) & (f):    Electricity is a concurrent subject. Government of India supplements the efforts of the States towards strengthening their distribution systems through its various schemes including Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS).Government of India have recently approved the “Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme - A Reforms based and Results linked Scheme” with the objective of improving the quality and reliability of power supply to consumers through a financially sustainable and operationally efficient distribution Sector. The Scheme aims to reduce the AT&C losses at pan-India levels to 12-15% and ACS-ARR gap to zero by 2024-25. This would also contribute towards ensuring 24x7 electric supply to the urban and rural areas in the country.*********
