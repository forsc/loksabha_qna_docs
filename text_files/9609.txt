                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (d) Report of deaths of several birds in Sambahar Lake in Rajasthan has been received in the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. In order to assess and inquire into the matter regarding deaths of birds in Sambhar lake, Rajasthan, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has constituted a Committee comprising of the Deputy Inspector General of Forests (WL), MoEFCC, Scientist, Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun and Scientist, Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Izzatnagar, Bareilly. The Committee had visited the site on 23rd and 24th November 2019 and had detailed discussions with the Rajasthan State Forest Department also.  Based on the site visit and discussions, the following are the important findings: i.	As per information provided by the State Forest Department during the visit, birds which have been found with infection, are mostly omnivorous and insectivorous. As per the IVRI, the important bird species that have been affected include Northern shovelers, Kentish plovers, common teals, common sandpipers, Ruff, Pied avocets, whistling ducks, common coots However, Flamingoes, land birds (Crows, Kites, domestic chicken in nearby villages) were not affected.ii.	The rescued birds were given parenteral injections of Betamethazone, Neurobion, oxytetracycline and Atropine and also fresh feed and water. iii.	The birds responded well to the treatment in 24 to 48 hours depending upon the severity.iv.	As per IVRI, based on the epidemiological and laboratory investigations, the cause of mortality in migratory birds is Avian Botulism caused by  Clostridium botulinum. Several factors like, presence of crustaceans, invertebrates, heavy rains in month of July and August and thereby decrease in salinity level, etc. have been  attributed to favouring the growth of Clostridium botulinum	 The important steps taken by the Government in this regard include:i.	 The ailing birds are given first aid treatment at the site and are taken to a rescue centre at Kachroda Forest Nursery, Jaipur District.ii.	 A small rescue centre has also been established at Nawa in Nagaur.iii.	 So far, 591 live but ailing birds have been rescued from various sites at Sambhar Lake and treated at Kachroda Nursery Rescue Centre.iv.	A soft release facility has been set up for release of birds recovered from ailment.v.	The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is coordinating with State Forest Department, Scientific institutions/organizations and civil society organizations for management of the issue.	***
