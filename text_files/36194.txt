                                                                               THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE                MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                       (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a) to (c): National Urban Digital Mission (NUDM) was launched in February, 2021, to facilitate electronic delivery of municipal services to citizens across towns and cities of the country. NUDM will make available shared digital infrastructure to all States and Union Territories (UTs) which would include foundational digital building blocks, ready-to-use platforms, standards, specifications, and frameworks for electronic delivery of municipal services. The implementation of NUDM is being anchored by the Centre for Digital Governance (CDG) under the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA). Stakeholders’ consultation is part of the approach towards implementation of NUDM, and engagements have started with various State Governments.(d) to (g): Government of India launched Smart Cities Mission (SCM) on 25 June 2015.  100 Smart Cities have been selected through 4 rounds of competition from January 2016 to June 2018.  As on 4 March 2022, 100 Smart Cities have tendered out 6,928 projects worth ? 1,91,238 crore; work orders have been issued in 6,282 projects worth ? 1,65,503 crore; 3,576 projects worth ? 59,958 crore have been completed.  So far, Government of India has released ? 29,213.60 crore for 100 Smart Cities, out of which ? 25,177.65 crore (86%) has been utilized.  As per SCM Guidelines, Government of India (GoI) will provide financial support to the extent of ? 48,000 crore over five years i.e., on an average ? 100 crore per city per year.  An equal amount on a matching basis will be contributed by the State Government/Urban Local Body (ULB).  Apart from these sources, around ? 42,028 crore (21%) has been proposed from convergence with other Missions, ? 41,022 crore (21%) from Public-Private Partnership (PPP), around ? 9,843 crore (4.8%) from loans, ? 2,644 crore (1.3%) from own resources and remaining from other sources. The funding of the Central Government and State Government to provide funds as per the sanctioned cost of projects remain unchanged. Although, the sanctioned cost of projects may undergo variations during the course of execution and may increase or reduce in some cases. The implementation of SCM at the city level is done by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) created for the purpose. At State level, Mission implementation is coordinated by the State level High Powered Steering Committee (HPSC) chaired by the Chief Secretary of the State.  At the National level, implementation of SCM is monitored by an Apex Committee headed by Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA).  Nominee Directors of MoHUA on the Boards of SPVs monitor progress in respective cities on a regular basis. MoHUA regularly interacts with the States/Smart Cities through video conferences, review meetings, field visits, regional workshops etc. at various levels to assess the performance of cities and handhold them for improving the same. Smart Cities are assessed on various parameters including, but not limited to, project implementation and utilization of funds through the Online Geospatial Management Information System (GMIS). The period of implementation of SCM has also been extended upto June 2023 and all Smart Cities are expected to complete their projects within the stipulated time.                              *****
