In August 2017 the nine judge bench of Hon’ble Supreme Court gave its verdict on privacy in the Puttaswamy case laying down that privacy is a fundamental right under article 21 of the constitution. In July 2018 the Justice Srikrishna committee submitted its report along with the draft of the personal data protection bill.(c):  The report of the committee along with the draft of the PDP bill is available at https://www.meity.gov.in/data-protection-framework. (d): During the proceedings in above cited case Hon’ble Court took note of the constitution of the committee of experts to bring out the data protection framework. The committee also studied the observations of the Hon’ble Court in the privacy judgement and ensured that its report is in consonance with the Supreme Court’s judgement. *******
