                                                        The Information Technology Act, 2000 provides adequate provisions for justice mechanism to deal with cyber contraventions and cyber crimes. Section 46 of the Act provides for adjudication mechanism for cyber contraventions. Secretaries of Department of Information Technology of each State and Union Territory have been appointed as Adjudicating Officer.  The appeals are dealt by Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT). Cyber crime cases are dealt by appropriate competent courts. Presently there is no proposal with Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to establish separate cyber courts.*******
