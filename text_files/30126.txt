                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS (SHRI DEVUSINH CHAUHAN)(a)	BharatNet project is implemented in a phased manner to provide broadband connectivity to all Gram Panchayats (GPs) in the country. As on 01.11.2021, a total number of 1,66,088 GPs are made Service Ready in the country. The implementation of the project is affected mainly on account of widely dispersed GPs across remote corners of the country, covering difficult terrains (including Hilly/ Rocky) and also difficulty of access in Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas.(b)	In Odisha, a total number of 3810 GPs were taken up for implementation under Phase-I through Powergrid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL), out of which 3809 GPs have been made Service Ready, as on 01.11.2021. The Phase-II in Odisha is implemented in State-led model through the State Government under which, 2402 GPs have been made Service Ready out of 2,946 planned GPs. Further, 19 GPs have been made Service Ready on Satellite media out of 43 planned GPs. In total, 6,230 GPs have been made Service Ready in Odisha. Under BharatNet project, 569 GPs are yet to be made Service Ready in Odisha, including 29 GPs in Nabarangpur District, 51 GPs in Malkangiri District and 51 GPs in Koraput District.(c)	The State/UT-wise details (including Odisha) are given in Annexure-I.  (d)	The scope of BharatNet on 30.06.2021 was extended up to all inhabited villages beyond GPs in the country. The target date for completion of the project is August, 2023.
