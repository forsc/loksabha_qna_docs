                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):	Public Health and hospitals being a State subject, the primary responsibility of providing health care and hospital services to its citizens is that of the State Governments.   However, under National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to the State Governments/UTs to strengthen their health care system including establishment of new PHCs, based on the requirements posed by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs).No proposal for establishment of new Primary Health Centres (PHCs)  in Assam, particularly at Gobindapur and Lachanga in Barpeta Districts and Balarchar in Bongaigaon is received from the Government of Assam.   However PHC at Temura in Barpeta District was already approved under NHM in FY 2012-13 which, as reported by the  Government of Assam, could not be  taken up due to non-availability of land for the facility.(c):	No proposal is received from the Government of Assam  for upgradation of existing State dispensaries to PHCs at Bohori and Kachumara in Barpeta District.
