                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b) Yes Sir, there is spatial and temporal variability of rainfall in the country, which  makes the natural water availability confined to few months only in most parts of the country.(c) & (d) Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management & conservation including rain water harvesting is primarily States’ responsibility. Central Government supports construction of water harvesting and conservation works primarily through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) aided by Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana –Watershed Development Component (PMKSY-WDC) and Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana – Per Drop More Crop. Under these Schemes, during the last three years, 17,56,027 water harvesting and conservations works have been completed for which Rs.23,435.67 crore was released as Central share.Other measures taken by the Central Government to promote rain water harvesting / conservation are as follows:-•	Hon’ble Prime Minister has written a letter to all Sarpanchs on 08.06.2019 regarding the importance of water conservation and harvesting and exhorted them to adopt all appropriate measures to make water conservation a mass movement. Contd…P/2//2//•	Creation of a new Ministry of Jal Shakti for dealing with all matters relating to water at one place in an integrated manner. •	The National Water Policy (2012) has been formulated by Department of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation (DoWR, RD & GR), inter-alia, advocates rain water harvesting and conservation of water and highlights the need for augmenting the availability of water through direct use of rainfall. It also, inter-alia, advocates conservation of river, river bodies and infrastructure should be undertaken in a scientifically planned manner through community participation. Further, encroachment and diversion of water bodies and drainage channels must not be allowed and wherever, it has taken place, it should be restored to the extent feasible and maintained properly.•	In compliance to the decision taken by the Committee of Secretaries, an ‘Inter-Ministerial Committee’ under the Chairmanship of Secretary (WR, RD & GR) has been constituted to take forward the subject of ‘Push on Water Conservation Related Activities for Optimum Utilization of Monsoon Rainfall’. •	DoWR, RD &GR has circulated a Model Bill to all the States/UTs to enable them to enact suitable ground water legislation for its regulation and development, which includes provision of rain water harvesting. So far, 15 States/UTs have adopted and implemented the ground water legislation on the lines of Model Bill.•	Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has issued directions under Section 5 of “The Environment Protection Act, 1986” for mandatory Rain Water Harvesting / Roof Top Rain Water Harvesting for all target areas in the Country including UTs. While granting ‘No Objection Certificate (NOC)’ for drawing ground water, CGWA insists for mandatory rain water harvesting as per the guidelines issued. •	Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) under DoWR, RD & GR has also prepared a conceptual document entitled “Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Ground Water in India” during the year 2013, which envisages construction of 1.11 crore rain water harvesting and artificial recharge structures in the Country at an estimated cost of Rs. 79,178 crores to harness 85 Billion Cubic Metre (BCM) of water, in an area of 9,41,541 sq.km by harnessing surplus monsoon runoff to augment ground water resources. •	Besides, CGWB has taken up Aquifer Mapping and Management programme during XII Plan, under the scheme of Ground Water Management and Regulation. The Aquifer Mapping is aimed to delineate aquifer disposition and their characterization for preparation of aquifer/area specific ground water management plans with community participation. The management plans are shared with the respective State Governments for taking appropriate measures. •	DoWR, RD&GR has instituted National Water Awards to incentivise good practices in water conservation and ground water recharge. Contd….P/3//3//•	Mass awareness programmes (Trainings, Seminars, Workshops, Exhibitions, Trade Fares and Painting Competitions etc.) are conducted from time to time each year under the Information, Education & Communication (IEC) Scheme of DoWR, RD & GR in various parts of the Country to promote rain water harvesting and artificial recharge to ground water. •	The Ministry of Rural Development in consultation and agreement with the DoWR, RD & GR and the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare has developed an actionable framework for Natural Resources Management (NRM), titled “Mission Water Conservation” to ensure gainful utilization of funds. The framework strives to ensure synergies in Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), PMKSY, erstwhile Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) now PMKSY-WDC and Command Area Development & Water Management (CAD&WM), given their common objectives. Types of common works undertaken under these programmes/schemes are water conservation and management, water harvesting, soil and moisture conservation, groundwater recharge, flood protection, land development, Command Area Development & Watershed Management•	Department of Land Resources is currently implementing 8214 watershed development projects in 28 States covering an area of about 39.07 million ha. under the Watershed Development Component (WDC) of the PMKSY principally for development of rainfed portions of net cultivated area and culturable wastelands. The major activities taken up under the WDC-PMKSY, inter-alia, include ridge area treatment, drainage line afforestation, soil and moisture conservation, rain water harvesting, horticulture, and pasture development etc. •	Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs has released Model Building Bye-laws, 2016 which recommends Rainwater Harvesting for all types of Building with plot size 100 sq.m or more. Barring the States/UT of Manipur, Sikkim Mizoram and Lakshadweep, all the States have incorporated the provisions in their respective building bye laws. The plans submitted to the local bodies shall indicate the system of storm water drainage along with points of collection of rain water in surface reservoirs or in recharge wells. Further, all building having a minimum discharge of 10,000 litre and above per day shall incorporate waste water recycling system. The recycled water should be used for horticultural purposes.Central Water Commission (CWC) under Ministry of Jal Shakti carries out techno-economic appraisal of major (command area more than 10000 hectare) and medium (command area more than 2000 hectare and less than 10000 hectare) irrigation projects which are planned on Inter-State river / river basins.
