ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): In 2nd  & 3rd round of bidding under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN scheme, networks/proposals connecting Hindan airport to various cities have been awarded to Selected Airline Operators. The list of such networks/proposals is at Annexure-A. RCS flights could be commenced once the Selected Airline Operators complete their preparedness for operations.;;(c) and (d): With repeal of the Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation was deregulated. Airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type, free to select whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate. Government has, however, laid down Route Dispersal Guidelines with a view to achieve better air transport services to different regions of the country. It is, therefore, up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability in the country subject to compliance with Route Dispersal Guidelines.;
