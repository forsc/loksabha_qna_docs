Prior to discontinuation of regular passenger train services, w.e.f. 23rd March, 2020, in view of Covid-19 pandemic, Swarupganj was being served by 02 pairs of Mail/Express and 02 pairs of Passenger services including 19411/12 Ajmer-Sabarmati Express, whose experimental stoppage had been provided at Swarupganj w.e.f. 29.01.2019. Presently, Swarupganj is being served by 02 pairs of Special Mail/Express services, which are providing connectivity, to the passengers of Swarupganj, for destinations like Ajmer, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Mumbai etc.Owing to operational constraints and for the lack of commercial justification, at present, there is no proposal for stoppage of additional trains at Swarupganj.
