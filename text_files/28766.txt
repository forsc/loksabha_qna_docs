                                                        THE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a)	to (c) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 89* FOR 3RD DECEMBER, 2021(a) to (c) Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) are estimated to account for 63% of all deaths in India of which the cardiovascular diseases lead with 27% overall mortality cause. In a report “India: Health of the Nation’s States” by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), it is found that there is increase in proportion of deaths due to NCDs (among all deaths) from 37% in 1990 to 61% in 2016 and decrease in proportion of deaths due to Communicable Diseases (CDs) (among all deaths) from 53% in 1990 to 27% in 2016.  This shows a epidemiological transition with a shift in disease burden to NCDs. A population-based initiative for prevention, control and screening for common Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) i.e. diabetes, hypertension and common cancers has been rolled out in the country under NHM and also as a part of Comprehensive Primary Health Care. Under the initiative, persons more than 30 years of age are targeted for their screening for common NCDs. Screening of these common NCDs is an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres.The Department of Health & Family Welfare, provides technical and financial support to the States/UTs under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), as part of National Health Mission (NHM). Under NPCDCS, 677 District NCD Clinics, 187 District Cardiac Care Units, and 5392 Community Health Center NCD Clinics has been set up.Cardiovascular Diseases patients are getting treatment at various health facilities in the health care delivery system including Medical Colleges, Central Institutes like AIIMS, Central Government hospitals, and private sector hospitals. There is also focus on cardiovascular diseases in its various aspects in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojna (PMSSY). Under Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), health insurance cover of Rs. 5 lakhs per family per year for secondary or tertiary care hospitalization to over 10.75cr. beneficiary families identified from Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011 (SECC 2011) database is provided. AB-PMJAY provides treatment corresponding to a total of 1,669 procedures under 26 different specialties for NCDs including Cardiovascular Diseases. The treatment packages under AB-PMJAY are very comprehensive covering various treatment related aspects such as drugs and diagnostic services.Preventive aspect of Cardiovascular Diseases is being strengthened under Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Ayushman Bharat Health Wellness Centre scheme, by promotion of wellness activities and targeted communication at the community level. Other initiatives for increasing public awareness about Cardiovascular Diseases and for promotion of healthy lifestyle includes observation of National and International Day and use of print, electronic and social media for continued community awareness. Furthermore, healthy eating is also promoted through FSSAI. Fit India movement is being implemented by Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, and various Yoga related activities are being carried out by Ministry of AYUSH. In addition, NPCDCS gives financial support under NHM for awareness generation (IEC) activities for Cardiovascular Diseases to be undertaken by the States/UTs as per their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs).Relevant data related to patients, including cardiovascular patients, registered and under treatment, is maintained by the Institutions and Hospitals concerned at their own level.
