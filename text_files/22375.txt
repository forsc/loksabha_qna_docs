MURALEEDHARAN](a)    Yes.(b)	Under the Neighbourhood First Policy, development cooperation is an important component of our engagement with neighbouring countries.  There is a specific focus on regional connectivity initiatives which act as force multipliers for regional growth and development while enhancing people to people contact and enhancing economic cooperation. While undertaking these projects, Indian expertise is showcased in project planning and implementation in a wide range of areas covering both infrastructure development as well as socio-economic development. Developmental assistance to neighbouring countries is carried out mainly through Lines of Credit, Grant-in-aid & capacity building prorgrams.(i)  Lines of Credit:   Development assistance in the form of concessional Lines of Credit is extended by the Government of India under the Indian Development and Economic Assistance Scheme (IDEAS) through the Exim Bank of India. 45 Lines of Credit worth US$ 14.53 billion covering 263 projects have been extended to 7 countries in our neighbourhood namely Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Maldives, Mauritius and Seychelles.

The projects span different sectors such as connectivity, energy, roads, agriculture, infrastructure, education, culture, capacity building, security and training. These projects are taken up based on the developmental needs of our neighbouring countries and our overall strategic interest in the region.		A substantial part of our grant assistance to neighbouring countries is for connectivity and infrastructure development projects which promote cross-border connectivity.
