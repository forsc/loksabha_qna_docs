Nuclear power plants are designed adopting safety principles of redundancy, diversity and provided fail-safe design features following a defence-in-depth approach, in line with codes and guides of Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB). The operations are performed adopting well laid out procedures by highly qualified, trained and licensed personnel. Appropriate Personal Protection Equipments and monitoring aids are provided to all the personnel working in the nuclear power plants. The safety of nuclear power plants is continuously monitored and reviewed by the AERB.A detailed emergency preparedness plan in line with the guidelines of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) is put in place at each of the nuclear power plant sites before start of their operation. The emergency preparedness plans incorporate effective measures for evacuation of public in the unlikely event of an emergency. The State authorities and designated responders (including security personnel) are trained in all aspects of the emergency response. Local people living in the vicinity are sensitized about the actions to be taken in the unlikely event of an emergency. Emergency exercises are conducted periodically in accordance with the plan and improvements if any, based on the feedback are made in the procedures. Regular exercises on security contingencies are conducted with On Site and Off Site response force.*****
