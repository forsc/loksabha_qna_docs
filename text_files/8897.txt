ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a)	To prevent commission of offences involving breach of peace, activities prejudicial to the security of the State and maintenance of public order, 5161 persons including stone pelters, OGWs, separatists, etc. were taken into preventive custody in Kashmir Valley since 4th August, 2019. Out of these, presently 609 persons are under preventive detentions. These detentions have been made under statutory provisions by the concerned Magistrates.-2/…-2-LS.US.Q.NO.2417 FOR 03.12.2019(b) & (c) No separate assessment has been made of cost incurred towards personnel deployed, cost of supplies, travel expenditure, detention of persons, communication and medical facilities, etc.(d) & (e) Full potential and economy in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh regions could not be realized for the last 70 years as the people of Jammu and Kashmir have suffered from terrorist violence and separatism supported from across the border for the past many decades.  On account of article 35A and certain other constitutional ambiguities, the people of this region were denied full rights enshrined in the Constitution of India and other benefits of various Central Laws that were being enjoyed by other citizens of the country.  	After the Declaration issued by the President under article 370, based on recommendation of the Parliament, and reorganisation of the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir into Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir and Union Territory of Ladakh, all such aspects have been addressed.  The people and business community of these regions can now realize full potential in all sectors of economy and businesses like in other parts of the country.	Due to these recent decisions, certain precautionary measures taken initially have been substantially relaxed.  There is no specific report received from the Government of Jammu and Kashmir or Administration of Ladakh regarding any new financial implications for businesses and economy in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh regions on account of such preventive steps taken as short term measure.   -3/…-3-LS.US.Q.NO.2417 FOR 03.12.2019	Under the Prime Minister’s package announced on 7th November 2015 for Rs.80,068 Crores, 63 major development projects in Road, Power, Health, Tourism, Agriculture, Horticulture, Skill Development sectors etc. are already under various stages of implementation. 	In addition to the above steps, many flagship schemes of the Government of India including the individual beneficiary centric schemes are being proactively implemented by the Government.*****
