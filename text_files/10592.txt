The Government of India is supplementing the efforts of the State Governments in addressing the challenges of pollution of rivers by providing financial and technical assistance through schemes like ‘Namami Gange’, National River Conservation Plan (NRCP), Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) etc. Hon’ble National Green Tribunal (NGT), Principal Bench, New Delhi has passed an order directing all the States and Union Territories (UTs) to prepare action plans for bringing all the polluted river stretches up to the bathing standards. In compliance of Hon’ble NGT order, action plan has been prepared by Government of Maharashtra for rejuvenation of river Wainganga which  has been approved by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for implementation by the State Government.  As per the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution), Act 1974, industrial units are required to install effluent treatment plants (ETPs) and treat their effluents to comply with environmental standards before discharging into rivers. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) and Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) monitor industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under  provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has informed that they are taking action against the defaulting industries responsible for causing water pollution in river. MPCB has also issued directions to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation as well as Bhandara & Pauni Municipal Councils in this matter. According to CPCB, there are 2743 Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) in the country which are discharging their effluents in various water bodies. Out of total 2743 industries, 2497 industries are operational and 246 industries self-closed. Number of complying and non-complying units are 2222 and 275 respectively.
