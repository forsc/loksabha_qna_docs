ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) has developed various Software Applications which monitor the parameters of functioning of MoPR schemes by Panchayats’ including planning (PlanPlus-http://planningonline.gov.in), accounting (PRIASoft - https://accountingonline.gov.in), progress of work (ActionSoft - https://reportingonline.gov.in) and details of assets created (National Asset Directory - https://assetdirectory.gov.in). Besides, the Public Financial Management System (PFMS - https://pfms.nic.in) application is used to track the fund disbursement from Government of India to various levels down below.(b) & (c) Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) has been providing programmatic support for strengthening of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and capacity building of Elected Representatives and functionaries of PRIs to improve their functioning and effectiveness and make them self reliant. These programs are specifically focused on addressing the critical gaps that constrain the functioning of Panchayats, facilitating democratic planning and decision making through People’s participation, and strengthening the institutional structure of Panchayats.	Further, the Government has launched the core Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA), which is being implemented from 2018-19 to 2021-22, with the primary aim of developing governance capabilities of PRIs to deliver on Sustainable Development Goals (SDG''s) with the main thrust on convergence with Mission Antyodaya and emphasis on strengthening PRIs in the 117 Aspirational districts. The scheme of RGSA extends to all States/Union Territories (UTs) including institutions of Rural Local Government in Non-Part-IX areas. Details of Annual Action Plan (AAP) of the States/UTs approved and funds released there under during the years 2016-17 and 2017-18 under the erstwhile scheme of Capacity Building – Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (CB-PSA) and during the year 2018-19 and 2019-20 under the scheme of RGSA are at Annexure.(d) MoPR has been taking several steps to strengthen the Panchayati Raj Institutions in the States and Union Territories covered under Part IX of the Constitution through provisioning of financial and technical assistance under the schemes and programmes of the government and issue of advisories from time to time. The various measures taken include incentivizing the States which have devolved more functions, funds and functionaries to Panchayats, providing financial and technical assistance for capacity building of Panchayats to enable them to perform the devolved functions effectively and efficiently, strengthening systems of budgeting, accounting and auditing, development of software applications and imparting training for their use to bring in transparency, accountability and efficiency in their functioning, incentive awards to the selected best performing Panchayats and assisting the States in formulation of detailed guidelines for preparation of participatory Gram Panchayat Development Plans by the Gram Panchayats utilising the resources available at their command. Under the Fourteenth Finance Commission award, grants to the tune of Rs. 2,00,292.20 crore for the period from 2015 to 2020 are being devolved to Gram Panchayats of 26 states for delivery of basic services.********
