                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a)	 to (e): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2987 BY SHRI ACHYUTANANDA SAMANTA TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 15.12.2021 REGARDING JALESWAR-NEW DIGHA RAILWAY LINE.(a): Digha-Jaleswar (41 Km) New Line was sanctioned in 2010-11. The anticipated cost of the project is `1584 crore. The execution of the project could not be taken up as the State Government of West Bengal has not taken up land acquisition in West Bengal portion.(b) to (e): Bansapani-Barbil rail line project has been identified by Odisha Rail Infrastructure Development Limited, a JV Company of Govt. of Odisha (51%) and Ministry of Railways (49%) for development under Joint Venture Model. Ministry of Railways has accorded in-principle approval to this project for taking up pre-investment activities subject to 100% funding of the project by Govt. of Odisha. This project will reduce the distance between Barbil and the steel plants in Kalinga Nagar area of Odisha. This project is not yet sanctioned. Hence, no fund had been provided for financial year 2016-17.Completion of any Railway project/s depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forestry clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project/s site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions, etc.  All these factors vary from project to project and affect the completion time of the project/s. As such, no confirmed timeline of completion of the project/s can be ascertained at this stage. Nevertheless, Railways are making all efforts to complete these projects at the earliest.*****
