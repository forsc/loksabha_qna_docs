ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	and (b) According to IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5oC (2018), the social, economic and environmental factors underlying migration are complex and varied; therefore, attributing it to the effect of observed climate change or assessing its possible magnitude with any degree of confidence is challenging. (c) and (d) Migration is linked to both push and pull factors relating to livelihoods living conditions and opportunities.  Relief, recovery and rehabilitation are governed inter alia by the relevant provisions of the National Disaster Management Act and the guidelines, directives and orders of the National Disaster Management Authority and the State Disaster Management Authorities. The provision of public health facilities to the disaster-hit is governed by these provisions and other orders and the relevant activities of the health departments at the States and Centre. Disaster affected people are provided preventive and active health care in public health institutions by the relevant health departments. The Constitutional, legislative, legal and administrative provisions relevant to disaster management and disaster risk reduction suffice for the management of the health of populations affected by disasters in the country. The government of India stands committed towards combating climate change through its several programs and schemes. This includes inter-alia implementation of the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), which comprises of missions in specific areas of solar energy, energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan eco-system, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. The NAPCC provides an overarching framework for all climate actions. Thirty three States /Union Territories have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) in lines with NAPCC taking into account State’s specific issues relating to climate change. These SAPCCs inter-alia outline sector specific and cross sectoral priority actions including adaptation. ***
