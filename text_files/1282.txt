ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE  IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO) (a) and (b) India has developed 12 National Biodiversity Targets (NBTs) in line with the global Strategic Plan(SP) for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets.  The Strategic Plan and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets provide an overarching framework for the purpose of promoting broad-based action in support of biodiversity over the decade by all countries and stakeholders. India’s 12 NBTs are listed in the Annexure.(c) to (e) Several policies, programmes, and initiatives of the Government related to biodiversity contribute towards achievement of the NBTs. India has made significant contributions especially towards attainment of NBT 6 corresponding to Aichi target 11, relating to protected areas and other area based conservation measures. With well over 20 percent of its geographical area under biodiversity conservation, India has exceeded the terrestrial component of 17% of Aichi target 11 and 20% of NBT 6.  With only 2.4 percent of the world’s land area supporting nearly 18 percent of human population, this is a significant achievement.  India by operationalising the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing has also achieved the NBT 9 corresponding to Aichi target 16.  India has reported progress towards achievement of biodiversity targets in its sixth national report to the Convention on Biological Diversity submitted in December 2018, which is available at the link https://chm.cbd.int/database/record?documentID=241351. There are no specific shortcomings causing delay in achievement of the targets. **********
