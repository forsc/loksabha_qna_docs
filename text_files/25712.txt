ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION, MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)  (a) to (c): India has been registering a fair GDP growth rate(at constant prices) of 8.3%, 6.8%, 6.5%, 4.0% and -7.3% during 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 respectively. Year 2020-21 GDP growth witnessed a decline due to COVID-19 pandemic. Though the growth rates are less than those of Bangladesh during 2017 to 2020, such comparison of economies of significantly different sizes may not be appropriate. GDP Growth rates of Bangladesh (at constant price) are 7.1%, 7.3%, 7.9%, 8.2% and 2.4% for the years 2016 to 2020 respectively as per world bank database. (d): In FY 2020-21, Government had announced a special economic and comprehensive package of Rs.29.87 lakh crore under Atmanirbhar Bharat (ANB) to combat the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, to revive economic growth and to bolster employment. Union Budget 2021-22 has announced number of measures to support broad-based and inclusive economic development including a 34.5 percent increase in capital expenditure and 137 percent increase in health expenditure. Government announced a relief package of Rs. 6.29 lakh crore in June 2021 to strengthen public health and provide impetus for growth and employment measures.(e): As per the Economy Survey 2019-20, Government has articulated the vision of India becoming a US$ 5 trillion by 2024-25 at Current Prices.                                                   *****
