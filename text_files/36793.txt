(c)to (e) One of the fundamental principles of National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 is ‘substantial investment in a strong, vibrant public education system as well as the encouragement and facilitation of true philanthropic private and community participation’. It unequivocally endorses and envisions a substantial increase in public investment in education both by the Central government and all State Governments. It envisages the Centre and States to work together to increase the public investment in Education sector to reach 6% of GDP at the earliest. Accordingly, Ministry has written to all its implementing agencies, regulatory bodies, State/UT Governments, other stakeholder Ministries/Departments, etc for taking steps for implementation of NEP 2020. In this regard, the Ministry of Education has, for the first time, been allocated a record Budget of more than Rs. One Lakh Crore for its activities for the upcoming financial year 2022-23,which is an increase of 18.5% over Revised Estimate 2021-22 .*****
