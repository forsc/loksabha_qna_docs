ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR):(a): Administrative approval for implementation of the National Film Heritage Mission (NFHM) was issued on 24.11.2014 to undertake preservation and restoration of India’s film heritage in a Mission Mode. The Scheme is spread over 2014-15 to 2020-21 and envisaged at a total cost of Rs.597.41 Crore. The project is being implemented through the National Film Archive of India (NFAI). The scheme is continuing since its launch in November, 2014. However, there were reports in the media in September, 2017 regarding decaying of film reels in the NFAI, Pune. Following the reports, it was decided not to process any further RFPs until the activities under the NFHM are reviewed and a way forward is finalized. In this regard, a Committee of Technical Experts consisting of eminent film personalities namely Shri Shaji N Karun, Shri Ponnaya, Shri Piyush Shah, Shri K S Sasidharan and Shri Ketan Mehta, was constituted on 26.04.2018 to look into the condition of the films and related material at NFAI and to suggest ways and means of restoring them. The committee submitted its detailed report on preservation practices of NFHM/NFAI and suggested measures to be taken on technical and general aspects of film preservation.The present status/stage of the various activities envisaged under the NFHM Scheme is as following:i)	The ‘Collection Assessment of film material’ is completed and handing over is in process. ii)	The number of films to be preserved under the ‘Preventive Conservation of film content’ depends on the outcome of the collection assessment of films. As the quantum of work has been considerably reduced, the contract with the selected bidder for Preventive Conservation will be revised. iii)	The evaluation of bids under ‘Digitization of film content at NFAI’ is in progress. iv)	The Request for Proposal for “Restoration of Film Content” was floated on 15th November, 2019 with last date of receiving bids if 7th January, 2020. v)	NFAI has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with M/s National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) India Limited on 30th April, 2019 in relation to planning, designing and construction of Storage facility (Vaults) of Global Standards and maintenance of NFAI facilities at Phase I and Phase II. The preparation of a Detailed Project Report for vault construction at the NFAI Phase II premises is in progress.(b):	The Request for Proposal for “Digitization of Film Content at NFAI” was floated on 20th May, 2019 and evaluation of the bids is in progress. However, 566 films have been digitized out of which 325 films have been restored under the 12th Five Year Plan scheme on pilot basis.  (c):	The National Film Archive of India (NFAI) is the only National Archive in India which caters to the niche subject of preservation, conservation and digitization of film content. Along with films, the non-filmic material like posters, photos, song booklets, pamphlets, etc. is also digitized and restored for posterity. Further, capacity building programmes such as Film Appreciation Courses and Film Preservation Workshops are being undertaken on regular basis. The various technology partners associated with NFAI are –i)	Federation of International Film Archives (FIAF) and its member countries that also allows technological and cultural exchange in the field of film archiving. ii)	NIC, C-DAC and IIT Mumbai for information technology inputs. ***
