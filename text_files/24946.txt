ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF TEXTILES  (SMT. DARSHANA JARDOSH)(a) & (b):	Yarn Supply Scheme (YSS) is being implemented throughout the country through National Handloom Development Corporation to make available all types of yarn at Mill Gate Price. Under the Scheme, freight charges are reimbursed for all types of yarn and component of 10% price subsidy also exists on hank yarn, which is available for cotton, domestic silk, wool and linen yarn with quantity caps.As per the 3rd party Evaluation study of the implementation of Yarn Supply Scheme:i. YSS has been acknowledged as a successful scheme which has helped to increase overall production of handloom.ii. Reduced cost of good quality raw material and transport subsidies have helped the weavers to a large extent to sell their product at a competitive price and hence increase and regularise their net income.iii. The scheme provides good quality yarn at lower prices than the open market at the weaver door steps through depots which have been very helpful in sustenance of their engagement in handloom trade.(c) & (d):	As per 3rd handloom census (2009-10), average earning of Handloom Households was Rs. 36498 per annum (i.e. Rs. 3042 per Month).  Further, it was estimated that 99% of weaver households earned less then Rs 5000 per month. This proportion has come down to 67.1% in 4th Handloom Census (2019-20).To promote handloom sector, the Office of the Development Commissioner for Handlooms, Ministry of Textiles, is implementing the following schemes across the country:-1)	National Handloom Development Programme (NHDP)2)	Comprehensive Handloom Cluster Development Scheme (CHCDS)3)	Handloom Weavers’ Comprehensive Welfare Scheme (HWCWS)4)	Yarn Supply Scheme (YSS)Under the above schemes, financial assistance is provided for raw materials, purchase of looms and accessories, design innovation, product diversification, infrastructure development, skill upgradation, lighting units, marketing of handloom products and loan at concessional rates.(e):	To popularize Handloom Products in the international markets, Handloom Export Promotion Council (HEPC) organizes international Expos, events and RBSMs. During 2020-21, HEPC has organized 12 International Fairs in virtual mode.***
