HARSH VARDHAN)????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????, ??????? ?? ???????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ??????? ????????. ???? ?????(a) 	Sir, Department of Science and Technology (DST), under the Scheme for Young Scientists and Technologists (SYST), nurtures young scientists and technologists to take up Science & Technology (S&T) based projects of societal relevance with lab-to-land approach from across the country. Under this scheme, young researchers can align themselves with academic institutes, Research and Development (R&D) laboratories or S&T driven voluntary organizations for addressing local challenges. These young scientists and technologists then make concerted efforts to address challenges through S&T interventions and adaptive R&D. A total of 200 projects were supported in last five years and Rs. 25.11 Cr was allocated for the activities proposed under these projects. Some of the noteworthy achievements under the scheme are development of hand held equipment for making bamboo stripes for drudgery reduction of bamboo artisans, eco-friendly bio-formulation developed for poplar farmers, low cost dental brackets for cost effective dental treatment, eco-friendly package developed for tropical hills to cultivate orchids, cost effective wood composite blocks from wood dust and plastic waste, green cutting fluid for the benefit of industry workers etc. (b)	The Government of India has set up the Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) at NITI Aayog. The objective of setting up AIM is to create scientific temper and cultivate the spirit of curiosity and innovation among young minds. Towards this endeavour, AIM is establishing Atal Tinkering Labs (ATL) in schools across the country for students between grade 6th to 12th, equipped with latest emerging technologies such as electronics, IoT, 3D printing, Robotics, etc. Till date, 14916 schools have been selected for the establishment of ATLs and 4870 schools have received the ATL grant-in-aid.AIM is also supporting the establishment of new incubation centres under the Atal Incubation Centres (AICs) scheme that would nurture innovative start-up businesses in their pursuit to become scalable and sustainable enterprises. Along with AICs, AIM is also providing scale-up support to a few distinguished incubation centres of the country. These incubation centres, referred to as Established Incubation Centers (EICs) have already been in existence but AIM intends to further augment their performance by providing them scale-up support. Under this scheme AIM has provided support to 47 AICs and 9 EICs across the country.*******
