                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(DR. SUBHAS SARKAR)(a) to  (d) :	The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, developed by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), which sets the guidelines and direction for the development of syllabi and textbooks at all the school stages, emphasizes on ethical development, inculcating the values, attitudes and skills such as human rights, justice, tolerance, co-operation, social responsibility, non-violence and respect for cultural diversity, etc. required for living in harmony with oneself and with others. The NCERT textbooks, developed on the basis of NCF, 2005, prescribe themes and examples related to moral conduct across the subject areas and across the various stages of school education in the syllabi and textbooks for classes I-XII. University Grants Commission (UGC) has launched a policy framework- “Mulya Pravah – Guidelines for Inculcation of Human values and Professionals Ethics in Higher Educational Institutions”. It emphasizes that stakeholders of an institution, be they faculty, students, administrators or others, should be guided by the core values like integrity, dedication, trusteeship, sustainability, inclusiveness, commitment, respectfulness, harmony and belongingness.  Further, the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020 also provides for ethical reasoning, traditional Indian values and all basic human and Constitutional values (such as seva, ahimsa, swachchhata, satya, nishkam karma, shanti, sacrifice, tolerance, diversity, pluralism, righteous conduct, gender sensitivity, respect for elders, respect for all people and their inherent capabilities regardless of background, etc.). However, education being a subject in the Concurrent list of the Constitution and majority of schools are under the jurisdiction of State/Union Territory (UT) Governments, it is for the respective State/ UT Government to take appropriate action to impart the moral education on the students of their schools.****
