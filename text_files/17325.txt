                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI  & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  Cleaning of Rivers is an ongoing process and Government of India (GoI) is supplementing the efforts of the States for pollution abatement of river Yamuna, a major tributary of River Ganga by providing financial assistance to Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh since 1993 in phased manner under the Yamuna Action Plan (YAP). The pollution abatement work taken up under YAP relates to sewerage/interception and diversion of drains, sewage treatment plants (STPs), low cost creation of sanitation/community toilet complexes, electric/improved wood crematoria, etc which lead to the conservation of River Yamuna. Till date, an amount of Rs.1851.95 crore has been released as GoI’s share to above States under different phases of YAP and other schemes.(b)  Sewage treatment capacity of 942.25 million litres per day (mld) has been created under YAP- I & II in Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.(c)  The water quality of river Yamuna has not shown the desired improvement in Delhi due to a large gap between sewage generation and availability of sewage treatment capacity and also the lack of adequate fresh water in the river.(d)  A total of 13 projects have been taken up at a cost of Rs.2419 Crore to abate the pollution in river Yamuna which are at various stages of implementation. Through these projects, a total of 1385 MLD sewage treatment capacity (998.5 MLD STP capacity along with up-gradation & rehabilitation of 386 MLD STP capacity) will be created in Delhi.*****
