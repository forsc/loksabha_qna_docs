However, as per the National Sample Survey (NSSO Statistics-2011-2012, 68th round) estimates, 39 lakhs people are employed as domestic workers by private households, of which 13 lakh are male and 26 lakh are female domestic workers. (b):		Whenever any such incident is brought into the knowledge of the Government action is taken as per prevalent rules in this regard. Contd..2/- 2 ::(c) to (e):	The Central Government has enacted the Unorganized Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008 for providing social security to all unorganized workers including domestic workers. The Act provides for formulation of social security schemes viz. life and disability cover, health and maternity benefits & old age protection by the central Government. The state Government are mandated under the Unorganized Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008 to formulate suitable welfare schemes for unorganized sector workers including domestic workers relating to provident fund, employment injury benefits, housing, education schemes for children, skill up gradation of workers, financial assistance & old age homes.The Central Government in 2017 converged the social security scheme of Aam Aadmi Bima Yojana (AABY) with Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) to provide life and disability coverage to the unorganised workers, depending upon their eligibility. The converged PMJJBY/PMSBY scheme is for the beneficiaries in the age group 18-50 years and provides for coverage of Rs. 2 lakh, in case of natural death and Rs. 4 lakh, in case of accidental death. The converged schemes are being implemented through Life Insurance Corporation of India. A premium of Rs.342/- (330+12) per annum is required to be paid for the converged schemes. The premium is shared between the State Government and the Central Government in the ratio of 50:50. Around 2.83 crore beneficiaries have been covered under this scheme.           	The Central Government has also launched Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) which  will  cover 10.74 crore poor and vulnerable families providing  coverage up to Rs. 5 Lakhs  per family  per year  for secondary and  tertiary medical care & hospitalization. This scheme will also cater to eligible domestic workers.  The Central Government has also introduced a pension scheme i.e. Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Mandhan (PM-SYM) Yojana w.e.f. 15.02.2019 for unorganized workers who are mostly engaged as rickshaw pullers, street vendors, mid-day meal workers, head loaders, brick kiln workers, cobblers, rag pickers, domestic workers, washer men, home-based workers, agricultural workers, construction workers, beedi workers, handloom workers, leather workers, audio-visual workers or in similar other occupations. Each eligible unorganized worker including domestic worker registered under PM-SYM Scheme and who makes regular monthly age-specific contribution ranging from Rs.55/- to Rs.200/- will receive an assured minimum pension of Rs.3,000/- per month after attaining the age of 60 years. The Central Government contributes equal amount as contributed by subscriber towards the pension fund. On the death of the beneficiary during the receipt of pension, the spouse will get 50 per cent of the pension.*****
