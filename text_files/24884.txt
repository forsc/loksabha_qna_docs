STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 73 FOR 23RD JULY, 2021…..(a)	 Multiple States had repeatedly demanded that they be allowed to procure vaccines directly and administer them as per their requirements. In this context and based on field experiences “Liberalized Pricing and Accelerated National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy” was being implemented from 1st May’21 to 20th June’21. Under this strategy, Government of India was procuring 50% of the monthly vaccine production and continued to provide it to States free of cost for administering to priority groups. The State Government and private hospitals were also empowered to directly procure the remaining 50% vaccine. (b) to (d): In view of the experiences gained from implementation of “Liberalized Pricing and Accelerated National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy” and the repeated requests received from States, the Guidelines for National COVID Vaccination Program were reviewed and “Revised Guidelines for Implementation of National COVID Vaccination Program” were issued on 8th June 2021. These guidelines became effective from 21st June 2021. According to these guidelines, Government of India is procuring 75% of the vaccines being produced by the manufacturers in the country and cleared by Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL).  These vaccines are provided free of cost to States/UTs to vaccinate all adult Indians more than 18 years of age.As on 20th July 2021, a total of 34.82 crore doses have been provided free of cost by Government of India to all States/UTs since the beginning of vaccination drive (State/UT-wise details at Annexure-1) and 4.57 crore doses have been procured directly by States/UTs during 1st May’21 to 20th June’21. (State/UT-wise details are at Annexure-2).(e)   During the implementation of “Liberalized Pricing and Accelerated National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy” the total number of doses administered declined from 8.99 crore in April 2021 to 6.10 crore in May 2021. States through multiple communications intimated that they were facing difficulties in managing the funding and logistics of direct procurement of vaccines. This in turn had an impact on the total number of doses administered.(f)     A total of 11,197 Oxygen concentrators have been supplied and further one lakh oxygen concentrators are being procured. Further, 1571 Oxygen Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants are being installed across States/UTs. The details of Oxygen concentrators and PSA plants is at Annexure-3.
