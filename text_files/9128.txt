ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN] (a) 	At present, there are 36 Passport Offices in the country including one in Bihar and two in Gujarat. The list is at Annexure-I. There are 93 Passport Seva Kendras (PSKs) and 424 Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs). This lists are at Annexure – II and Annexure III respectively.  There are 517 Passport Kendras in the Country as on 28th November, 2019 as extended arms of 36 Passport Offices. (b)	The average number of passport and passport related applications processed per month at these 36 Passport Offices during the period January-October, 2019 is at Annexure-IV.(c)	In its Citizens’ Charter, the Ministry is committed to issue a fresh passport in ‘Normal’ Category within 30 working days (excluding PV). In case of re-issue of an ordinary passport, the Ministry is committed to issue it within 7 working days in cases where pre-police verification is not required and within 30 working days (excluding PV) in cases where PV is required. 	The average time taken to issue a passport during January-September 2019 is 9 days (excluding PV) in ‘Normal’ Category. It can thus be seen that there is no delay in issuing passports. However, at times, the process of issuance of passports gets delayed due to the following reasons:i. Late receipt of police verification reports;ii. Receipt of incomplete police reports; andiii. Late submission of requisite documents by the applicants.(d) & (e)	The opening of new Passport Kendras in various States in the country is an on-going activity and depends on various factors, including distance from the existing Passport Kendras and volume of applications from a particular region.***
