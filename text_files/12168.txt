                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (d) : As per the National Mental Health Survey, 2016, the prevalence of mental disorders in adults over the age of 18 years is about 10.6%. However, as per the study titled “The burden of mental disorders across the states of India: the Global Burden of Disease study 1990 – 2017” published in the Lancet Psychiatry, one in every seven people in India has mental disorder. To address the burden of mental disorders, the Government is implementing the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) in the country.  Under NMHP, Government is supporting implementation of the District Mental Health Programme (DMHP) in 655 districts of the country for early detection, management and treatment of mental disorders/illnesses. To generate awareness among masses about mental illnesses, Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities are included as an integral part of the NMHP.  Funds upto Rs. 4 lakh per annum are provided to each District under the DMHP for IEC and awareness generation activities in the community, schools, colleges, workplaces, with community involvement. With the objective to address the shortage of qualified mental health professionals in the country, the Government is implementing Manpower Development Schemes for establishment of Centres of Excellence and strengthening/ establishment of Post Graduate (PG) Departments in mental health specialties. Till date, support has been provided for establishment of 25 Centres of Excellence and strengthening/ establishment of 47 Post Graduate (PG) Departments in mental health specialties in the country. Tertiary level mental healthcare facilities are provided through dedicated Mental Health Institutions as well as Medical Colleges run by Central and State Governments. In addition to the Manpower Development Schemes of NMHP, the Government is also augmenting the availability of manpower to deliver mental healthcare services in the underserved areas of the country by providing online training courses to various healthcare service providers like medical officers, psychologists, social workers and nurses to deliver quality mental healthcare services throughout the country through the Digital Academies established at the three Central Mental Health Institutes.
