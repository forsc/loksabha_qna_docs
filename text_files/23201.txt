ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a)	The Government has accorded ‘in-principle’ approval for 100% disinvestment of Government of India (GOI) shareholding in Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL) (also called Visakhapatnam Steel Plant or Vizag Steel) along with RINL’s stake in its Subsidiaries/Joint Ventures through strategic disinvestment by way of privatisation. An Inter-Ministerial Group has been formed to work out the modalities. (b)	RINL has participated in the auctions conducted for iron-ore mines but has not been successful so far. Further its efforts to get allotments of iron-ore mines from State Governments under Section 17A of MMDR Act, 1957 have also not been fruitful.(c)	The receipts from strategic disinvestment of the CPSEs are used to finance the social sector/developmental programmes of the Government benefiting the people of the country. (d)	The ownership of the land acquired/transferred for the RINL vests with the Union of India. While finalising the structure of transaction, due consideration is made for hiving off of surplus non-core land & assets. The State Government is consulted in specific matters as and when needed and their support is also solicited in the matters that require their intervention.
