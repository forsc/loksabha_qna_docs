As per 2011 Census, the number of main workers  in the age group  of 5-14 years  in the country  is 43.53 lakh  which shows a decline  from 57.79 lakh as per  2001 Census.  State wise details of main workers in the age group of 5-14 years  as per  Census 2011 is at Annexure-I.Contd..2/-::  2  ::For elimination of child labour,  the  Government  has amended  the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Act , 1986  and enacted the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 which came into force with effect from  1.9.2016. The Amendment Act inter-alia provides for complete prohibition of work or employment of children below 14 years of age in any occupation and process and prohibition of adolescents in the age group of 14 to 18 years in hazardous occupations and processes. The Amendment Act also provides the stricter punishment for employers for violation of the Act and has made the offence as cognizable.As per provisions contained in the Act, whoever employs any child or permits any child to work in contravention  shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six month but which may extend to two years, or with fine which shall not be less than twenty thousand rupees but which may extend to fifty thousand rupees, or with both.Also whoever employs any adolescent or permits any adolescent to work in contravention of the provisions  shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months but which may extend to two years or with fine which shall not be less than twenty thousand rupees but which may extend to fifty thousand rupees, or with both.As per the information received from the States/UTs , the number of violations  detected , prosecutions launched  and convictions made  under the  Child Labour Act , State/UT wise , during the last three years  is given at annexure –II.                  The Ministry of Labour and Employment is also implementing the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme since 1988 for rehabilitation of child labourers. Under the NCLP, the children in the age group of 9-14 years are rescued/ withdrawn from work and enrolled in the NCLP Special Training Centres, where they are provided with bridge education, vocational training, mid-day meal, stipend, health care etc. before being mainstreamed into formal education system.  The children in the age group of 5-8 years are directly linked to the formal education system through a close coordination with the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan  and to ensure the effective enforcement of the provisions of the Child Labour Act and smooth implementation of NCLP Scheme, a dedicated online portal named PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) is developed in order to make the NCLP successful through better monitoring and implementation ensuring the timely disposal of work with transparency. **                                                ********
