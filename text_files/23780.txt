ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a)	The Government has conducted auction of right to use spectrum in 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz and 2500 MHz bands in March 2021.(b)	Total spectrum auction bid amount was Rs. 77820.82 crore, out of which 21,918.47 crores has been received as upfront payment in FY 2020-21.(c)	M/s Reliance Jio Infocom Ltd, M/s Bharti Airtel Ltd, and M/s Vodafone Idea Ltd have participated in this auction.(d)	The Reserve Price of each band of spectrum in each License Service Area (LSA) had been decided by the Government after considering the recommendations of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on Auction of Spectrum dated 01.08.2018. (e)	Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) have acquired 855.60 MHz of spectrum in the auction in 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz and 2300 MHz bands and will be able to use spectrum acquired in these bands for augmenting capacity of their networks which may improve quality of services provided by them.(f)	The correlation effect of auctions on the tariffs cannot be forecasted precisely, as there are many factors that play a role in fixation of tariffs. Presently, tariffs are under forbearance except for the ceiling tariffs. The telecom service operators have complete freedom to design their tariff offerings as per their best commercial interest and market conditions.
