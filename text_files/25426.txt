Further, the addition and deletion of ration cards under NFSA is a continuous process and new ration cards are issued to the genuine eligible persons/households under NFSA by all States/UTs (including Madhya Pradesh) as per their own norms and criteria. Further, this Department had advised all States/UTs, including Madhya Pradesh to identify all eligible and poor persons/households including vulnerable sections of the society for inclusion under NFSA up to the given ceiling limit of coverage of persons under the Act.***
