                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JALSHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) to (c)  As reported by Ministry of Environment,  Forest and  Climate  Change (MoEFCC), Hon’ble National Green Tribunal (NGT) in O.A. 477 of 2015 titled ‘Jan Sahyog Manch Vs.  Union of  India and  Others’ vide its  order dated  25.05.2017, had directed  MoEFCC  to  regulate the quality standards of  lead to be used for PVC pipes, inter-alia. Pursuant to that MoEF&CC has notified Lead Stabilizer in Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)  Pipes and Fittings Rules, 2021 vide Gazette Notification no.  G.S. R. 228 (E), dated 30th March 2021.Further, as reported by Central Public Health and Environmental Engineering Organisation (CPHEEO), an advisory on “Pipe Materials for Transmission of Water”, 2020, has been issued by them  recommending  all  pipe  materials with their advantages and disadvantages for adoption by the Implementing Agency in water supply projects.Water is a State subject. Power to plan, design, approve, implement, operate and maintain the water supply scheme is vested with the States. The Government of India supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical and financial assistance. Since August 2019, the Government of India in partnership with States is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), to make provision of potable tap water supply to every rural household of the country, by 2024. The Govt. of India has issued JJM Operational Guidelines under which it is provided that the type of material to be used under different terrain/ conditions should adhere to the CPHEEO recommendations for such conditions, as the case may be and as amended from time to time. Being the implementing agency, it is the responsibility of the Public Health Engineering Departments (PHED)/ Rural Water Supply (RWS)/ concerned Department in the States/ UTs, to ensure the adherence to the CPHEEO recommendations.  As such, neither MoEFCC nor CPHEEO has indicated any ban on any of the referred pipe materials being used in drinking water supply schemes.Under JJM, no study has been undertaken by the Department regarding the hazardous impact of pipe material on human health.*****
