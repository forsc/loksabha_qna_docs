NAS (2017) was administered with district as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as Languages, Mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools.

The learning levels of 15 lakh students in 44,304 schools across 610 districts in 34 States and UTs were assessed, in 5 subject areas of English, Mathematics, Science, Social Science and Modern Indian Language (MIL).The NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level and devise strategies for further improvement. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.(c) to (d) Standard of education is a comprehensive term that includes learners, teachers, teaching learning process, learning environment, curriculum, pedagogy, learning outcomes, assessment, etc. Samagra Shiksha focuses on improvement in quality of education by providing support for different interventions to all States and UTs, like in-service training of teachers and school heads, conduct of achievement surveys at state and national level, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment, grants for library, sports and physical activities, support for Rashtriya Avishkar Abhiyan, ICT and digital initiatives, School Leadership development programme, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, support for Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat, etc.Further, in order to improve the standard of education, the Government has taken several other steps:-1.
