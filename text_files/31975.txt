There are 8 medical colleges in 7 districts out of 24 districts in Jharkhand. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare administers a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for ‘Establishment of new Medical Colleges attached with existing district/referral hospitals’ with preference to underserved areas and aspirational districts, where there is no existing Government or private medical college.  Under the Scheme, 5 medical colleges are sanctioned at Dumka, Hazaribagh, Palamu (Daltonganj), Koderma and Chaibasa (West Singhbhum) in Jharkhand and 3 are already functional. Under Phase-III of the above Centrally Sponsored Scheme, all States/UTs were requested to submit proposals along with Detailed Project Report (DPR) for consideration by the Ministry. No proposal was received from the State Government of Jharkhand.
