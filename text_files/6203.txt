                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE; MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MINISTER OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????; ??????? ?? ???????????? ??????; ?? ?????? ??????? ????????. ???? ?????(a) & b): Yes, Neyveli Lignite Corporation India Limited (NLCIL) and Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) University had jointly undertaken the R&D project “Utilization of Bottom Ash for the replacement of river sand” during the year 2011-2014. Under R&D project, bottom ash samples of NLCIL power stations were studied for the suitability to use as an alternative to sand. The physical and chemical properties of bottom ash were tested. The bottom ash can be used in concrete / solid block and the effect of unburnt carbon in construction mix was also tested. The Bottom ash from Thermal Power station-I Expansion of NLCIL was found suitable as alternative material for sand as partial replacement (up to 50%). Based on the results, an experimental building was constructed at Neyveli and the performance was also evaluated. The study result proves that bottom ash is suitable for construction applications and it can be used as a partial replacement of fine aggregates and it is being utilized in the construction activities of NLCIL.(c)	It is observed that the mixture of cement, Fly ash, 50% Bottom ash gives strength which is equivalent to control mix (Cement, Fly ash, sand). The bottom ash concrete shows better performance in terms of strength, shrinkage and as well as the durability.(d)	The bottom ash properties vary from power station to power station due to coal / lignite mineral content and unburnt carbon content. Hence, specific study is required by the concerned power station to find its suitability in the field of construction.                                               ********
