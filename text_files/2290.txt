ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a ) to (c):  Airfares are dynamic in nature and are determined by Airlines,  based on  various factors including demand and supply. User Development Fee (UDF) is one of the factors in overall ticket cost charged by airlines to the passenger.  Further, Government of India has established Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA)  to determine the tariffs in respect of aeronautical services provided at major airports in the country.  AERA determines aeronautical tariff including UDF based on traffic projection made by an airport operator for a given control period of five years, fair rate of return on  investment   and  provisions to meet operation and maintenance cost. Therefore, reduction in previous UDF will not affect the expansion plan of an airport operator. ;(d): As per AERA regulation, all assets including metro station that are owned and located within Airport premises are considered as Regulatory Asset Base for tariff determination. However, the determination of tariff can be done only after the assets are commissioned and put to use.
