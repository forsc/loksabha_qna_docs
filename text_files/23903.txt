The same has been declared as National Project as per Section 90 of Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014. (b) Out of 16 projects which have been declared as National Projects so far, five projects namely Polavaram Irrigation Project (Andhra Pradesh), Saryu Nahar Pariyojana (Uttar Pradesh), Gosikhurd Irrigation Project (Maharashtra), Teesta Barrage Project (West Bengal) & Shahpurkandi Dam Project (Punjab) have been taken up for execution by the State Governments concerned. Details in this regard are placed at Annexure-I.(c) & (d)  A High Power Steering Committee (HPSC) has been constituted for overall monitoring of National Projects. As an outcome of the review, the status is reviewed, and bottlenecks for each of the National Projects are identified, based on which proposed plan of action is worked out. Twelve meetings of the HPSC have been held so far.
