JITENDRA SINGH):(a)	No Sir, no ban is imposed by the Government for recruitment of Scientific and Technical Support Staff (S&T) posts in ISRO. With the space sector reforms being implemented, greater emphasis is being laid on R&D activities, technology demonstration missions, Science & exploration missions, missions of national importance, human space programme & strategic missions realisation by ISRO. In line with this, to ensure optimal allocation/redeployment of the existing resources to these activities of the Centres/Units, a detailed exercise is being carried out. The recruitments will be made once this exercise is completed, only to ensure that right set of personnel are recruited suiting to the job requirements. (b)	Yes Sir. During June 2020, in order to enhance the diffusion of space technology, boost economy in the country and encourage private players in space activities, the Cabinet has approved Space Sector Reforms. In this regard, the following reforms are proposed in the mode of execution of space activities in the country:•	In order to enhance utilization and maximize benefits from the space assets, it is proposed to change the approach from “Supply Based Model” to “Demand Based Model”. New Space India Limited (NSIL) will act as the aggregator of user requirements and obtain commitments.•	NSIL to take ownership from DOS for operational launch vehicles, commercialize launches, satellites and services.•	Permit NGPEs to carry out space activities through an Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Center (IN-SPACe)•	ISRO to carry out capacity building in Space domain through development of new technologies and capabilities and enable sharing of facilities by NSIL and NGPEs.•	Announcement of Opportunities for NGPEs offering challenges in new domains of technology.(c)	Space reforms aims to create an enabling environment for private players to carry out space activities as detailed in para (b) above. The concerns expressed by the employees of ISRO regarding the reforms are addressed by the Department through appropriate briefing and its implication on ISRO. Further, it is clarified that the responsibilities of ISRO are intact with focus on R&D activities, technology demonstration missions, mission of national importance, human space programme, Science & exploration missions & strategic missions realisation. (d)	As detailed in para (a), recruitments to S&T posts are made to ensure that the resourses are optimally deployed across the Centres/Units. Further it is essential to ensure that right set of people recruited to meet organisation goals. Such exercises are carried out periodically to ensure required corrections in the system suiting to meeting the organisational objectives.(e)	Yes Sir. A Departmental Committee has been constituted in the backdrop of shift in mandate towards R&D. The terms of references of Committee are:•	Recommending methodology for rightsizing and optimal utilization of the current S&T manpower.•	Assessment of future manpower requirements in all categories of S&T.•	Any other recommendations which may be appropriate in view of the renewed mandate of ISRO.(f)	& (g) No Sir. The committee’s deliberations are in progress and recommendations are not yet arrived. Detailed assessment of requirement for future activities is under progress in coordination with Centres/Units of ISRO. ****
