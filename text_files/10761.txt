ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; AND MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING AND MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRY AND  PUBLIC ENTERPRISES (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a) to (f) Cyber space is a complex environment of people, software, hardware and services on the Internet. There are media reports about social media platforms being misused to spread fake news.           Under the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000, intermediaries, including social media platforms, are required to observe due diligence while discharging their duties. The Act also provides for removal of unlawful online content on being notified by the appropriate Government or its agency.         Further, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) through a program, namely, Information Security Education & Awareness (ISEA), has been creating awareness among users highlighting the importance of following the ethics while using Internet and advising them not to share rumors/fake news. A dedicated website for information security awareness (https://www.infosecawareness.in) provides all the relevant awareness material. MeitY and Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) as well as Police are in regular touch with various social media platforms to effectively address the issue of removal of objectionable content. MHA has issued a number of advisories to the States/ UTs including an advisory dated 13.01.2018 on cyber crime prevention and control.          The Cable Television Network (Regulations) Act, 1995 and Rules made there under inter alia provide that no programme shall be broadcast on TV which contains anything obscene, defamatory, deliberate, false and suggesting innuendoes and half-truths.  As part of self-regulatory mechanism, News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) has been set up by news channels to monitor news content.
