The implementing department for such projects are decided by the States/ UTs themselves. To supplement their efforts and to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources, the Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments through various schemes and programmes. The major ongoing schemes of the Department of Water Resources, River Development  & Ganga Rejuvenation include, the umbrella scheme of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY); Flood Management & Border Areas Programme (FMBAP); Special package for Irrigation Projects in Maharashtra; Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project; River Basin Management; National Hydrology Project; Polavaram Multi-purpose Project; National River Conservation Plan; Farakka Barrage Project; and Namami Gange. (b) The Central Water Commission (CWC) constantly monitors the live storage status of 120 major reservoirs of the country and disseminates the information in a weekly bulletin.  Based on the live storage status, advisories are issued to concerned States for judicious and prudent use of water and also for allocation of stored water for different uses, according top priority to drinking water. Whenever the percentage of departure of current storage of dam goes below 20% of Normal (i.e., 20% less than the average storage of last ten years), advisory is issued to the State Government concerned for judicious use of available water. During current year, such advisories were issued to Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Tripura, and Uttarakhand.  *****
