ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (a) to (d): From time to time, associations of employees of public sector general insurance companies submit their demands of their employees and suggestions for strengthening them. The suggestions received have included suggestions in respect of merger of these companies. The speech of the Finance Minister on the budget for the financial year 2018-2019 announced the Government’s intent to merge three public sector general insurance companies, viz., National Insurance Company Limited, United India Insurance Company Limited and Oriental Insurance Company Limited. Against the above background and upon further consideration of the matter, Government subsequently decided to infuse capital, focus on their growth and not to proceed with merger.*****
