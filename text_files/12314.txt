Agricultural labourers fall under both the Central and State Governments. Present Minimum rates of wages for the agricultural Labourers in the Central Sphere is at Annexure.(b) & (c):	The Central Government has revised the Basic Minimum wages on 19.01.2017 for the scheduled employments in the Central Sphere. In order to protect the minimum wages against inflation, the Central Government mooted the idea of Variable Dearness Allowance (VDA) in terms of recommendations of the Labour Ministers’ Conference held in 1988. Accordingly, in the Central Sphere, Variable Dearness Allowance (VDA) has been added as a component to the Minimum Wage and the same is revised twice in a year effective from 1st April and 1st October every year on the basis of Consumer Price Index number.*                                                     ******
