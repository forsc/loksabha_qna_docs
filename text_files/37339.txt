The EPF has representation from trade/industry, line ministries/departments, regulatory agencies, research institutes, state governments etc. Meetings of the EPF are held regularly to discuss the various issues affecting the exports, such as identification of potential markets, SPS/ TBT issues, market access issues, plans for export promotion and capacity building programmes etc. Recommendations made by the EPF are passed on to the relevant authorities for appropriate action. Exporters of millets are also entitled to assistance under various components of the export promotion scheme of APEDA.*********
