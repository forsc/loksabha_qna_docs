                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) & (b) Yes Sir. Although ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects as per the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, supplementing the efforts of the States remained top priority in Central Government’s agenda during the last three years. The Government of India has, on 27.09.2017, approved implementation of the umbrella scheme of “Modernisation of Police Forces(MPF)” at a total outlay of Rs. 25,061.90 crore. The umbrella scheme has two verticals – Security Related Expenditure (SRE) of specific theatres and Modernization of Police  Forces  of States & UTs.  Under  the sub-scheme of ‘Assistance  to States	-2/…-2-LS.US.Q.NO.332 FOR 04.02.2020for Modernisation of Police’ of the second vertical, the State Governments are provided central assistance for acquisition of advanced weaponry such as INSAS Rifles & AK series rifles; all types of intelligence equipments including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Night Vision Devices (NVDs), CCTV Surveillance system & body worn camera systems; modern communication equipment and state-of-the-art equipment for security / training / forensics / cyber crime / traffic policing. Further, ‘construction’ and ‘purchase of operational vehicles’ is permitted in the insurgency affected north-eastern States and Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected districts. The Crime and Criminal tracking Network & System (CCTNS) project has been implemented with the aim of interlinking Police Stations all over the country with the objective of tracking crime and crime related data across the country in common networked eco-system. (c) & (d) Ministry of Home Affairs is implementing Emergency Response Support System (ERSS) project through States/ Union Territories. ERSS seeks to enable a pan-India, single, internationally recognized number i.e. 112 based emergency response mechanism for various emergencies, including police, medical and fire, with computer-aided dispatch of field resources. 112 service is accessible through call, SMS, e-mail, panic button and a 112 India mobile app. ERSS has been operationalized by 28 States/UTs in the country. *****
