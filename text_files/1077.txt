ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                         (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) The Integrated Housing and Slum Development Programme (IHSDP), a component of Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JnNURM), was launched in December 2005. The period of JnNURM was  upto March, 2012. However, to complete the on-going projects sanctioned upto 31.03.2012, the period was first extended upto March 2015 and then upto March 2017. Under IHSDP, a total of 4,51,951 houses in 1030 projects in the country were  approved of which 4,04,062 houses have been  completed. State/Union Territory (UT)-wise details of projects pending completion in this regard are given at Annexure-I. Details of physical and financial progress made under IHSDP in Buldhana District of Maharashtra are at Annexure II.(b) & (c) Total central assistance involved/allocated in 4,51,951 houses approved under IHSDP was Rs. 6,161.45 crore of whichRs.6,437.14 crore was released uptill 31.03.2017. Excess release was due to cancellation/curtailment of projects at a later stage. As the extended period for completing the on-going projects under IHSDP components of JnNURM ended on 31.03.2017, no central grant is available after March 2017 for components of JnNURM and any spill over liability on cost of projects is to be borne by the respective State/UT Governments from their own sources.                   *******
