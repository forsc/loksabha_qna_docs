                                                        The Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance (a)	to (d) According to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines, banks do not have any Minimum Balance requirement for Basic Savings Bank Deposit accounts (BSBD), including accounts opened under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY).

BSBD accounts provide certain basic minimum facilities free of charge. For accounts other than BSBD accounts, as per RBI’s Master Circular on “Customer Service in Banks” dated July 1, 2015, banks are permitted to fix service charges on various services rendered by them, as per their Board approved policy, while ensuring that the charges are reasonable and not out of line with the average cost of providing these services. As apprised by eighteen Public Sector Banks (PSBs), the amount collected through the levy of charges for non-maintenance of minimum balance in Savings Bank account, during the last three financial years, are as under:Year	All eighteen Public Sector Banks (Amount in Rs. crore)2016-17	790.222017-18	3368.422018-19	1996.46The reduction in the amount collected through levy of charges by PSBs during 2018-19, inter-alia, include reduction in charges for non-maintenance of minimum balance by State Bank of India, with effect from 1.10.2017.
