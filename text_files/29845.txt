One of the notable interventions of the scheme is to mobilise, educate and transform Ward Members or Panchs into Sectoral Resource Persons with a clear role and to transform them into agents of change.

The notable intervention in this regard is rolling out of Audit online application under e- Mission Mode Project for online audit of Panchayat accounts. Further, scheme also supports innovative and economic development and income enhancement projects on a limited scale. ***
