ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE					(SHRI AJAY BHATT)IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE   (a) & (b): As per the present disinvestment policy of the Government, listing of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) is done to facilitate people’s ownership and improve the efficiency of companies through accountability to its stake holders.  It provides an opportunity to the citizens to participate in the wealth and prosperity of the CPSEs.  Government of India has disinvested 15.17% of its paid up equity in Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd. (MDL) through Initial Public Offer (IPO) and got it listed on the stock exchanges in October, 2020.  Like other listed companies, MDL is also required to meet the Minimum Public Shareholding (25%) norms of SEBI.  Hence, as per the extant disinvestment policy, any further disinvestment in MDL depends upon factors like investor’s interest and market sentiments.(c)  No, Sir.  The last order was placed in 2005.  However, RFP under strategic partnership model has been issued to MDL recently.(d)  Does not arise.*****
