However, since these projects have a long gestation period (say 3-5 years) and the rural people cannot be put to the risk of consuming contaminated water, all States have also been advised to install community water purification plants. This has been done with the objective of providing 8-10 litres of safe water per capita per day for drinking and cooking purposes only.Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has issued guidelines for ‘Detection, Prevention & Management of Arsenicosis in India’ to the Arsenic affected States. State Governments are also advised to strengthen District/Community Health Centre (CHC) infrastructure for early diagnosis, management and treatment of Arsenic affected cases and for this purpose seek necessary support in the State Program Implementation Plans (PIPs) submitted under the National Health Mission (NHM).(c) & (d):      A slight increasing trend has been noticed in the Cancer cases in the States of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.
