ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b)	 State of Assam suffers loss due to flood every year. The flood management & anti-erosion schemes are planned, investigated and implemented by the State Governments with own resources as per priority within the State. The Union Government renders technical guidance and promotional financial assistance to the States for flood management works in critical areas. Government of India  had launched “Flood Management Programme (FMP)” during XI Plan for providing central assistance to the State Governments for taking up works related to river management, flood control, anti-erosion, drainage development, flood proofing works, restoration of damaged flood management work and anti-sea erosion works which was continued during XII Plan. For the period 2017-18 to 2019-20, FMP is a component of “Flood Management and Border Area Programme (FMBAP)” Scheme of Ministry. 		In the State of Assam, a total of 141 projects costing Rs.2383.11 crore were approved and included under FMP.  During XI Plan, 100 projects with an estimated cost of Rs.996.14 crore were approved while during XII Plan, 41 projects with an estimated cost of Rs.1386.97 crore were approved. Since start of XI Plan, total Central Assistance released by Government of India to State Government of Assam under FMP till date is Rs.1201.36 crore. The Central assistance released to State of Assam during the Financial Year 2017-18 & 2018-19 under FMP are Rs.245.49 crores and Rs.142.12 crores respectively.Contd…P/2//2//(c) & (d) The recurrence flood problem in Assam leads to loss of life, property and creates ecological imbalance. Flood is a natural calamity and is attributed to various factors like wide variation in rainfall, both in time and space with frequent departure from normal pattern, inadequate carrying capacities of rivers, river bank erosion, silting of river beds, landslides, poor natural drainage, snow melts and glacial lake out bursts. Under the existing Scheme of State Disaster Response Fund/National Disaster Response Fund of Ministry of Home Affairs, there is no such provision to declare any disaster including flood as a “National Problem/Calamity”. However, in the event of disaster of a ‘severe nature’, financial assistance towards the notified natural disasters including flood is met from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) which is further supplemented from the cess-based fund of National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) in accordance with the established procedure, which includes an assessment based on the visit of an Inter-Ministerial Central Team.		The Water Resources Department (WRD), Government of Assam, have taken up various flood management schemes for effective flood and erosion management in the State with funds from different sources. The impact of the floods can be mitigated to a certain degree by adopting combination of structural and non-structural measures. Central Water Commission is running an elaborate network of Flood Forecasting System for providing timely early warning and forecast. The long term measures include construction of storage reservoirs, scientific management of catchment area, etc.*****
