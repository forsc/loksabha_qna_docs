                                                        THE MINISTER OF FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SMT. HARSIMRAT KAUR BADAL)(a) to (e): A statement is laid on the Table of the House.  STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) TO (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *317 FOR ANSWER ON 10TH DECEMBER, 2019 REGARDING “MEGA FOOD PARKS”.(a):	40 Mega Food Parks (MFPs) are in various stages of implementation under Mega Food Park scheme of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY). Out of these, 18 MFPs have been operationalized till date. Total amount of grant released under the scheme is Rs1288.62 crore. State/UT wise list of the 40 Mega Food Parks along with grant released is given in Annexure.(b):	The main objective of the scheme is to provide modern infrastructure facilities for the food processing industries. Modern processing and preservation capacity of 23.02 Lakh MT & 63 Primary Processing Centers (PPCs) with farm level infrastructure of 2.45 Lakh MT have been created so far in operational parks. (c):	Out of 40 MFPs, 18 MFPs have been operationalized and remaining 22 MFPs are expected to be operationalized during the next two years. Their distribution across States/UTs is given in Annexure.(d):	Ministry of Food Processing Industries does not establish Mega Food Parks in the country on its own. The proposals are invited through Expression of Interest (EoI) from time to time. At present, there is no proposal under consideration to set up any new Mega Food Park in the country including Uttar Pradesh. However, two Mega Food Parks in Mathura and Gautam Budh Nagar Districts of Uttar Pradesh have been given approval. As per the scheme guidelines, each MFP, on being fully operational, is estimated to benefit about 25,000 farmers. Farmers are going to be benefitted through the activities such as direct sourcing of raw material by the processing units, value addition and enhancing shelf life of agricultural produce, transfer of modern technologies of agriculture production etc. (e):	 Implementation of the projects within the specified timelines of 30 months is affected due to various reasons including time taken in obtaining statutory clearances from the State government, term loan sanction and disbursement from the lending bank, infusion of promoter’s equity and change by promoters midway. No increase in grant has been permitted for any cost escalation due to delay. Project wise cost for setting up of 40 Mega Food Parks is given in the Annexure. *****
