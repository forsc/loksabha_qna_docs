The role of Government of India is to form guidelines/instructions for scheme implementation, release of funds in the prescribed ratio and monitor the implementation of the scheme. All the issues pertaining to implementation of the scheme including timely payment of the honorarium to Anganwadi Workers (AWWs)/ Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) rests with the concerned States/UTs.  Payment of honorarium to Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) is to be made in Direct Benefit Transfer mode through Public Financial Management System/ Integrated Financial Management System/ State Payment Portal;(d)	The Government has, recently, enhanced honorarium of AWWs from 3000/- per month to 4500/- ; AWW at mini –AWCs from Rs.2250/- to Rs. 3500/- per month; AWHs from Rs. 1500/- to Rs. 2250/- ; and introduced performance linked incentive of Rs. 250/- per month to AWHs effective from 1st October, 2018.
