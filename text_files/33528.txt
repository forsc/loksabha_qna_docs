ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL)(a) to (c) Panchayat, being “Local Government”, is a State Subject and part of the State List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.  Accordingly, Panchayats are set up and operate through the respective State Panchayati Raj Acts and their performance is monitored mainly by the State Governments. However, Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) reviews their performance from time to time, through studies, review meetings, field visits, video conferencing, Information Technology applications, Common Review Missions (CRMs) etc.Article 243G of the Constitution envisages the panchayats as institutions of self government and provides that the legislature of a State, may by law, endow the Panchayats with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as institutions of self-government and for the preparation of plans and implementation of schemes for economic development and social justice. Accordingly, devolution of powers, responsibilities and resources are essential for effective functioning and success of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). As per a study conducted during 2015-16, by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), out of 29 subjects listed in the 11th Schedule of the Constitution, States of Jammu & Kashmir and West Bengal have devolved 24 and 28 subjects to their Panchayats respectively. In March, 2020, the State of Bihar has intimated that it has devolved all 29 subjects to its Panchayats.  Capacity building and training of representatives and officials of the PRIs, empowerment of the Gram Sabha to function as a vibrant institution at the Panchayat level and developing systems for transparency and accountability of PRIs are also essential for effective functioning and success of PRIs.In order to enable the Panchayats for preparation of annual plans in evidence based and structured manner, the People’s Plan Campaign has been rolled out as an annual event as “Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas” from 2018.The Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) is being implemented for capacity building for Elected Representatives (ERs) of Panchayat Functionaries and other stakeholders. Towards making the Gram Sabhas vibrant and for strengthening the rural local self- governance, a detailed advisory has been issued to the States/UTs in August, 2021.To strengthen functioning of PRIs across the country, MoPR has launched eGramSwaraj (https://egramswaraj.gov.in), a user friendly web-based portal, which aims to bring in better transparency in the decentralised planning, progress reporting, financial management, work-based accounting and details of assets created. Further, for ensuring timely audit of Panchayat accounts i.e. receipts and expenditures of Gram Panchayats (GPs), MoPR has rolled out an online application – AuditOnline (https://auditonline.gov.in). This application not only facilitates the auditing of Panchayat accounts but also provides for maintaining of audit records. This application streamlines the process for audit inquiries, draft local audit reports, draft audit paras etc. and thus ensures proper maintenance of accounts by Panchayats to improve transparency and accountability.Under the Fourteenth Finance Commission award for the period of 2015-2020, grants to the tune of Rs. 2,00,292.20 crore were allocated to GPs in 26 States. The grant was provided to GPs for delivering basic services. Under Fifteenth Finance Commission, Grants to the tune of Rs. 60,750 crore were allocated for the interim period FY 2020-21 and Rs.2,36,805 Crore are allocated for the period FY 2021-26 to Panchayats in all the three tiers and Traditional Local Bodies in non Part IX areas in 28 States.___
