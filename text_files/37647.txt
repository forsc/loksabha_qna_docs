                                                    (a)	whether the Government has made any assessment about the efficacy of nano urea and if so, the details thereof; (b)	whether selling price marked on the pesticides are much higher than their market price and if so, the details thereof; and(c)	the efforts made by the Government to check rising price of pesticides and ensure reasonable MRP on pesticides?    






ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI BHAGWANTH KHUBA)(a):	 Nano Urea developed by IFFCO has been provisionally included in Fertilizer Control Order (FCO)-1985, based on the preliminary experimental trials undertaken in several Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)/state agricultural Universities. Nano-urea spray on different crops gave comparable yields to those obtained under fully recommended doses of fertilizers with 50% savings in top dressed urea.  (b) & (c):	The regulation of price of pesticides does not come under the purview of Insecticides Act, 1968 and Insecticides Rules, 1971. Pricing of pesticides is market driven and to make available pesticides at reasonable prices, the Registration Committee grants registration certificates for generic pesticides expeditiously. Availability of more options to farmers ensures healthy competition in the market thereby having the effect of stabilizing the prices.                                  *********
