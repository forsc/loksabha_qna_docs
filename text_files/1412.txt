                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):     Public Health and hospitals is a State subject and regulation of diagnostic laboratories falls within the ambit of State Governments.  However, the Government of India enacted the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010 and notified Clinical Establishments (Central Government) Rules, 2012 for registration and regulation of clinical establishments, including diagnostic laboratories. In the State /UTs where the said Act is in force, the clinical establishments are required to meet the norms such as minimum standards of facilities and services, minimum requirement of personnel, maintenance of records and reports and displaying of rates at a conspicuous place. The clinical establishments are also required to follow Standard Treatment Guidelines issued by the Central/State Governments and charge rates for each type of procedure and service within the range of rates determined from time to time.Contd……-2-(b) & (c) Public Health and hospitals being a State subject, it is the responsibility of the States/UTs to ensure availability of labs in hospitals.  In 2015, under National Health Mission (NHM), Government of India launched National Free Diagnostic Service Initiative (FDI).  This initiative aims to ensure the availability of 56 diagnostic tests at district hospital level, 39 tests at Community Health Centre, 19 tests at Primary health centre and 7 tests at the level of Sub-Centre. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is supporting all State/UT in its roll out.The detailed guidelines is available on web link: http://www.nhsrcindia.org/sites/default/files/practice_file/Free%20Diagnostics%20Service%20Initiative.pdf……………
