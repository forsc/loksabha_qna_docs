ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b): 	Government of India enacted National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) which provides for coverage of about 75% of the rural and 50% of the urban population (67% of the total population of the country) for receiving highly subsidized foodgrains under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), which at Census 2011 comes to about 81.35 crore. At present, approx 79.53 crore persons are covered under the Act. The coverage under the Act is substantially high to ensure that all the vulnerable and needy sections of the society get its benefit. Directions are also issued by Government of India to all States to ensure full coverage of all vulnerable groups. However identifications and issue of ration cards is responsibility of the State Govenments.........2/--2-(c) & (d): 	Corresponding to the all India coverage of upto 75% and upto 50% in the rural and urban areas, State-wise coverage was determined by the then Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog) by using the NSSO Household Consumption Expenditure Survey data for 2011-12. Section 9 of the Act provides that the percentage coverage under the Targeted Public Distribution System in rural and urban areas for each State shall be determined by the Central Government and the total number of persons to be covered in such rural and urban areas of the State shall be calculated on the basis of the population estimates as per the census of which the relevant figures have been published. Any change in the State/UT-wise coverage is possible only after the population data of next Census is published. (e) & (f): 	A special dispensation was allowed for April-June 2020 to allocate foodgrains for all the beneficiaries, who are not covered under NFSA and to whom ration cards have been issued by the State Governments under their own scheme @ 5 kg per person per month. Under this, foodgrains were supplied by Food Corporation of India to States/Union Territories at flat rates of Rs 21/22 per kg for wheat/ rice throughout the country, as per the demand of the States/UTs. The dispensation has been renewed for the period from May 2021 to March 2022.****
