                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) 	A complaint was received in the Ministry of Women and Child Development from a survivor of child sex abuse attempting to report such incident later in life. The complainant had requested for permitting latter day reporting of childhood sexual abuse by adults.(b) & (c) Section 19 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 lays down that any person (including the child), who has apprehension that an offence under POCSO Act is likely to be committed or has knowledge that such an offence has been committed, shall provide such information to a Special Juvenile Police Unit or the local police. The POCSO Act does not provide for any period of limitation for reporting the child sexual offences. Hence any victim, at any time or stage, can complain about the sexual abuse faced by him/her as a child. (d) 	No, Sir. (e) 	Does not arise.*********
