ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS[SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR](a) The objective and primary purpose of Community Radio Stations is to broadcast radio programmes having immediate relevance to the community with emphasis on development, agriculture, health, education, environment, social welfare, community development and cultural aspects. There are a total of 329 Community Radio Stations (CRSs) in the country. A State/UT-wise list of operational CRSs is available at the Ministry’s website www.mib.gov.in. The total number of Community Radio Stations operating in the state of Gujarat is 11.(b) A State/UT and district-wise detail of grants disbursed to Community Radio Stations, including for the State of Gujarat, is available at the Ministry’s website www.mib.gov.in.(c) To support the Community Radio sector, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has approved a Central Sector Scheme Namely “Supporting Community Radio Movement in India”. Under the said Scheme, the Ministry organises Community Radio awareness workshops for creating awareness about Community Radio Stations, thus encouraging the process to set up Community Radio Stations in rural and urban regions across the country. Community Radio Stations are also empanelled with Bureau of Outreach Communication (BOC) of the Ministry for getting advertisements from Central and State publicity agencies. At present, 156 CRSs are empanelled with BOC.(d) Not applicable in the view of the above.(e) There are a total of 142 Community Radio Stations in the country operated by educational institutions and focussing on education & related programmes. However, other CRSs also broadcast programmes on education and related content as per needs of the community. As per the existing Policy guidelines, a Community Radio Station is expected to cover a range of 5-10 Km. For this, a transmitter having maximum Effective Radiated Power (ERP) of 100 W is adequate. However, in case of a proven need where the applicant organization is able to establish that it needs to serve a larger area or the terrain so warrants, higher transmitter wattage with maximum ERP up to 250 Watts can be considered on a case-to-case basis, subject to availability of frequency and such other clearances as necessary.****
