                                                        THE MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a) to (d)   A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.  *****   STATEMENT REFERRED IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.†*60 TO BE ANSWERED ON 22nd JULY, 2021 ON “INCREASING RIVER POLLUTION” RAISED BY  SHRI NIHAL CHAND.(a) to (d)   Rivers in the country are polluted mainly due to discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage from cities/towns and industrial effluents in their respective catchments, problems in operation and maintenance of sewage/effluent treatment plants, lack of dilution, dumping of solid waste on river banks and other non-point sources of pollution. Rapid urbanization and industrialization have compounded the problem. As per the report published by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in March, 2021, sewage generation from urban areas in the country is estimated at 72,368 million litres per day (MLD), against which sewage treatment capacity of 31,841 MLD was available. This gap between sewage generation and treatment remains a major point source for increase in pollution of rivers. CPCB in association with Pollution Control Boards/Committees in different States/Union Territories (UTs), have been monitoring the water quality of rivers and other water bodies across the country through a network of monitoring stations under the National Water Quality Monitoring Programme. Based on water quality monitoring results, pollution assessment of rivers has been carried out by CPCB from time to time. As per the last report published by CPCB in September 2018, 351 polluted stretches were identified on 323 rivers based on monitoring results in terms of Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), an indicator of organic pollution. State/UT wise details of identified polluted river stretches are given at Annexure.            Cleaning/rejuvenation of rivers is an ongoing process. It is the responsibility of the States/UTs and local bodies to ensure required treatment of sewage and industrial effluents to the prescribed norms before discharging into water bodies, coastal waters or land to prevent and control of pollution therein. For conservation of rivers, this Ministry has been supplementing the efforts of the States/UTs by providing financial and technical assistance for abatement of pollution in identified stretches of rivers in the country through the Central Sector Scheme of Namami Gange for rivers in Ganga basin, and Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) for other rivers.            NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches on 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country with the sanctioned cost of projects as Rs.5965.90 crore, and sewage treatment capacity of 2522.03 MLD has so far been created under the programme. Under the Namami Gange programme, a total of 346 projects including 158 projects for sewage treatment of 4948 MLD and sewer network of 5213 kms., have been sanctioned at a cost of Rs.30235 crore. Details of funds released for cleaning/rejuvenation of rivers in the country under these two programmes during last two years are as under:                                                                                                                  (in Rs.crore)Financial Year	Funds released under National River Conservation Plan	Funds released under Namami Gange programme2019-20	136.66	2673.092020-21	99.87	1339.97Contd…P/2//2//   	Discharge of industrial effluents is monitored by CPCB and the respective State Pollution Control Boards/Committees, and in case of non-compliance with the prescribed norms, actions are taken in accordance with the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.                Besides, in compliance of the orders of National Green Tribunal (NGT) in Original Application No.673/2018 regarding polluted river stretches in the country, States/UTs are required to implement action plans approved by CPCB for restoration of the said stretches in their jurisdiction within the stipulated timelines. As per the orders of NGT, regular review on implementation of action plans is undertaken in the States/UTs and also at Central level.Rivers are major source for drinking water supply in many towns/cities. Water supply and sewage management being the State subject, States/UTs are vested with planning, implementation, operation & maintenance, etc. The Central Government in association with the States/UTs has been implementing Jal Jeevan Mission to enable every rural household in the country to have potable water by 2024 at an estimated outlay of Rs.3.60 lakh crore. For urban areas, sewerage and drinking water supply infrastructure are also created under the schemes of Atal Mission for Rejuvenation & Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and Smart Cities Mission under the aegis of Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs. *****                ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTs (a) TO (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.†*60 TO BE ANSWERED ON 22ND JULY, 2021 ON ‘INCREASING RIVER POLLUTION’.Details of State/UT wise Polluted River StretchesS.No.	State/UT	Polluted River Stretches	Number1	Andhra Pradesh	Kundu, Tungabhadra, Godavari, Krishna, Nagavali	52	Assam	Bharalu, Borsola, Deepar Bill, Digboi,  Kamalpur,  PanchnaiBrahamputra, Kharsang, Pagldia, Barak, Baroi Bega, Beki, Bhogdoi, Boginadi, Borbeel, BordoibamBeelmukh, Burhidihing, Dhansiri, Dikhow, Dikrong, Diplai, Disang, Gabharu, Holudunga, Jai Bharali, Jhanji, Kalong, Kapili, Killing, Kohora, Kulsi, Malini, Mora Bharali, Parashali, Puthimari, Ranga, Samaguri, Sankosh, Silsako, Sorusola, Son, Sonai, TengaPukhuri	443	Bihar	Sirsia, Farmar, Ganga, Poonpun, Ram Rekha, Sikrahna	64	Chhattisgarh	Hasdeo, Kharoon, Mahanadi, Seonath, Kelo	55	Daman, Diu and Dadra Nagar Haveli	Damangang	16	Delhi	Yamuna,	17	Goa	Sal, Mandovi, Talpona, Assonora, Bicholim, Chapora, Khandepar, Sinquerim, Tiracol, Valvant, Zuari	118	Gujarat	Amlakhadi, Bhadar, Bhogavo, Khari, Sabarmati, Vishwamitri, Dhadar, Triveni, Amravati (Tributary Of Narmada), Damanganga, Kolak, Mahi, Shedhi, Tapi, Anas, BalehwarKhadi, Kim, Meshwa, Mindhola, Narmada	209	Haryana	Ghaggar, Yamuna	210	Himachal Pradesh	Sukhana,  Markanda, Sirsa, Ashwani, Beas, Giri, Pabbar	711	Jammu & Kashmir	Devika, Banganga, ChuntKol, Gawkadal, Tawi, Basanter, Chenab, Jhelam, Sindh	912	Jharkhand	Garga, Sankh, Subarnarekha, Damodar, Jumar, Konar, Nalkari	713	Karnataka	Arkavathi, Lakshmantirtha, Malprbha, Tungabhadra, Bhadra, Cauvery, Kabini, Kagina, Kali, Krishna, Shimsha, AsangiNalla, Bhima, Kumardhara, Netravathi, Tunga, Yagachi	1714	Kerala	Karamana, Bharathapuzha, Kadambayar, Keecheri, Manimala, Pamba, Bhavani, Chitrapuzha, Kadalundy, Kallai, Karuvannur, Kavvai, Kuppam, Kuttiyady, Mogral, Periyar, Peruvamba, Puzhackal, Ramapuram, Thirur, Uppala	2115	Madhya Pradesh	Chambal,  Khan, Kshipra, Betwa, Sone, Gohad, Kolar, Tapi, Bichia, Chamla, Choupan, Kalisot, Kanhan, Katni, Kunda, Malei, Mandakini (Mp), Newaj, Parvati, Simrar, Tons, Wainganga	2216	Maharashtra	Godavari,  Kalu,  Kundalika, Mithi, Morna, Mula,  Mutha,  Nira, Vel, Bhima,  Indrayani, Mula-Mutha, Pawana, Wainganga, Wardha, Ghod, Kanhan, Kolar (Mah), Krishna, Mor, Patalganga, Pedhi, Penganga, Purna, Tapi, Urmodi, Venna, Waghur, Wena, Bindusar, Bori, Chandrabhaga, Darna, Girna, Hiwara, Koyna, Pehlar, Sina, Titur, Amba, Bhatsa, Gomai, Kan, Manjeera, Panchganga, Panzara, Rangavali, Savitri, Surya, Tansa, Ulhas, Vaitarna, Vashisti	5317	Manipur	Nambul, Imphal, Iril, Khuga, Khujairok, Lokchao, Manipur, Thoubal, Wangjing	918	Meghalaya	Umkhrah,  Umshyrpi, Kyrhukhla, Nonbah, Umtrew, Lukha, Myntdu	719	Mizoram	Tiau, Tlawng, Tuipui, Tuivawl, Chite, Mat, Saikah, Tuikual, Tuirial	920	Nagaland	Dhansiri, Dzuna, Chathe, Dzu, Dzucha, Sano	621	Odisha	Gangua, GuradihNallah, Kathajodi, Nandirajhor, Daya, Kuakhai, BanguruNallah, Bheden, Brahamani, Budhabalnaga, Kusumi, Mahanadi, Mangala, Nagavalli, Nuna, Ratnachira, Rushikulya, Sabulia, Serua	1922	Puducherry	Arasalar, Chunnambar	223	Punjab	Ghaggar, Satluj, Kali Bein, Beas	424	Rajasthan	Banas, Chambal,	225	Sikkim	ManeyKhola, Rangit, Ranichu, Teesta	426	Tamil Nadu	Cauvery, Sarabanga,  ThirumanimUthar, Vasista, Bhavani, Tambirapani	627	Telangana	Musi, Manjeera, Nakkavagu, Karakavagu, Maner, Godavari, Kinnersani, Krishna	828	Tripura	Burigaon, Gumti, Haora, Juri, Khowai, Manu	629	Uttar Pradesh	Hindon, Kalinadi, Varuna, Yamuna, Gomti, Ganga, Ramganga, Betwa, Ghaghara, Rapti, Sai, Saryu	1230	Uttarakhand	Bhela, Dhela, Suswa, Kichha, Kalyani, Ganga, Kosi, Nandour, Pilkhar	931	West Bengal	Vindhadhari, Mahananda, Churni, Dwarka, Ganga, Damodar, Jalangi, Kansi, Mathabhanga, Barakar, Dwarakeshwar, Kaljani, Karola, Mayurkashi, Rupnarayan, Silabati, Teesta	17 	Total	 	351  *****
