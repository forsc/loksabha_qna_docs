(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	Government has been implementing Bhartiya Prakritik Krishi Padhati (BPKP) as a sub scheme of Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) since 2020-21 for the promotion of traditional indigenous practices. The scheme mainly emphasizes on exclusion of all synthetic chemical inputs and promotes on-farm biomass recycling with major stress on biomass mulching; use of cow dung-urine formulations; plant-based preparations and time to time working of soil for aeration.

This   reduces the conversion period from 2-3 years to few months and allows farmers for marketing of their produce at premium prices.   Car Nicobar and Nancowry group of Island under the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands with 14,491 ha cultivable area is the first Large Contiguous Area declared as certified organic. Government of India have already sanctioned and released Rs 11.48 lakh to Union Territory of Ladakh for LAC.(c) & (d):	Government has initiated programme to provide financial assistance to individual farmers with 8.0 or more hectare land @ 2700/ha for 3 years for Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) certification through Regional Council or National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) certification.
