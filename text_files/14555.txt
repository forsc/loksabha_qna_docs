                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (d):	Health is a State subject and the Central Government supplements the efforts of the State Governments in preventing and controlling cancer. The objectives of National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), being implemented by Central Government under National Health Mission (NHM) for interventions upto the district level, includes awareness generation for cancer prevention, screening, early detection and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. For cancer,  the focus is on three cancers, namely breast, cervical and oral.  A population level initiative for prevention, control and screening for common Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) i.e. diabetes, hypertension and common cancers viz. oral, breast and cervical cancer, has been rolled out in over 215 districts of the country, as a part of comprehensive primary healthcare. Screening of common NCDs including three common cancers i.e. oral, breast and cervical is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres. Awareness campaigns on common risk factors for NCDs, including cancer, and promotion of healthy lifestyle are also carried out through electronic and social media. Camps for awareness generation and screening for common NCDs are also organized at Pragati Maidan, New Delhi, during the India International Trade Fair each year.  Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research (NICPR), Noida, has launched www.cancerindia.org with the theme “India Against Cancer”, a portal that provides information on the leading cancers in India with a major focus on awareness, prevention and treatment of these cancers. To tackle the challenge of NCDs, including cancers, 616 NCD Clinics at District level and 3,872 NCD Clinics at Community Health Centre level have been set up under NPCDCS.  Under NHM, support is provided to States/UTs to provide free essential medicines and diagnostic services for primary and secondary health care needs.  To enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer, the Central Government is implementing Strengthening of Tertiary Care for Cancer Scheme, under which setting up of 19 State Cancer Institutes and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres have been approved. The list of such approved SCIs/TCCCs in the country alongwith funds released is at Annexure. Further, Oncology is also one of the focus areas in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar in Haryana and strengthening of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, are also steps in the same direction. Cancer is diagnosed and treated at various levels in the health care system. Treatment of cancer is by surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and palliative care. While doctors with D.M. (Medical Oncology), M.Ch. (Surgical Oncology) and M.D. (Radiation Oncology) treat cancer patients in higher level tertiary care hospitals, other doctors such as General Surgeons, Gynecologists, ENT Surgeons etc. also provide treatment for cancer in Government and private hospitals, depending on the type and site of cancer. The information regarding cancer patients in Government hospitals is not maintained centrally.. In Government hospitals, treatment is either free or highly subsidized. Treatment of cancers is also available under Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY). Besides this, Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment (AMRIT) Deendayal outlets have been opened at 203 Institutions/Hospitals with an objective to make available drugs and implants at discounted prices to the patients. Under the umbrella scheme of Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi, financial assistance is provided to families living below threshold poverty line for their treatment, including treatment of cancer, in Government hospitals.
