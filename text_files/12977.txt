ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a): India’s growth trajectory over the period 2014-15 to 2018-19 is characterized by macroeconomic stability with real GDP growth averaging 7.4 per cent, significantly higher than that of any comparable peer, both among advanced and emerging market economies. As  in  other  major  economies,  India’s  Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth also correlates  with  the  growth  of  global  output. As per World Economic Outlook Update of January 2020  published by IMF, world output growth is estimated to grow at its slowest pace of 2.9 per cent since the global financial crisis of 2009, declining from a subdued 3.6 per cent in 2018 and 3.8 per cent in 2017. The recent moderation in India’s growth coincides with a deceleration in growth of global output. World Economic Outlook  Update  of  January  2020  has  projected  the  growth  of  Indian  economy  to  increase  to  5.8  per  cent  in  2020  expecting  India  to  contribute significantly to an eventual pickup in the growth of world output. (b): Government has implemented several major structural reforms in recent years to bolster investment and growth. These, inter-alia, include Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to strengthen the financial system, Goods and Services Tax (GST) to simplify the indirect taxation regime, Make-in-India programme to boost domestic manufacturing capacity, liberalization of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) Trinity towards greater transparency, efficiency and financial inclusion. Recently, the corporate tax rate has been cut to 15 per cent for new domestic manufacturing companies, which is amongst the lowest in the world. In December 2019, the government has announced the Rs.103 lakh crore National Infrastructure Pipeline which would significantly boost infrastructure and spur growth impulses in the economy. Union Budget 2020-21 has also announced a number of measures to support broad-based and inclusive economic development. These, inter-alia, include rationalization of personal income tax rates to support domestic demand, a 16-point action plan for holistic development of the agriculture sector and critical measures to boost infrastructure and rural spending. The improvement in growth and the measures announced in the Union Budget 2020-21 are expected to further strengthen the economy.(c): The recent spike in CPI-C inflation is mainly on account of temporary increase in food price inflation. Government has taken various measures from time to time to stabilize prices of essential food items which, inter-alia, include appropriately utilizing trade and fiscal policy instruments like import duty and export management through instruments like Minimum Export Price, export restrictions, etc. to regulate domestic availability and moderate prices; imposition of stock limits and advising States for effective action against hoarders & black marketers. Government is implementing Price Stabilization Fund (PSF) to help moderate the volatility in prices of agri-horticultural commodities and has taken several measures recently to control prices of onions and pulses.  (d): An aggregated amount of Rs. 1,75,987.72 crore as surplus funds has been transferred from RBI to the Government. While accounted for Non-tax revenue receipts, Rs. 28000 crore was taken in 2018-19 as interim dividend and the balance of Rs. 1,47,987.72 crore in 2019-20. The transfer of surplus in 2019-20 was as per the recommendations of the Bimal Jalan Committee. In the BE 2020-21, an amount of Rs. 72000 crore has been included. The final surplus transfer is subject to approval of the Central Board of Directors of RBI.   (e): Repayment of loans to World Bank (International Bank for Reconstruction & Development, and International Development Association) during 2018-19 and 2019-20 is given below.Repayment of Government Loans from 2018-19 (Rs. crore)	2018-19	2019-20Total	19120.17	18071.38 Note: Data for 2019-20 is upto 24/02/2020 and for 2018-19 is provisional        Interest Payment of Government Loans from 2018-19 (Rs. crore)	2018-19	2019-20Total	0.35	0.37Note: Data for 2019-20 is upto 25/02/2020 and for 2018-19 is provisional (f): Utilization of loan (drawdown) from foreign countries/institution during 2018-19 and 2019-20 is given in Annexure I.
