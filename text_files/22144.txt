As of January, 2021, the Mission is being implemented in 6,360 blocks in 691 districts across all 28 States and 7 Union Territories (UTs). Cumulatively, 7.35 crore women have been mobilized into more than 66.65 lakh SHGs. Further, the SHGs have been federated into 3.86 lakh village level federations and more than 33,587 Cluster Level Federations. Cumulatively, these community institutions have been provided more than Rs. 12595.88 crore as capitalization support.The State Missions under DAY-NRLM finalize the number of households to be mobilized into SHGs on the basis of Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) data and through the process of Participatory Identification of Poor. Of the total 7.35 crore households mobilized so far, 3.07 crore households (42%) have been mobilized in the last 3 years (2017-18 to 2019-20).
