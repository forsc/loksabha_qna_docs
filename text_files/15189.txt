ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d) :  To achieve the objective of “Housing for All” by 2022, the Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana - Gramin (PMAY-G) w.e.f. 01.04.2016 and aims at construction of 2.95 Crore houses in two phases i.e. 1.00 Crore in Phase I (2016-17 to 2018-19) and 1.95 Crore in Phase II (2019-20 to 2021-22).  Against this target, the Central Government has allocated target of 2.21 crore to the States/UTs, including for 2020-21. The States/UTs have completed 99.06 lakh PMAY-G houses  as on 16.03.2020. At present, there is no proposal for extending the timeline for completion of 2.95 crore houses under PMAY-G.  The Government has issued guidelines on death of beneficiaries, temporary and permanent migration, unwilling beneficiaries etc under PMGSY. However, to  achieve the completion target in a timely manner by States/ UTs under PMAY-G, the Government has taken several initiatives and innovative steps which include: i.	Implementation and monitoring of the scheme through end to end e-Governance model using MIS-AwaasSoft. ii.	Evidence based monitoring of construction of house through uploading of geo-tagged photographs at each pre-determined stage of house construction.iii.	Single bank account (State Nodal Account) of PMAY-G at the State/UT level from where the assistance is transferred directly to beneficiary account through DBT.iv.	Increasing availability of trained rural mason by encouraging Rural Mason Training.v.	In many States/ UTs, house sanctioned under PMAY-G are assigned to a field functionary for better monitoring, hand-holding leading to timely completion of houses. vi.	Giving awards to the best performing States/UTs, Districts.vii.	Performance Index Dashboard, has been developed to monitor different aspects of implementation of the programme, both geographically and parameter-wise, wherein States / UTs are ranked based on performance on daily basis, thereby creating healthy competition and motivation. viii.	Increasing choices available to beneficiaries by providing a menu of house design typologies based on climate, topography, cultural and traditional housing practices and vulnerability to disaster.  *******
