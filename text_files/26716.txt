ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI AJAY KUMAR MISHRA)(a) to (d):	‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibilities to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens including investigation and prosecution of crime including cases of missing children rest with the respective  State Governments.  Specific information  on use   -2-LS.USQ. NO.2306 FOR 03.08.2021of Artificial Intelligence by States/ Union Territories to trace missing children or in any other investigation is not maintained centrally. However, as per information from Unique Identification Authority of India, missing children have been re-united with their families by NGOs/ Orphanages etc. using Aadhaar enrolment (with biometrics) in case child’s 12-digit Aadhaar (with biometrics) had already been captured in the Aadhaar database in the past. The Ministry of Women & Child Development has developed a national tracking system for missing and vulnerable children i.e. TrackChild Portal which has been implemented across the country. The URL of the TrackChild is www.trackthemissingchild.gov.in. The Ministry of Women & Child Development had also launched Khoya-Paya platform which is an enabling platform, where citizens can report missing children as well as sightings of their whereabouts. Details of children who have been found, can also be reported on this platform. Khoya-Paya is integrated with TrackChild.Further, any such development in use of Artificial Intelligence in crime and criminal investigation is a likely function of successful trial or deployment of this technology by the police in the States/ Union Territories. *****
