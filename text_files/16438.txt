ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION (SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a)	The Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education – Samagra Shiksha which subsumes three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE) from 2018-19. It is an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education. Under the Scheme, the State and Union Territory Governments are supported in universalizing access to school education. States and UTs are facilitated to move towards composite/integrated schools, by opening the new upper primary schools/sections in the campuses of existing primary schools through upgradation of the existing primary school. Similarly, secondary schools are opened through upgradation of existing upper primary schools and senior secondary school through upgradation of secondary school. While upgrading schools, priority is given to those schools which have adequate space and other infrastructure to be upgraded to next level of education, besides location in uncovered areas and having adequate enrolment.(b) and (c) 	Under the erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of SSA and RMSA since inception and Samagra Shiksha, approval has been given so far for construction of 3848 primary, 1047 upper primary and 54 secondary school buildings along with other infrastructure till 2019-20. Further, approval has been given for opening of 34 new primary schools to the State of Andhra Pradesh with an estimate of Rs. 1388.90 lakh for the year 2020-21 under Samagra Shiksha.(d) 	Yes, Sir.(e)	Under Samagra Shiksha, States and UTs are supported for strengthening of existing government schools, and for creation and augmentation of infrastructure facilities based on proposals received from respective State/UT, their eligibility as per norms of the scheme and physical and financial progress of the State/UT in respect of works approved earlier. *****
