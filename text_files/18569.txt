Ministry of Panchayati Raj regularly advises States for holding regular and timely elections to Panchayats.(b) The Government of West Bengal has informed that development programmes in Darjeeling and Kalimpong hill areas are being undertaken by the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA). Block Development Officers are implementing programmes in absence of elected bodies in Panchayats. No funds are allocated to Panchayats in those areas. Funds under National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP), wage component of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 (MGNREGA) are being sent to the beneficiaries through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode. Fund Transfer Orders (FTOs) for materials components are prepared by the concerned Block Development Officer and payment made directly to the agencies.(c) Yes, Sir.  (d) The Government of West Bengal has informed that one State Government Officer has been appointed in each Panchayat body for day-to-day functioning of the Panchayat. Grassroots level schemes are being implemented through existing office set-up in such cases.
