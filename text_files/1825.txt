MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D. V.

There is no definition of ‘Generic drugs’ prescribed in the said Act & Rules made thereunder.

Central Drugs Standard Control Organization(CDSCO) grants permission to Manufacturer/import of new drugs under the provisions of Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940 and Rules made thereunder in proper name. Details of number of permissions granted during the last three years are as below- Year	Number of Permissions Granted2016	1942017	2122018	239Total	645 (b)&(c):	Both generic drugs without any brand name and branded drugs are treated alike for fixation of ceiling price under the provisions of Drugs(Prices Control) Order (DPCO).

In case a violation of an order issued under DPCO is detected, action for overcharging is taken as per provisions of DPCO.(d):	No such proposal is under the consideration of the Government.(e):	In view of (d) above, the occasion does not arise.*******
