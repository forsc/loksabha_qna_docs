The last such survey was conducted during 2011-12. Now, NSO has switched to the annual Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), which was conducted during 2017-18.

The manpower planning and employment in Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) is aligned to the objective and targets of their business plans, prevailing business conditions & requirements and other factors like future operations, expansion/investment plan, retirement, attrition etc. In addition, recruitment under central government is primarily made by various recruitment agencies namely Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), Staff Selection Commission (SSC) and Railway Recruitment Board (RRB) etc. Besides these, many Ministries/Departments have their own recruitment mechanism for certain posts in their domain. There is no centralized agency to collect data from all recruitment agencies and from States/UTs. The Government posts are regularly filled up in accordance with the prescribed recruitment rules. The year-wise number of persons recruited through the main recruitment agencies of the Central Government and employment in CPSEs to the extent available is given below:Year	No. of candidates recommended by UPSC 	No. of candidates recommended for appointment by SSC 	No. of candidates empanelled/ recruited by RRB	Employment* inCentral Public Sector Enterprises(in Lakh)2015-16	6877	25138	79803	11.852016-17	5740	68880	26318	11.352017-18	6314	45391	24462	10.882018-19	4422	16748	6493	Not available *PSE surveys, M/o Heavy Industries & Public Enterprises, 	The above figures do not include recruitments made by the various Ministries/Deptt. through their own mechanism, State Governments, Banks, Other Financial Institutions, Universities, Statutory/ Autonomous Bodies and directly by the Ministries/Departments without going through UPSC, SSC and other recruiting agencies.

As on 17-01-2020, 16.6 lakh (appx.) candidates have been reported to be placed across the country under PMKVY. 		Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) has been initiated by Government inter alia for facilitating self-employment. Under PMMY collateral free loans uptoRs. 10 lakh, are extended to micro/small business enterprises and to individuals to enable them to setup or expand their business activities. 		 In addition to above mentioned, the Stand-up India Scheme is launched to promote entrepreneurship among Scheduled Caste/Schedule Tribe and Women for loans in the range of Rs. 10 Lakhs to Rs. 100 Lakhs. The Scheme is expected to benefit large number of such entrepreneurs, as it is intended to facilitate at least two such projects per bank branch (Scheduled Commercial Bank) on an average one for each category of entrepreneur. 				Government has implemented the National Career Service (NCS) Project which comprises a digital portal that provides a nation-wide online platform for the job seekers and employers for job-matching in a dynamic, efficient and responsive manner and has a repository of career content to job seekers.*****
