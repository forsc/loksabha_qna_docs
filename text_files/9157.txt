THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI  PIYUSH GOYAL)(a): 	Government has put in place a liberal and transparent policy for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), wherein most of the sectors are open to FDI under the automatic route. The Government reviews the FDI policy on an ongoing basis and makes changes from time to time, to ensure that India remains a attractive & investor friendly destination. It has been the endeavour of the Government to put in place an enabling and investor friendly FDI policy. The intent is to make the FDI policy more investor friendly and remove the policy bottlenecks that have been hindering investment inflows into the country.(b) & (c): 	Government does not fix targets for FDI inflows as FDI is largely a matter of private business decisions. Government of India has put in place a liberal and investor friendly FDI policy. FDI inflows depend on a host of factors such as availability of natural resource, market size, infrastructure and investment climate as well as macro-economic stability and investment decision of foreign investors.*****
