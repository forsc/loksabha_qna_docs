ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a) to (d): The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 in itsSchedule lays down Pupil-Teacher Ratio (PTR) for primary schools which is 30:1. As per theUnified District Information System for Education (UDISE) 2017-18 (provisional), the PTRat national level for primary schools is 23:1.Education is in the concurrent list of the Constitution. The recruitment, service conditions anddeployment of teachers come under the purview of the State/ Union Territory (UT)Government. The recruitment of teachers in schools is a continuous process and the vacancieskeep arising due to retirement, resignation and additional requirements on account ofenhanced students’ strength. However, Ministry of Human Resource Development has beenrequesting all the States and UT Governments for filling-up the vacant posts of teachers andtheir rational deployment, for which the Ministry issues advisories to all States and UTs fromtime to time.Further, the Central Government through the centrally sponsored Scheme of SamagraShiksha, provides assistance to the States and UTs for deployment of additional teachers tomaintain appropriate Pupil Teacher Ratio as per the prescribed norms for various levels ofschooling.******
