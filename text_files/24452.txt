                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b) Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Shyama Prasad MukherjiRurban Mission (SPMRM) which was launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister on February 21st, 2016 to provide catalytic interventions to rural areas on the threshold of accelerated growth through a cluster based approach. Mission strives to strengthen the rural areas by providing economic, social and infrastructure amenities, thus leading to sustainable and balanced regional development in the country.   Under the Mission, a total of 300 Rurban clusters with thematic economic growth points are to be developed across the country, with a funding support of up to 30% of the estimated investment for each Rurban cluster, given as Critical Gap Funding (CGF), while 70% or more of the funds are mobilized by the States through convergence with synergic State and Central programmes. Cluster based plans are made following decentralised planning and efficient convergence of local efforts and resources to achieve their development aspirations. The Rurban Clusters are not selected constituency-wise.   As per the guidelines /Framework of Implementation of SPMRM, a ‘Rurban cluster’, would be a cluster of geographically contiguous villages with a population of about 25000 to 50000 in plain and coastal areas and with a population of 5000 to 15000 in desert, hilly or tribal areas. For selection of clusters, the Ministry would provide a list of leading sub districts to each State, and within these sub districts so identified by the Ministry, the State Governments would select the clusters.  The detailed guidelines / Framework of Implementation (FOI) of the Mission may be seen by visiting the Rurban website, i.e., https://rurban.gov.in.   (c) & (d) Yes Sir.  The Ministry held detailed consultations to identify the immediate and medium to long term impacts of the pandemic and ensuing lock down on the community institutions.   (Some Part Deleted in between) Considering the massive outreach of the project, National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM)/National Rural Economic Transformation Project (NRETP) is in a prime position to launch interventions which could positively impact the lives of millions of households. In this context, the Ministry has emphasized its focus on the following three components: a)      Community Investment Fund (CIF) - Support to SHGs and federations in undercapitalized areas - All efforts are being made to capitalize these SHGs to the level consistent with NRLM guidelines, so that they can make loans for livelihoods activities. b)     Support for Migrant households - Innovative projects are being proposed to support migrant households in some of the States, viz. Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Some of key interventions (i) inclusion of migrant households in SHGs and access to CIF etc.(ii)  undertaking skill-mapping and facilitating at least one additional livelihoods source for the migrant households; (iii) access to food, basic health and nutrition support services; (iv) facilitating access to rights and entitlements, employment support; etc. c)      Implementing Innovation/Pilot Projects:  In order to build resilience to future shocks and taking into account learning emerging from the current situation, NRLM/NRETP will finance pilot projects in the areas of Health and Nutrition, Financial Inclusion, Farm Livelihoods and for returned migrant workers, which are as follows: (i)      Health and Pilot Nutrition Projects : Building on lessons from state level programs, such as JEEViKA (Bihar) and Umed (Maharashtra), the pilot projects will expand these approaches to key states – Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. focused on (i) spreading awareness about key health and nutrition aspects; (ii) behavior change communication; (iii) strengthening convergence with front line workers such as ASHA workers; and (iv) promoting dietary diversity and scaling of agri-nutri garden intervention. (ii)   Credit Risk Fund for Enterprise loans - Apart from providing working capital support to enterprises as per approved guidelines, it is envisaged that NRLM/NRETP would pilot provisioning of Credit Risk Fund (CRF) for these entrepreneurs. CRF is an established mechanism of financing within the banking industry wherein the parties involved (the bank and the entrepreneur) share the risk. (iii)  Promotion of Integrated Farming Clusters - In order to augment the livelihoods basket of the poor, Integrated Farming Clusters (IFC) will be promoted under the project. Each IFC will comprise of 2-3 adjoining villages covering about 250-300 households wherein every household will have 3-4 Livelihoods (farm and non-farm) with strong backward and forward linkages. Special emphasis will be placed on targeting landless and marginal farmers. In addition to above, the implementation of all other schemes, like MGNREGS, PMAY-G, PMGSY, NSAP, etc., is also being monitored closely for their expeditious delivery.  It may also be mentioned that the basic principle behind people’s plan campaign also known as Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) is evidence based planning for the Gram Panchayat aggregating the resources available within the Gram Panchayat including Central Finance Commission Grants and the Mahatma Gandhi NREG Scheme.   Ministry of Rural Development is actively participating and promoting their endeavour. *****
