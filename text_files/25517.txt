ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a): 	Government is implementing a placement linked skill development programme, Deendayal Upadhyaya-Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), for rural poor youth under National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) all over the country including the State of Karnataka. DDU-GKY is being implemented by 871 PIAs operating 2322 Training centres across the country. Under DDU-GKY, a total of 10.89 lakh candidates have been trained [since its inception (September, 2014) till June, 2021] while 7.04 Lakh candidates have been placed.  The State-wise number of candidates trained and placed since 2014-15 till June, 2021 is given at Annexure.(b): 	Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) aims at mobilizing about 9-10 crore rural poor households into Self Help Groups (SHGs) and provide them long-term support such that they diversify their livelihoods, improve their incomes and quality of life. While doing so, DAY-NRLM ensures adequate coverage of vulnerable sections of the society such as people belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, minority groups and persons with disability, while keeping in view the overall coverage of the rural poor households.The SHGs and their federations promoted under DAY-NRLM provide a close and long-term handholding support to each of their members and enable them to access financial services from Banks, diversify and stabilize their livelihoods and effectively access their entitlements. Community driven approach is central to the Mission’s implementation strategy. Since inception of the programme, the Mission has made a stride in achieving the following milestones-o	Outreach in 6758 blocks spread over 705 districts across 28 States and 6 UTs under the intensive strategy;o	7.63 crore women mobilized into 69.92 lakh Self-Help Groups (SHGs);o	Capitalization support of more than Rs. 14071 crore has been provided to the SHGs;o	More than 3.3 lakh Community Resource Persons trained on multiple interventions;o	More than Rs 3.82 lakh crore of Bank credit has been accessed by the SHGs since 2013-14;o	1.19 crore women farmers have been covered under Farm interventions which promote sustainable agriculture, livestock and Non Timber Forest Produce (NTFP); ando	More than 1.57 lakh enterprises supported under SVEP.DAY-NRLM has set up sensitive and dedicated support structures at all levels of Mission architecture. These support structures are staffed with dedicated professionals. These structures keep on nurturing institutions of poor, through community mobilization, institutional building and creating livelihood opportunities. Further, the program is extensively monitored and reviewed at all levels (National, State, District and Sub-District levels) on a regular basis (monthly/ quarterly/ half-yearly) to keep track of the progress under all program components.From the national level, monitoring by the National Level Monitors and the Common Review Mission provide useful insights for undertaking course-corrective measures helpful in overcoming challenges for effective program implementation.(c) & (d): National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET) is an overarching skills regulatory body which regulates the functioning of entities engaged in vocational education & Training and establish minimum standards for the functioning of such entities. There are no such separate goals set by (NCVET) under DDUGKY. The Action Plan targets for DDUGKY are approved by the Empowered Committee of NRLM.********
