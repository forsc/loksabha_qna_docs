Subsequently, further surveys were conducted in early 2021 regarding availability of various forms of digital devices with children.(c) & (d): The Ministry has undertaken an initiative, namely ‘Manodarpan’, covering a wide range of activities to provide psychosocial support to students, teachers and families for Mental Health and Emotional Wellbeing during the COVID outbreak and beyond.A Webpage on the website of this Ministry (https://manodarpan.education.gov.in ) has also been created.
