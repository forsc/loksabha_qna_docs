However, cases registered under various heads of heinous and non-heinous crimes have shown decline during 2017 and 2018 when compared to previous years and also in the current year (upto 15/09/2019) when compared to the corresponding period in 2018.(d)	: As reported by NCRB, Metropolitan City-wise and State/UT-wise cases reported under murder, causing death by negligence, Auto/Motor vehicle theft, and robbery during 2015-17 are at Annexure-I and Annexure-II respectively.

(*As reported by NCRB, the latest data available in this regard pertains to 2016).(e)	: As per the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India, the primary responsibility with respect to ‘Police’ & ‘Public Order’ lies with the State Governments concerned.  In so far NCT of Delhi is concerned, Delhi Police has instituted a number of measures to both prevent and expeditiously detect crimes in the NCT of Delhi, of which major ones include, action against organized crime, arrest/surveillance of notorious criminals, joint group patrolling in vulnerable areas to enhance Police visibility, enhanced focus on beat policing, including through re-organisation of beats, closer surveillance of criminals and citizen-centric policing through ‘Jan Sampark’ and other community approach programmes.*****
