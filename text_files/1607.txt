ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (d):	Reforms in labour laws are an on-going process to update the legislative system to address the need of the hour so as to make them more effective, flexible and in sync with emerging economic and industrial scenario. Accordingly, in line with the recommendations of the Second National Commission on Labour , the Ministry has taken steps for drafting four Labour Codes on Wages; Industrial Relations; Social Security; and Occupation Safety, Health and Working Conditions respectively, by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the relevant provisions of the existing Central Labour Laws. All the 4 Labour Codes contain provisions relating to wage, social security, safety, health and grievance redressal mechanism for workers. The proposed codification will also make the existing labour laws in sync with the emerging economic scenario; reduce the complexity by providing uniform definitions and reduction in multiple authorities under various Acts and bring transparency and accountability in enforcement of labour laws. This in turn would lead to formalization along with ensuring safety, social security and welfare of workers.  At present, the 4 draft Labour Codes are at pre-legislative stage.*******
