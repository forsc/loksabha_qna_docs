ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a): Implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 requires multiple initiatives and actions which have to be taken by multiple bodies in a synchronized and systematic manner. Therefore, the implementation of this Policy is led by various bodies including Ministry of Education, Central Advisory Board of Education, Union and State Governments, education-related Ministries, State Departments of Education, Boards, National Testing Agency, the regulatory bodies of school and higher education, National Council of Educational Research and Training, State Council of Educational Research and Training, schools and Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs). Since, education is a concurrent subject, State/UT Government play a vital role in the implementation of the National Education Policy 2020. The policy provides different timelines as well as principles and methodology for its implementation.(b) & (c): The NEP, 2020 envisions that the M.Phil. programme shall be discontinued. The University Grants Commission has informed that old students who have done M.Phil or already enrolled for M.Phil will not be affected.*****
