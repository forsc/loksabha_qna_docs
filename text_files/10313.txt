ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	Yes, sir. The decision to impose export restrictions on a farm product is based on a number of factors such as domestic supply and price position, concerns of food security, need to balance between remunerative prices to the growers and availability of agricultural products to common man at affordable prices, requirements of importing countries, etc. Among the major agricultural products, restrictions exist on export of mustard oil, which is allowed to be exported only in branded consumer packs of up to 5 Kg subject to a Minimum Export Price of USD 900 per MT. The export of onions has been prohibited with effect from 29th September 2019. In addition, the export of a number of seed varieties is restricted.(b)	The Government is in favour of a stable export policy for the farm products. The Agriculture Export Policy provides that export restrictions will be imposed only on the commodities, which are essential for food security, under extreme price situation based on decision of a high-level committee. Consequently, mandate of the Committee of Secretaries on ‘Essential commodities’ has been expanded to provide recommendation on export restrictions on a few commodities, which are essential for food security, under extreme price situation only.***********
