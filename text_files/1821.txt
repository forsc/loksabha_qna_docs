                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	The State/UT-wise number of houses constructed, funds released and utilized under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojna - Gramin (PMAY-G) during the last three years (2016-17, 2017-18, and 2018-19) and the current year (2019-20), which includes the State of Tamil Nadu are given at Annexure I and II.(c):	The erstwhile rural housing scheme has been re-structured into PMAY-G to achieve the objective of “Housing for All” by 2022. To achieve this objective, the target number of houses to be constructed under PMAY-G by the year 2021-22, is 2.95 Crore which is to be achieved in  phases. In the first phase 1.00 crore houses were taken up for construction in 3 years i.e., 2016-17 to 2018-19 and in the second phase 1.95 crore houses are targeted for construction in 3 years i.e., 2019-20 to 2021-22. As on 27th June 2019, under PMAY-G, a total of 1,00,93,550 houses have been sanctioned out of which 81,45,763 houses have been completed. (d):	Under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), beneficiaries are identified based on housing and socio-economic deprivation parameters as per Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) – 2011 data. Accordingly, all rural households who are houseless and living in zero, one and two room kutcha house and subject to exclusion parameters as per SECC 2011 are provided assistance under PMAY-G. As on 27th June 2019, a total of 1,00,93,550 houses have been sanctioned to eligible  deprived rural households under PMAY-G.(e) & (f):	The target set under PMAY-G is construction of 2.95 crore pucca houses by 2022.  In order to achieve the target by the year 2022, following steps have been taken by the Government :-i.	All States / UTs now have  a single bank account of PMAY-G at the State/UT level, the State Nodal Account, from where the assistance is transferred directly to beneficiary  account through Fund Transfer Order, thus ensuring smooth and faster transfer of funds to the beneficiary.ii.	Implementation and monitoring of the scheme is through end to end e-Governance model. All activities of implementation of scheme from identification of beneficiaries till completion of houses are done through MIS-AwaasSoft. iii.	Evidence based monitoring of construction of house through uploading of geo-tagged photographs at each pre-determined stage of house construction through the mobile application- AwaasApp. This has helped in reduction of time in verification of house construction enabling  faster release of assistance leading to timely house completion.iv.	Increasing availability of trained rural mason by implementing ''on the job''  Rural Mason Training Programme which has helped in construction of quality houses at a faster pace.v.	Assigning each house sanctioned under PMAY-G to a local functionary to improve monitoring and facilitate timely construction of houses.vi.	Awards to the best performing States/UTs based on performance index dashboard, thereby creating healthy competition and motivation among the States/ UTs for achieving the set targets.*****
