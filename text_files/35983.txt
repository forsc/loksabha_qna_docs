                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)  (a)	to (f):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT  REFERRED  TO  IN  REPLY  TO  PARTS  (a) to (f)  OF  LOK  SABHA  STARRED  QUESTION  NO. 292    FOR  ANSWER    ON  23rd  MARCH, 2022     REGARDING   “ IMPORT OF PALM OIL”.(a):	Yes, Sir. India is the largest importer of edible oils i.e., palm oil, in the world. India''s Import of edible oils during the last three financial years (FYs) are as under:YEAR	QTY (TON)2018-19	1,50,19,308.542019-20	1,47,22,123.782020-21	1,35,40,020.94Source: DGCI&S(b) & (c):  At present, adherence to NDPE (No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation) policies is not mandatory for import of palm oil into India. However, both Malaysia and Indonesia, which are the major suppliers of palm oil to India, have certification schemes to promote sustainability in palm oil production. It is mandatory for palm oil produced in Malaysia to be certified under the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO). In addition, Roundtable Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification is also gaining importance in Malaysia. Indonesia has also adopted the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) standard to promote sustainability in palm oil production. The Government has not received any quality-related complaints in palmolein imported from Malaysia and Indonesia.(d):	As per Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restrictions on Sales) Third Amendment Regulations, 2021, sale of Multi Source Edible Vegetable Oil is allowed only in containers, marked and labelled in the manner as specified in FSSAI regulations. However, State Governments can exempt any edible oil from these provisions in specific circumstances and for specific period. (e) :      The details of the total palm oil imports from Malaysia and Indonesia during each of the last three years are at Annexure.(f) :   In order to reduce dependence on imports, the Government has launched the National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) with the aim to augment the availability of edible oil in the country by harnessing area expansion and increasing crude palm oil production. The salient features of NMEO-Oil palm include assistance for planting material, inputs for intercropping up to gestation period of 4 years and for maintenance, establishment of seed gardens, nurseries, micro irrigation, bore well/pump set/water harvesting structure, vermi compost units, solar pumps, harvesting tools, custom hiring centre cum harvester Groups, farmers and officers training, and for replanting of old oil palm gardens etc.********  AnnexureDetails of India’s palm oil imports from Malaysia and IndonesiaQty in MT; Value in USD MillionITCHS	DESCRIPTION	COUNTRY	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21			Qty	Val	Qty	Val	Qty	Val15132110	CRUDE PALM KERNEL OIL	INDONESIA	67571	60.32	77868.02	54.71	46919	40.99		MALAYSIA	49426	42.09	62654.54	39.04	59789.58	58.1415132910	REFND PALM KERNEL OIL AND ITS FRACTNS	INDONESIA	2216	2.15	2642	2.04	3944	3.32		MALAYSIA	560.4	0.57	839.63	0.71	4175.33	4.5615111000	CRUDE PALM OIL AND ITS FRACTNS	INDONESIA	4156999.7	2341.27	4272207.1	2548.76	4095159.5	3071.91		MALAYSIA	1712902.2	1009.41	1488524.5	828.76	2799267.3	2209.1215119010	REFINED BLEACHED DEODRSED PALM OIL	INDONESIA	8984.88	5.67	1493.05	0.8	4838	3.82		MALAYSIA	4079.82	2.93	2266.13	1.42	 -	 -15119020	REFINED BLCHD DEODRSED PALMOLEIN	INDONESIA	1617720.8	985.48	286323.79	183.41	79783.95	56.79		MALAYSIA	696908.87	425.02	1715637.9	966.18	1695.16	1.7215119030	REFINED BLEACHED DEODORISED PALM STEARIN	INDONESIA	 -	 -	76045	43.55	28864	22.02		MALAYSIA	 -	 -	11067	5.91	2971	2.1715119090	OTHER REFINED PALM OIL	INDONESIA	51139	31.49	6836	3.66	0	0		MALAYSIA	15549.19	10.61	61044.11	31.18	298	0.4 	TOTAL	INDONESIA	5904631.4	3426.38	4723414.9	2836.93	4259508.4	3198.85		MALAYSIA	2479426.5	1490.63	3342033.9	1873.2	2868196.4	2276.12Source: DGCI&S Figures for 2021-22 are provisional*****
