                                                        (a)& (b) The Ministry of Shipping issued a General Order and Notification dated 22nd June, 2018, which provide relaxation under section 406 & 407 of Merchant Shipping Act,1958 for coastal movement of fertilizers. In view of the relaxation provided, a foreign flag ship before engaging in coastal trade of fertilizers  directly as well as a foreign flag vessel in-chartered by a citizen of India or a company or a cooperative society for coastal movement of fertilizers, are not required to obtain license from the Director General of Shipping. The said Order was followed by a clarificatory order dated 10th September, 2018, which clarified  that 50% of the total coastal cargo on board should be fertilizers and rest of the coastal cargo can be any other cargo. The movement of fertilizers can be in either bulk, break bulk or containerized form. Prior to the issue of the aforesaid General Order and Notification, foreign flag vessels  were permitted to transport fertilizers along the Indian coast only after issue of a licence by Director General of Shipping. (c) 	The stakeholders have to submit the information regarding the transportation by email in a prescribed format, as mentioned in the General Order dated 22nd June, 2018,  at least 24 hours prior to sailing of ship from a port in India.                                            ******
