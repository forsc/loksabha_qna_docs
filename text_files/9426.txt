                                                    (a) 	whether power generation in the country fell 12.7 per cent year-on-year, in October and thus recording third straight month when power generated was less than the corresponding months a year ago;(b) 	if so, the details thereof;(c) 	whether the Government would attribute the fall in demand to the extended monsoons this year and if so, the details thereof; and(d) 	whether lower generation in October could also be due to an all time low PLF of 51.1 per cent of coal plants stressed for adequate demand and coal supply issues and if so, the details thereof?






ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (d ) :	The details of growth in generation during three months i.e August to October 2019 is given at Annexure. The electricity generated was 0.4% higher in August 2019 with respect to August 2018. There was reduction of around 2.9% and 12.88% during September 2019 and October 2019 respectively with respect to the same months last year. The lower generation was mainly due to prolonged rainy season and good rainfall which led to reduction in demand in Agriculture sector and reduction in cooling requirement in domestic and commercial sectors.		During the current year 2019-20 (upto October, 2019), there has been 16% growth in generation from Hydro and around 22% growth in hydro power imported from Bhutan. There has also been 27% growth in generation from Nuclear power plants and 24% growth in generation from Solar. The share of green power i.e. generation from Non-fossil Fuel has been around 27.3%. Thus, the reduction in overall generation was not attributable to the lower plant load factor (PLF) of thermal generation rather we have been able to change the energy mix in order to reduce our Carbon footprint.                                           ************
