(f) &(g): Some Public Sector Banks have on occasions engaged private entities for effecting recovery. The recovery process for NPA accounts is regulated as per RBI guidelines dated 24-04-2008, through which the RBI advised banks, inter-alia, to ensure that the contracts with the recovery agents do not induce adoption of uncivilized, unlawful and questionable behaviour or recovery process. Further, the guidelines provide that the Banks, as principals, shall be held responsible for the actions of their agents. Hence, they are to ensure that agents are properly trained to handle their responsibilities with care and sensitivity for recovery of dues. Government has also sensitized the Public Sector Banks to adopt a non-coercive strategy for recovery of education loans. Grievances received in this regard are dealt with as per extant procedures for resolution.(h) & (i): In order to help the borrowers to tide over difficulties in the wake of Covid 19 pandemic, RBI allowed moratorium of six months on payment of all instalments falling due between March 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020 without an asset classification downgrade to borrowers which include Education Loans also. Further, RBI, vide circular dated 6 August, 2020, provided a framework for resolution of stressed assets to enable the lenders to implement a resolution plan in respect of personal loans, including education loans, covering grant of moratorium of up to two years while classifying them as standard subject to certain conditions. Further, the Government provided ex-gratia relief by way of payment of difference between compound interest and simple interest, on the outstanding as on 29.2.2020, of eligible borrowers in the specified loan accounts, including education loans, for the period of six months from 1.3.2020 to 31.8.2020.*****Annexure-I to reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 264 for answer on 15.03.2021 State-wise number and amount of outstanding education loans and Non-performing Assets (NPAs)  as on 31.12.2020 	Amount Rs in  Crore 	Loan Outstanding	NPA	Percentage of NPA 	A/cs	Amount	A/Cs	Amount	 NORTH EASTERN REGION	 	 	 	 	 Assam	12840	461.80	1151	30.60	6.63Meghalaya	3504	132.73	174	5.03	3.79Mizoram	324	12.64	43	1.59	12.56Arunachal Pradesh	407	37.88	46	1.67	4.42Nagaland	350	13.73	27	0.77	5.59Manipur	832	36.20	87	3.19	8.80Tripura	4123	112.92	454	11.58	10.26Total	22380	807.90	1982	54.42	6.74EASTERN REGION	 	 	 	 	 Bihar	105043	3524.88	24384	908.16	25.76Jharkhand	61332	2831.17	6235	232.53	8.21West Bengal	63327	2505.44	5506	159.30	6.36Odisha	51943	1732.59	5341	210.29	12.14Sikkim	713	19.56	18	0.42	2.15Andaman& Nicobar	485	23.68	20	0.53	2.24Total	282843	10637.32	41504	1511.23	14.21CENTRAL REGION	 	 	 	 	 Uttar Pradesh	119171	4319.08	11186	287.42	6.65Uttarakhand	20982	851.79	1209	32.60	3.83Madhya Pradesh	86987	2937.96	8639	186.00	6.33Chattisgarh	19574	720.00	1514	35.37	4.91Total	246714	8828.83	22548	541.39	6.13NORTHERN REGION	 	 	 	 	 Delhi	35361	2191.02	1451	43.64	1.99Punjab	29934	1748.48	1849	52.63	3.01Haryana	33517	1644.69	3654	100.84	6.13Chandigarh	4232	281.65	154	4.05	1.44Jammu & Kashmir	14323	518.36	501	11.94	2.30Ladakh	40	1.17	0	0.00	0.00Himachal Pradesh	16201	505.92	884	26.70	5.28Rajasthan	45407	2015.72	2483	61.23	3.04Total	179015	8907.01	10976	301.03	3.38WESTERN REGION	 	 	 	 	 Gujarat	48437	3291.33	1902	47.31	1.44Maharashtra	224276	9534.49	22276	448.00	4.70Dadar Nagar Haveli &  Daman &Diu	465	19.28	11	0.22	1.14Goa	7593	388.93	392	16.96	4.36Total	280771	13234.03	24581	512.49	3.87SOUTHERN REGION	 	 	 	 	 Andhra Pradesh	111822	6741.70	5786	115.23	1.71Telengana	63534	4773.93	2953	75.33	1.58Karnataka	256219	8040.76	28694	495.69	6.16Lakshadweep	19	0.59	0	0.00	0.00Tamilnadu	697066	17193.58	168410	3490.75	20.30Kerala	325703	10236.12	54519	1396.23	13.64Puducherry	18311	481.80	4307	93.31	19.37Total	1472674	47468.48	264669	5666.54	11.94G.Total	2484397	89883.57	366260	8587.10	9.55Source: State Level Bankers'' Committee  Annexure-II to reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No.264 for answer on 15th March, 2021Stream-wise number and amount of outstanding education loans andNon-performing Assets (NPAs) as on 31.12.2020Stream	Loan Outstanding	NPAs	Percentage of NPAs	No.	Amount(Rs in Crore)	No.	Amount(Rs in Crore)	Medical Profession	156338	10147.05	17676	633.15	6.23Engineering	1023968	33315.64	176256	4041.68	12.13Nursing Courses	123359	3674.68	22013	520.16	14.15MBA	216623	9541.36	28736	685.51	7.18Others	813979	28286.43	107238	2383.34	8.42Source: State Level Bankers'' Committee Annexure-III to reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 264 for answer on 15.03.2021 Percentage of NPAs under Education Loans  vis-a vis other type of loans  							(In percent)As on	Education	Housing	Vehicle Loans	Consumer Durables	Other Retail Loans	Agriculture & Allied	Industry31.03.2018	8.11	1.56	1.96	1.99	2.19	7.84	21.1431.03.2019	8.29	1.43	1.82	4.53	2.06	8.96	16.6631.03.2020	7.61	1.61	1.68	6.91	1.52	10.33	13.60Source: RBI						 Annexure-IV to reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 264 for answer on 15th March, 2015 Stream-wise percentage of NPAs for the last three years in respect of Education Loan.AS on	Medical Profession	Engineering	Nursing	MBA	Other Professions31.03.2018	5.51	7.73	12.96	6.21	7.2631.03.2019	10.27	10.61	15.76	8.37	12.4031.03.2020	7.60	13.67	15.18	7.43	11.02Source: State Level Bankers'' Committee
