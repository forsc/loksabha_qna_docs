ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)	No. Launched in February 2015, MADAD Portal provides for online registration, tracking and resolution of grievances by Indians around the world in a transparent, time bound, and accountable manner. Tracking and monitoring through MADAD has significantly strengthened the mechanism for addressing and resolving the grievances of all overseas Indians.	Since February 2015 till July 15, 2019, a total of 50,327 grievances including those related to repatriation of Indian citizens in distress situations abroad,  have been registered on MADAD out of which 44,188 grievances have been successfully resolved thereby making the resolution rate of grievances registered on MADAD nearly 90%.  Among the cases that are pending final resolution, most are due to reasons like incomplete information submitted by the complainants; non-cooperative attitude of foreign sponsors / employers; limited role of Missions/ Posts in Court cases; and cases which are under investigation of the local authorities.(c)   	Ministry and our Missions and Posts abroad attach high importance to resolving grievances registered on MADAD and the responses are tracked and monitored on a real-time basis. There is an inbuilt system to escalate the grievances to higher levels in case not responded to on time. Communications received from Hon’ble Members of Parliament are actively followed up and responded to  on high priority and MADAD has an inbuilt mechanism for identifying and tracking such cases.(d) & (e)	No. MADAD is one of the flagship initiatives of the Ministry of External Affairs under Digital India and is an integrated digital platform which is seamlessly spread across websites, mobile based platforms including IOS and Android as well as emails and text messages providing users with end-to-end digital tracking and monitoring with a view to timely resolution of their grievances. ***
