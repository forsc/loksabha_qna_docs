ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS (DR. SUBRAHMANYAM JAISHANKAR)(a) to (e) 		A statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (e) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *72 REGARDING “HARASSMENT OF YOUTH ABROD” FOR ANSWER ON 26.06.2019	Given the large number of Indian youth who go abroad for work, the Government is aware that some of them have to face harassment due to lack of familiarity with the rules and regulations of that country or due to some other reasons. The well being and welfare of Indians abroad is among the top priorities for the Government of India. Indian Missions and Posts advise Indians living abroad to register themselves with their Consular and Community Welfare Sections.  Missions and Posts also widely disseminate salient information on various issues, including information related to the host countries, through website, social media, etc. with a view to enhance the awareness of Indian nationals abroad.  Comprehensive Pre-Departure Orientation Training (PDOT) which has been started on a voluntary basis, is also a step in the    direction of making our workers more aware and to sensitize them to best practices to ensure their welfare and safety. Such PDOT has already been imparted to over 46,000 workers so far and a         Pre-Departure Orientation booklet has now been launched in 6 different Indian languages for distribution to emigrating workers. In addition, Indian Missions / Posts abroad remain vigilant and closely monitor any incidents of harassment faced by Indian nationals, including the youth. Apart from that, Indian Missions/ Posts abroad also extend all possible help and assistance to Indian nationals including when they are detained by local police/ immigration authorities or put in prisons for violation of local laws. Apart from extending them all possible consular assistance, Indian Missions and Posts also assist in availing legal aid wherever needed. 	As per the information available with the Ministry, the number of Indian prisoners in foreign jails as of 31.05.2019 is 8189 which also includes under-trials. Country-wise list is given at Annexure. However, due to strong privacy laws prevailing in many countries, the local authorities do not share information on prisoners unless the person concerned consents to the disclosure of such information. Even countries which share information do not generally provide detailed information about the people of foreign countries imprisoned. 	Indian Missions / Posts abroad remain vigilant and closely monitor the incidents of Indian nationals being put in jail in foreign countries for violation of local laws or alleged violation of local laws. Apart from extending them all possible consular assistance, Indian Missions and Posts also assist in availing legal aid wherever needed.  Missions and Posts also maintain a local panel of lawyers where Indian community is in sizeable numbers. Legal assistance is also provided to Indian nationals abroad including those in prison on a means-tested basis in deserving cases through the Indian Community Welfare Fund.Further, the Government has concluded Agreements on Transfer of Sentenced Persons with a number of countries. Due to the efforts of the Government, a number of Indian nationals in prisons abroad have received amnesty or commutation of their sentences. Since 2016 till present, in the countries in Gulf region a total of 3087 Indian nationals have received amnesty or commutation of their sentences.  ***
