                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) Yes, Sir.  (b) & (c)    Water being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation and efficient management of water resources including tackling of water crisis are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments. In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Central Government provides technical and financial assistance to them through various schemes and programmes. Central Government has taken various steps to tackle water crisis and augment the water supply in the country. The Ministry of Jal Shakti has been created by the Government of India, integrating the erstwhile Ministry of Water Resources River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation and the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, with an aim to integrate water resources management under one umbrella so that the issues relating to water are dealt with in a holistic manner. Recently, the Hon’ble PM has personally addressed letters to all sarpanches in the country motivating them to take up water conservation activities. Ministry of Jal Shakti has launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) - a campaign for water conservation and water security. During the campaign, officers, groundwater experts and scientists from the Government of India will work together with State and district officials in India’s most water-stressed districts for water conservation and water resource management.  Contd…P/2//2//Central Government has formulated a National Perspective Plan (NPP) for Water Resources Development which envisages transfer of water from water surplus basins to water deficit basins to improve availability of water. Central Government has launched Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) for completion of 99 on-going Major/Medium irrigation projects having ultimate irrigation potential of 76.03 lakh hectares.Central Government has formulated National Water Policy (NWP), 2012 which inter-alia recommends conservation, promotion and protection of water and highlights the need for augmenting the availability of water through rain water harvesting, direct use of rainfall and other management measures. The NWP, 2012 has been sent to all States/ Union Territories and the concerned Central Ministries for appropriate action. Through centrally sponsored scheme, National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), technical and financial assistance are provided to States for providing safe drinking water in rural areas. The NRDWP has been restructured to make it more competitive, result oriented and outcome based to reduce the slippages and inefficiencies in the rural drinking water supply.Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is implementing Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) in 500 cities with Mission components such as water supply, storm water drainage, etc. The water supply component includes augmentation of existing water supply system and water treatment plants; rehabilitation of old water supply system; rejuvenation of water bodies for drinking water supply and recharging of ground water, etc. Some initiatives/measures taken by Central Government to control water depletion and promote rain water harvesting / conservation are available at the URL:http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf*****
