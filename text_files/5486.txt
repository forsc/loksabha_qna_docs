                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (e):	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 5085 BY SHRI RANJEETSINGH HINDURAO NAIK NIMBALKAR TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 24.07.2019 REGARDING PHALTAN-PANDARPUR RAIL LINE(a) to (e):   Phaltan-Pandharpur (108.70 km) new line project was included in Budget 2017-18 subject to requisite Government approvals.  As per Detailed Project Report (DPR), cost of this new line project has been assessed as `1,153 crore with Rate of Return (-) 3%.Considering the huge shelf of ongoing new line projects and being financially unremunerative, it is very difficult for Railways to bear the entire cost of the project. Accordingly Government of Maharashtra has been requested to give consent for bearing 50% cost of the project and also to provide land free of cost so that project can be processed for sanction. Phaltan-Padharpur proposed line falls entirely in Maharashtra.*****
