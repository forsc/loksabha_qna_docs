ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) 2005 is a demand driven wage employment Scheme. Hence no States/UTs-wise allocation of fund is made. States/UTs-wise, including Gujarat, Central fund released under the MGNREGS during the current financial year 2019-20 (as on 17.07.2019) is given at Annexure.(c) & (d):	The Ministry releases funds to the State/UT on the basis of the agreed to Labour Budget, opening balance, pending liabilities of the previous financial year, if any, and overall performance. Fund release to States/UTs is a continuous process and Central Government is committed to making funds available keeping in view the demand for work. The Ministry seeks additional fund for MGNREGS as and when required for meeting the demand for work on the ground.(e):	The Ministry along with the States/UTs has been making concerted efforts for improving the timely payment of wages. States/UTs have been advised to generate pay orders in time. This has resulted in considerable improvement in the status of timely generation of pay order leading to improvement in actual time taken to credit wages in the workers account. During the current financial Year 2019-20 (as on 17.07.2019), 98.05% pay orders have been generated within the stipulated 15 days. The delay in payment of wages are due to implementation issues in the States which include inadequate staffing, non-timely recording and reporting of attendance, measurement, data entry, generation of wage list, Fund Transfer Order (FTO), etc.*****
