                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a) to (e) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO.171* FOR 12TH FEBRUARY, 2021(a) to (e) The National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) provides guidance on all aspects of COVID-19 vaccination including prioritization of population groups, procurement and inventory management, vaccine selection, vaccine delivery and tracking mechanism etc.NEGVAC has recommended priority groups for administration of COVID-19 vaccines. The recommendations of NEGVAC in this regard have been accepted by the Government. As per these recommendations, the prioritized groups comprise Health Care Workers, Front Line Workers (which includes State and Central Police departments, Armed Forces, Home Guard, prison staff, disaster management volunteers and Civil Defense Organization, Municipal Workers, Revenue & Panchayati Raj Institution officials engaged in COVID-19 containment, surveillance and associated activities) persons above the age of 50 years and persons below 50 years with associated comorbidities. An estimated 3 crore Health Care Workers and Front Line Workers as detailed above are expected to be provided COVID-19 vaccine during the initial phase of COVID-19 vaccination drive. COVID vaccination is an ongoing and dynamic process under which more than 55% of the Health Care Workers have received 1st dose of vaccine so far and vaccination of Front Line Workers have also begun from 2nd February 2021. The beneficiaries as prioritized by NEGVAC subsequently will be taken up as part of ongoing process once substantial coverage of the vaccination of Health Care Workers and Front Line Workers is achieved.  Two vaccines namely Covishield manufactured by M/s Serum Institute of India and Covaxin manufactured by M/s Bharat Biotech International Limited have been granted permission for restricted use in emergency situation by the National Regulator i.e. Drug Controller General of India [DCG(I)].Supply orders amounting to a total of 410 lakh doses have been placed by Government of India for both these vaccines. These supply orders also include 100 lakh doses received from Gavi support through Covax facility. The orders placed so far are sufficient for coverage of on-going vaccination drive for Health Care Workers and Front Line Workers. Procurement of additional quantity of vaccines has also been factored in.*****
