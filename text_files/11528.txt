Funds for the BharatNet project are allocated as a whole and not State/Union Territory-wise. A lump sum amount is allocated and disbursed from Universal Service Obligation Fund to Bharat Broadband Network Limited for execution of BharatNet project. The details of State/UT wise funds disbursed/allocated by Bharat Broadband Network Limited under BharatNet Project, are given in Annex-I.(b) to (d)	The State/UT-wise details of length of optical fibre cable laid, the number of Gram Panchayats that have been provided with broadband connectivity, and the number of functional Wi-Fi hotspots in the country under the scheme are given in Annex-II.(e)	BharatNet is a project of mega nature and the GPs are widely dispersed across the country in rural and remote areas. All out efforts are being made to expeditiously implement the project. The delay in the implementation of the project is mainly on account of:(i)	Delay in the initial commencement of the project as the work on the project began in the second half of 2014 due to field survey of GPs and pilot testing of the technology model.  (ii)	In Phase-I, only one media that is underground OFC to cover GPs, and Right of Way (RoW) issues.(iii)	 Under Phase-II, about 65,000 GPs  in 8 States are being implemented under State-led model, and delay in their implementation is also adversely affecting the completion of the Project. (f)	The broadband connectivity to all the 2.5 lakh Gram Panchayats is targeted to be provided by August 2021.
