ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS (SHRI DEVUSINH CHAUHAN)(a) to (c)	Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has been monitoring the performance of Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) against the benchmarks for various Quality of Service (QoS) parameters through Performance Monitoring Reports (PMRs). These benchmarks are assessed over the entire Licensed Service Area (LSA) in every quarter and published on TRAI’s website, www.trai.gov.in. 	As these benchmarks are based on percentile basis and assessed over entire LSA for quarter of a year, there may be few pockets or few days where few users might be experiencing poor quality or service although TSPs have met the benchmark. 	In case TSPs are not meeting the benchmarks for the parameters defined under QoS Regulations then Financial Disincentives (FD) are imposed on the TSP who has not met the benchmark.
