Some of them are listed below:-i.	State-of-the-Art Vande Bharat services have been introduced between New Delhi – Varanasi and New Delhi- Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Katra.

Conversion of End-On-Generation (EOG) trains into Head-On-Generation (HOG) trains has been done to reduce noise and air pollution at stations and in trains. This is expected to significantly reduce the consumption of fossil fuels.ix.	Conventional lighting in coaches is being replaced with modern and energy efficient Light Emitting Diode (LED) lights. x.	Increased number of mobile charging points are also being provided in coaches.xi.	With a view to further fortify the security system, in addition to CCTV Cameras and Emergency Talk Back System, Flasher lights have also been provided in ladies coaches in EMU rakes in South Eastern Railway.
