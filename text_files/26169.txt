ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) &  (b) Ministry of Tourism (MoT) endorses  recognition to tour operators, travel agents and tourist transport operators under a  voluntary scheme. MoT has evolved Sustainable Tourism Criteria for India (STCI) comprising major segments of the tourism industry, namely accommodation, tour operators, beaches, backwaters, lakes and river sectors, etc.  Sustainable tourism implies minimizing the negative and maximizing the positive effects of all forms and activities of tourism on environment,  local communities, heritage inclusive economic growth.  Principles of STCI   for tour operators inter alia include conservation of resources and  reduction of pollution etc. MoT has made it mandatory for the approved tourism service providers such as tour operators, adventure tour operators, travel agents etc. to follow the Code of Conduct for safe and sustainable Tourism.(c) Tourism management is a part of the regular management practice of the National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries. A set of comprehensive guidelines has been issued under section 38O-1(c) of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 for tiger conservation and tourism in Tiger Reserves, which allows regulated tourism in core areas. Action is taken as per the provision of Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972  for any crime related to wild animals and issue related to protected areas. (d) & (e )   There is no data to support the rising level of air pollution in Union Territory (UT)  of Ladakh. The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 is applicable in UT of Ladakh and necessary actions as per the provision of the Act are implemented. Government is promoting public participation for prevention and control of pollution through focussed programmes like ‘Green Deeds & Habits for Sustainable Development” The details are available at http://moef.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ggd-19-08-2020_final.pdf . *****
