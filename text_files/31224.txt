                                                        THE MINISTER OF NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND POWER (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a)State-wise year-wise number of standalone solar water pumps installed under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) scheme since inception is given  at Annexure-I. District-wise number of these pumps for Rajasthan is given at Annexure-II.(b) As per the information available from the solar pump suppliers, about 3.50 lakh solar pumps have been manufactured and supplied under various Central Government and State Government programmes during the last five years.(c)Following provisions of the PM-KUSUM Scheme aim to increase country’s solar water pump manufacturing capacity:(i) Target of installation or solarisation of 35 lakh pumps through central financial support under the Scheme provides visibility of demand in the coming years.(ii) Condition of domestic content requirement for participation in Component-B (standalone solar pumps) and Component-C (solarisation of existing agricultural pumps).(iii) Direct participation of manufacturers of solar pumps/ solar photovoltaic modules/ solar pump controller either as sole bidder or member of a Joint Venture, in bidding under Component-B and Component-C.(d) to (f) Under the PM-KUSUM Scheme, there is no limit on number of solar water pumps in a district. However, new solar pumps are not allowed to be installed in areas notified by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), which monitors and regulates ground water development and extraction. Only the existing diesel pumps can be replaced with solar pumps under Component-B and existing electric pumps can be solarized under Component-C in these areas provided they use micro irrigation techniques to save water. Additionally, to conserve ground water, following provision are included in the PM-KUSUM Scheme:(i) Preference for installation of standalone solar pumps and solarisation of existing agriculture pumps is given to the farmers using micro irrigation systems or covered under micro irrigation schemes or those who opt for micro irrigation systems.(ii) The size of standalone solar pump is to be selected on the basis of water table in the area, land covered and quantity of water required for irrigation.(iii)Farmers have the option to monetize the surplus power generated under individual pump solarisation by selling it to the DISCOM. Further, under feeder level solarisation, farmers are incentivised for electricity consumption below the benchmark consumption. Details of the ground water table released by CGWB in June, 2021 along with solar pumps installed, district-wise, is placed at Annexure-III.(g)The steps taken/being taken by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy for decentralised solar power production include the following:(i) Installation of grid-connected solar power plants up to 2 MW capacity under Component-A of PM-KUSUM Scheme(ii) Installation of standalone solar pumps under Component-B and solarisation of grid-connected agriculture pumps including through feeder level solarisation under Component-C of PM-KUSUM Scheme by providing Central Financial Assistance (CFA).
