                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a)       As per the report of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) – 4, 2015-16, 35.7% children under 5 years of age are underweight and 38.4% are stunted indicating a reduction from the previous data captured in NFHS – 3, 2005-06, which reported 42.5% children under 5 years of age as underweight and 48% stunted. However, the recently released report of NFHS-5 (2019-20) is available only for 22 States/UTs. The State/UT wise details of stunting, wasting and underweight among children under 5 years as per NFHS-4 & NFHS-5 is annexed. (b)       Government of India implements the Anganwadi Services Scheme, POSHAN Abhiyaan, Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana and Scheme for Adolescent Girls under the Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services Scheme (ICDS) as targeted interventions for children upto the age of 6 years, Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers and Adolescent Girls, throughout the country. POSHAN Abhiyaan aims to reduce malnutrition in a phased manner, through a lifecycle approach, by adopting a synergised and result oriented approach. All these schemes address one or other aspects related to nutrition and have the potential to improve nutritional outcomes in the country.  Recently, Government has also taken measures to strengthen nutritional content, delivery, outreach and outcomes with focus on developing practices that nurture health, wellness and immunity to disease and malnutrition. Steps have also been taken to improve nutritional quality and testing, strengthen delivery and leverage technology under the ''Poshan Tracker'', a robust ICT enabled platform, to improve governance with regard to real time monitoring of provisioning of supplementary nutrition for prompt supervisions and management of services. Also, Guidelines on Quality Assurance, Roles and Responsibilities of Duty Holders, procedure for procurement, for transparency, efficiency and accountability in delivery of Supplementary Nutrition have been streamlined. Government has advised States/UTs to ensure that the quality of supplementary nutrition conforms to prescribed standards laid down under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and regulations made thereunder. States/UTs have also been advised to promote use of AYUSH systems for prevention of malnutrition and related diseases. A programme to support development of Poshan Vatikas at Anganwadi Centres to meet dietary diversity gap leveraging traditional knowledge in nutritional practices has also been taken up. Mission Poshan 2.0, an integrated nutrition support programme, has been announced in Budget 2021-22. *****   Annexure Statement referred to in reply to Part (a) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.837 for 23.07.2021 by Shri Guman Singh Damor regarding  MALNOURISHED CHILDREN S.No.	State/UT	Stunting	Wasting	Underweight 		NFHS-4	NFHS-5	NFHS-4	NFHS-5	NFHS-4	NFHS-51	Andaman & Nicobar Islands	23.3	22.5	18.9	16	21.6	23.72	Andhra Pradesh	31.4	31.2	17.2	16.1	31.9	29.63	Arunachal Pradesh	29.4	-	17.3	-	19.4	-4	Assam	36.4	35.3	17	21.7	29.8	32.85	Bihar	48.3	42.9	20.8	22.9	43.9	416	Chandigarh	28.7	-	10.9	-	24.5	-7	Chhattisgarh	37.6	-	23.1	-	37.7	-8	Dadra & Nagar Haveli & Daman & Diu	37.2	39.4	26.7	21.6	35.8	38.79	Delhi	31.9	-	15.9	-	27	-10	Goa	20.1	25.8	21.9	19.1	23.8	2411	Gujarat	38.5	39	26.4	25.1	39.3	39.712	Haryana	34	-	21.2	-	29.4	-13	Himachal Pradesh	26.3	30.8	13.7	17.4	21.2	25.514	Jammu & Kashmir	27.4	26.9	12.2	19	16.6	2115	Jharkhand	45.3	-	29	-	47.8	-16	Karnataka	36.2	35.4	26.1	19.5	35.2	32.917	Kerala	19.7	23.4	15.7	15.8	16.1	19.718	Ladakh	26.8	32	13.7	17.4	23.6	25.819	Lakshadweep	30.9	30.5	9.3	17.5	18.7	20.420	Madhya Pradesh	42	-	25.8	-	42.8	-21	Maharashtra	34.4	35.2	25.6	25.6	36	36.122	Manipur	43.8	46.5	15.3	12.1	28.9	26.623	Meghalaya	28.9	23.4	6.8	9.9	13.8	13.324	Mizoram	28.1	28.9	6.1	9.8	12	12.725	Nagaland	28.6	32.7	11.3	19.1	16.7	26.926	Orissa	34.1	-	20.4	-	34.4	-27	Puducherry	24	-	23.8	-	22.7	-28	Punjab	25.7	-	15.6	-	21.6	-29	Rajasthan	39.1	-	23	-	36.7	-30	Sikkim	29.6	22.3	14.2	13.7	14.2	13.131	Tamil Nadu	27.1	-	19.7	-	23.8	-32	Telangana	28	33.1	18.1	21.7	28.4	31.833	Tripura	24.3	32.3	16.8	18.2	24.1	25.634	Uttar Pradesh	46.3	-	17.9	-	39.5	-35	Uttarakhand	33.5	-	19.5	-	26.6	-36	West Bengal	32.5	33.8	20.3	20.3	31.6	32.2 *********
