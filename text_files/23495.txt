ICAR has developed several location specific bio-engineering measures to check soil erosion due to run-off of rain water, sand dune stabilization and shelter belt technology to check wind erosion and reclamation technology for problem soils in the country.Department of Land Resources has sanctioned, 8214 watershed development projects covering an area of about 39.07 million hectare  in 28 States (except Goa)  [now 27 States and UTs of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh) during the period 2009-10 to 2014-15 under erstwhile Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP). Subsequently IWMP was amalgamated as a Watershed Development Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (WDC-PMKSY) in 2015-16. A total number of 1832 projects (345 uninitiated and 1487 in preparatory stage) were transferred to various States in 2018 to implement them from their own budget.  The focus of DoLR is to complete 6382 projects.  Out of 6382 sanctioned projects being funded by Department of Land Resources, 4769 projects have been reported as completed, 409 projects are in Consolidation Phase and 1204 projects are in Work Phase (as on 28.02.2021).The activities being undertaken through the watershed development projects inter alia include ridge area treatment, drainage line treatment, soil and moisture conservation, rain water harvesting, nursery raising, afforestation, horticulture, pasture development, livelihoods for assetless persons, etc.State-wise details of number of sanctioned projects, area covered by the projects and Central share released during the last three years and the current year (upto 28.02.2021) are given in Annexure I. In addition, other Central Ministries / Departments like Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare are implementing schemes and programmes like the Per Drop More Crop component of PMKSY which inter alia includes activities for water conservation, drought proofing, water harvesting, ground water recharge, etc. that complement and supplement interventions undertaken under the WDC-PMKSY.National Afforestation & Eco-Development Board, Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change is implementing National Afforestation Programme (NAP) for ecological restoration of degraded forest area. The scheme is implemented through a decentralized mechanism of State Forest Development Agency (SFDA) at State level, Forest Development agency (FDA) at Forest Division level and Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMCs) at Village level.  An amount of Rs. 237.80 crores has been released to the States to treat an area of 76957 hectares during the last three years and the current financial year. The State-wise / Year-wise details of approved area and fund released under NAP scheme during last three years and current financial year are given in Annexure II. Further, Government of India has announced the commitment to work towards achieving Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) by 2030 with the cooperation and synchronized efforts of all the relevant Ministries/Departments.                                               *****
