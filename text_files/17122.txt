                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):	State/UT wise details of number of total COVID-19 cases, active cases, recovered cases and deaths are at Annexure I.(b):	The epidemic curve of any pandemic goes through an ascending, peaking and descending phase. The current phase of pandemic in India is on multiple trajectories across the urban and semi urban areas of the country. Since the country has a huge population, it is expected that there would be a large number of cases every day. However, the cases and deaths per million population in India is among the lowest if one were to compare between similarly affected countries. Most affected States/UTs in the country are Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Delhi.(c) & (g):	Government of India has taken a series of actions to prevent, control and mitigate the impact of COVID-19. India followed a whole of Government and whole of society approach. Hon’ble Prime Minister, a High level Group of Ministers (GoM), Cabinet Secretary, Committee of Secretaries and senior officers in MoHFW continue to monitor public health response to COVID-19 in the country. The public health actions were taken in a pre-emptive, pro-active, graded manner based on the evolving scenario. A number of travel advisories were issued restricting inflow of international travelers, till such time, commercial flights were suspended on 23rd March, 2020. Till then, a total of 14,154 flights with 15,24,266 passengers have been screened at these airports. Screening was also done at 12 major and 65 minor ports and land border crossings. In the initial part of the pandemic, India evacuated a large number of stranded passengers from then COVID affected countries (China, Italy, Iran, Japan, Malaysia) and again in the un-lockdown phase, a total of 13,18,891 passengers have been brought back (as on 14th September, 2020) and followed up.Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) is conducting contact tracing through community surveillance. In the earlier part of the pandemic, this was done for travel related cases and subsequently for cases being reported from community as a part of containment strategy. As on 14th September 2020, a total of about 40 lakh persons have been kept under surveillance. There are 726 laboratories conducting COVID-19 Testing. India is testing is about 1 million samples a day. A total of 5.8 crore samples have been tested so far (as on 14th September 2020).As on 15th September, 2020, a total of 15,360 COVID treatment facilities with 13,20,881 dedicated isolation bed without O2 support have been created. Also, a total of 2,32,516 oxygen supported isolation beds and 63,194 ICU beds (including 32,409 ventilator beds). Guidelines on Clinical management of COVID-19 have been issued and are being updated regularly.  States are being supported in terms of supply of logistics. So far 1.41 Crore of PPE Kits, 3.44 crores N-95 masks, 10.84 crore tablets of Hydroxychloroquine and 30,663 ventilators and 1,02,400 oxygen cylinders have been supplied to States/UTs/ Central Government hospitals so far (as on 14th September, 2020).Various cadres of personnel and volunteers across sectors and departments for COVID related works and maintenance of other essential medical services have been worked out, trained through resources made available on the website of MoHFW, iGOT (online platform) by DOPT (https://igot.gov.in/igot/). MoHFW website is being daily to provide general public with information on current status of COVID-19 spread in India. Communication material is also being hosted on MoHFW website and through social media. A dedicated call centre / helpline (1075) has been started to guide community at large which are being used by the citizens very effectively and on a regular basis.More than 30 vaccine candidates have been supported which are in different stages of development, 3 candidates are in advanced stage of Phase I/II/III trials and more than 4 are in advanced pre-clinical development stage. A National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 has been constituted on 7th August, 2020, under NITI Ayog. Thirteen clinical trials of repurposed drugs have been undertaken to build a portfolio of therapeutic options for Covid-19 patients.The Government of India is implementing India COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Package. The details of financial, medical and other assistance under the package provided by Government of India is at Annexures II to VII.(d):	Several different testing techniques and methodologies have been adopted for laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19. •	Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard test for detecting cases of COVID-19. The advantage of this platform lies in its accuracy of detection. •	The TrueNat and CBNAAT systems have also been deployed for diagnosis of COVID-19 in view of availability of customized testing cartridges, widespread availability even at district and primary health center level and quick turnaround time.•	Rapid Point-of-Care (PoC) Antigen Detection tests have relatively moderate sensitivity but high specificity. A positive test should be considered as a true positive whereas all symptomatic individuals testing negative through the rapid antigen test should be confirmed with a real-time PCR test. •	IgG Antibody test for COVID-19 has been recommended only for sero-surveillance and not diagnosis.India is conducting an average of 10-11 lakh tests per day. Persons 26-44 years of age represent 40% of the total confirmed cases in the country.(e):	State/UT wise details of number of health facilities (including Dedicated COVID hospitals, Dedicated COVID Health Centers and COVID Care Centers) and beds available are detailed in Annexure VIII. No specific antivirals have been proven effective so far. Symptomatic treatment for fever and cough, appropriate rehydration, supplemental oxygen therapy remains the mainstay of treatment. The drug Hydroxychloroquine has been recommended for treatment of mild (but high-risk cases) and for moderate cases. In addition, provisions for investigational therapies has also been made for using Remdesivir, Convalescent plasma and Tocilizumab for managing severe cases under close medical supervision. Guidelines on Clinical management of COVID-19 were issued and are being regularly updated & widely circulated.Testing and treatment of COVID-19 is free in all Government facilities. Health is a State subject. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare does not maintain state-wise data on average cost, treatment cost etc. (f):	By imposing country-wide lock-down, India successfully blunted the aggressive progression of COVID. The period of lockdown helped the nation create much required additional health infrastructure. During this time, dedicated isolation beds recorded an increase of 22 times and dedicated ICU beds above 14 times to what existed in March 2020. Similarly, laboratory capacity for testing COVID was increased nearly 10 times during this time. Whereas there was no indigenous manufacturing of PPE, with the requisite standards, at that point in time, we are now self-sufficient and, in a position, to export the same. Similarly, very limited indigenous manufacturing was available at the time of lockdown, this capacity was also enhanced to attain self-reliance in this regard. During this period, various cadres of personnel and volunteers across sectors and departments for COVID related works and maintenance of other essential medical services were worked out, trained through resources made available on the website of MoHFW, iGOT (online platform) by DOPT (https://igot.gov.in/igot/).It has been estimated that the decision of lockdown by slowing down the progress of pandemic in India, prevented 14–29 lakh cases and 37–78 thousand deaths.(g):	Reply same as answer to Question at (c).
