ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION     (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (e): A Statement is laid on the table of the House.Statement referred to in the reply to parts (a) to (e) of the Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 52 regarding "Flights for Indian Expatriates" to be answered on 04.02.2021; ; (a) to (c): All efforts have been made to provide maximum connectivity to Indian expatriates desirous to fly back to their respective countries of employment. India has formalised Air Bubble agreements with 24 countries. These Air Bubble agreements provide access directly or through transit facility to more than 100 countries.; Despite the entry restrictions, strict health protocols enforced by significant number of foreign countries and limitations on the number of flights, most countries are accessible through these Air Bubble agreements. In addition to the connectivity provided by Air Bubble agreements, the Vande Bharat Mission flights also carry passengers to other foreign countries with whom direct Air Bubble arrangement does not exist. Formalisation of new Air Bubble arrangements is an ongoing process and the Government is taking all necessary steps to facilitate movement of passengers.;  (d): Resumption of regular scheduled international operation depends on many factors including the normalisation of domestic air travel, behavior of COVID-19 virus globally and entry restrictions imposed on Indian nationals by other countries. While the domestic travel is coming close to its pre-COVID level, the behavior of the Coronavirus and its new strains require close monitoring so that the gains achieved in containing the COVID-19 pandemic in India are not lost. Further, the restrictions imposed by different countries on entry of Indians also imposes air connectivity limitations between India and the partner country.; (e): To increase the connectivity to member states of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), India has formalised Air Bubble agreements with all the member states of GCC except Saudi Arabia. Air Bubble arrangements have been formalized with i) Bahrain ii) Kuwait iii) Oman iv) Qatar and v) United Arab Emirates. With respect to Saudi Arabia, India has already proposed an Air Bubble agreement. However, there are, presently, restrictions on carriage of passengers on direct flights from India to Saudi Arabia.
