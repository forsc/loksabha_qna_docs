                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a): As per Schedule-I of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005, (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA), “all material required for the works shall be procured by the Gram Panchayat or the implementing agency using a transparent tender process as specified by the State Government”. Generally the States follow the current Schedule of Rates (SoR) of the State or the Central Schedule of Rates for this purpose.  The States revise the rates of material from time to time. (b) & (c): The Labour Budget (persondays) and expenditure under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) exhibit an increasing trend. The details of budget allocation and agreed to Labour Budget (persondays) during the last two years and current financial year 2019-20 (as on 06.02.2020) are given below:                                                                  (In crore)Financial Year	         Budget Allocation (In Rs.)	         Agreed to                                                            Labour Budget (persondays)2017-2018	             55,167.06	                          231.312018-2019	             61,830.09	                          256.562019-2020                     71001.81	                          270.43(As on 06.02.2020)	       Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is a demand driven wage employment programme. It provides livelihood security i.e., fall back option for livelihood for the rural households when no better employment opportunity is available. The demand for work is influenced by various factors such as rain-fall, availability of alternative and remunerative employment opportunities outside Mahatma Gandhi NREGS etc. (d): Wages under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA, 2005 are notified and revised annually based on Consumer Price Index-Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL) by the Central Government in accordance with the provisions of Section 6(1) of the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA. The revised wage rates are made applicable from 1st April of the year. State/UT-wise prevailing minimum wage rates under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA during the current FY 2019-20 are given at Annexure. The rates of the wages declared by the State Governments and the prevalent wage rates in the market in respect of States are not maintained in this Ministry.   Annexure-I referred in reply to part (d) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.1448 dated 11.02.2020
