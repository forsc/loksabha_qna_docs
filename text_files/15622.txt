ANSWER




ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a)	to (d): 	A statement is laid before the Table of the House.  STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) to (d) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 398 FOR 20.03.2020 ASKED BY SHRI RANJEETSINGH HINDURAO NAIK NIMBALKAR AND SHRI SHANTANU THAKUR REGARDING SHe-Box(a) to (d):	In order to ensure the effective implementation of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act (the SH Act), 2013, Ministry of Women and Child Development has developed an online complaint management system titled the Sexual Harassment electronic–Box (SHe-Box) for registering complaints related to sexual harassment of women at workplace. 	The portal was developed to provide a platform to women working or visiting any office of Central Government (Central Ministries, Departments, Public Sector Undertakings, Autonomous Bodies and Institutions etc.), State Government or private organisation to file complaints related to sexual harassment at workplace under the SH Act. Those who have already filed a written complaint with the concerned Internal Committee (IC) or Local Committee (LC) constituted under the SH Act are also eligible to file their complaints through this portal.	The mechanism of the portal is such that all the Central Ministries/ Departments’ ICs have inbuilt accounts within the SHe-Box. Once a complaint is submitted to the ‘SHe-Box’, it lands automatically into the account of the IC of the concerned Ministry/Department having jurisdiction to take action into the matter. 	With regard to complaints related to State Department(s) and private organisations, all such complaints land automatically into the account of District Officer/District Nodal Officer designated/appointed in the concerned district who forwards such complaint to the Internal Committee/Local Committee of the concerned office/district to take action into the matter. 	Economic independence is one of the key aspects towards improving the position of women within the family and in the society. Amongst others, this would entail not only increasing their presence in the work force but, more importantly, creating an enabling environment at workplace so that more and more women could join the workforce.	As per National Crime Records Bureau data, in the year 2017, 479 cases of sexual harassment of women at work or office premises had been recorded whereas in 2018, 401 cases have been recorded of sexual harassment of women at work or office premises. *****
