ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF JAL SHAKTI(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) 	Under Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) [SBM(G)], all Below Poverty Line (BPL) households and identified Above Poverty Line (APL) households (SC/ST households, households with physically disabled person, landless labourers with homestead, small and marginal farmers and women headed households) are eligible for incentive for the construction of Individual Household Latrine (IHHL).  All others are encouraged to construct their toilet on their own, through Information, Education and Communication (IEC) interventions.  Since the launch of SBM(G) on 2nd October, 2014, 10.76 crore IHHLs have so far been constructed as per the data reported by the States/UTs on the online Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) of SBM(G).   Out of these, 8.90 crore IHHLs have been reported constructed with SBM(G) funds only.  Remaining IHHLs have been reported constructed under other Schemes (MGNREGS, PMAY, Namami Gange, etc), convergence with these schemes, and self-financing. (b) & (c)	SBM(G) guidelines provide that Gram Panchayats should construct Community Sanitary Complexes (CSCs), on need basis, to cater to the sanitation needs of households who do not have individual toilets due to lack of space or for floating/migrant population, or at places where large congregation of people usually takes place, etc.  For the construction of CSC, priority is to be given to the locations with predominant SC/ST habitations, poorest of poor in the village and/or those visited by migrant labourers/floating population etc. As per the data reported by the States/UTs on the online IMIS, 1,37,504 villages have CSCs.(d) 	No, Sir.  Under SBM(G), ODF has been defined as termination of faecal-oral transmission, by ensuring, a) no visible faeces found in the environment/village and, b) every household as well as public/community institution(s) using safe technology option for disposal of faeces.  (e)  Emphasis of SBM(G) has been on IEC and Community Approach to Sanitation (CAS). Massive media campaigns have been carried out at national level using Audio Visual (TV) and Audio (Radio). States have also conducted IEC campaigns using Inter Personal Communication (IPC) techniques.  Cleanliness campaigns are held at regular intervals to create social awareness.  To educate the people, the programme also lays emphasis on community involvement.  *****
