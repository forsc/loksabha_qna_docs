ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)   The issue of desiltation of rivers has been considered by Government since long. In this  context, some of the Committees constituted are as under: (i)  	A Committee headed by Dr. B.K. Mittal, former Chairman, Central Water Commission in 2001 to study the problem of silting in the rivers.(ii)  	A Committee headed by Shri Madhav Chitale, Expert Member, NGRBA in 2016 for preparation of guidelines for works on desiltation from Bhimgauda (Uttrakhand) to Farakka (West Bengal).(iii)  	A Committee under the Chairmanship of Shri A.B. Pandya, former Chairman, Central Water Commission in 2017, to address the issue of floods and siltation in the  State of Bihar.The findings of these Committees have been shared with all the stakeholders.(b) & (c)  Erosion and deposition of silt is a natural process in alluvial rivers. Rivers carry, pickup and drop silt load as per their regime conditions i.e. discharge in the river, river slope, morphology, nature of silt etc. The measures for flood management including desilting of rivers are formulated by the State Governments as per their priority. The Government of India supplements the efforts of State Governments by providing technical advice and promotional financial assistance for critical areas.*****
