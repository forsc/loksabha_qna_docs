                                                        THE MINISTER FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND MINISTRY OF EARTH SCIENCES (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a)	Yes Sir. National Centre for Seismology (NCS) maintains a country wide seismic network of 115 field stations for monitoring earthquake activity in India and its adjoining region. The centre disseminates earthquake parameters to all disaster management authorities within 5-10 minutes after occurrence of event. Also, a detailed hazard assessment in the form of Microzonation study has been taken up and maps for Delhi, Kolkata, Sikkim, Guwahati, Bengaluru, Jabalpur etc., has been prepared. In addition, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and State Governments have taken up specific programmes to create awareness among the general-public through mock drill etc.(b)	The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS): based on past earthquakes and soil characteristics, publish the seismic zoning map of India. According to this map, the country has been grouped into four seismic zones i.e. Zone-II, III, IV and V. Zone V is considered to be the most seismically active, while Zone II is the least. The Jharkhand State comes under Zone II, III and IV; with majority of land area falling under Zone II and III. The important cities that fall under the high seismic Zones of IV and V, State/UT-wise are given in Table 1.(c)	West Bengal comes under Zone II, III and IV on the Seismic zoning map of India; with majority of land area falling under Zone II and III. (d)	The areas have been classified based on the past earthquakes and local site properties.
