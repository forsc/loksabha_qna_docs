                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) & (b):	In pursuance of Union Budget 2020-21, ‘KISAN RAIL’ Service was initiated  by Indian Railways that serve as trains with multi commodities (all perishables and agro-products and seeds), multiconsignors, and multi consignees primarily to enable farmers and producers to move their agricultural produce from rural areas to major towns and cities. These trains operate in a time-tabled manner, whereby loading and unloading can be done at any of the stations with stoppages. A farmer can book a few kilograms to several Tonnes as per his requirement and no minimum or maximum size of consignment is prescribed.So far, Indian Railways have operated 157 Kisan Rail services on 18 routes for transportation of fruits, vegetables and other perishables. Under ‘Operation Greens – TOP to Total’ scheme of Ministry of Food Processing Industries, a subsidy of 50% is being granted on the transportation of fruits and vegetables via Kisan Rail.Furthermore, Bharatmala Pariyojana has been taken up by Ministry of Road, Transport & Highways, which envisages the development of 34,800 km of National Highways under Phase I of the program to improve the efficiency of logistics and freight movement in the Nation. As a part of the Bharatmala Pariyojana Phase I, 24 greenfield corridors covering about 7500 km has been planned which includes 6 Greenfiled Expressways of 2375 km and 18 greenfield access-controlled corridors of 5325 km, passing through hinterland regions thereby improving connectivity to major urban centres providing a boost to economy in these regions.Contd…2/--2-To further address the transportation issues of Farmers, Farmers Producers Organizations (FPOs) and Traders, the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers’ Welfare, Govt. of India has launched the Kisan Rath Mobile Application.  The App facilitates the Farmers, FPOs and Traders to post their load requests for transportation of agriculture and horticulture produce which are sent to transport aggregators and individual transporters who can revert to them with service details. So far 99,756 tractor trolleys and 9,85,232 trucks have been on boarded for providing services. ********
