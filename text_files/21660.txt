                                                        (a) & (b):  Rural Health Statistics (RHS) is an annual publication, based on Health care administrative data reported by States/UTs. RHS provides information on rural health infrastructure and requirements of public health facilities in rural/tribal areas as reported by States. As per the RHS 2019, the state-wise details of shortfall of health facilities in rural areas is at Annexure-1 and the state-wise details of number of Sub Centres (SCs), Primary Health Centres (PHCs), Health and Wellness Centres Sub-Centres (HWCs-SCs), Health and Wellness Centres-PHCs (HWCs-PHCs) & Community Health Centres (CHCs) functioning in tribal areas is at Annexure-2.“Public Health and Hospital” being a State subject, the primary responsibility of ensuring availability of healthcare facilities including development of health infrastructure in backward and tribal areas lies with respective State/UT Governments. To address the healthcare challenges, particularly in rural areas, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in 2005 to supplement the efforts of the State/UT Governments to provide accessible, affordable and quality healthcare to all those who access public health facilities. Currently, NRHM is a sub-mission of National Health Mission (NHM).National Health Mission (NHM) supplements the efforts of the State/UT governments to provide accessible, affordable and quality healthcare to all those who access public health facilities including in backward and tribal areas. Under the National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their health care systems including setting-up/upgrading public health facilities and augmenting health human resource on contractual basis for provision of equitable, affordable healthcare to all its citizens particularly the poor and vulnerable population including tribal population based on requirements posed by the States in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs).Various interventions that are implemented for better healthcare in tribal areas and beneficiaries are as follows;•	The population norms for setting up Health Facilities in tribal areas are relaxed. Against the population norms of 5,000, 30,000, and 1,20,000 for setting up of Sub Centre, PHC and CHC respectively, in tribal and desert areas its 3,000, 20,000 and 80,000.•	Relaxed norms for Mobile Medical Units (MMUs)•	All tribal majority districts whose composite health index is below the State average have been identified as High Priority Districts (HPDs) and these districts receive more resources per capita under the National Health Mission (NHM) as compared to the rest of the districts in a State. •	Implementation of Free Drugs and Free Diagnostics Service Initiatives.•	SC/ST households are covered under Ayushman Bharat, Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) for health coverage up to Rs 5 Lakh per family per year as per Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC).Due to above interventions, there has been 67.89 % increase in facilities available in Tribal areas compared to 16.24% increase for all, between 2005 and 2019:Type of Facility	All India	Tribal Areas	RHS2005	RHS2019	%Increase	RHS2005	RHS2019	%IncreaseCHCs	3222	5685	76.44	643	1022	58.94PHCs	23109	30045	30.01	2809	4211	49.91SCs	142655	160713	12.65	16748	28682	71.25Total	168986	196443	16.24	20200	33915	67.89(c):  As per information received, the Government of Andhra Pradesh is establishing 5 multi-speciality hospitals in tribal areas and among them, two are in north Andhra region (Seetampeta, Parvathipuram) @ Rs 49.26 crores each.
