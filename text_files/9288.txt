                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS & SPORTS{ SHRI KIREN RIJIJU }(a) and (b) Yes Sir. The scheme of Panchayat Yuva Krida aur Khel Abhiyan (PYKKA) was discontinued with effect from 31.03.2014 and Rajiv Gandhi Khel Abhiyan (RGKA) was introduced with effect from 01.04.2014 for holistic development of sports at Block level. Subsequently, RGKA was discontinued after launch of Khelo India Scheme in 2016-17.(c) Under Rajiv Gandhi Khel Abhiyan, Rs. 81.19 crore was spent by this Ministry for promotion of sports in rural areas for conducting sports competitions. Khelo India Scheme does not distinguish between rural and urban areas. Under the scheme funds are released to State/Union Territories as a whole for creation of sports infrastructure and holding of annual sports competitions.(d) Khelo India Scheme does not provide for setting up of stadium. As such, no new stadium has been sanctioned either in urban or rural areas during the period of operation of the scheme.****
