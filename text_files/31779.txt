ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE					(SHRI AJAY BHATT)IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE  (a) to (c): Ministry of Defence has notified 1st “Positive Indigenisation list” of 101 items on 21st August, 2020 and 2nd “Positive Indigenisation list” of 108 items on 31st May, 2021 for which an embargo has been imposed on the import beyond the timelines up to December 2025 indicated against them. This is a big step to promote indigenisation in defence sector. This offers a great opportunity to the Indian defence industry to manufacture these items using their own design and development capabilities to meet the requirements of the Indian Armed Forces and contribute in economic growth. These  lists include some high technology weapon systems like artillery guns, assault rifles, corvettes, sonar systems, transport aircrafts, light combat helicopters (LCHs), radars, wheeled armoured platform, rockets, bombs, armoured command post vehicle, armoured dozor and many other items to fulfill the needs of our Defence Services. *****
