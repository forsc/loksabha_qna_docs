ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (e)  The average annual water availability of any region or country is largely dependent upon hydro-meteorological and geological factors. However, water availability per person is dependent on population of the country and for India, per capita water availability in the country is reducing due to increase in population. Due to high temporal and spatial variation of precipitation, the water availability in many regions of the country is below the national average and may be facing water stress / scarce conditions.	As per the assessment jointly carried out by Central Ground Water Board and the State Government for 2017, out of total 584 Mandals in the Telangana state, 70 Mandals (12% of the total Mandals) have been categorized as ‘Over-exploited’, where ‘Annual Ground Water Extraction’ is more that ‘Annual Extractable Ground Water Resource’.The Government of Telangana has informed that the available inflows have been effectively & efficiently utilized for both Irrigation and drinking water needs for the last five years i.e., 2014-15 to    2019-20.Contd…P/2//2//Water Resources projects are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the state governments themselves as per their own resources and priorities. In order to supplement the efforts of the state governments, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes.During 2016-17, eleven ongoing projects of Telangana were prioritized under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana - Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (PMKSY-AIBP) in consultation with the State for completion in phases. Against the eligible balance amount of Central Assistance (CA) of Rs.1129.693 Cr., for these prioritized projects, CA of Rs. 777.03 Cr. has been released/sanctioned since April, 2016. All the eleven projects have been included under Command Area Development & Water Management (CADWM) programme. During 2016-19, central share of Rs. 36.34 crore has been released to Telangana for CADWM works of these projects. So far, no central assistance proposal has been submitted by State of Telangana for the 2019-20.Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is implementing Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) in 500 cities with mission components such as water supply, storm water drainage, etc. In the State of Telangana, projects under AMRUT are being implemented in 12 cities, namely, Adilabad, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), Karimnagar, Khammam, Mahbubnagar, Miryalaguda, Nalgonda, Nizamabad, Ramagundam, Siddipet, Suryapet and Warangal. Out of these, water supply projects have been taken up in 10 cities. So far, a central assistance of Rs.662.37 crores has been provided to the State of Telangana under AMRUT.*****
