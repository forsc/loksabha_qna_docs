ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) Under the Namami Gange Programme, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is carrying out monitoring for assessment of River Ganga water quality at 30 locations in Uttar Pradesh through Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board. River water quality is assessed for notified primary water quality criteria for bathing water w.r.t parameters potential Hydrogen (pH) (6.5-8.5), Dissolved Oxygen (= 5 mg/l), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (= 3 mg/l) and Faecal Coliforms (= 2500 MPN/100 ml). All the locations in Uttar Pradesh are monitored on fortnightly basis.Based on the manual water quality assessment by CPCB’s in 2021 (Jan to May), pH (median) and DO (median) are meeting the primary water quality criteria for bathing at all the monitoring locations in Uttar Pradesh. Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) has been found within the acceptable limits except marginal exceedance (BOD: 3.1 to 4.1 mg/L) in locations/stretches (a) Bithoor, Kanpur to Kala Kankar, Rai Bareilly and (b) from Down stream (D/s) Mirzapur to Tarighat, Ghazipur (except (U/s) Varanasi, Assighat). Faecal Coliforms (FC) (median) is meeting the primary water quality criteria for bathing in the entire stretch of river in Uttar Pradesh except (i) Up Stream (U/s) Kanpur (Ranighat), Shuklaganj D/s to Bathing Ghat (Jajmau bridge) (ii) Down stream (D/s) Mirzapur to Tarighat, Ghazipur (except U/s Varanasi, Assighat).(b) & (c)  The pollution in river Ganga is not only due to discharge of effluents from industries but also due to domestic waste water as well as from solid waste ingress into the river. As per the inventorization of 2020-21, 913 Grossly Polluting industries (GPIs) discharging into river Ganga in the State of Uttar Pradesh were inspected by CPCB through 16 third party technical institutes and respective actions are already taken by State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/ Pollution Control Committee (PCC). As per CPCB’s data on Grossly Polluting industries (GPIs) inspection in 2020-21, it is observed that about 139.419 Million Litres per Day (MLD) effluents is being discharged into river Ganga in Uttar Pradesh having BOD load of 4.58 Tons Per Day (TPD).Contd…P/2//2//(d)  The steps taken by the Government to tackle the pollution of river Ganga are as follows:Under Namami Gange Programme, a diverse set of interventions for cleaning and rejuvenation of river Ganga and its tributaries have been taken up. These includes pollution abatement activities including domestic sewage, industrial effluent, solid waste, River front Management, Aviral Dhara, Rural Sanitation, Afforestation, Biodiversity Conservation, Public Participation etc. A total of 353 projects are taken up at a sanctioned cost of Rs.30,458 crore out of which, 178 projects have been completed.The polluted river stretches in the country are being rejuvenated through approved action plans to achieve the target of outdoor bathing criteria notified by Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC). At present, State Governments are implementing Action Plans drawn by State River Rejuvenation Committees for restoration of water quality of the identified polluted river stretches. The implementation is being monitored regularly at State level by Chief Secretary of the respective State/UT and at Central level by the Central Monitoring Committee under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Jal Shakti. Stringent monitoring and regulation of industries and pollution sources is undertaken to assess the compliance status of Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) for enforcing regulatory framework on the polluting industries. Stringent action is taken by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)/State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/ Pollution Control Committees against the GPIs discharging into main stem of Ganga River & its tributaries which are non-complying with respect to the prescribed norms.MoEF&CC formulates and notifies standards for emission or discharge of environmental pollutants viz. air pollutants and water pollutants from industries, operations or processes with an aim to protect and improve the quality of the environment and abate environmental pollution.Industry specific effluent/emission standards are notified under Schedule-I: ‘Standards for Emission or Discharge of Environmental Pollutants from Various Industries’ of Environment Protection Act, 1986. State Pollution Control Boards and Pollution Control Committees in States and Union Territories, respectively are adhered to ensure the compliance of these standards. So far, 47 industry specific effluent standards and 63 industry specific emission standards have been notified.Further, the identification and assessment of quality and quantity of major drains joining river Ganga and its tributaries, establishment/upgradation of Waste Water Treatment Plants (STPs and CETPs) for the towns located on Ganga main stem and its tributaries, performance evaluation of those Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) and Common Effluent Treatment Plans (CETPs) are undertaken.Construction works are under progress for 20 MLD Common Effluent Treatment Plan (CETP) for Jajmau tannery cluster Kanpur, largest of its type in the country, for pollution abatement in River Ganga at a cost of Rs.617 crore.  This addresses a long-standing challenge posed to river Ganga due to pollution from tannery cluster in Jajmau area.  Up-gradation projects for other CETPs have been sanctioned in the tannery clusters of Unnao, Banther and textile cluster at Mathura..*****
