ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES (SHRI RAMESWAR TELI) (a) & (b): Ministry of Food Processing Industries is implementing the Central Sector Scheme of Integrated Cold Chain and Value Addition Infrastructure as one of the component of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana with the objective of arresting post-harvest losses of perishables by encouraging the creation of primary processing, preservation and value addition infrastructure and transportation facilities (reefer/ insulated vans) across the country. To meet these objectives, the Scheme for Integrated Cold Chain & Infrastructure was launched in 2008. 292 projects have been approved as on 30.06.2019 and out of these, 154 projects have started commercial operations. Ministry does not support setting up of stand-alone cold storage projects. Small-scale cold storage plants are assisted by Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare through the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) for development of Horticulture in the country and Scheme for Capital Investment Subsidy for Construction/ Expansion / Modernization of Cold Storages and Storages for Horticulture Products of National Horticulture Board.  (c) & (d): Under the Scheme for Integrated Cold Chain & Value Addition Infrastructure, this Ministry invites proposals for setting up of cold chain projects by floating Expression of Interest (EoI). Promoters may submit their proposals against the EoI. The eligible proposals are approved based on the operational guidelines of the scheme. The entrepreneurs from Arani may also avail the benefit under the Scheme.  *****
