ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Yes, Sir. There is a proposal to redevelop the Central Vista area wherein it is proposed to construct a new additional Parliament building as well as Common Central Secretariat. The existing Parliament Building was constructed in 1927 and it is over 90 years old.  Its existing facilities and amenities are inadequate to meet the current demand.  There is acute shortage of office space  and  there  are  no  individual  chambers  for Members of Parliament. The other buildings on the Central Vista were built after Independence i.e. Krishi Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan etc. These buildings are more than 50 years old and there is shortage of working space, parking, amenities and services in these buildings for efficient office atmosphere. The spread of Central Government Ministries and Departments in different locations leads to inefficiency and the problems can be resolved by developing a Common Central Secretariat.       The Central Vista, which is the main boulevard of Delhi extending from Rashtrapati Bhawan to India Gate is one of the most visited places in Delhi.  It is used for Republic Day Parade and various other functions organized in the lawns and green spaces which showcase the capital to the world.  However, it lacks basic public facilities, amenities and parking.  The un-organized vending and haphazard parking leads to the congestion and gives a poor public perception.  Therefore, there is a need for upgradation of Central Vista.(b)	There is no proposal for redeveloping of heritage buildings. (c)	No Sir.(d)	There is no proposal of redeveloping the heritage buildings in the Central Vista.(e)	The cost of redevelopment of Central Vista area i.e. for Common Central Secretariat and new Parliament Building as well as improvement of Central Vista area shall be worked out after finalization of the proposals.                                         *****
