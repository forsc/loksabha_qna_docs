ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) to (b) The cement consumption is still around 240 kg per capita against global average of 530 kg per capita, which shows significant potential for the growth of cement industry. About 65% of cement demand comes from housing and real-estate sector, 20% comes from infrastructure and remaining 15% is related to industrial development. New metro rail projects, development of regional airports, national highway grid as well as state roads through Bharatmala, railways infrastructure, multimodal river terminals for cargo, public infrastructure for smart cities as well as upcoming cities and towns will require huge quantities of cement and concrete. The cement consumption is expected to rise in coming times since India has a lot of potential for development in infrastructure and cement sector will benefit from it. The cement production has slightly decreased due to the effect of Covid 19 lockdown. The State-wise data is not being maintained centrally. The installed cement capacity and cement production in the last three years is as below:Financial Year	Installed Cement Capacity(million tonnes/annum)	Cement Production(million tonnes/annum)	Capacity Utilisation(%)2018-19	          537.21	  337.32	62.772019-20	          537.21	  334.37	62.212020-21	           ~550	          299.95	54.54
