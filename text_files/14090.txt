ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d): State-wise details of reserved accommodation are not maintained. However, during financial year 2018-19, total end to end reserved accommodation defined in the computerised Passenger Reservation System (PRS) of Indian Railways for all trains including those serving the states of Gujarat, Bihar and West Bengal was approximately 48.87 crore. This is 1.45 crore more than the accommodation in 2017-18 which was approximately 47.42 crore. Providing additional reserved accommodation to cater to the requirement of increasing passenger traffic on Indian Railways is a continuous and ongoing process based on demand pattern, technical feasibility  and availability of resources.*****
