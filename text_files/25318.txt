ANSWER




                                                        (a)	The number of youths imparted skill training under various schemes of Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), namely (i) Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) (ii) Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) (iii) National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) (iv) Craftsman Training Scheme  is 2.35 Crore excluding fee-based programmes, not counted for this purpose.  (b)	Details of number of persons trained, State-wise,  under the above schemes during 2015-16 to 2020-21are given at  Annexure I to IV.(c)	Technical and Vocational Education Training ecosystem faced many challenges due to nationwide lockdown due to outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic which caused disruption in classroom and onsite trainings. However, to mitigate the hardship caused, online blended training programmes were introduced in both short term and long skilling. (d)  Blended Training through Digital Skills is crucial in the post Covid era to ensure skillingfor the youth and also to address the requirements of Industrial Revolution 4.0. In job roleswhere there can be partial delivery of skilling using on-line modules, blended trainingprogrammes may be feasible. Such training programmes using on-line mode can have advantage such asincreasing the reach of training, less commutation for trainees, particularly womentrainees, etc.The National Skill Development Corporation, under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), has created e-Skill India, a multi-lingual portal, providing e-skilling opportunities to the Indian youth. e-Skill India works collaboratively as an e-Learning aggregator portal by establishing strategic digital skilling partnerships with knowledge partners to bring best-in-class digital opportunities for the Indian youth under one roof. The portal has over 900 e-courses and more than 7.5 lakh enrolments. Majority of e-courses on e-Skill India are offered for free.Similarly, in the field of long term training, the Directorate General of Training under MSDE has launched Bharat Skill Portal covering 29 popular courses, e-learning video content for 71 courses and Question Bank for all the 137 trades under Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS) for ITIs, benefitting 9,38,851 trainees. Further, on the occasion of the World Youth Skill Day, on 15.07.2021, blended learning was launched in respect of six courses under the Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS) for long-term training through the Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs). The six courses are namely those for Electrician, Fitter, Welder, Computer Operator & Programming Assistant, Cosmetology and Diesel Mechanic.
