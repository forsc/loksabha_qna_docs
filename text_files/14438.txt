                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b) The average annual water availability of any region or country is largely dependent upon hydro-meteorological and geological factors. However, water availability per person is dependent on population of the country and for India, per capita water availability in the country is reducing due to increase in population. The average annual per capita water availability in the years 2001 and 2011 was assessed as 1816 cubic meters and 1545 cubic meters respectively which may further reduce to 1486 cubic meters in the year 2021. Annual per-capita water availability of less than 1700 cubic meters is considered as water stressed condition, whereas annual per-capita water availability below 1000 cubic meters is considered as a water scarcity condition. Due to high temporal and spatial variation of precipitation, the water availability in many regions of the country is below the national average and may be facing water stress / scarce conditions.(c) to (e)  The country is facing a number of challenges in water management such as high temporal and spatial variability in respect of availability of water resources, declining per-capita water availability due to increase in population, inadequate water storage for meeting future water demands, over-exploitation of ground water resources, droughts, low water use efficiency, etc.Water being a State subject, measures for management of water resources is primarily taken by respective State Governments.
