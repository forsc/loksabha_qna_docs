ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI(SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a) to (d) A statement is laid on the Table of the House.Statement referred to in the reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 57 due for reply on 22.07.2021.Swachh Bharat Mission-Grameen [SBM(G)] is demand driven programme, hence no fixed State-wise and year-wise allocation of funds could be made under the programme.  For implementation of the programme, each year State Governments submit their Annual Implementation Plans (AIPs) to the Government of India. The AIPs are approved by the National Scheme Sanctioning Committee (NSSC) constituted for the purpose.  Accordingly, annual allocation of funds is made for the States/UTs considering their AIPs. Details of the funds allocation made under the programme during the last three years State/UT-wise are given at Annexure-1. Funds are released to the States/UTs in instalments based on their annual allocation and subject to fulfilment of other conditions as prescribed in the SBM(G) guidelines e.g. submission of Statement of Expenditure, Utilisation Certificates and Audited Statement of Accounts.  Accordingly, on receipt of the demand from the States/UTs and the requisite documents, funds were released timely to them as per their eligibility.  In addition, performance based incentive grants as per the results of National Annual Rural Sanitation Surveys (NARSS) were also released to the States/UTs during 2017-18 to 2020-21 under Swachh Bharat Mission Support Operation of World Bank.  Details of the total Centre share funds (including Performance Based Incentive Grants) released to the States/UTs during the last three years are given at Annexure-2.  SBM(G) was launched by the Government with effect from 2nd October, 2014 with the main aim to make the country Open Defecation Free (ODF) by 2nd October, 2019, by providing access to toilets to all the rural households in the country. More than 10 crore individual household latrines were constructed under the programme during 2014 to 2019.  As a result, all the villages in the country declared themselves ODF as on 2nd October, 2019.  Having achieved the outcomes of the ODF, Phase-II of SBM(G) is now being implemented with the focus on ODF sustainability and to make arrangements for Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM) in all villages i.e. ODF Plus, by 2024-25. -----
