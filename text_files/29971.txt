CHINRAJ TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 08.12.2021 REGARDING  COMPENSATION TO FARMERS(a): Railway has honoured the judgement of LAOP No. 102/2012. Sanction of competent authority for making payment to Revenue department has been obtained and further, payment has been deposited with Revenue Divisional Officer, Karur.

However, some farmers approached court for enhancement of compensation. (c): Yes, Sir. There was an order in Execution Petition 149/2016 in Principal Sub-Ordinate Judge, Karur, Tamil Nadu that ordered to seize the material of Karur Junction. However, it could not be executed as the issues with land owners were sorted out, through district revenue authorities.  (d): Proposals / representations / suggestions both formal   and informal regarding Railway   projects are received from State Governments, Ministries of Central Government, Elected representatives, Consultative Committees etc. by Railways at various levels including Railway Board, Zonal Railways, Division Office  etc. As receipt of such proposals /suggestions is a continuous and dynamic process, centralized compendium of such requests is not maintained.*****
