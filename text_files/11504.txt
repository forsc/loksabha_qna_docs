ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW & JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) & (b):   As per information available on the web-portal of National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) as on 29.01.2020, 2.67 lakh cases are pending in Bombay High Court. 79,749 cases are pending in Bombay High Court for more than ten years. The data regarding cases related to coal miners is not available on the web-portal of National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG). (c) : Disposal of cases in courts is within the domain of the judiciary.  The time taken for disposal of a case depends on several factors such as category of the case (civil or criminal), complexity of the facts involved, nature of evidence, co-operation of stake-holders viz. bar, investigation agencies, witnesses and litigants besides the availability of physical infrastructure, supporting court staff and applicable rules of procedure.    Government has no role in disposal of cases in courts.  However, the Union Government is committed to speedy disposal of cases and reduction in pendency of cases to improve access to justice. The National Mission for Justice Delivery and Legal Reforms, established by the Union Government, has adopted many strategic initiatives, including improving infrastructure [court halls and residential units] for Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Courts, leveraging Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for better justice delivery, filling up of vacant positions of Judges in High Courts and Supreme Court, reduction in pendency through follow up by Arrears Committees at District, High Court and Supreme Court level, emphasis on Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) and initiatives to fast track special type of cases.***********
