ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): Presently Alliance Air, a wholly owned subsidiary of Air India, operates regular flights on Mumbai/Bhavnagar/Mumbai sectors as per schedule given below:9I-651 Mumbai/ Bhavnagar - 1755/1910 - Daily9I-652 Bhavnagar/ Mumbai - 1935/2110 - Daily;;However, due to non-availability of slots at Mumbai airport, currently, Alliance Air is unable to expand its flight operations ex-Mumbai. Further, with repeal of Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation was totally deregulated. Airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type, free to select whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate. In this regard, Government has laid down Route Dispersal Guidelines with a view to achieve better regulation of air transport services of different regions of the country. It is however up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability. As such, the airlines are free to operate anywhere in the country subject to compliance of Route Dispersal Guidelines issued by Government.
