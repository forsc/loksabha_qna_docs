                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a): 	The number of cases pending with various courts in the country is as under:-Sl. No. 	 Name of Court	Pendency as on 1	Supreme Court of India	70,038   (08.11.2021)*2	High Courts	 56,45,617 (06.12.2021)**3	District & Subordinate Courts	4,09,34,646 (06.12.2021)**Source   *Website of Supreme Court of India.**National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG).Disposal of cases pending in various courts is within the domain of judiciary. Timely disposal of cases in courts depends on several factors which, inter-alia, include availability of adequate number of judges and judicial officers, supporting court staff and physical infrastructure, complexity of facts involved, nature of evidence, co-operation of stake holders viz. bar, investigation agencies, witnesses and litigants and proper application of rules and procedures. There are several factors which may lead to delay in disposal of cases.  These, inter-alia, include vacancies of judges, frequent adjournments and lack of adequate arrangement to monitor, track and bunch cases for hearing.  The Central Government is fully committed to speedy disposal of cases in accordance with Article 21 of the Constitution and reducing pendency.  The Government has taken several initiatives to provide an ecosystem for faster disposal of cases by the judiciary.  National Mission for Justice Delivery and Legal Reforms was set up in August, 2011 with the twin objectives of increasing access by reducing delays and arrears in the system and enhancing accountability through structural changes and by setting performance standards and capacities.  The Mission has been pursuing a co-ordinated approach for phased liquidation of arrears and pendency in judicial administration, which, inter-alia, involves better infrastructure for courts including computerization, increase in strength of subordinate judiciary, policy and legislative measures in the areas prone to excessive litigation, re-engineering of court procedure for quick disposal of cases and emphasis on human resource development.	(b):	A statement showing the list of District and Subordinate Court Complexes as available at National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is at Annexure.(c) to (e):	The Department of Justice is implementing a scheme for setting up of 1023 Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) including 389 Exclusive POCSO Courts for expeditious trial and disposal of cases related to rape and POCSO Act. This Centrally Sponsored Scheme started in October, 2019 which has been extended for further two years up to 31.03.2023 at a total cost of Rs. 1572.86 crore with Central share of Rs.971.70 crore. As per information provided by the High Courts for the month of October 2021, a total of 681 FTSCs including 381 exclusive POCSO courts are functional in 27 States/UTs across the country. Upto October 2021, these courts have disposed of 64217 cases, while 181689 cases are still pending. Setting up of subordinate courts including Fast Track Courts (FTCs) and its functioning comes within the domain of the State Governments in consultation with the respective High Courts. The appointment of Public Prosecutors for conducting the criminal trials under the provisions of IPC and other special laws is done by the State Governments. However, Department of Legal Affairs in September 2019 requested the Chief Secretaries of all the States to ensure that special courts being setup to handle POCSO-related cases have adequate number of Special Public Prosecutors who are appointed under section 24(8) of Cr.PC with due regard to their qualifications as well as the orientation towards child rights.*******Annexure Sr NoStates/UTs	Total Districts	Total Court Complexes1	Andaman and Nicobar1	42	Andhra Pradesh13	1873	Assam30	714	Bihar37	795	Chandigarh1	26	Chhattisgarh23	897	Delhi11	128	Diu and Daman2	29	DNH at Silvasa1	210	Goa2	1611	Gujarat32	33212	Haryana21	5813	Himachal Pradesh11	5014	Jammu and Kashmir20	8115	Jharkhand24	2416	Karnataka30	20517	Kerala15	16518	Ladakh2	319	Madhya Pradesh50	22520	Maharashtra40	47821	Manipur9	2022	Meghalaya9	1023	Mizoram3	924	Nagaland4	525	Odisha	30	12226	Puducherry	4	027	Punjab22	6828	Rajasthan36	31129	Sikkim4	930	Tamil Nadu32	26531	Telangana10	11032	Tripura8	2433	Uttar Pradesh74	17034	Uttarakhand13	6135	West Bengal22	89Grand Total	646	3358STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (B) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2120 FOR ANSWER ON 10.12.2021 REGARDING POCSO CASES.
