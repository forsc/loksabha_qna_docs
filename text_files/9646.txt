To rapidly build-up immunization coverage special immunization drives like Mission Indradhanush, Intensified Mission Indradhanush, Gram Swaraj Abhiyaan (GSA), Extended GSA has been conducted to reach out to left out children and hard to reach children living in remote & inaccessible geographical areas and pregnant mothers with vaccines.(d):    The full immunization coverage is improving over the years. The State/UTs wise full immunization coverage for last three years is given in annexure 1. The State/ UT wise details of vaccine preventable diseases burden are given at annexure-II. (e):    The Government has been regularly reviewing the immunization program through various mechanisms. Some of these are (i) Immunization programme review with State/UTs, (ii) reviewed and feedback of HMIS, concurrent monitoring data with the states/ UTs for corrective measure (iii) Regular video conference with state at all level to discuss program implementation gap (iv) Cold chain review (v) supportive supervision including  concurrent monitoring  feedback of the programme to State/UTs (iv) National Program Coordination Committee (NPCC) reviews etc. (f) In addition to above Government of India is also undertaking awareness generation through electronic and print media through radio, television, posters, hoardings etc., strengthening inter personal communication & social mobilization by front line health workers like Auxillary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) and Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and other community workers for demand generation and empowering the community, regular utilizing of social media platforms like Twitter, WhatsApp’s etc.
