                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI A. NARAYANASWAMY)(a) & (b):  As per the new guidelines that streamlined the National Overseas Scholarship Scheme for SC students, preference is given to subjects viz science and technology where there is greater demand from the students. Further, research in subjects where Indian universities have considerable strength and where the field work has to be in India, can be done in Indian Universities for funding which there is already a National Fellowship Scheme. Accordingly, topics/courses concerning Indian Culture, Heritage, History & Social studies on India will not be considered for award of scholarships from 2022-23 onwards, whereas other Humanities/Social Sciences subjects, such as Law, Economics, Psychology etc. which need international exposure are still available for funding. This change has provided more opportunities for the poor SC students to study in global best universities.(c) & (d):  The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has launched, w.e.f. 01.04.2021, a Scheme for Promoting Silver Economy  (under Atal Vayo Abhyuday Yojana (AVYAY)) with an            objective to encourage the entrepreneurs to think about the problems of the elderly and come out             with innovative solutions. The Government aims to achieve the objective by providing upto Rs. 1 crore as financial assistance through equity participation, through an open invitation on a portal namely Seniorcare Ageing Growth Engine (SAGE).W.e.f 01.04.2021 the Ministry has also launched a Scheme of Senior Able Citizens for Re-Employment in Dignity (SACRED) portal. Many senior citizens have experience, time and energy which can be used by the business enterprises looking for stable employees with experience. The Human resources cells of many private enterprises seek experienced but stable persons in certain positions. The portal allows bringing these people together by virtual matching of preferences. The portal has been launched by the Vice President of India on International Day on Older Persons (IDOP), 2021 i.e. on 01/10/2021.With effect from 01.04.2021 the Ministry has also launched a Scheme of Action Groups Aimed at Social Reconstruction (AGRASR Groups): Elderly Self Help groups - The Senior Citizens are encouraged to form Self-Help Groups (SHGs), which will provide them with a platform to share the time constructively with each other. To attain financial assistance under the scheme, SHGs will function as ‘Action Groups Aimed at Social Reconstruction (AGRASR Groups)’.*****
