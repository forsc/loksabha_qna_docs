ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	The plastic products, which arecommonly used for packaging, carrying or dispensing commodities and include items intended to be used only once, for the same purpose, before they are discarded can be termed as ‘Single Use Plastic’ for ease of understanding.(b)	and (c)	The Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals (DCPC), Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers, has constituted a committee to look into the issues of Single-use plastic. The Committee has identified a list of possible Single-use plastic items based of their utilities and environmental impact and submitted its report to the Department. (d) and (e)	Considering the high environmental cost associated with the use ofSingle-use plastic, particularly the adverse effect on soil, water bodies and on marine environment, Hon’ble Prime Minister has announced India’s pledge to phase out Single-use plastic by 2022. As per the plastic Waste Management Rules ,2016 the carry bag made if virgin or recycled plastic less than fifty microns in thickness has been prohibited. There is complete ban on sachets using plastic material used for storing, packing or selling gutkha, tobacoo and pan masala. Further, 23 State and 9 UTs through their own notification have also imposed partial or complete prohibition on the use of plastic carry bags/single use plastic.However, to support the economic stability of the people working in the sector, the Government has identified Compostable plastic as one of the alternatives. To promote the use of compostable plastic, the restrictive provision of minimum thickness of fifty microns, as per Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016, does not apply to carry bags made up of compostable plastic, conforming IS/ISO 17088. Some of the State Governments which have banned the use of plastic bags in their respective States are allowing only the Compostable plastic bags for plant nurseries,horticulture, agriculture and other uses. Apart from the traditional materialssuch as jute bags, leaf plates, bamboo cutleries, the new materialssuch asbagasse-based products, banana stem-based products etc are now widely available in the market.Regarding,the use of plastic in food packaging, the Rules prohibit the use of carry bags made of recycled plastic or products made of recycled plastic for storing, carrying, dispensing or packaging ready to eat or drink food stuff.*****
