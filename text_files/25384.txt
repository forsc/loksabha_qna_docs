                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	Under the PM-KISAN Scheme the benefits are transferred in 3 equal installments of four-monthly period in a year. The benefits are transferred into the account of intended beneficiaries from the period of their registration under the scheme and thereafter for all subsequent period. The details of number of beneficiaries registered in the State of Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Maharashtra under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme district-wise and year-wise is given at Annexure-I while the total amount paid under the Scheme in the State of Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Maharashtra, district-wise and year-wise is given at Annexure-II.(b) & (c):	 Yes, Sir, The PM-KISAN is a continuous and ongoing Scheme under which the benefits are released to the beneficiaries after their correct and verified data is received from the respective State/UT Governments and the same has successfully been validated through Aadhar/PFMS/Income tax database at various levels. The data that fails the validation at any level is sent back to State Governments for correction. The payment is then made after the receipt of correct data. The payment of all installments has been and is continuously being made under the PM-KISAN in Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Maharashtra.(d) & (e):		The responsibility of enrolment/collecting the data of the farmer families lies with the respective State Governments.  The State Governments have been continuously requested and vigorously pursued for completing the exercise at the earliest, in mission mode and by organizing camps. Every week, a meeting is held with State Governments and other concerned stakeholders through Video Conferencing to review the preparedness of the States for the smooth and seamless implementation of the scheme. On the advice of the Union Government, the States have organized publicity/awareness camps to ensure expeditious Aadhaar authentication of the data of the beneficiaries along with new registrations and correction of already registered data. To achieve 100% Saturation, a special facility has also been provided to the farmers in the PM-Kisan portal, namely, Farmers Corner. Through this facility, the farmers can do their self-registration, farmers can edit their names in PM-Kisan database as per their Aadhaar card and also can know the status of their payment. The above facilities on Farmers Corner are also available through CSCs. A special Mobile App has also been launched which provides the facilities available through Farmers Corner.
