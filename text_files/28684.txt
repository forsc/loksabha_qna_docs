(iii)	Capital infusion in ECGC will increase its capacity to underwrite risks up to Rs.88,000 crore and this will enable ECGC to issue covers that can support additional exports of Rs.5.28 lakh crore over the five-year period in line with the existing pattern.

Further, Rs. ?33,000 Crore of additional exports (estimated support by NEIA) will help create 2.6 lakh new jobs, including around 12,000 in formal sector.
