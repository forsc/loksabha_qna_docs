ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) & (b) 	At the time of launch of Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) on 15.08.2019, out of total 3.31 Crore rural households in 117 Aspirational districts, only 31.11 Lakh (9.4%) households were having tap water connections, which has now increased to 1.09 Crore (33.85%) as reported by States on JJM-IMIS. (c) & (d) 	Under the Operational Guidelines for the implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission, certain difficult areas have been identified for taking up water supply work and provide tap water connections to households on priority, inter alia which includes Aspirational districts and SC/ ST majority villages. Since powers to plan, approve and implement water supply schemes are vested with State Governments, they have been requested to accord priority to Aspirational districts and SC/ ST majority villages. The same is being regularly reviewed with State Governments.(e)	The key features of the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) are to make provision of potable water to every rural household through Functional Household Tap Connections (FHTCs) at a service level of 55 litre per capita per day (lpcd) of prescribed quality (BIS:10500) and supply on a regular and long-term basis. At the time of launch of Jal Jeevan Mission on 15th August, 2019, out of total 18.94 Crore rural households in the country, 3.23 (17%) crore rural households had tap water connections. Since then, 4.52 Crore (23.84%) rural households have been provided tap water connections thus, as on date, 7.76 Crore (40.89%) rural households have provision of tap water supply.(f)	States/ UTs are annually allocated funds which is released based on progress of implementation. A Technical Committee under the chairmanship of Principal Scientific Advisor (PSA) to Government of India has been set up to examine and recommend various innovations and water related new technologies, which can be used in providing potable tap water supply to every household. In addition, the Department provides technical assistance to States as required by them. ***
