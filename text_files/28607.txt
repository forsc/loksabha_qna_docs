                                                                             THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                            (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a) & (b):  Yes Sir. The standard specifications of Light Urban Rail Transit System named “MetroLite” and rubber-tyred electric coach powered by overhead traction system running on a road slab with an exclusive right of way named “MetroNeo”, suitable for smaller cities or areas of cities with less projection of ridership were issued in July, 2019 and November, 2020 respectively. MetroLite and MetroNeo are the low cost mobility solutions with reduced system requirements and same experience, ease of travel in terms of comfort, convenience, affordability, safety, punctuality, reliability and environment- friendliness as that of conventional metro rail system. The low capital cost of these new transit modes than that of high capacity metro rail is due to light civil structure, lesser axle load, smaller stations, low power rated electrical equipment, low operation and maintenance cost etc. These systems can also be used as feeder system to conventional metro rail. (c) & (d):	Urban transport, which is an integral part of urban development, is a state subject. Hence, respective State Government/ Union Territories(UTs) is responsible for initiating and developing urban transport infrastructure including rail based mass transit modes viz. Metro Rail/MetroLite/MetroNeo/Regional Rapid Transit System(RRTS) etc.   As per Metro Rail Policy-2017, the Central Government considers financial assistance for such projects in cities or urban agglomerates, based on feasibility of the proposal and availability of resources, as and when posed by the concerned State Government/ Union Territories (UTs). The details of MetroLite and MetroNeo proposals received from various State Governments/Union Territories (UTs) for central financial assistance, State and City-wise, are as under:Sr No	State/UT	  City	           Name of Project1	Delhi	          Delhi	    Rithala-Narela MetroLite Corridor in the remaining 03                                     corridors of Delhi Metro Phase-IV2	Maharashtra	  Nashik    Nashik MetroNeo3	Jammu and Kashmir Jammu	    Jammu MetroLite4		          Srinagar  Srinagar MetroLite5	Uttar Pradesh	  Gorakhpur Gorakhpur MetroLite                         *****
