                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)	to (c)  As per information provided by the Board of Governors in supersession of Medical Council of India (MCI), 12,55,786 allopathic doctors are registered in the country as on 30th June, 2020. Assuming 80% availability, it is estimated that around 10.05 lakh doctors may be actually available for active service. It gives a doctor-population ratio of 1:1343 as per current population estimate of 135 crore against the WHO norms of 1:1000. Besides, there are 7.88 lakh Ayurveda, Unani and Homeopathy (AUH) doctors in the country. Assuming 80% availability, it is estimated that around 6.30 lakh Ayurveda, Unani and Homeopathy (AUH) doctors may also be available for service and considered together with allopathic doctors it gives a doctor population ratio of 1:825. As per provisional data of National Health Profile 2019, compiled by the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence(CBHI), one bed in Government Hospitals including Primary Health Centre (PHCs) in rural and urban areas is available for average 1890 people in the country. The requirement of hospitals beds varies from one region to another based on age mix of population and disease profile, their incidence and prevalence rates. Further, the details of State- wise number of  ICU  beds  and  ventilators  in different Government (Central and State) run Dedicated COVID Hospitals is at Annexure.  Data pertaining to international standards is not maintained centrally.Since Health is a state subject, it is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments to make efforts for improving healthcare facilities in the State in accordance with the requirement and fund availability. However, the Central Government provides assistance to the State Government in their efforts to provide better health care facilities to the people through various schemes including National Health Mission(NHM) and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.
