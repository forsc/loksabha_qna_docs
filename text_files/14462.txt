ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES(SHRI  NITIN GADKARI)(a) to (e):	Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) had notified Udyog Aadhaar Memorandum (UAM), a one-page online registration system for MSMEs on 18th September 2015 by replacing the filing of Entrepreneurs’ Memorandum (EM part-I & II).  UAM was amended in 2017 for incorporating new features. The memorandum is to be filed by a unit on self-certification basis and no additional document is required to be uploaded at the time of registration. However, the Central Government or the State Government may seek documentary proof of the information provided in the memorandum from the unit. The General Manager of the District Industries Center (DIC) of the concerned district can also undertake verification of the memorandum submitted by an enterprise and in case of any discrepancy, can take appropriate action.Only running units can register under UAM. Registration under UAM is purely voluntary and there is no compulsory license issued by the Ministry of MSME.Further, Industrial license is compulsory for the manufacture of Cigars and Cigarettes of tobacco and manufactured tobacco substitutes (Cigars, cheroots, cigarillos and cigarettes of tobacco or of tobacco substitutes) under the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951. Fresh Industrial licenses are not being issued since 1999 for health reasons.
