HARSH VARDHAN)(a) & (b):  A statement is laid on the Table of the HouseSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 492* FOR 26TH JULY, 2019(a):  NITI Aayog in collaboration with the World Bank and the Ministry of Health and family Welfare has brought out a comprehensive State Health Index report “Health States, Progressive India – Report on the Ranks of States and Union Territories, June 2019”. The report ranks the Sates / UTs on the basis of their overall performance and incremental improvement over the period 2015-16 (Base year) to 2017-18 (Reference year). This Health Index is a weighted composite index based on 23 indicators covering key aspects of health sector performance grouped into three domains namely Health Outcome, Governance and Information and Key Inputs / Processes. For better comparison, States / UTs have been classified into three categories viz., Larger States (21), Smaller States (8) and UTs (7). As per State Health Index report, overall health index of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, among 21 larger States, are 32.11 and 28.61 respectively for the year 2017-18 placing them relatively at lower position. The score varies in the range of 28.61 for Uttar Pradesh to 74.01 for Kerala. (b): “Public Health and Hospitals” being a State subject, the primary responsibility of improving the primary healthcare lies with respective State Government. However, under National Health Mission (NHM) support is provided to States for strengthening their healthcare systems based on the proposals received from them.Under the National Health Mission (NHM), higher per capita resources are allocated to the High Focus States including Uttar Pradesh and Bihar as compared to non-high focus States. ***
