ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) to (b): 		At present, as part of Public Distribution System (PDS) reforms, nearly 90% of total 23.4 Crore ration cards under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) across the country have been seeded with Aadhaar number of at least one member of the household. Linking of Aadhaar with ration cards is also dependent on enrolment/ generation and delivery of Aadhaar card to beneficiaries. Further, Department has issued a notification under the Section-7 of the Aadhaar Act 2016 on 08/02/2017 (as amended from time to time) for the use of Aadhaar in PDS for the distribution of subsidized foodgrains to eligible beneficiaries under the NFSA. Presently, the timeline given to States/UTs for linking of Aadhaar with all ration cards has been extended up to 31/03/2020. .........2/--2-(c) to (d): 		Although biometric authentication of beneficiaries has not been made compulsory by the Department, so far only more than 60% of total allocated foodgrains are distributed on monthly basis after biometric  authentication. However, Department vide letters dated 24/10/2017 and 08/11/2018 has issued clear instructions to all States/UTs that genuine beneficiaries/households shall not be denied from their entitled foodgrains under NFSA, only on the ground of not possessing an Aadhaar number, or due to any technical failure of electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) device including failure of biometric/ Aadhaar authentication of beneficiary owing to network/ connectivity/ linking issues. ****
