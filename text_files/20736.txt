ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)& (b) Many studies by different Organizations/ Institutes have been published from time to time, estimating mortality, morbidity, life expectancy, etc. attributable to environmental pollution based on models, simulations and varying assumptions. These studies are based on secondary data and extrapolation of findings from a small sample size to a larger population. These estimates do not depict the actual status as there are no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct correlation of death/ disease exclusively due to pollution. Health effects of pollution, including air pollution, are synergistic manifestation of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity, etc., of the individuals.(c) & (d) Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare along with Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) has conducted the study ‘India State-level Disease Burden Initiative’. The report, titled ‘India: Health of the Nation’s States - The India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative’  was published in 2017. The study report provided the distribution of diseases and risk factors across all states of the country from 1990 to 2016. The five leading risk factors for Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in 2016 includes child and maternal malnutrition, air pollution, dietary risks, high systolic blood pressure, and high fasting plasma glucose. The study  reported that the DALYs due to air pollution decreased by 23•6% in India from 1990 to 2016.  ******
