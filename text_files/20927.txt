ANSWER




                                                        (a) and (b)      National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) is implementing central component of Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) across the country which is for all sections including Persons with Disability (PwD) . As on 19.01.2021, around 48 thousand PwD candidates have been trained/oriented under PMKVY 2.0 across the country. Out of which, 122 PwD candidates are from Parbhani constituency of State of Maharashtra. However, no PwD candidates have been trained in Yavatmal-Washim constituency of State of Maharashtra. The State-wise number of PwD candidates trained/oriented under PMKVY 2.0, as on 19.01.2021, is given at Annexure. Under PMKVY 2.0, there are incentives to encourage participation of PwDs in the skill training namely; post placement support, monthly conveyance allowance, boarding and lodging etc. There is an exclusive Sector Skill Council for PwD namely Skill Council for PwD (SCPwD) for catering to the needs of the PwD candidates and it runs training in PwD-friendly training centres. Such centres are structurally designed to enable such candidates to experience beneficial training such as availability of Braille, computer screen reader for visually impaired, sign language interpreter for speech and hearing impaired at Training Centres. National Skill Development Agency has been subsumed under National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET) which has been notified by MSDE on 05th December, 2018 as an overarching regulatory body to establish minimum standards for the functioning of entities in both long and short term training. It, amongst others, anchors the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) and allied quality assurance mechanisms. In order to incorporate the needs of PwD in development of qualifications, a committee comprising of various stakeholders was set up in NSDA (now NCVET).  After several consultations the following decisions were taken: •   To include PwD component in the Qualification File Template.•   To add new sector in the NQR to reflect Qualifications being used for training of PwD.•   To invite (SCPwD) and Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DePwD), in stakeholder consultations of all job roles at NSDA (now NCVET), in order to obtain their inputs on the PwD amenability of job roles. (c) and (d)      Rozgar Melas are conducted by NSDC, PMKKs, SSCs and TPs as a part of overall “Placement incentives & Job Melas / Rozgar Utsav” component of PMKVY 2.0 and it is a ongoing process. Rozgar Melas are conducted for all persons including PwD candidates. Special attention is given to the differently abled candidates to provide them easier access to facilities such as registration windows for divyangjan were made according to the needs. Also, specific group of employers are invited to the Rozgar Melas who are interested in hiring Divyangjan.  Annexure The State-wise number of PwD candidates trained/oriented under PMKVY 2.0, as on 19.01.2021, is given below: S. No.	State/UT	PwD candidates trained/oriented1.	 	Andhra Pradesh	9902.
