ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d):	The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) was started in the year 2000 as 100% Centrally Sponsored Scheme. However, the funding pattern was modified to 60:40 between the Centre and States for all States except for 8 North Eastern and 3 Himalayan States for which the ratio was fixed at 90:10 based on the recommendations of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalization of Centrally Sponsored Schemes. The funding pattern was modified in order enhance the allocation to accelerate the execution of PMGSY and accommodate new proposals of the State Governments. There is no proposal to provide 100% Central Grant under PMGSY to the States. ******
