ANSWER




ANSWERMINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’) (a) to (e):	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 191 TO BE ANSWERED ON 02nd DECEMBER, 2019 ASKED BY SHRI ARUN SAO REGARDING “WEIGHT OF SCHOOL BAGS” (a):	Yes ,Sir. The State Government of Madhya Pradesh has notified guidelines for reduction of weight of school bags, wherein the maximum weight of school bags for classes I - X has been prescribed, along with the textbooks and subjects specified by the State Government and National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT).(b):	The States of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Telangana, Nagaland, West Bengal, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Goa, Kerala, Odisha, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Mizoram, Tripura and Union territories of Delhi, Dadra Nagar Haveli, Chandigarh and Lakshadweep have issued instructions/guidelines to reduce the weight of school bags. All States and UTs have been advised to formulate such policy. (c) to (e):	The Union Government has issued a communication to all States and UTs vide letter no. 1-4/2018-IS-3, dated 05/10/2018, to formulate the policy for reducing weight of school bags. The Ministry of Human Resource Development has also constituted an expert group to formulate a policy on children school bag and they have submitted a draft policy in this matter.The National Curriculum Framework (NCF)-2005 brought out by NCERT emphasizes upon shifting learning away from rote methods, connecting knowledge to life outside school, enriching the curriculum to provide for overall development of children rather than remain textbook centric and making examination more flexible and integrated to classroom life.The NCERT has taken following initiatives in this context:(i)		New syllabi and textbook reflects the NCF 2005 perspective on curriculum load and are interactive and based on child centered pedagogy. The NCERT textbooks and other teaching learning materials are available online on its website www.ncert.nic.in.(ii)		NCERT recommends only two books (Language and Mathematics) for Classes I and II and three books (Language, EVS and Mathematics) for Classes III to V.(iii)		NCF 2005 suggests that autonomy should be given to the schools to develop their own flexible time table so that school can teach two or three subjects each day giving students more time to do activities and develop deeper understanding of the concept. NCERT addresses this issue in capacity building programme for teachers and school heads. Also, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has issued circulars specifying the maximum number of books to be prescribed in classes I-VIII.  They have also issued a Circular on 12/09/2016 which provides detailed guidelines to schools, teachers and parents to reduce the weight of school bags and vide circular dated 13/08/2018 advised schools to ensure no homework for students till Class II..*****
