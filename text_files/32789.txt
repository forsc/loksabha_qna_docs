ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR TEXTILES  (SMT. DARSHANA JARDOSH)(a):	Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) sells pressed cotton bales only through a robust independent e-auction portal managed by a Public Sector Undertaking.  The present e-auction system for sale of cotton by CCI is fool-proof, transparent and buyers’ friendly and there is no scope of manipulating cotton prices in favour of any buyer segment including MNCs. CCI undertakes cotton procurement, if market price falls below Minimum Support Price (MSP). Since, right from the beginning of cotton season 2021-22, the ruling price of raw cotton is above MSP, there has been no requirement for CCI to undertake MSP operation.(b):	During current cotton season 2021-22 (1.10.2021 to 30.09.2022), CCI has setup 33 procurement centres in 10 districts under its branch office at Guntur in the state of Andhra Pradesh. List of district-wise procurement centres is at annexure-I.(c):	Ministry is constantly engaged with various stakeholders across the entire cotton value chain in respect of the prices of cotton and cotton yarn to harmonize their interest. Prices are affected by market forces of demand and supply. In addition, cotton being an internationally traded commodity, its price is also affected by the price in the international market.
