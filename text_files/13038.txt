                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)&(b):      Wages under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA), 2005 are notified and revised annually based on Consumer Price Index-Agricultural Labour (CPI-AL) by the Central Government in accordance with the provisions of Section 6(1) of the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA. The revised wages are made applicable from 1st April of the year. Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is a demand driven wage employment programme. It provides livelihood security i.e., fall back option for livelihood for the rural households when no better employment opportunity is available. The demand for work is influenced by various factors such as rain-fall, availability of alternative and remunerative employment opportunities outside Mahatma Gandhi NREGS etc. The data regarding prevalent wages of men and women in the market in respect of States are not maintained centrally in this Ministry.  (c)&(d):       Fund release to States/UTs under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is a continuous process and Central Government is committed in making funds available to the States keeping in view the demand for work and adherence by the States to the Scheme Guidelines. The Ministry seeks additional fund for Mahatma Gandhi NREGS as and when required for meeting the demand for work on the ground. In the Financial Year 2019-20, the budget provision at Budget Estimate (BE) stage was Rs.60,000 crore.  Due to increase in demand, the Ministry has requested for additional budget allocation.  The budget allocation  has been enhanced to Rs.71001.81 crore at the Revised Estimate (RE) stage.******
