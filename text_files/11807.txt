Under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) version 2.0, Selected Airline Operator(SAO) was awarded Hisar-Chandigarh-Delhi-Hisar network under RCS - UDAN. The same was terminated/cancelled due to non-compliance of contract agreement by SAO. No valid bid was received in subsequent rounds of bidding under this scheme. RCS - UDAN is a market driven mechanism. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN from time to time.
