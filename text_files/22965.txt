                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE; MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MINISTER OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN) ????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????, ??????? ?? ???????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ??????? ????????. ???? ?????(a)  &  (b)   National Science Day (NSD- 2021) was celebrated by Department of Science and Technology (DST) at India International Centre, New Delhi on 28th February, 2021. The theme of NSD 2021 was ‘Future of STI: Impacts on Education, Skills and Work’ emphasizing the necessity of understanding of science and reaching out to people in the dynamic S&T scenario. National Council for Science & Technology Communication (NCSTC) of DST is nodal agency to support, catalyze and coordinate celebration of the NSD throughout the country, particularly in scientific institutions & research laboratories. The NSD lecture was delivered by Dr (Ms.) Gargi B Dasgupta, Director, IBM Research India, Bangalore, India on the topic “ The future of jobs and the urgency of Science ”.  Awards were given on February 28, 2021, the National Science Day, to individuals/institutions for their work related to S&T Communication & Popularisation, Science Journalism, Augmenting Writing Skills for Articulating Research (AWSAR) Awards and Science & Engineering Research Board (SERB) Women Excellence Awards.  Two databases on “ S&T Awards in India ” and “I ndian origin academicians and scholars abroad ” were dedicated to the nation. The database on “ S&T Awards in India ” attempts to build and manage the information about science and technology awards instituted since 1928 in India. It provides data on various aspects such as discipline, periodicity, categories, awards level, chronology and state-wise distribution of awards and their sponsors. It aims to help planners, policy makers, funding agencies and other stakeholders to plan their R&D initiatives. The database on “Indian Origin Academicians”, in turn, has information on 23,472 Indian academicians and research scholars working in various countries. It explored around 2,700 academic university websites to gather this information from selected countries (US, UK, Australia and Canada). It is of immense relevance in the present-day scenario where international collaborations with knowledge experts are the key factor for S&T led growth and competitiveness. The Government has observed National Science Day by also organizing Educational Webinars, Online symposium, secured E-Pledges and virtual public talks. Department of Science & Technology provides a token support to several states for celebrating National Science Day 2021 wherein several activities like, Mobile Photography (Science In Nature), Science Models,  Declamation, Oral Presentations, educational tours,  Poster & Slogan Competitions, Science Exhibitions, Lectures on Sir C.V. Raman,   Awareness Series on Vaccination of Covid-19, Debate on General Science & Covid-19 were conducted. (c)     During NSD celebrations, students and teachers were exposed to concept and ideas for Atmanirbhar Bharat i.e. the applications of Science and Technology for ''self-reliant India'' in relation to economic development, growth and creation of new jobs in the country.  Students have been encouraged for science education, research and innovation through young entrepreneurs/start-ups meet and popular lectures in order to bring creativeness and imagination/ideas that can be converted into real-time research to develop new indigenous products, address problems in the society thus leading to self-reliance. Various S&T institutes organized Seminars on Atmanirbhar Bharat related topics for societal benefit and for improving of the socio- economic conditions.  Young curious minds have been motivated to think beyond and come up with ideas for challenging problems, where   science forms the base of decision making, pursue science and research as a career option and join the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign in building a robust ecosystem. *****
