THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI  PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) to (e):  	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.******** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 494 FOR ANSWER ON 6TH APRIL, 2022.(a) to (e):	Shared mobility is broadly defined as transportation services and resources that are shared among users, either concurrently or one after another. This includes public transit, micro mobility (bike sharing, scooter sharing), automobile-based modes (car sharing, rides on demand, and micro transit) and commute-based modes or ridesharing (carpooling and vanpooling). Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has issued the Motor Vehicle Aggregators Guidelines, 2020, on 27th November, 2020, in accordance with section 93 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, for compliance by all States/ UTs. These guidelines provides a guiding framework to the State/UT Governments to consider for issuance of license as well as regulating the business being conducted by such Aggregators. To support the Shared Mobility Industry, the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) have published Taxi Policy Guidelines in December, 2016; and provisions have been made for better utilization of transportation assets and reducing traffic congestion at the state level under The Motor Vehicles Amendment Act, 2019 of MoRTH. Several States have also developed policies to regulate the shared mobility ecosystem. Initiatives for planning and management of public transport system including issues of share mobility, are taken up by the State Governments/ Union Territories/ Urban Local Bodies. Scheme of implementation or operation of carpooling is not formulated in the State of Karnataka.Government addresses transport related issues/grievances through prescribed mechanisms. However, transportation being a State subject, concerned State Governments/ UTs are responsible for promotion of shared mobility and redressal of operational difficulties related to this issue. *****
