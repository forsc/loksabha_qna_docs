An action plan of the National Mission was formulated under 5 strategic initiatives which are reviewed by the Advisory Council of the National Mission from time to time.  Eleven meetings of the Advisory Council have been held so far.  Activities under the National Mission are of an on-going nature and regular reports are presented before the Advisory Council of the National Mission.(d): Hearings and disposal of cases in courts is within the domain of the judiciary.
