                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS,  HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) to (c) 	Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) monitors the performance of telecom service providers including Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL)against the benchmark for various Quality of Service (QoS) parameters laid down by TRAI by way of QoS regulations issued from time to time, through Quarterly Performance Monitoring Reports (PMRs) and the performance is assessed for the service area as a whole.  As per PMR issued by TRAI for the quarter ending September 2019, BSNL and MTNL are meeting all the benchmarks for all the parameter in its Licensed Service Areas (LSAs)except for the parameter for call drops in West Bengal service area only by BSNL.Number of subscribers of BSNL and MTNL for the last three years is as under:<pre>S. No.	PSU	 Number of subscribers (in crore) as on		31.03.2017	31.03.2018	31.03.20191	BSNL	11.51	12.41	12.692	MTNL	0.71	0.69	0.67</pre>Despite stiff competition, BSNL is managing to increase its subscriber’s base.  However, there is marginal decline in subscriber’s base of MTNL.BSNL has informed that to further improve its network and services in all its LSAs, it is continuously adding new equipment and updating existing equipment in both urban and rural areas under various network expansion phases. MTNL has informed that it has recently improved its wireless network by increasing the download and upload speed.Further, the Cabinet in the meeting held on 23.10.2019 approved the revival plan for BSNL and MTNL. With the revival plan, it is expected that BSNL/MTNL will turn around soon and will be able to provide improved services. The revival plan also includes administrative allotment of spectrum to BSNL/MTNL for providing 4G services. With 4G services, BSNL/MTNL will be able to offer high speed wireless data services, which will make them competitive and further improve the customer experience.************
