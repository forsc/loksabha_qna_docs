Government has, from time to time, appointment some prominent persons for specific assignments in government, keeping in view their specialized knowledge and expertise in the domain area. NITI Aayog, in its three year Action Agenda, and the Sectoral Group of Secretaries (SGoS) on Governance, in its report submitted in February, 2017, have recommended for induction of personnel in the middle and senior management level in the Government with the twin objectives of bringing in fresh talent as well as augment the availability of manpower. Based on this, it has been decided, in principle, to appoint outside experts to 40 positions at Deputy Secretary/Director level.*****
