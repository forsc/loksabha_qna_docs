                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE(DR BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (c): Ministry of Health & Family Welfare continues to closely monitor COVID-19 trajectory in the country. An upsurge of COVID-19 cases in the country was observed by the end of December, 2021 which was primarily driven by the Omicron variant. In April-May, 2021, a high number of cases were reported on daily basis across the country. On 7th May 2021, 4,14,188 COVID-19 new cases were reported in the country by States/UTs. During the present surge in cases, Union Health Ministry has continued to urge and advise all States/UTs to maintain focus on surveillance and containment, appropriate clinical management of cases and strict adherence to COVID appropriate behaviors besides focus on vaccination. Vaccination for young adolescents (15-18 years of age) and Precaution Dose for healthcare workers, frontline workers and elderlies with co-morbidities was also started. Health infrastructure was upgraded through funds provided under ECRP-II package to the States. As on 31st January 2022, the trajectory seems to be stabilizing and even declining in certain States/UTs. The situation is monitored on a regular basis. ***
