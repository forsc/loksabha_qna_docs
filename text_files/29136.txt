ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI (SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a) to (g) A statement is laid on the table of the House. Statement referred in reply of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 80 to be answered on 02.12.2021 (a) to (c) 	Water supply is a State subject. Government of India supplements the efforts of States by providing financial and technical assistance to make provision of drinking water to rural population. Since August 2019, Jal Jeevan Mission is being implemented in partnership with States to make provision of potable tap water supply to every rural household of the country by 2024.To expedite the planning and implementation, as well as monitoring and handhold States/ UTs including Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Jharkhand, regular reviews as well as field visits are undertaken by teams from the mission.A few of the common observations made across these States are as under:i.)	These States need to expedite finalization of Village Action Plans(VAPs) and constitute Village Water & Sanitation Committees (VWSCs)/ Pani Samitis as a sub-committee of Gram Panchayats;ii.)	engage Implementation Support Agencies (ISAs) for all villages to bring awareness and mobilize local village communities; andiii.)	train 5 women in every village for water quality testing through Field Test Kits (FTKs) and report the same as a part of surveillance;A few key observations made by the visiting teams and shared with these States are as under:Maharashtra: In 2021-22, so far, the State has provided tap water connections to only 4.90 lakh rural households. Engagement of third-party inspection agencies and their tagging with the project sites were to be completed. Skilling of village people to prepare masons, fitters, plumbers, electricians, fitters, pump operators, etc.; training of 5 women in each village for use of FTKs for water quality surveillance need to be expedited. Moreover, lack of awareness was also observed in the local village communities about their role in the implementation of the mission and community mobilization needs to be expedited.Rajasthan: In 2021-22, the State has provided tap water connections to only 2.06 lakh households. The State is yet to take up the implementation works in about 36 thousand villages, which needs to be expedited. It also needs to expedite the execution of multi-village water supply schemes. The State is yet to formulate operation &maintenance (O&M) policy and to explore solar based schemes to minimize the expenditure on regular operation and maintenance of water supply schemes. Moreover, it was also observed that at some places, the tap water connections were provided without pedestal support and platform. O&M related issues, leakage of pipeline, unhygienic conditions due to improper grey water management were also observed at certain locations. It was suggested to geo-tag all water supply assets including pipe-line for better asset management.Jharkhand: In 2021-22, the State has provided tap water connections to only 2.20 lakh households. The State needs to expedite pace of implementation especially in Aspirational districts. It was also observed that due to frequent power cuts, a few water treatment plants were not running to their full capacity. The State needs to immediately upgrade/ modernize the sub-division/ block level laboratories with adequate equipment, glassware, space, etc. as prescribed. Moreover, given the huge Iron contamination across the State, the NABL accreditation needs to be expedited. IEC activities such as signboards for dissemination of information about the schemes, wall paintings, slogans, etc., were not seen, which needs immediate attention.(d) 	The details of fund allocated, fund drawn and fund utilized by these States under Jal Jeevan Mission is annexed.(e) & (f) 	All three States viz. Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Jharkhand have planned to make provision of tap water supply to all rural households by 2024.
