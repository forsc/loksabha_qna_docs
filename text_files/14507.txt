ANSWER




                                                         ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):      Yes. Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has informed that it is reported by World Health Organisation (WHO) that increased intake of Trans-Fatty Acids (TFA) (>1% of total energy intake) is associated with increased risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) events and mortality. Globally, more than 5,00,000 deaths in 2010 were attributed to increased intake of TFA .   (b) & (c):      FSSAI has taken steps to create awareness about the adverse health effects of trans fats through regulations and multi-media campaign. Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labelling) Regulations, 2011 specify that every package of edible oil, edible fats, interesterified vegetable fat, hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated oils, margarine and fat spreads and package of food in which fats, oils and fat emulsions is used as an ingredient shall declare the quantity of trans fat content and saturated fat contents on the label.Food Safety and Standards (Advertising and Claims) Regulations, 2018 specify that ‘trans-fat free’ claim can be made by Food Business Operators, in case where the trans-fat is less than 0.2 grams per 100 g or 100 ml of food. According to instructions issued by FSSAI on 22nd July, 2019, the food establishments meeting this requirement can voluntarily display ‘trans-fat free’ logo in their outlets and on their food products. A 30 second audio-visual public service announcement ‘Heart Attack Rewind’ in English, Hindi and 15 regional languages was played for 4 weeks on radio, various social/digital media platforms  and  through publicity on bill boards  to create awareness on trans fat and its adverse health effects thereby  reducing  the acceptability of artificial trans fat in foods. Social/digital media campaign has reached a large number of people.     Information is also   available on FSSAI website i.e. www.fssai.gov.in and more than 100 thousand views visited the page. During Swasth Bharat Yatra, a Pan-India cyclothon held during October, 2018-January, 2019 with aim to engage citizens on issues of food safety, combating food adulteration and promoting healthy diets. Message on trans-fat was also conveyed throughout the Yatra. ‘Heart Attack rewind’ was also played  in regional languages. The message of Yatra reached over 25 million people. The stakeholders across the country including consumers are being made aware & educated about the various aspects of food safety & hygiene including trans-fat, food labelling, nutritional information and other food safety related issues through various communication platforms, print, outdoor, digital & social media, videos, flyers, brochures and booklets, stalls at fairs/melas/events and mass awareness campaigns etc.   There is no specific budget earmarked and allocated exclusively for trans-fat awareness. However, awareness on trans-fat is one of the key messages included in various awareness campaigns to promote food safety and hygiene and healthy diets.………………
