                                                        THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a)	No, Sir.(b)	National Film Development Corporation (NFDC)  has undertaken the following schemes with support from the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting:(i)	Production of films in various Indian languagesIn 2016, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India entered into an Agreement with National Film Development Corporation (NFDC) to enable the execution of the Scheme ‘Production of films in various Indian languages’. This activity is carried out by the NFDC   under the Scheme of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, titled ‘Development, Communication and Dissemination of Filmic Content’, wherein NFDC produces and co-produces films in various Indian languages that reflect the Cinemas of India. NFDC encourages debutant filmmakers by undertaking 100% production of their first feature film, while simultaneously co-producing good quality films in partnership with private players both from India and abroad.(ii)	Film Facilitation Office – Easing filming in India The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (I&B) under the Government''s policy of "Ease of doing Business" set up the Film Facilitation Office (FFO) in the National Film Development Corporation (NFDC) in December 2015, for international filmmakers, who wish to shoot their Feature Films, TV/Web shows and series & Reality TV/Web shows and series in India. The FFO’s “Film in India” mandate thus promotes India as a filming destination. With the launch of its web portal www.ffo.gov.in in November 2018, the FFO established an online single window facilitation and clearance mechanism that eases the process of filming/shooting in India, for filmmakers from abroad. Once the Ministry of I&B  approves a project proposal, Indian Missions abroad grant Film Visa  to the project team. The FFO web portal has started accepting online applications from Indian filmmakers also, who wish to film in various locations situated in different States of India.    (c)	Yes, Sir. NFDC has co-produced the film “Beyond the Known World”, directed by Shri Pan Nalin, which is the first feature film to be recognized under the Agreement on Audio-Visual Co-production between the Governments of India and New Zealand. NFDC has also commissioned the following feature films in 2018-19 and 2019-20. •	Production -   Korangi Nunchi (Telugu) and Chaad (Bengali), which are directed by first-time feature filmmakers.•	 Co-production - Laal Maati (Marathi), Lonak (Hindi), Joseph Ki Macha (Manipuri), Pedh Pe Kamra (Dogra), Ek Laal Kameez (Chhattisgarhi).During the visit of the Hon’ble Prime Minister of Bangladesh to India in April, 2017, Hon’ble Prime Minister of India announced that both countries have agreed to jointly produce a feature film on the life and works of Bangabandhu, Sheikh Mujibur Rehman.
