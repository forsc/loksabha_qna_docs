Guidelines with regard to slaughter houses have been prescribed by FSSAI under Regulation 2.1.2 (1) (5), Schedule IV; Part IV of Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration) Regulations, 2011. The guidelines cover slaughter-houses and slaughtering of animals which includes specific hygienic and sanitary practices to be followed by Food Business Operators engaged in manufacture, processing, storing and selling of Meat and Meat Products, pre & post handling of animals and precautions for animal welfare. In addition, State/UT Governments have also their own guidelines for slaughter-houses and slaughtering of animals. FSSAI has recently launched the “Clean and Safe Meat Campaign” wherein States/UTs have been encouraged to conduct food safety audit of their municipal slaughter houses using FSSAI recognized third party audit agencies.The implementation and enforcement of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and Rules and Regulations framed thereunder primarily rests with the State/ UT Governments. Regular surveillance, monitoring and inspection is undertaken by State/UT Governments under FSS Act, 2006 to check compliance of the provisions laid down under Regulation 2.5 relating to meat and meat products of Food Safety and Standards (Food Product Standards and Food Additives) Regulations, 2011 along with Schedule-4 of Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration) Regulations, 2011.(c) The Government of India has been ever vigilant and restrict in its effort to implement the provision of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 and its Rules made there under. In particular, to Slaughter House Rules Government of India only allows registered slaughter houses to conduct the slaughter and violator of any such Act and Rules is accordingly punishable. As per the direction of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in its order dated 17.02.2017 in respect of W.P (Civil) No.330 of 2001 in the matter of Common Cause Vs Union of India & others, stated that a compendium prepared by the Government of India was forwarded to all Chief Secretary of all States/UTs for compliance.  The compendium also includes the Slaughter House Rules, 2001 framed under Prevention of Cruelty to Animal Act, 1960. Hence, it is the responsibility of the State Governments /UTs to take action against the illegal slaughter houses and to see that the animals are not subjected to unnecessary pain or suffering.
