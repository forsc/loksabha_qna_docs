ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (c) : 	The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) had assessed the State wise and month wise overall demand and supply as per the information received from the States and published the Load Generation Balance Report (LGBR) for the financial years 2019-20 and 2020-21, which includes the months of March 2020 to September 2020. Government of India or any of its organisations do not bifurcate the demand into rural and urban areas.(d) : 		The requirement for power depends upon many factors including weather and the extent of economic activity. Migration also has an impact on the consumption pattern of electricity. (e) to (g) : 	The details of month wise demand and supply of electricity in terms of peak power and energy are furnished at annexure. The peak demand and the energy requirement had dropped by around 23-24% in the month of April 2020 w.r.t. April 2019 due to the effect of the covid pandemic. The peak demand and the energy requirement are increasing on a month to month basis since May 2020. There is a marginal increase in peak demand and energy requirement in the current month of September 2020 (up to 14th September 2020) vis a vis the corresponding period last year. *************
