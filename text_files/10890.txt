Moreover, as per the Government policy, more trees are planted than number of trees approved for removal.This policy has contributed significantly towards increase in forest and tree cover in the country.Government’s efforts to plant more trees than removed has also been reflected in the assessments in biennial India State of Forest Reports (ISFR) by Forest Survey of India.As per the biennial edition of ISFR of 2017, the forest and tree cover has increased by 8021 square km as compared to that of ISFR 2015 assessment.Government of India,as per the provisions under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, accords prior permissionfor change in land use from forest to non-forest. Such permissions are accorded subject to recommendation of the concerned State/UT Government and for unavoidable developmental projects/purposes. While according such permissions, it is ensured that minimum number of trees are removed which are inevitable. Following measures are taken to ensure removal of minimum number of trees and to check deforestation:i)	The trees are removed only when it is absolutely necessary.ii)	Wherever possible, trees marked for removal are translocated.iii)	 All such removal and translocation of trees are taken-up under the strict supervision of the concerned State Forest Department.iv)	To check illicit felling, the matter is monitoredand controlled by well-organized Forest Department in every State/UT.
