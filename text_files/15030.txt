ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING:(SHRI PRATAP CHANDRA SARANGI)(a) & (b) Government of India envisages bringing out a National Fisheries Policy for holistic development of the fisheries sector. The proposed policy would incorporate the provisions of the existing National Policy on Marine Fisheries, 2017 and will provide for policy provisions for the sub-sectors of inland fisheries, aquaculture, mariculture including elements of post-harvest. Given the cross-cutting nature of various fisheries sub-sectors, it is considered that an integrated National Fisheries Policy would better serve the public interest rather than individual sub-sector wise policies. Allocation of funds is usually made under the schemes and programmes implemented by the Government in line with the Policy directives. The Government has allocated Rs.560 crore for continuation of ‘Blue Revolution Scheme’ during financial year 2020-21 for undertaking various ongoing fisheries development programmes including marine fishery, aquaculture and mariculture. Besides, the Government has created the Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) during 2018-19 with a fund size of Rs. 7,522.48 crores spreading over a period of five years. Further the Government, in its Union Budget 2019-20 has announced a new scheme the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) which envisages a total investment of about Rs 20,050 crores which includes central, state and beneficiary shares over a period of five years w.e.f. 2020-21. ******
