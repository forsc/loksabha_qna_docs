ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS[GEN. (Dr) V. K. SINGH (RETD.)](a) to (c) It was brought to the notice of this Ministry that in some States, vehicle owners are facing problem for registration in spite of vehicles having valid Type Approval Certificates issued by a Testing Agency prescribed under the Central Motor Vehicles Rules 1989 and the vehicle is subjected to physical inspection by State Transport Authority before an advisory is issued for their registration in the State. Ministry has issued advisories to all States/UT’s dated 4th May, 2017 and further on 10th February, 2020 intimating that the VAHAN system provides a mechanism for the inventory of vehicles being uploaded by the vehicle manufacturers against valid type approval certificates and that unless there are reasons for disputing the specifications supplied, the pre-inspection of a model of vehicle already type approved should not be resorted to as it leads to unnecessary delay and harassment and further requesting to implement the system of registration of vehicles based on production of Type Approval Certificate and FORM 22.*****
