ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a)to b): The trade data of India’s exports to and imports from China from FY 2014-15 to FY 2021-22 is as under:(Values in USD Billion) 2014-15	2015-16	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21	2021-22 (Apr-Sept)Import	60.41	61.71	61.28	76.38	70.32	65.26	65.21	42.33Export	11.96	9.01	10.17	13.33	16.75	16.61	21.19	12.26Total trade	72.37	70.72	71.45	89.71	87.07	81.87	86.4	54.59Trade deficit	48.45	52.7	51.11	63.05	53.57	48.65	44.02	30.07(Source: DGCIS)(c) to d): The imports from China have   increased from USD 60.41 billion in 2014-15 to USD 65.21 billion in 2020-21, exhibiting an increase of 7.94% over 6 years. However, the imports were static between 2019-20 & 2020-21. The major items of import from China are products such as telecom instruments, computer hardware and peripherals, fertilizers, electronic components/ instruments, project goods, organic chemicals, drug intermediates, consumer electronics, electrical machinery etc. Many of these imported items are used for meeting the demand of fast expanding sectors like telecom and power in India. Some of our imports from China like the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and drug formulations provide the Indian pharma industry raw material for producing finished goods which are also exported out of India. The details of India’s imports from China, principal commodity wise and value wise during the last seven years and the current year is given in Annexure-I.(e) to (f): The exports from India to China have increased from USD 11.96 billion in 2014-15 to USD 21.19 billion in 2020-21, exhibiting an increase of 77.17% in 6 years. (g) The Government of India has made sustained efforts to achieve a more balanced trade with China, including bilateral engagements to address the non-tariff barriers on Indian exports to China. The Government has also launched schemes such as Production Linked Incentive Schemes (PLIs) to promote domestic manufacturing capacities in critical sectors such as Key Starting Materials/Drug Intermediates, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients apart from electronic components & mobiles, white goods (ACs and LEDs), Specialty Steel, Drones and Drone Components etc. These schemes will promote domestic manufacturing capacities and attract investment and reduce dependency on imports from China. **** Annexure-IThe details of India’s imports of major commodity groups from China from FY 2014-15 to FY 2020-21 and 2021-22 (till September 2021) is as follows:SL NO	MAJOR COMMODITY GROUPS	IMPORT FROM CHINA IN MILLION USD		2014-15	2015-16	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21	2020-21 (APR-SEP)	2021-22(APR-SEP)1	COTTON RAW AND WASTE	0.01	0.01	0.05	0.10	0.37	8.07	0.02	0.00	0.002	VEGETABLE OIL	0.25	0.40	0.37	0.63	0.46	0.56	0.22	0.07	0.203	PULSES	72.34	61.44	64.81	58.11	47.86	51.58	46.36	24.92	18.134	FRUITS AND VEGETABLES	89.48	74.31	176.95	85.13	33.27	48.41	36.69	13.21	15.935	PULP AND WASTE PAPER	16.42	14.98	19.65	17.95	21.00	24.34	20.84	10.74	14.006	TEXTILE YARN FABRIC, MADEUP ARTICLES	849.27	869.65	745.28	992.62	923.52	895.03	700.60	228.92	406.017	FERTILISERS, CRUDE AND MANUFACTURED	3154.73	3268.09	1250.68	1072.58	2053.29	1820.93	1551.23	704.83	1735.008	SULPHUR AND UNROASTED IRON PYRTS	0.11	0.13	0.10	0.24	0.27	0.21	0.13	0.05	0.069	METALIFERROUS ORES AND OTHER MINERALS	263.55	213.28	243.13	272.96	476.15	261.54	238.42	93.36	169.9810	COAL, COKE AND BRIQUETTES, ETC.	423.63	364.40	402.79	642.52	698.89	160.32	20.71	9.63	180.5511	PETROLEUM, CRUDE AND PRODUCTS	315.82	306.34	213.11	313.84	302.27	340.44	183.63	94.44	212.9712	WOOD AND  WOOD PRODUCTS	680.31	637.41	697.74	932.58	803.99	784.43	525.75	209.13	316.1213	LEATHER AND LEATHER PRODUCTS	211.94	223.47	224.32	265.67	256.90	236.49	114.30	37.57	72.3814	ORGANIC AND INORGANIC CHEMICALS	4079.65	3752.95	3562.40	4750.20	5781.19	5197.64	5693.70	2733.36	4040.7715	DYEING/TANNING/COLOURING MTRLS.	631.54	554.58	560.10	751.13	759.89	779.54	775.01	301.96	496.0116	ARTIFICIAL RESINS, PLASTIC MATERIALS, ETC.	2085.81	2080.03	2270.30	2945.48	3227.06	3165.79	2741.78	970.36	2133.0317	CHEMICAL MATERIAL AND PRODUCTS	1609.39	1477.09	1658.57	2230.65	2592.04	2467.49	2721.34	1305.61	1716.1118	NEWSPRINT	26.19	0.15	0.00	0.01	 	0.00	0.01	 	 19	PEARLS, PRECIOUS AND SEMI-PRECIOUS STONES	31.19	45.11	45.76	107.61	64.11	61.24	45.20	11.97	31.4520	IRON AND STEEL	4101.53	3541.11	2576.56	3090.72	3153.45	2706.35	2208.84	976.34	1356.1021	NON-FERROUS METALS	1606.37	1352.35	1363.75	1657.52	2131.10	1855.26	1460.08	548.76	903.8522	MACHINE TOOLS	645.33	645.45	727.52	1014.96	1142.81	1026.74	1109.88	388.19	711.7323	MACHINERY, ELECTRICAL AND NON-ELECTRICAL	7390.79	8045.51	8395.95	10354.11	11135.68	10865.44	10220.49	3889.29	5839.4124	TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT	3029.43	3173.47	3653.34	3758.57	2721.66	2470.58	2374.43	886.13	1384.8625	PROJECT GOODS	1449.33	994.11	763.00	609.54	553.28	438.28	347.92	178.94	101.5926	PROFESSIONAL INSTRUMENT, OPTICAL GOODS, ETC.	469.13	477.83	525.70	807.30	815.93	758.15	930.46	421.25	955.8927	ELECTRONIC GOODS	19727.01	22678.65	24731.24	31975.18	22737.47	21374.09	23936.27	10144.80	15291.8728	MEDCNL.
