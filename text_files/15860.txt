ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT (SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)  (a) to (d) : A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. ***  Statement referred to in reply to parts (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 405  to be answered on 23.03.2020 regarding “Fee structure in Higher Education” asked by Shri Janardan Mishra and Shri Rodmal Nagar,         Hon’ble MPs.  (a) and (b):  Government is not working on any scheme related to change in fees of higher educational institutions. It is to be known that every educational institution is an autonomous institution. Therefore, various educational institutions take decisions through their regulatory units such as Finance Committee, Board of Governance, Executive Council etc.   (c): For technical institutions, in the light of the Supreme Court order, AICTE had constituted a committee under the chairmanship of retired Supreme Court Judge B.N. Sri Krishna to fix the upper limit of fees in technical institutions. In December 2015, AICTE accepted the report of this committee and after consulting the Ministry of Education of the States, implemented it. Under this, the upper limit of fees for various technical courses has been prescribed. Besides this, in every State a "State Fee Regulation Committee" has been constituted. It is clearly mentioned in the handbook of AICTE that the technical institutes of the States can charge the fees only on the basis of the Fee Regulation Committee of the State.  (d): The fee structure of Jawaharlal Nehru University and the fee structure of other universities are determined according to the nature of the course.  ****
