                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a) Out of the mandated 300 clusters to be developed under Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM), 296 clusters have been identified and approved across 28 States and 7 Union Territories. 289 Integrated Cluster Action Plans(ICAPs), which are investment plans for each clusters, have been approved. Further, Detailed Project Reports of 272 clusters have been approved by respective State Level Empowered Committee (SLEC). The summary of investment approved and expenditure till 14.09.2020 is as tabulated below:Total Investments approved in the 289 ICAPs 	     Total Expenditure till 14.09.2020 date (in Rs. Cr.)                                             (in Rs. Cr.)Convergence	*CGF	        Total	              Convergence	*CGF	Total21,031.48	6,903.50	27,934.99	      7,828.95	     1,518.88	9,347.83 * Critical Gap Funds (b)  SPMRM is not an individual beneficiary focused programme rather it provides for holistic development of the entire area by providing, social, digital and economic infrastructure and amenities are taken up which may lead to direct / indirect benefit to the communities and cluster''s population. (c)  SPMRM clusters focus on  interventions which can be broadly categorized under basic, economic, social and digital amenities. The interventions depend on locally felt needs, as identified through stakeholder consultations including Gram Sabha. Strengthening economic activities is one of the key priorities in cluster development. This is being achieved through investments in skill development  linked to economic activities, employment generation through  promotion of Self Help Groups (SHGs) and  agri- processing and tourism development etc.(d)  Selection of Rurban clusters is based on the predefined methodology, detailed in the Framework of Implementation, which factors in parameters such as (i) Decadal Growth in Rural Population (ii) Decadal Growth in Non-Farm work force participation (iii) Presence of Economic Clusters (iv) Presence of places of Tourism and Pilgrimage significance and (v) Proximity to Transport Corridors, (vi) Decadal growth in Tribal Population (vii) Current Tribal Literacy Rate. The clusters are selected and approved by States/ UTs and sent to Ministry for final approval.Development of ‘Rurban Clusters’ involves identification and formulation of desired interventions based on local needs identified during stakeholder consultations including Gram Sabha, finalization of projects by the District Level Committees which has officers of concerned line departments, Block Development Officer, Sarpanches and representatives of the concerned Panchayati Raj Institutions.The District Collector / Chief Executive Officer, Zila Parishad chairs the Committee.The State Level Empowered Committee(SLEC) headed by the Chief Secretary of the State/UT then recommends the ICAP of the cluster to the Ministry. Thus, peoples'' participation is ensured through involvement of public representatives  in the process of selection of proposed interventions in a Rurban cluster. (e)  At least 70 percent of the total funds for cluster development is envisaged through convergence of various Central Sector, Centrally Sponsored and State Schemes. The Mission provides for additional Critical Gap Funds(CGF) of up to 30% of the project cost or Rs. 30 crore, whichever is less for non-tribal clusters and up to 30% of the project cost or Rs. 15 crore, whichever is less for tribal and hilly clusters. There is no overlap of funds. ***
