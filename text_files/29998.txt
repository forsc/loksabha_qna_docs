                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS  (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	Yes Sir. The state-wise list of ATL schools funded as on November, 2021 is placed as Annexure-A. (b)	Yes Sir.(c)	The Government of India is encouraging the schools to provide exposure of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education to students so that they can be exposed with futuristic technology platforms. The Government has set up the Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) at NITI Aayog with the objective to foster curiosity and innovation among young minds. AIM is establishing Atal Tinkering Labs across the country for students between grade 6th to 12th, equipped with latest emerging technologies such as electronics, IoT (Internet of Things), 3D printing, Robotics, etc. AIM is collaborating with relevant stakeholders and has created relevant learning modules around the above topics, which can be leveraged by the existing school ecosystem.The target is to establish 10,000 ATLs across India. The current update as on date are as follows:•	To date, 9,300+ schools have received the ATL sanction and grant-in-aid.•	More than 60% schools are Government (State, Central, Tribal, etc) and/or Government Aided schools.•	Currently, the percentage of district coverage of ATLs is more than 90%.•	ATLs are also open to students from other schools and children from nearby communities.Further, as per the self-reported data by the schools, following key results have been achieved:•	More than 70,00,000 students are or have been actively engaged in ATL activities, enhancing their STEM skills. •	More than 3,00,000 community children are or have been actively engaged in ATL activities, and are introduced to Tinkering and Innovation. •	More than 1,80,000 projects are created by students from the ATL community.(d)	Schools and their competent authorities are authorized to ensure that the ATL is accessible and open to all students. AIM engages and monitors the schools through online dashboard and review schools based on the ATL guidelines. AIM is in constant communication with the schools to observe adequate activities and workshops are carried out, troubleshoot issues, keep ATL operational, to ensure best experience for the students of the country. Whenever AIM observes any lacunae in procedural formalities, AIM supports the schools to update all mandatory information to be uploaded on ATL Dashboard with relevant documents, and course correct their procurement and administrative processes with a remedial action and update AIM at the earliest. The state-wise list of ATL schools funded as on November, 2021 is placed as Annexure A. (e)	The procurement of ATL equipment is enabled via Government E-Marketplace (GeM). GeM has been implemented to create a transparent mechanism for procurement and fund utilization. As per the ATL guidelines, there is no explicit provision for five-year maintenance by tenderer. Schools are independent and responsible to identify the most suitable tenderer through the GeM portal with the goal to ensure smooth delivery of ATL activities and for maintenance of ATL Equipment. AIM provides subsequent tranche/s to the school over a period of four years to ensure smooth maintenance of ATL equipment. ***** Annexure-A State/UT wise summary of funded Atal Tinkering Labs in Schools as on November 2021.State / UT	Grand TotalANDAMAN AND NICOBAR ISLAND	10ANDHRA PRADESH	683ARUNACHAL PRADESH	31ASSAM	328BIHAR	93CHANDIGARH	22CHHATTISGARH	351DADRA AND NAGAR HAVELI	4DELHI	197GOA	19GUJARAT	585HARYANA	391HIMACHAL PRADESH	102JAMMU AND KASHMIR	81JHARKHAND	122KARNATAKA	713KERALA	361LADAKH	2MADHYA PRADESH	571MAHARASHTRA	973MANIPUR	114MEGHALAYA	13MIZORAM	25NAGALAND	24ODISHA	313PUDUCHERRY	18PUNJAB	221RAJASTHAN	487SIKKIM	27TAMIL NADU	918TELANGANA	341TRIPURA	20UTTAR PRADESH	909UTTARAKHAND	78WEST BENGAL	209Grand Total	9356
