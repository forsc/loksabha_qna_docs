ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a)  It is for the State Governments concerned to undertake enumeration, protection and management of water bodies in their respective States. However, this Ministry undertakes census of minor irrigation schemes from time to time, which also captures information pertaining to certain specific water bodies in the country. As per the latest census, being 5th census of minor irrigation schemes with reference year 2013-14, there are 5,16,303 water bodies in the rural areas of the country, which are being used for minor irrigation. Out of these, 53,396 water bodies are not in use for various reasons such as non-availability of water, siltation, salinity, etc. (b)  Works related to water resources development & management are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priorities. Role of Government of India is limited to providing technical support, and partial financial support in some cases, as per the norms of the existing schemes being implemented by Government of India.  Contd…P/2//2//Central assistance for restoration of water bodies is provided by this Ministry under the scheme “Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies”, which is a component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana – Har Khet Ko Pani (PMKSY- HKKP). The scheme aims at restoring the lost irrigation potential by improvement and restoration of existing water bodies. Under the RRR of Water Bodies scheme, XII Plan onwards a total of 2,228 water bodies with an estimated cost of Rs.1,914.86 crore, have been taken up for restoration in various States. Upto March, 2021, central assistance of Rs.469.69 crore has been released to the States under the scheme, and in this period RRR of 1,549 water bodies has been completed.State-wise details of central assistance released, and water bodies restored under the scheme since XII Plan onward, are tabulated below:S. No. 	State	Central assistance released till March, 2021(Rs. In crore)	Water Bodies completed till March, 2021	  1	Andhra Pradesh	2.70	0	 2	Bihar 	18.08	6	 3	Gujarat	8.81	3	 4	Madhya Pradesh	37.70	124	 5	Manipur	34.63	0	 6	Meghalaya	5.18	8	 7	Odisha	145.18	810	 8	Rajasthan	62.18	66	 9	Tamil Nadu	34.25	153	 10	Telangana	104.56	371	 11	Uttar Pradesh 	16.41	8	  	Total 	469.69	1549	 (c)  Increased ground water recharge is one of the key objectives of Repair, Renovation and Restoration of Water bodies scheme.(d) & (e)  The mandate for enumeration, protection and management of water bodies is with the State Governments concerned. However, this Ministry has impressed upon the States to take necessary steps for keeping all the water bodies encroachment free,  inclusion of water bodies in land records, incorporating water bodies as integral part of town planning process, and to take strict action against the encroachment, etc. Further, water bodies are included under RRR of Water Bodies scheme only after concerned State Government certifies that the water bodies concerned are free from encroachment.Also, Central Pollution Control Board under Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, has in 2019 issued “Indicative Guidelines for Restoration of Water Bodies”, which also address removal of encroachments and blockades. The guidelines further recommend that the State Government or UT Administration may maintain records pertaining to the boundaries of each pond or lake in the respective State/UT, and may also ensure  that the water body spread area/ water body boundary remains encroachment-free.*****
