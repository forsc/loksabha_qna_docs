ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a): Pollution abatement of rivers is a continuous and ongoing process. It is the responsibility of the State Government / concerned local bodies to set up the facilities for collection, transportation and treatment of sewage for abatement of pollution of rivers. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) has been supplementing the efforts of the State Governments in abatement of pollution of identified stretches of various rivers through the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) being implemented through National River Conservation Directorate (NRCD), for implementation of projects on cost sharing basis between the Central and State Governments. NRCP (excluding Ganga and its tributaries, which are handled by the Ministry of Jal Shakti) has so far covered polluted stretches of 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the Country at a sanctioned cost of Rs. 5870.54 crore, and Central Share of Rs. 2378.73 crore has been released to the State Government for implementation of various pollution abatement schemes. Sewage treatment capacity of 2522.03 million litres per day (mld) has been created so far under the NRCP resulting in reduction in pollution load being discharged into the rivers.  (b):A Project for pollution abatement of river Devika and Tawi at Udhampur in Jammu and Kashmir, at a cost of Rs. 186.74 crore, has been sanctioned under NRCP on cost sharing basis between Government of India and State Government. The Government of India share in the project is Rs. 168.66 crore and State Government share is Rs. 18.08 crore. The major components sanctioned under the project are construction of three sewage treatment plants (STPs) having total sewage treatment capacity of 13.6 mld, laying of sewer lines, construction of sewage pumping stations, construction of improved wood crematoria and river front development. An amount of Rs. 30.00 crore has also been released by the Government of India as its share for the project.  (c) & (d):Proposals for pollution abatement of rivers are submitted by the State Governments from time to time, which are examined and considered for financial assistance under NRCP depending on the pollution status of the river, State Government’s commitment to bear matching share, conformity of projects formulated as per the Ministry’s guidelines and availability of funds under the programme. No proposal has been received from the State Government for pollution abatement of river Jhelum in Jammu and Kashmir under NRCP. *****
