The recommendations of the Law Commission are under consideration of the Government. (d) and (e):The Election Commission of India has informed that the EVMs used by them are non-tamperable both due to the technological measures, and also due to strict administrative and security procedures laid down in this regard. The machine used by the Commission is a stand-alone, non-networked and one time programmable one, which is neither computer controlled, nor connected to the internet or any network and hence cannot be hacked. The machine is electronically protected to prevent any tampering/manipulation. The programme used in these machines is burnt into a one-time programmable/masked chip so that it cannot be altered or tampered with.
