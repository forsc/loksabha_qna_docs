                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b) Rural roads under PMGSY are constructed and maintained as per the technical specifications and geometric design standards given in the Ministry of Rural Development Specifications for Rural Roads, Rural Roads Manual of the Indian Roads Congress (IRC) (IRC-SP:20) and also, where required, the Hill Road Manual (IRC:SP:48) and other relevant IRC Codes & Manuals. The works under the scheme are sanctioned by the Ministry based on the Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) submitted by the respective State Governments. The sanctioned works are executed by the State Governments. The following is the details regarding eligibility of roads to be sanctioned under different verticals of PMGSY . PMGSY-I which envisages all-weather road connectivity to eligible unconnected habitations of designated population size as per Census 2001, roads connecting the targeted habitations were taken up for sanction under the new connectivity component. Under up-gradation component, intermediate link roads, which were not upto the standards of all-weather roads, were taken up for upgradation to the prescribed standards.Under PMGSY-II, which envisages upgradation of the existing rural road network to improve its overall efficiency as a provider of transportation services for people, goods and services, the selection of roads in a particular district/block has been done by the States/UTs based on the utility value of the eligible roads computed on the basis of their economic potential and their role in facilitating the growth of rural market centres and rural hubs.All the works have been sanctioned under PMGSY-I and II.Under PMGSY-III, which envisages consolidation of existing Through routes and major rural links connecting habitations, inter-alia, to Gramin Agricultural Markets, Higher Secondary Schools and Hospitals, the selection of roads in a particular district/block is done by the States/UTs based on the utility value of the eligible roads computed on the basis of the population served by the road and market, educational, medical and transport infrastructure facilities connected by the concerned road.Road Connectivity Project for Left Wing Extremism Affected Area(RCPLWEA) : roads under RCPLWEA are sanctioned on the recommendations of Ministry of Home Affairs whose recommendations are based on consultation with the respective state governments.(c) & (d)         Yes Sir, the Ministry has received representations regarding inclusion of some important roads under PMGSY-III and providing connectivity to left out habitations.(e)        In order to ensure that roads sanctioned under PMGSY are village friendly, the scheme  has inbuilt mechanism for consultation with public representatives at planning, selection of roads and monitoring stages.  As per the programme guidelines of the current phase, i.e., PMGSY-III, the proposals received from the Members of Parliament with regard to selection of roads are given full consideration and such proposals that cannot be included are communicated in writing to the Members of Parliament with reasons for non-inclusion of such proposal in each case. In order to ensure that the State Government give due attention towards provisions of the programme guidelines while submitting the proposals to the Ministry of Rural Development for sanction, the Ministry has issued an advisory to the States on 2nd June, 2020. The State Governments have been advised, inter-alia, to communicate the final list of proposals in the order of priority to the Member of Parliament with the reasons for non-inclusion of certain roads in the proposals and obtain their consent on the proposals sent for approval. Apart from the Member of Parliament, other public representatives are also involved in the process of selection, planning and inspection of roads under PMGSY-III.Besides, following provisions have been made in the programme guidelines to make the roads village friendly:-•	Where the road passes through a habitation, the road in the built-up area and for 50 m on either side is appropriately designed preferably as a cement concrete road or with paved stones, besides being provided with side drains. Appropriate side drains, cross drainage and protection works are provided so that improper drainage does not damage the road or the dwellings along side.•	Locally available materials are also used in construction of roads, subject to adherence to technical norms and relevant code of practices.•	Road Safety Audit is mandatory requirement while preparing the DPR for PMGSY-III and it is to be audited by a certified road safety auditor.  An independent safety audit during design stage of the roads exceeding a length of 5 km as a part of the DPR is required.  *******
