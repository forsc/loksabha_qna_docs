                                                        (a) & (b) A National Perspective Plan (NPP) for the comprehensive development of India’s coastline and maritime sector has been prepared Programme in April 2016 under the Sagarmala.As a part of the NPP, a roadmap is developed for increasing Indian port capacity to 3300+ MTPA by 2025. Master Planning of 12 Major Ports has been carried out and 95 capacity expansion and port modernization projects have been identified. Major ports capacity has been re-rated with respect to global benchmarks as per berthing policy 2016 and effective capacity has increased by 293 MTPA after re-rating. Global benchmarks have been adopted to improve the efficiency and productivity for major ports and 116 initiatives have been identified to unlock 100 MTPA of capacity at major ports.Under Sagarmala Programme, 236 projects have been identified for enhancing the infrastructure at ports and are expected to mobilize around Rs. 1,17,600 Cr of infrastructure investment. These projects would be implemented by major ports, state maritime boards, private agencies etc.           Under coastal community development component of Sagarmala Programme, Ministry of Shipping is funding construction of fishing harbours/fish landing centres in Maritimes States and UTs in convergence mode of implementation with Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Department of Fisheries.  16 projects have been funded by Ministry of Shipping under this scheme.(c) to (e) Sagarmala projects are being implemented by various stakeholders viz. Major Ports, Central line Ministries/ Agencies, Maritime States/UTs, State Maritime Boards, Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) etc,. For execution of sagarmala projects, Major Ports do not face land acquisition issue generally as the land are usually owned by them. Fishing Harbours/ Fish Landing Centres are implemented by State Maritime Boards/Coastal State Governments/UTs etc.. These projects are considered for funding after confirmation of land availability for the project by respective implementing agencies and State Governments.                                               ********
