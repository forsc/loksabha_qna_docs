                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) to (c): The matter regarding creation of a Judicial Service Commission to help the recruitment to the post of district judges and review of selection process of judges / judicial officers at all levels was included in the agenda for the Chief Justices Conference, which was held on 3rd and 4th April, 2015. It was resolved to leave it open to the respective High Courts to evolve appropriate methods within the existing system to fill up the vacancies for appointment of District judges expeditiously.Further, views of States and High Courts were sought on a comprehensive proposal formulated for constitution of All India Judicial Service (AIJS) which was approved by the Committee of Secretaries. While two High Courts have concurred with the proposal approved by Committee of Secretaries for formation of AIJS, twelve High Courts have not favoured the proposal of formation of AIJS. Six High Courts have suggested changes in age at induction level, qualifications, training and quota of vacancies to be filled through AIJS. Most High Courts want administrative control over Subordinate Judiciary to remain with the respective High Courts.  While two State Governments have supported creation of AIJS, seven State Governments have not favoured the formation of AIJS. Five State Governments have requested for some changes in the proposal.The comprehensive proposal formulated for constitution of AIJS which was approved by the Committee of Secretaries along with views received from High Courts and States was included in the agenda for the Joint Conference of Chief Ministers and Chief Justices of High Courts held on 5th April, 2015. Keeping in view the divergence of opinion among the States and High Courts on constitution of AIJS, the Government has undertaken further consultation to arrive at a common ground.
