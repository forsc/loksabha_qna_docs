These FMC projects will lower the consumption of diesel resulting in reduction in carbon emission. In addition to existing FMC capacity of 151 MTPA, CIL has taken up new 35 FMC Projects of 414.5 MTPA scheduled to be commissioned by FY2023-24. Out of 35 FMC Projects, 5 Projects of 70 MTPA capacity has already been commissioned and 1 Project of 12 MTPA is under Trial run.(ii)	Use of low emission engines: For Diesel driven HEMM, CIL has introduced emission norm certified electronically controlled engines with reduced emission level.   (iii)	Energy Efficiency Measures: Efficient use of energy ultimately translates into reduction of carbon footprint. CIL has been taking various energy efficiency measures like use of LED lights, energy efficient ACs, Super Fans, Efficient Water Heaters, Auto timer switches in street lights, capacitor banks etc.(iv)	Creating Carbon sink through extensive plantation:  During last 3 years, CIL has planted more than 61 Lakh saplings covering 2,632 Ha of area in and around mine leasehold.(v)	Promoting renewables: CIL has installed 6.63 MW of solar power plants, of which 2 MW is ground mounted and 4.63 MW is rooftop installation.(b)	CIL has taken an initiative for techno - economic feasibility study for introduction of dual fuel (Diesel - LNG) operation in the existing dumpers through a pilot project. Based on the outcome of pilot project, strategy for adoption of LNG for dual fuel operation in dumpers will be finalized.
