ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V.

Wherever required, complaints are referred to Missions/Posts abroad for providing relief/rescue of emigrants in distress and for early redressal of grievance with employer/sponsor and/or local authorities. In India the complaints, with details of illegal agents and fake agencies, are forwarded to the concerned State/UT Government and Police authorities urging them to apprehend illegal agents and prosecute them as per law.

Visual and print media awareness campaign encouraging emigrants to utilize the services of the registered Recruitment Agents and not to go through illegal/fake agents are organized regularly.

The aspect of safe and legal migration is also included in various State Outreach Programmes conducted in States from time to time.       As per data available, the number of complaints against unregistered agents received and referred to the State Government/Police during the period to 2017-2021 is as under:-<pre>YearNo. of Complaints receivedCases referred to State Government for actionProsecution Sanction soughtProsecution Sanction issued2017446446303020183503501515201976976935352020166166070720211391390707</pre>(c) Upon hearing the information, Embassy of India, Mali (Bamako) pro-actively engaged with the said migrant workers and the employer.
