                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) The epidemic curve of any pandemic goes through an ascending, peaking and descending phase. The current phase of pandemic in India is on multiple trajectories across the urban and semi urban areas of the country. India has reported large outbreaks in certain districts indicating spread of infection in those districts. Only 10 States are currently contributing to 75% of active cases in the country, which suggests that COVID is still limited in spread                             (details at Annexure I). India has among the lowest cases and deaths per million population among similarly affected countries. This is further corroborated by the fact that the nationwide sero-prevalence for COVID-19 conducted in May, 2020 was found to be less than 1%. (b) Government of India has adopted containment strategy for containing the spread of    COVID-19 by suppressing/breaking the cycle of transmission in the country. The containment plans envisage a strategy of breaking the chain of transmission by (i) defining containment and buffer zones, (ii) applying strict perimeter control, (iii) intensive active house to house search for cases and contacts, (iv) isolation and testing of suspect cases and high risk contacts, (v) quarantine of high risk contacts, (vi) intensive risk communication to raise community awareness on simple preventive measures and need for prompt treatment seeking and (vii) strengthening of passive Influenza Like Illness (ILI)/ Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) surveillance in containment and buffer zones.(c) State/UT wise details of total cases and tests conducted is at Annexure II.(d) In all public health institutions under the jurisdiction of Ministry of Health & Family Welfare COVID-19 test such as RT-PCR, Truenat, CBNAAT and Rapid Antigen test are done free of cost. ICMR has also provided COVID-19 testing reagents to all the States and UTs free of cost. As health is a State subject, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has also written to all States/UTs to negotiate with private laboratories and fix up mutually agreeable prices for samples being sent by government and also for private individuals desirous of testing by these laboratories.
