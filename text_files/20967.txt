                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (d):	As per the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) carried out by the National Sample Survey Organisation of the Ministry of Statistics &   Programme Implementation,  in the year 2017-18, the total employment in both organized and unorganised sector in the country was around  47 crores. Out of this, around 9 crores are engaged in the organized sector and the balance of 38 crores are in the unorganized sector.Contd..2/-:: 2 ::           	The Government is mandated to provide Social Security to unorganised sector workers by formulating suitable welfare schemes on matters relating to (i) life and disability cover, (ii) health and maternity benefits, (iii) old age protection and (iv) any other benefit as may be determined by the Central Government. Life and disability coverage is provided through Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) at the annual premium of Rs. 342/- (Rs. 330/- for PMJJBY + Rs.12/- for PMSBY) through banks. The benefits under the schemes are Rs.4.0 lakh on death due to accident, Rs. 2.0 lakh on death due to any cause. Rs. 2.0 lakh on permanent disability and      Rs. 1.0 lakh on partial disability. The health and maternity benefits are addressed through Ayushman Bharat Scheme which is a universal health scheme.        		 In order to provide old age protection to unorganised sector workers, the Government of India has launched a flagship scheme namely Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Mandhan Yojana            (PM-SYM) in  March 2019, which is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme. The workers in the age group of 18-40 years whose monthly income is Rs.15000/-or less and not a member of EPFO/ESIC/NPS can join the scheme. Under the scheme, 50% monthly contribution is payable by the beneficiary and equal matching contribution is paid by the Central Government.  Under the scheme, beneficiaries are provided monthly minimum assured pension of       Rs.3000/- after attaining the age of 60 years.  Enrolment to the Scheme is done through the Common Service Centres, with its network of 3.50 lakh Centres across the country. In addition eligible persons can also self-enroll through visiting the portal.******
