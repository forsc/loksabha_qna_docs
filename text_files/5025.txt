MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (e) : National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 recommended Yoga as an integral part ofHealth and Physical Education. Health and Physical Education is a compulsory subject from Class I toClass X and optional from Class XI to XII. The National Council of Educational Research andTraining (NCERT) has already developed integrated syllabi on Health and Physical Education fromClass I to Class X. The content of Yoga has been included from Class VI onward. A separate syllabuson Yoga from Upper Primary to Secondary Stage has also been developed. The syllabus is available onNCERT website www.ncert.nic.in.Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has made Health and Physical Educationcompulsory in all classes from I-XII for its affiliated schools. It has been advised to schools that Healthand Physical Education includes three areas i.e. Health Education, Physical Education and Yoga and allthree areas are essential to achieve holistic health (physical, mental, intellectual, emotional, social andspiritual)..Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for SchoolEducation - Samagra Shiksha with effect from 1st April, 2018 which envisages school education as acontinuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable qualityeducation at all levels. Realizing the need for holistic development of children, under the SamagraShiksha, Sports and Physical Education component has been introduced for the first time forencouragement of Sports, Physical activities, Yoga, Co-curricular activities etc. A provision has beenmade for grants for sports equipments in all government schools at the rate of Rs. 5000 for PrimarySchools, Rs. 10,000 for upper primary schools and up to Rs. 25,000 for secondary and senior secondaryschools per annum. In the year 2018-19, an outlay of Rs. 506.90 crore was approved under sports grantfor 894307 government schools.Ministry has issued guidelines vide letter 24.12.2018 to States and UTs to ensure properutilization of sports grant.
