ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b): The Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) is implementing a number of rural development schemes for rural areas of the country including Karnal (which includes Panipat) and Kurukshetra Parliamentary Constituencies in Haryana by taking up multi-pronged strategies to address rural poverty and improve the economic well-being of the people in rural areas with the main focus on increasing livelihood opportunities, empowering rural women, providing social safety net, skilling of rural youth, infrastructure development etc through its programmes viz. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), Deen Dayal Upadhyay – Gramin Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), Shyama Prasad Mukherjee National RuRBAN Mission(SPMRM) and National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP). Most of these schemes have special provisions for women, socially and economically disadvantaged groups to facilitate their active participation and expansion of these schemes for the benefit of people in rural areas. (c) : There are no specific training programmes for the effective implementation of climate change adaptation programs by MoRD. However, under DAY-NRLM, regular training along with discussions in the meetings of SHGs and federations are being conducted particularly on change in the cropping pattern, water conservation, plantation etc to inculcate these practices and create awareness among the community across the country including Karnal (which includes Panipat) Parliamentary Constituency in Haryana.         As informed by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), the National Action Plan for Climate Change (NAPCC) is the overarching policy framework to mitigate and adapt to the adverse impact of climate change in the country. Subsequent to the NAPCC, State Governments were encouraged to prepare State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) in consistence with strategies in the NAPCC. Thirty-three States/UTs including Haryana have prepared their SAPCC with guidance from Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC). In order to support climate change adaptation actions in the country, MoEF&CC has established the National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC). NAFCC supports adaptation projects that are State driven and are based on needs and priorities identified under the State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) and the relevant Missions under the NAPCC. Till date, 30 adaptation projects are sanctioned in 27 States and UTs under NAFCC. ******
