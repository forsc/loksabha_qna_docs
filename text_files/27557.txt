                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARTI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a)	As per the latest National Health Account Estimates, per capita expenditure on health for the year 2016-17 is Rs. 4381. The per capita expenditure incurred by Government on health and per capita out of pocket expenditure (OOPE) by the households for the year 2016-17 is Rs. 1418 and Rs. 2570, respectively.(b)	Public Health & Hospital being a State subject, the primary responsibility to provide affordable healthcare services to the people lies with the State Government. However, the Central Govt. has taken several initiatives for supplementing the efforts of the States for providing quality and affordable healthcare services to the people. Some of the major initiatives include National Health Mission, Ayushman Bharat (AB)-Health & Wellness Centres (HWCs), Pradhan Mantri Jan ArogyaYojana (PMJAY), Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) and upgradation of medical colleges. 		Free Drugs Service Initiative and free Diagnostics Service Initiative are being implemented under National Health Mission for provision of essential medicines and diagnostics free of charge to beneficiaries. Under Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Programme, dialysis services are provided free to patients below the poverty line (BPL). Further, under Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadi Pariyojana (PMBJP) quality medicines at affordable price are provided to the masses through dedicated outlets called Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadi Kendra (PMBJK) across the country.(c) &(d) :  No such proposal is presently before the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. However, PMJAY provides health cover of Rs. 5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization to over 10.74 crores poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries).                                               ***
