                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a)	Licensed Service Area wise (LSA-wise) details of number of mobile towers is provided at Annexure-I. The present EMF emission norms as laid down for BTSs installed at various mobile towers in India are as follows:<pre>Frequency Range	E-Field Strength   (Volt/Meter)	H-Field Strength (Amp/Meter)	Power Density (Watt/Sq.Meter)400 MHz  to 2000 MHz	0.434 f ½	0.0011 f ½	f / 20002 GHz to 300 GHz	19.29	0.05	1</pre>	 (f is frequency in MHz) (b) 	The Licensed Service Area wise (LSA-wise) details of number of Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) found exceeding the prescribed EMF radiation limits on actual testing during each of the last three years and the current year is provided at Annexure-II. Telecom Service Provider (TSP) wise details of penalty imposed on BTSs found exceeding the prescribed EMF radiation limits on actual testing during each of the last three years and the current year is provided at Annexure-III.(c) 	On 20.11.2013, the penalty has been increased from Rs. 5 lakh per BTS to Rs 10 lakh per BTS per incidence in case of non-compliance to actual EMF norms. Further, on 29.03.2019, in case of a shared site, a penalty of Rs 20 lakh per BTS per incidence has been prescribed to be imposed on rogue BTS(s) (BTS whose exposure ratio/index is more than ‘1’) if the site becomes compliant removing contribution of that rogue BTS(s). However, if the site is not compliant even after removing the contribution of that rogue BTS (s), then a penalty in proportion to the exposure ratio (Rs. 20 lakh x Exposure Ratio) is prescribed to be imposed on all the remaining participating BTSs.(d)  	In addition to levy of financial penalty as mentioned above, if the BTS is not made compliant to the EMF radiation norms within 30 days by the erring TSP, the same is required to be shut down as per prescribed procedure.
