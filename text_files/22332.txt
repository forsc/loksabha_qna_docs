ANSWER




MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a)	: Theft/pilferage of coal is carried out stealthily and clandestinely. So, it is difficult to assess and specify the exact quantum of coal stolen and losses incurred on account of theft/pilferage. However, as per raids conducted by security personnel as well as joint raids with the law and order authorities of the State Government concerned, the quantity of coal recovered and its approximate value [Subsidiary-wise and State-wise] during  the last three years are as under :-(Provisional)Co.

However, the following steps have been taken to check Theft / pilferage of coal:•	RFID based Boom Barriers and CCTV cameras at weighbridges, GPRS based vehicle tracking system with geo-fencing and CCTV cameras installed at strategic locations in mines.•	Regular FIRs are lodged by the Colliery Management and CISF with local police. A close watch on the activities of criminals is being kept by CISF.•	Interaction and liaison with District officials at regular intervals and meetings with officials of the State Administration.•	Challans for coal transportation by trucks outside the district are being issued after fixing hologram and putting signatures of authorized officials of CISF to check pilferage.•	Armed Guards have been deployed at Railway sidings.•	Escorting of coal rakes in coordination with RPF upto weighbridge, is arranged in pilferage prone areas.•	Surprise re-weighment of coal loaded trucks is done at weighbridges.•	Surprise checks/raids are conducted by flying squads of CISF/security department.•	Regular patrolling is conducted in and around the mines including OB dumps.•	Joint patrolling with local police is also being carried out in pilferage prone areas.•	Check posts have been established at entry/exit points where all coal laden vehicles are physically checked.•	Security at coal dumps has been strengthened by fencing, proper illumination and round the clock guarding.      Besides, Ministry of Coal has launched Mobile App - Khanan Prahari and web App Coal Mines Surveillance & Management System (CMSMS) in July, 2018, for the purpose of detecting and taking action on unauthorized coal mining activities and enable law and order authorities to take suitable action in time. Till February, 2021, 443 Complaints have been registered.
