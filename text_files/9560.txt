                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE; MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND MINISTER OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR HARSH VARDHAN)????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????; ??????? ?? ???????????? ??????; ?? ?????? ??????? ????????. ???? ?????(a)	The Government is implementing a plan scheme titled ‘’Water Technology   Initiative’’ to promote research and development in provisioning safe drinking water.  The scheme encourages both laboratory and field research for addressing identified water challenges.  During the last 3 years, 7 water centres have been set up besides supporting 109 projects across the country at an expenditure of around Rs. 126 crore.  Besides this plan scheme, Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) has also developed and demonstrated wide range of water technologies.(b) & (c): Yes, Sir. The activities taken up under the scheme have resulted in providing   solutions  to  19  site  specific  water  challenges  related  to  water  availability and quality covering  365  habitats  across  23 states. The  breakthrough research on materials, products, technologies and systems have provided scalable solutions to low per capita availability, salinity, bacteriological, iron and arsenic contaminations.  Some of these solutions related to water conservation and augmentation, natural water filtration and arsenic contamination have been upscaled for meeting requirements of larger populations.   The low temperature thermal desalination technology has also been demonstrated and upscaled by Ministry of Earth Sciences.(d) & (e): The water challenges identified in Kerala include contamination through multiple species. A project is underway to identify the principal reservoirs of Vibrio Cholerae and pathogenic viruses in Vembanad Lake in Kerala and suggest appropriate management methodology.  A prototype comprising of compact Secchi-disk for assessment of algal population has been designed. CSIR has also deployed water purification system in regions of Wayanad, Kottayam, Kuttanad and other flood affected areas.                                             *********
