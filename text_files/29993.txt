Opening of Azimuth Housing with suitable mechanism and take measurement of the Slew ring bearing (SRB) of S-band DWR, closing after inspection, cleaning greasing under the supervision of ISTRAC.?	Make ready the radar system for limited operation subject to inspection on the damage in SRB.?	Placing the order for SRB based on the measurement and part number.?	Replace the SRB and make the radar system for normal operation under supervision of ISTRAC.?	Place wedges and fill the gaps with shrink free concrete between the azimuth pedestal and foundation.(b)	DWR Chennai being twenty year old radar spares are not readily available in the open market. Hence considering the expertise the task of refurbishment of DWR Chennai was then handed over ISTRAC. Currently, ISTRAC is in the process of completing the task assigned. (c)	No representation received from the Government of Tamil Nadu between 2014 and 2020 regarding the condition of S Band Doppler weather at Chennai.(d)	Yes Sir. Preventive maintenance of all DWRs of IMD including S band DWR at Chennai are scheduled twice annually every year. During the scheduled maintenance, the radar is fully shut down for careful examination of the system sub-parts for their required repair/replacement for error-free operations. During the preventive maintenance, the radar site is visited by the technical team of experts accompanied by the Head of the DWR station for technical inspection. In addition, in- house corrective maintenance is also carried out in case of fault developed in the radar system.
