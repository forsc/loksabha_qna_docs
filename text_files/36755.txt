                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) to (e): The Department of School Education and Literacy with effect from 2018-19 has launched an Integrated Centrally Sponsored Scheme for School Education- Samagra Shiksha Under the scheme, financial assistance is provided to States and UTs for undertaking various activities for universalization and delivery of equitable quality school education, including opening/strengthening of new schools upto senior secondary level, construction of school buildings & additional classrooms, setting up, up-gradation and running of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas, setting up of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Avasiya Vidyalayas, free uniforms, free text books, transport allowance and undertaking enrolment & retention drives. The Government of India has taken following measures for the betterment of school education across the country: 1. Central RTE Rules have been amended on 20th February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes at Elementary level. 2. A 70 indicator based matrix Performance Grading Index (PGI) has been developed to grade the States and UTs. This index has now been extended to district level to assess the Educational performance of the districts. 3. NISHTHA (National Initiative for School Heads and Teachers Holistic Advancement), an Integrated Teacher Training Programme has been introduced. 4. Learning Outcomes for Secondary level have been notified. 5. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) was entrusted to conduct teachers professional training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. 6. Availability of vast body of e-content on digital educational platforms, under PM e-vidya.	As education is in the Concurrent List of the Constitution, the recruitment, service conditions and deployment of teachers come under the purview of respective State Government/ UT Administration.The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 in its Schedule lays down Pupil-Teacher Ratio (PTR) for both primary and upper primary schools. At primary level, the PTR norm is maximum of 30:1 for enrolment upto 200 and maximum 40:1 thereafter.  The actual deployment of teachers in schools comes under purview of respective State Government.The recruitment of teachers in schools is a continuous process and the vacancies keep arising due to retirement, resignation and additional requirements on account of enhanced students’ strength/new schools. However, Ministry of Education requests the States and UT Governments for filling-up the vacant posts of teachers and their rational deployment, through Review meetings and advisories from time to time. Further, the Central Government through the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Samagra Shiksha, provides assistance to the States and UTs for deployment of additional teachers to maintain appropriate Pupil Teacher Ratio as per the prescribed norms for various levels of schooling. As per the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE+), 2019-20, the Pupil- Teacher Ratio at Government schools in State of Uttar Pradesh at Primary, Upper Primary and Secondary level is 29:1, 28:1 and 28:1 respectively.******
