                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) & (b) : 	The information about theft of electricity gets reflected in the high Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses of the power distribution utilities. As per the information submitted by them, the Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses of state power distribution utilities in the country in FY 2018-19 was 22.03%. (c) : 		There are specific provisions in the Electricity Act 2003 (Section 126 and sections 135 to 140) relating to theft and unauthorized use of electricity including stiff penal provisions and speedy trial for such offences by Special Courts (Part XV of the Electricity Act 2003). Government of India has provided assistance to the States under the schemes such as Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana and Integrated Power Development Scheme for use of aerial bunched cables and underground cables with the aim of reducing theft and AT&C losses. Energy audit has been made mandatory for all Discoms. This will also help in checking theft of electricity.***************
