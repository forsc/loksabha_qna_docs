ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW) (a) and (b) Representations, including that from the Hon’ble Member of Parliament, have been received for extension of 12555/56 Gorakhpur-Hisar Gorakhdham Express upto Sirsa.  These have been examined, but not found operationally feasible, at present. However, extension of existing train services is an ongoing process on Indian Railways, subject to traffic justification, operational feasibility, commercial viability, availability of resources, etc.(c) and (d) At present, Sirsa-Delhi sector is being served by 03 pairs of Mail/Express services including the service of 14620 Firozpur-Agartala Express departing Sirsa station at 17:07 hours.  Owing to operational constraints including terminal constraints at Delhi, there is no immediate proposal for introduction of new train between Delhi and Sirsa. However, introduction of new train services is an ongoing process on Indian Railways.*****
