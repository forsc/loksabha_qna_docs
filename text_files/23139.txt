The Centrally sponsored scheme of Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) is being implemented by the Ministry of Education with the aim of promoting access, equity and quality. Inter alia, the scheme provides central assistance to States for creation of Model Degree Colleges, infrastructure grants to college and universities, creation of universities either through upgradation of existing autonomous colleges or clustering of colleges etc.The Project Approval Board (PAB) of RUSA has approved an amount of Rs. 21 crores, under various components, for the 7 identified EBDs in the State of Maharashtra.
