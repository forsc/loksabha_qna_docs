                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (e) Detection and deportation of illegal migrants is a continuous and ongoing process. Central Government is vested with powers under Section 3(2)(c) of The Foreigners Act, 1946 to deport foreign nationals staying illegally in the country. These powers to deport illegally staying foreign nationals have been entrusted under Article 258 (1) of the Constitution of India to the State Governments. Further, under Article 239 (1) of the Constitution of India, the Administrators of the Union Territories have also been directed to discharge the functions of the Central Government relating to deportation of illegally staying foreign nationals. -2/…-2-LS.US.Q.NO.1680 FOR 02.07.2019Consolidated instructions regarding deportation/ repatriation of foreign nationals have been issued, vide MHA letter No. 25022/19/2014-F.I dated24.04.2014. Further advisories have been issued to the State Governments/ UT Administrations regarding identification of illegal migrants and monitoring thereof, vide MHA letter No. 24013/29/Misc./2017-CSR.III(i) dated 08.08.2017 and No. 25022/63/2017-F.IV dated 28.02.2018	Instructions have been issued to all State Governments/ UT Administrations including State Government of Karnataka from time to time in 2009, 2012, 2014 and 2018, for setting up detention centres as per requirement to restrict the movements of illegally staying foreign nationals so that they are physically  available at all times for expeditious repatriation / deportation. Consolidated instructions on the subject along with a Model Detention Centre/ Holding Centre/  Manual have also been circulated to all States/ UT Administrations, vide MHA letter No. 25022/32/2014-F.I (Vol.II) dated 09.01.2019. The State Government of Karnataka has informed that they are in the process of establishment of a Detention/ Holding Centre. The required police personnel and other infrastructure facilities have been allocated for this purpose and necessary work is under progress. 	Since illegal migrants enter into the country without valid travel documents  in clandestine and surreptitious manner, there is no accurate data -3/...-3-LS.US.Q.NO.1680 FOR 02.07.2019regarding number of such illegal migrants living in the country. As per information received from the State Government of Karnataka 143 cases have been registered against illegal Bangladeshi nationals in Karnataka and 114 illegal Bangladeshi nationals have been deported from Karnataka.*****
