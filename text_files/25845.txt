ANSWER




          THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE  MINISTRY OF HOUSING & URBAN AFFAIRS                      (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a) to (d): Central Public Works Department (CPWD) maintains utmost accountability and transparency in all aspects of its working. There is no general failure on the part of CPWD in completion of projects in scheduled time, which may however get rescheduled due to various factors such as release of funds by owner organisations, changes in scope of work, statutory local clearances, natural calamities etc. Private participation exists in CPWD projects as works are awarded to private agencies through transparent bidding process. A number of steps have been taken by the Government to improve the functioning of CPWD which include organizational restructuring, systemic improvement in manual provisions and procedures, implementation of technology based platforms e.g. e-payment, e-tendering, e-procurement, e-sewa, e-project management etc.(e) & (f): A total of 74 complaints have been received in Vigilance Unit of Central Public Works Department (CPWD) during the current year. Appropriate and robust mechanisms exist in the department for continuous review of all the works through Web Based Project Monitoring System (WBPMS) as also regular review by officers at field level and centrally by senior officers. Further, the Vigilance unit of CPWD has carried out 19 number of inspections in the last three years (2018-20) and the current year.                                        *****
