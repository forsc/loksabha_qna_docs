ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR) (a) to (c) As on 31st January 2022, 70% of the total vaccine doses have been administered at COVID-19 Vaccination Centres located in rural areas. As on 31st January 2022, a total of 20,73,71,863 Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered in tribal districts across the country, out of which 11,88,71,511 are first dose, 8,69,71,913 are second dose and 15,28,439 are precaution doses. Government of India is regularly reviewing the pace of COVID-19 vaccination and has issued multiple advisories to States/UTs to cover eligible beneficiaries with both doses of COVID-19 vaccine. All efforts have been made to maximise the convenience of the beneficiaries for availing COVD-19 vaccination, including tribal communities and those without access to digital technology, e.g., walk-in registration, facilitated cohort on–site registration and vaccination, assisted registration through Common Service Centers (CSCs) or 1075 Helpline/State’s Call Center, special sessions for people who don’t have any of the specified identity cards etc. Government of India has also initiated ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign wherein missed beneficiaries for 1st dose and due beneficiaries for 2nd dose are identified and vaccinated through house-to-house activity. ****
