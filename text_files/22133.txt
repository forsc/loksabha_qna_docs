ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	There are 723 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) in the country. Out of 723 KVKs, 38 are under the administrative control of State Governments, 66 under ICAR Institutes, 104 under NGOs, 474 under State Agricultural Universities, 22 under Central Agricultural Universities, 3 under Central Universities, 8 under Deemed Universities, 3 under PSUs, and 5 under other educational institutions.(b)	Third Party evaluation of Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) has been carried out by National Institute of Labour Economics Research and Development (NILERD), an autonomous institute under NITI Aayog 2015. The major observations and findings of this evaluation are as follows:- •	It was observed that KVKs are playing proactive role in transferring new technology at field level with beneficial impacts. •	The KVKs have an edge in technology transfer over other service providers by virtue of having better technical expertise and demonstration abilities. •	About 40 percent farmers reported that they implemented the technology immediately after its dissemination by KVK and that 25 percent did so from the next agricultural season. •	On an average a KVK covers 43 villages and 4300 farmers per year. 80% of villages covered are 10 km away from KVK.•	96% farmers’ requests were attended by KVKs.•	42% technologies adopted by farmers resulted in higher productivity, 33% resulted in high harvest income and 20% resulted in drudgery reduction.•	About 25% of persons trained started self-employment ventures.Besides, International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) evaluated the KVKs in 2019. The major findings of Study on KVK by IFPRI are as follows:•	KVKs’ efforts generated an additional net farm income of Rs. 3568 per hectare. •	Cost Benefit ratio is 1:7.8. Thus, the rate of return on expenditure on KVK is very high. •	One farmer trained by a KVK disseminates technology/knowledge to 30 fellow farmers.As regards role of KVKs, these grass root level scientific organizations are mandated with technology assessment and demonstration for its application and capacity development of farmers and extension personnel. Besides, KVKs also produce quality seeds and planting materials; and provide diagnostic and advisory services to the farmers for adoption of good agricultural practices.(c)	Yes Sir, KVK Portal has been developed to integrate all the KVKs of the country including those in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu for online monitoring, management, information and advice of KVKs and to disseminate useful knowledge and technologies to farmers.(d)	During the last two years and the current year, the KVKs conducted 1.12 lakh on farm trials and 7.35 lakh frontline demonstrations on the farmers’ fields; upgraded the knowledge and skill of 46.09 lakh farmers and 3.88 lakh extension personnel; conducted large number of extension activities  with the participation of 725.54 lakh farmers; produced 5.48 lakh quintal seeds of improved varieties of different field crops, 1150.53 lakh quality planting materials of elite species of different horticultural crops and 680.79 lakh fingerlings and other livestock strains and provided to farmers. The KVKs also tested 18.30 lakh Soil, water, plant, manures samples of the farmers and provided advisories accordingly. For providing timely and need based information on weather, market, various farm operations, outbreak of pest and disease incidence and their control measures, etc. to farming community, 8120.27 lakh messages were sent on farmers’ mobile.(e)	Out of total rural districts in the country, 636 districts are covered by KVKs. Since the States create new districts on the basis of their need, on the creation of new districts, steps are taken by the Department to set up KVKs. Accordingly, Government approved setting up of 76 KVKs in the country under three-year Plan (2017-2020) out of which 54 KVKs have been set-up. Lack of receipt of application for establishment of new KVKs from organizations having suitable site for establishment of KVKs is the reason for not setting up of these KVKs so far.Setting up of KVKs depend on the availability of suitable cultivable land in the name of proposing Government or its related host organizations. However, to expedite the process, the ICAR has constituted site selection committees for identifying the suitable land for setting up of remaining 22 KVKs.*******
