This Ministry has not received any information from Government of Telangana regarding suicides by online rummy games.(c)and (d): Online gaming platforms are intermediaries and they have to follow the due diligence as prescribed in the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000 and the Rules thereunder. State Governments under List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution have enacted their laws to deal with betting and gambling within their jurisdictions. Some States have recently legislated for online gaming also. MeitY regulate all the intermediaries as per the IT Act and the Rues thereunder.Further, keeping with the MeitY’s objective and goals to ensure an Open, Safe &Trusted and Accountable Internet, Government has notified the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 under the IT Act, 2000.
