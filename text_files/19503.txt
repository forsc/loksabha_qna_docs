ANSWER




MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) & (b):	There is no information available about the difficulties faced by fabric markers/garment exporters in Punjab. As regard steep rise in cotton prices, it is intimated that the Cotton is an agricultural commodity and price of cotton fluctuates on day to day basis due to various market dynamics. Based on the demand and supply situation, Cotton price has increased by 17% to 20%, as compared to rate prevailing on 1st September 2020. The average cotton price of J-34 variety cotton grown in the state of Punjab was Rs. 43502/- per candy in January 2020 whereas at present, the cotton price is ruling at Rs. 42936/- per candy. Therefore, current cotton prices are lower as compared to prevailing in the corresponding period of last year. Also, the Indian cotton is still cheaper as compared to the International prices. (c) & (d):	In order to make the textile value chain more competitive, Government has approved the scheme for Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) to all export goods including Readymade Garments (RMG) and made-ups with effect from 1st January 2021.***
