                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	: Yes, Sir. The Government through Coffee Board is implementing Integrated Coffee Development Project which inter-alia includes the following activities :(i)	In traditional coffee growing areas financial support is provided for replantation, water augmentation and eco-certification of coffee. Support is also provided for marketing of coffee on community basis by Small Growers’ Collectives / Self Help Groups (SHGs) / Cooperatives.(ii)	In Non-traditional areas of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha support is provided for coffee expansion (new coffee planting) and consolidation, quality up-gradation (purchase of baby pulpers and construction of cement drying yards) and Eco-Certification / Organic Certification. Support is also provided for marketing of coffee on community basis by Self Help Groups (SHGs) / TribalGrowers collectivesSupport is also provided for installing Roasting, Grinding and Packing Machinery.(b)	: Various interventions such as research & development, technology transfer, capacity building, support for value addition etc. are undertaken for overall improvement of production, productivity and quality of coffee. Coffee Board has launched Coffee Connect – Field Force Mobile App to provide advisories on production related aspects to the coffee growers. The Board has also launched a Web-portal namely, KSHEMAM (Kaapi Soil Health Monitoring and Management) which enable the growers to access the soil fertility status of their areas/ plantations and download the soil health cards.(c)	: Government has taken measures to boost the production and export of coffeeby the way of providing financial and technical assistance to the growers and the industry for replanting, water augmentation, expansion & consolidation of holdings in non-tradition and North Eastern Region, value addition and market promotion. Details of financial and technical assistance provided by the coffee Board during the last three years are given in Annexure I and Annexure-II respectively.(d)	: As per the post-monsoon estimation (during December 2019) done by the Coffee Board, the estimated crop for the year 2018-19 is 3,19,500 tonnes which is about 16% less than the post-blossom estimation of 3,80,000 tonnes carried out during May 2018.(e)	: Coffee exports in a particular year are generally contributed by the current year coffee production as well as the stock of previous year.  Accordingly, the dip in production during 2018-19 may effect export during 2019-20.
