ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	The Government of India has replaced Planning Commission with NITI Aayog with effect from January 1, 2015 in order to evolve a shared vision of National development priorities, sectors and strategies with the active involvement of States in the light of national objectives.   NITI   Aayog has been providing directional and policy inputs to Central Ministries/Departments and   State Governments across the range of sectors such as agriculture,   science   &   technology, education, healthcare, water resources, urbanization, energy, transport and so on.  With setting up of NITI Aayog, the process of five year plans has been discontinued after the 12th Plan..(b)	& (c)   Yes Sir. The exercise of appraisal of 12th five year plan (2012-17) was undertaken following a decision taken in the first meeting of the Governing Council of NITI Aayog on 8th February, 2015. This appraisal assessed the performance during the first four years of the plan (2012-13 to 2015-16) and spelt out policy-or-implementation-related changes aimed at furthering the development agenda of the nation. Further, in the backdrop of an increasingly open and liberalized economy, it was felt that a fresh approach to the development process with a long term vision for the country is required. In this context, NITI Aayog has released a Strategy for New India @75 document with policy recommendations in 41 key areas with drivers of growth, infrastructure, inclusion and governance.  In addition, a three year Action Plan for the years 2017-18 to 2019-20 was also released by NITI Aayog.*****
