Apart from those skilled by the Ministry, the details of persons trained through 3 major skilling schemes of the other Ministries, viz. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojna (DDU-GKY) and Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETI) implemented by Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) and Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojna- National Urban Livelihood Mission (DAY-NULM)by Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) from 2018-21 in West Bengal are placed below:Number of persons Trained in West Bengal through 3 other major schemes 	TotalS.N	Scheme Name	FY 18-19	FY 19-20	FY 20-21	1	Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojna (DDU-GKY)	8,652	9,531	521	18,7042	Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETI) 	13,149	12,576	5876	31,6013	Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojna- National Urban Livelihood Mission (DAY-NULM)	35,416	4,262	409	40,087		57,217	26,369	6,806	90,392 (d)	The details of youth given placement during 2018-2021 in West Bengal in MSDE schemes are placed below: Skilled persons placed under MSDE schemes in West Bengal S.N	Scheme Name 	FY 18-19	FY 19-20	FY 20-21	Grand Total1	PMKVY	33,836	29,777	6,946	70,5592	JSS	1,269	1,233	1,160	3,662The final report of Tracer Study of ITI Graduates (published in January 2018 by the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, GoI) mentions that, all over India, 63.5% of total ITI pass-outs got employed (wage+ self, out of which 6.7% are self-employed) and 36.4% remained unemployed and was looking for jobs. Even though the first figure was low for females (55.3%) as compared to that for males (65.1%), the corresponding figures for SCs (65%) and STs (69.8%) were higher than the percentage of total pass-outs in (wage+ self) employed. Comparable State-wise figures are not available. It is to be noted that this Ministry monitors placement mandatorily only in PMKVY (Short Term Training). Since, NAPS is an apprenticeship related scheme, no placement is tracked.As far as Ministry’s schemes are concerned, the Implementing organizations (Training Providers (TPs) in the case of PMKVY, NGOs in the case of JSS) themselves do handholding for placement and separate placement agencies do not come into picture. The details of persons Placed by Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) and Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) through the three major schemes as mentioned above, from 2018-21, in West Bengal are placed below: Skilled persons under 3 other major schemes placed in West Bengal 	Grand TotalS.N	Scheme Name	FY 18-19	FY 19-20	FY 20-21	1	Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojna (DDU-GKY)	3,700	3,829	2,544	10,0732	Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETI) 	8,418	8,960	4,591	21,9693	Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojna- National Urban Livelihood Mission (DAY-NULM)	8,950	3,650	618	13,218		21,068	16,439	7,753	45,260Annexure-I ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *62 TO BE ANSWERED ON 07.02.2022 REGARDING SCHEMES FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT 1.	Definition of worker (employed persons): Persons who, during the reference period, were engaged in any economic activity or who, despite their attachment to economic activity, temporarily abstained from work for reasons of illness, injury or other physical disability, bad weather, festivals, social or religious functions or other contingencies constituted workers. 2.	Definition of usual status worker (ps+ss): The workers in the usual status (ps+ss) are obtained by considering the usual principal status (ps) and the subsidiary status (ss) together. The workers in the usual status (ps+ss) include (a) the persons who worked for a relatively long part of the 365 days preceding the date of survey and (b) the persons from among the remaining population who had worked at least for 30 days during the reference period of 365 days preceding the date of survey.3.	Seeking or available for work (or unemployed): Persons who, owing to lack of work, had not worked but either sought work through employment exchanges, intermediaries, friends or relatives or by making applications to prospective employers or expressed their willingness or availability for work under the prevailing conditions of work and remuneration, were considered as those ‘seeking or available for work’ (or unemployed). 4.	Unemployed persons in usual status (ps+ss): The number of persons unemployed for a relatively long period during a reference period of 365 days is defined as unemployed in the usual principal  status or in usual status (ps). However, some of the unemployed on the basis of this criterion might be working in a subsidiary capacity. Therefore, the persons who are neither employed in PS  nor employed in SS but available for work (seeking or not) are defined as unemployed in usual  status (ps+ss).
