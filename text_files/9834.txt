ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Under the Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is implementing a flagship scheme called the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) 2016-20 with an objective to provide skilling to 1 crore prospective youth under Short Term Training (STT) courses and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) across the country for four years i.e. 2016-2020 with an outlay of Rs. 12,000 Cr. Under PMKVY (2016-20), as on 11.11.2019, 69.03 lakh (appx.) (38.01 lakh STT + 31.02 lakh RPL) candidates have been trained / oriented throughout the country. The State/UT-wise including State of West Bengal number of candidates trained / oriented under PMKVY (2016-20) is given at Annexure.(b)	Under PMKVY 2016-20, focus on employment has been significantly enhanced and candidates have been placed in various sectors and industries. Training Centers (TCs)/ Training Providers (TPs) are required to have dedicated mentorship-cum-placement cells for industry linkage and placement of candidates. TPs are mandated to organize Placement/Rozgar Melas every six months with support from the Sector Skill Councils (SSCs) and to ensure the participation of local industry. The scheme also incentivizes TCs/TPs for facilitating placement of the trained candidates. The reimbursement of last 20% of training payout to TCs is linked with the placement (wage employment or self employment) of the candidate. Additionally, post placement support of Rs. 1500 per month per trainee is applicable for special group (women candidates and persons with disability) and special areas (LWE, North East region and J&K) for 2 or 3 month post training depending on placement within or outside the district of the domicile of the candidate.(c) and (d)	Under PMKVY (2016-20), there are various provisions for monitoring of TCs as well as candidates. The life cycle of training process of candidates (enrollment-training-assessment-certification-placement) are tracked or monitored on real-time basis through the Skill Development Management System (SDMS) which is linked with Aadhaar enabled biometric attendance. Empanelled TCs are being monitored effectively through various methodologies such as self-audit reporting, call validations, surprise visits, social media etc. Appraisal of the on-going schemes and consequent improvements is an ongoing process.(e)	Under the new economic and industrial policy regime, India is moving towards becoming a global knowledge economy with the rising demand for skilled workforce. Under Skill India Mission, this is being achieved through the focus on skill development training by aligning with the current requirement of industry. Under PMKVY (2016-20), training is being imparted in National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) aligned job roles developed by industry led Sector Skill Councils. The Ministry has undertaken various measures to encourage greater participation of industry in skilling ecosystem to improve employment outcomes. Employer led skill development is also being promoted to further improve placements rates under PMKVY 2016-20.
