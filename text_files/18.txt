In the case of Union Territories, the Central contribution of premium is proposed to be 100% for UTs without legislature, while it is in the ratio of 60:40 for those with legislature.(c):     The scheme provides for cashless treatment for the entitled beneficiaries at empanelled hospitals.  No money is released to the beneficiary and payment is made directly to the hospitals by State Health Agency (SHA) in case of Trust mode, and by Insurance company in case of Insurance mode.  As on 18.06.2019, the total number of claims made are 23,26,520 and total claim amount submitted is Rs. 3077,51,38,624.

All such beneficiary families under RSBY that do not feature in the targeted groups as per SECC data, are also covered under PMJAY. At present, no proposal to extend the coverage of PMJAY is pending before the Government.   		 State-wise details of number of claims and claim amount are at Annexure-II.     	State Governments through State Health Agencies empanel hospitals within their jurisdiction to provide care to identified beneficiary families.
