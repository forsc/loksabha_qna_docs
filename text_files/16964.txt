ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b) Government of Kerala has entered into a Concession Agreement with Adani Vizhinjam Port Private Limited (AVPPL) in August 2015 for development and operation of Vizhinjam International Deepwater Multipurpose Seaport Project on Design, Build , Finance, Operate, Transfer (DBFOT) basis for initial concession period of 40 Years. An Independent Engineer has been appointed to monitor the project in line with the Concession Agreement. Government of Kerala has also constituted a Project Implementation Committee and an Empowered Committee headed by Chief Secretary of the State for monitoring the Project and for timely intervention and to render assistance to remove bottlenecks, if any faced by Concessionaire. Apart from the above, the Chief Minister reviews the project from time to time.      The construction work for the project was commenced in December 2015 and the project was scheduled for completion in December 2019. However, due to delay in the construction of breakwater, the completion of the port project is delayed. As per the current status of project informed by State Government of Kerala, some of the major components of work like construction of 800 meters long berth, dredging and reclamation, container yard and allied facilities have progressed satisfactorily and could be finished along with the completion of the breakwater. The project is expected for completion by 2021-22.                                           *****
