ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a): Airports Authority of India (AAI), the Implementing Agency, has awarded 948 routes under UDAN. Out of these 948 awarded routes, 403 UDAN routes have commenced connecting 65 UDAN airports including 2 water aerodromes & 8 heliports, as on 14.12.2021. The Selected Airline Operators (SAOs) have operationalized two (2) UDAN routes in West Bengal and Forty (40) UDAN routes in Telangana, so far. (b) & (c): Ministry of Civil Aviation has been interacting with the stakeholders including SAOs, State Governments etc. to review the scheme and operationalization of the routes awarded under UDAN and appropriate course corrections wherever required are taken to achieve the purpose of the scheme.  There is a delay in operationalizing some routes/discontinuation of the routes, for reasons which include: i)	Non-readiness of civil airports/heliports, which may be related to availability of land, creation of regional infrastructure, obtaining license from the Regulator etc. ii)Unsustainability of the operation on the awarded routes.;iii) Adverse impact of COVID-19 pandemic.;;UDAN is a market driven ongoing scheme. AAI, the Implementing Agency, has been conducting bidding under UDAN periodically with an aim to award routes to the SAOs for connecting more unserved and underserved airports across the country.;;(d): The Government of India has approved a budget of Rs. 4500 crore for revival of existing unserved / underserved airports / airstrips  of the State Governments, Airports Authority of India, Public Sector Undertakings and Civil Enclaves. An airport which is included in the awarded routes of Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) and requires upgradation/development for commencement of RCS operations, is developed under "Revival of unserved and underserved airports" scheme. Fund released under this scheme so far is about Rs. 2062.50 crore. Kothagudem airport does not figure in the tentative lists of the underserved and unserved airports of the scheme document.
