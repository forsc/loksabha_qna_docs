ANSWER




                                                        (a)       Under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, as on 10.07.2021, 199 empanelled training centres (TCs) including 48 Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendras (PMKKs) are operational in State of Bihar under PMKVY. The district-wise number of operational TCs in State of Bihar under PMKVY, as on 10.07.2021, is given in Annexure.(b)       PMKVY has two training components namely Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). Under STT component, candidates are being trained in short duration courses through empanelled TCs whereas under RPL component, candidates with prior learning experience or skills are being oriented and certified. Under STT-PMKVY, as on 10.07.2021, 3.84 lakh and 3.37 lakh candidates have been enrolled and trained, respectively, in the State of Bihar. Under RPL-PMKVY, 2.44 lakh and 2.39 lakh candidates have been enrolled and oriented, respectively, in the State of Bihar.         (c)        Under the scheme, placement has been linked with payout to training providers. The last tranche, i.e., 30 percent of total payout is only disbursed to training providers on ensuring placement of the candidates. Further, Rozgar Melas are organised with the support of Sector Skill Councils, training providers and implementing agencies to directly link the candidates with the potential employers.(d)       In view of (c) above, question does not arise.
