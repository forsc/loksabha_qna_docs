ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)	Welfare of Indians abroad, including students, is top priority of the Government of India.  Indian Missions/Posts have provision for  voluntary registration of all Indian nationals, including students, living in the country.  MADAD portal, launched in February 2015, extends helping hand to all Indians abroad.  Student Module of the MADAD portal, launched on 15 July, 2016, enables Indian students abroad to register voluntarily and provide data about their course, location, institution, duration of the course, etc. besides creating a database of Indian students going abroad.  Separately, the India Centre for Migration, a think tank of the Ministry, has prepared a “Student Handbook for Studying Abroad”, providing basic information to students intending to study overseas. The Ministry, through its Missions/Posts abroad, has also been regularly interacting with the  Indian students studying abroad. The Ministry and Indian Missions abroad issue advisories, from time to time, asking Indian students to carry all documentation and undertake due diligence to ensure that the foreign institutions to which they are seeking admission have proper authorization and capacities. In addition, the Ambassador and senior officials in Missions abroad regularly visit local universities and colleges to meet Indian students & address their issues.   Missions are also in constant touch with Indian student associations and University administrations. (c) to (e)	The Ministry has been making efforts for easing travel restrictions, wherever in place, for Indian students enrolled in foreign universities to make their travel to respective countries possible.   Our Missions abroad have been actively taking up these issues with the respective Governments and have been impressing upon those Governments to ease travel restrictions. The issue of travel restrictions has been taken up at the Ministerial level with several countries.  Consequently, travel restrictions have been eased for Indian students to travel to many countries, including USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg etc ; more countries are expected to open up when Covid situation improves.***
