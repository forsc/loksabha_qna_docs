ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ?????? (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):     The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) was introduced in the country from Kharif 2016 season.  Based on the experience and feedback from the stakeholders, scheme has further been revised and revamped with effect from Rabi 2018 and Kharif 2020-21 season.  Year-wise details of number of farmer applications enrolled under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) since inception of the scheme till 2020-21 alongwith coverage during 2011-12 to 2015-16 under erstwhile crop insurance schemes are given below:Before Inception of PMFBY	After Inception of PMFBYYear	Farmer Applications Insured (Lakh)	Year	         Farmer Applications Insured (Lakh)2011-12	297.0	2016-17	583.72012-13	334.0	2017-18	532.62013-14	332.4	2018-19	578.12014-15	370.8	2019-20	616.02015-16	485.5	2020-21	618.3Year-wise and State-wise details of farmers applications enrolled from 2016-17 to 2020-21  under PMFBY are given in Annexure. (c) & (d):   The PMFBY has been made voluntary for all farmers w.e.f. Kharif 2020 seasons.   Therefore, farmers are free to insure their crops as per their risk perception provided the crops and area is notified by the concerned State Government/UT Administration.     However, Government has taken several steps to create substantial awareness about the scheme amongst beneficiaries so that they can enroll themselves voluntarily under the scheme. The Government has made provision to ensure availability of adequate funds for awareness of PMFBY from Rabi 2018-19. The revised Operational Guidelines for PMFBY which came into effect from 1st October 2018 have provided that the insurance companies should compulsorily spent atleast 0.5% of the total gross premium collected by them for  Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities.            The Government has actively supported the awareness activities being carried out by the States, implementing Insurance Companies, financial institutions, and CSC network to disseminate key features of PMFBY amongst farmers and members of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). All the grass root level organisations responsible to implement PMFBY are actively involved in building capacity of farmers to take informed decisions.  Since, the Revamped PMFBY is being implemented from Kharif 2020, and has been made voluntary for all the farmers, the behavioural change communication activities are being conducted through various media tools viz Print, electronic, Digital and Social Media etc.  Mobile IEC vehicles also being used to motivate farmers during enrolment campaign at grass root level.            Apart from this, other activities for awareness generations involve the publicity of key features and benefits of the scheme through advertisements in leading National and local newspapers, airing of audio-visual spots on regional / local channels, distribution of IEC material in local languages, dissemination of SMS through Kisan / NCIP portal and organisation of online workshops of all stakeholders including farmers, Panchayat Members, and other key stakeholders.           Further, a structured awareness campaign ‘Crop Insurance Week/Fasal Bima Saptah’ was initiated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare since Kharif 2021 under Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav, an initiative to celebrate 75 years of India’s independence, in all the PMFBY  notified districts with special emphasis on aspirational/tribal districts. The core focus of the campaign is to increase the awareness and benefits of the scheme, sensitize the stakeholders and to increase overall enrolment of farmers, thereby helping them to reap the benefits of crop insurance with special focus on identified aspirational/tribal districts.  The next crop insurance week is set to be celebrated during Rabi 2021-22 with a view to create awareness amongst all stakeholders while targeting floating population of farmers at weekly bazar, rural haats, APMC Mandis, Rural fairs / Festivals including Block and Gram Panchayats etc. from 1st December to 7th December, 2021.(e):    The State-wise and Year-wise details of premium collected, claims reported and claims settled as per provisions of the PMFBY since inception of the scheme till 2020-21 are given in Annexure.(f) & (g):    The claims amounting to Rs. 951.21 crore of Telangana State for previous seasons are pending due to non-payment of State Government’s share in premium subsidy of Rs. 468.55 crore.   Government of India is regularly persuading the State Government of Telangana through meetings, written communications etc. to pay its share in premium subsidy so that the claims of eligible farmers can be settled by the concerned insurance companies.
