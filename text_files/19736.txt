ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a):	Pesticides are toxic substances which are registered for use in the country by the Registration Committee only after satisfying about their efficacy and safety to human health, animal and environment. The Pesticide may not pose any adverse effect on human beings, animals and the environment if they are used as per the label and leaflet approved by the Registration Committee.(b):	The decision to impose restriction of sale and use of pesticides is based on assessment of risk to Human and Animal health. The registration of Monocrotophos pesticide for use inContd….2/--2-agriculture in India was subjected to technical reviews in 1993, 1995 and 2005. None of the expert reviews have recommended imposition of complete ban on sale and use of Monocrotophos in agriculture. The Central Government vide Notification S.O.1482(E) dated 10th October, 2005 imposed ban on use of Monocrotophos on vegetables with effect from date of publication of order. Though, it is still registered for use in other crops like Cotton, Paddy, Maize, Black gram, Green gram, Red Gram, Sugarcane, Coconut, Citrus, Mango, Coffee and Cardamom. 	Further, 12 organophosphate molecules are banned in the Country due to safety issues; however, 21 organophosphates are presently registered in the country on various agricultural crops as per the label and leaflets approved by the Registration Committee after due examination of their efficacy and safety to human health, animal and environment.(c) & (d):	Registered Pesticides are periodically reviewed with regard to their safety and efficacy. On receipt of new studies / reports/ references/ information by government from time to time, the review is done by appointing expert committees. Based on the recommendations of such expert committees and after due consultation with Registration Committee, the Ministry of Agriculture has so far banned or phased out 46 pesticides and 4 pesticide formulations for import, manufacture or sale in the country. In addition, 5 banned pesticides are allowed to be manufactured for export only, 8 pesticide registrations have been withdrawn and 9 pesticides have been placed under restricted use.	While banning a pesticide, objections and suggestions received from the stakeholders on draft notifications are examined considering all aspects related to technical, scientific requirements, alternatives available, farmer interest, safety, toxicity and efficacy concerns, ban status in other countries, etc. and accordingly a final decision is taken.(e):	The Registration Committee constituted under Section 5 of Insecticide Act, 1968 registers insecticides after scrutinizing their formulae and verifying claims by the importer or the manufacturer as regards their efficacy and safety to human beings and animals. There are no guidelines of Registration committee which promotes more and more use of insecticides. Insecticide Act, 1968 doesn’t regulate fertilizers.(f):	Government of India is promoting Organic/ non-chemical farming in the states through dedicated schemes namely Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER). Both the schemes aim at promotion of cluster/ Farmers Producers Organization (FPO) based on chemical free low cost suitable organic farming and support farmers from input procurement to market linkages and formation of organic farming clusters.  Only organic/bio inputs are allowed under Organic farming. *****
