NHAI has issued a policy circular specifying the standards of ambulances (to basic life support ambulances as per AIS-125) and instructed its Regional Offices to upgrade the existing ambulances as per these standards. Recently, NHAI has also awarded tender for supply, operation and maintenance of ambulances for National Highways which aims at deploying Basic Life Support ambulances on the stretches under jurisdiction of NHAI.(c) Road users generally register all their highway related complaints through helpline number ‘1033’ which are duly addressed and resolved at local level itself, by the respective Regional Offices and Project Implementation Units. (d) The Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 provides for a scheme for cashless treatment of road accident victims during the Golden Hour.*****
