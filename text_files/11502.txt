The proposals recommended by various High Courts Collegiums for appointment of High Court Judges are under various stages of processing with the Government and Supreme Court Collegium as per the procedure prescribed in Memorandum of Procedure (MoP).  Filling up of vacancies in the High Courts is a collaborative and integrated process, between the Executive and the Judiciary. It requires consultation and approval from various Constitutional Authorities both at the Centre and State. Hence total time taken in the process of appointment cannot be indicated.
