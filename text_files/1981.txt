The anticipated cost of the project is `2562 crore at the price level of 2015-16, which will further increase and an expenditure of `184.21crore has been incurred till 31.03.2019.The total requirement of land for the project is 1736 Hectares, out of which, so far only 646 Hectares land has been handed over for the project and `62.71 crores have been paid by Government of Rajasthan as land compensation to land owners. Since as per the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Railways and Government of Rajasthan, the Government of Rajasthan has neither provided the total land required for this project nor deposited their share to Railways, hence, the project is presently held up on account of the same.*****
