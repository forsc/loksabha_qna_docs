ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a) Action against misuse of export schemes and concessions is a continuous process. Whenever misuse of such export schemes and concessions is detected the firms are placed in Denied Entity List (DEL) and adjudication proceedings are initiated. Investigations into misuse of export schemes and concessions are concluded within reasonable time even though there is no fixed time frame for completing the investigations in such cases. During the last three financial years 22099 firms have been placed in DEL and penalties were imposed on 2922 firms after adjudication. (b) & (c) The work related to investigation process is reviewed from time to time. Model guidelines to ensure timely completion of adjudication proceedings have been issued to Regional Authorities of the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) on 27.01.2021. Further, Central Economic Intelligence Bureau (CEIB) has issued an Information Sharing Protocol (ISP)  under which the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), CEIB, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) & other investigative agencies share information to investigate fiscal offences which includes misuse of export schemes and concessions.*******
