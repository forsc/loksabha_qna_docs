ANSWER




MINISTER OF  PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a): The coal production target of Coal India Limited (CIL) has been fixed at 660 Million Tonne (MT) for current year 2019-20.(b)&(c): The target for Power Sector for the current fiscal, as given by Ministry of Power, is 530 MT.  During the current year (April- October 2019-20), dispatch to Power sector from CIL sources has been 253.02 MT in comparison to last year’s figure of 276.84 MT. and from SCCL source, coal dispatch to power sector during  April- October 2019-20 has been 29.82MT in comparison to last year’s figure of 30.15MT. However, decline in dispatch of coal to Power Sector has not affected the coal availability position at the Power House end. Presently, stock at Power House end stands at 22.91MT as on 20.11.2019, equivalent to 14 days’ consumption with 4 power plants under critical list, as against the last year same day’s stock of 11.74 Million tonnes, equivalent to 7 days’ consumption, with 26 Power plants reeling under criticality. (d)to(f): Bulk of the coal produced in CIL is dispatched to the destination through rail mode in close coordination with the Indian Railways. Railway infrastructure, including availability of wagons, is at present sufficient to move the quantum of available coal. With the increase of production of coal down the years, railway infrastructure has also improved. Coal India Limited has also invested heavily in laying various railway lines like Tori-Shivpur and Jharsugua- Barapalli- Sardega. *****
