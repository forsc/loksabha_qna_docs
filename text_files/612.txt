                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRYAND DAIRYING(DR.SANJEEV KUMAR  BALYAN)(a) Yes Sir.  (b) The Department is implementing following schemes for dairy development and cattle rearing:-i.	National Programme for Dairy Developmentii.	National Dairy Plan-Phase Iiii.	Dairy Entrepreneurship Development Schemeiv.	Dairy Processing and Infrastructure Development Fundv.	Rashtriya Gokul Mission(c) The price of milk is paid based on the fat and/or Soild Not Fat (SNF) content in the milk. Most of the dairy cooperatives pay to their producers the maximum share of the consumer rupee (about 60-80 per cent) which is highest in the world. Further member farmers also receive annual bonuses plus various input services like veterinary services, Artificial Insemination (AI), cattle feed at subsidized rates etc and around the year market access by the cooperatives.

Since milk is a highly perishable product, this department does not have any proposal to fix MSP for milk in the country. (e) & (f) This Department is implementing Dairy Entrepreneurship Development Scheme (DEDS) from 01.09.2010 under which back ended capital subsidy is provided @25% of the project cost for general category and @33.33% for SC/ST farmers establishment of small dairy units (upto 10 animals), rearing of heifer calves- cross bred (upto 20 calves) among other components. ****
