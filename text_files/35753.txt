ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) to (d)  As per Section 6 (1) of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA), 2005, the Central Government may by notification specify the wage rate for unskilled work for its beneficiaries. Accordingly, the Ministry of Rural Development notifies Mahatma Gandhi NREGA wage rate for every financial year for States/UTs. To compensate the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA workers against inflation, the Ministry of Rural Development revises the wage rate every year based on change in Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labour (CPI-AL). The index is different for different States/UTs as notified by Labour Bureau, Shimla. If the calculated wage rate of any State/UT is coming lower than the wage rate of previous financial year, it is being protected by maintaining the previous financial year wage rate. The wage rate is made applicable from 1st April of each financial year. However State Governments can provide wage over and above the wage rate notified by the Central Government under the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA. (e) & (f)  As per the provision of the Act, the State Government shall link the wages, without any gender bias, with the quantity of work done and it shall be paid according to the rural schedule of rates fixed after time and motion studies for different types of works and different seasons and revised periodically.A separate Schedule of rates shall be finalized for women, the elderly, people with disabilities and people with debilitating ailments so to improve their participation through productive work.i.	The schedule of rates wages for various unskilled labourers shall be fixed up so that an adult person worked for eight hours which include an hour of rest will earn a wage which is equal to the stipulated wage rate;ii.	The working hours of an adult worker shall be flexible but shall not spread over more than twelve house on any day.*****
