                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL) (a) MoPR has been taking several steps for strengthening and development of the Panchayati Raj Institutions in the States and Union Territories including aspirational districts through provisioning of financial and technical assistance under the schemes and programmes of the Government and issue of advisories from time to time. The various measures taken include incentivizing the States which have devolved more functions, funds and functionaries to Panchayats, providing financial and technical assistance for capacity building of Panchayats under the erstwhile schemes of Capacity Building and on going scheme of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan to enable them to perform the devolved functions effectively and efficiently. Ministry has also assisted States in strengthening systems of budgeting, accounting and auditing, development of software applications to bring in transparency, accountability and efficiency in their functioning, and in formulation of detailed guidelines for preparation of participatory Gram Panchayat Development Plans by the Gram Panchayats utilising the resources available at their command. Further, Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV FC) has recommended Grants to the Rural Local Bodies (RLBs) in all the three tiers of Panchayats and Traditional Bodies in 28 States. The Recommended grants were Rs. 60,750 Crores for the interim period of 2020-21 and is Rs. 2,36,805 crore for the Award period 2021-26. The XV FC Grants have two components; namely, Basic (Untied) Grants and Tied Grants. Untied grants can be used for felt needs under the 29 subjects enshrined in the XI schedule, except for salaries and other establishment costs. Tied Grants are to be used for drinking water, rainwater harvesting, water recycling and sanitation and maintenance of ODF status. During 2020-21, Rs. 60,559 crore has been disbursed to the RLBs in the States constituting 99.69 % of the allocation. During 2021-22, so far Rs. 8923.80 crore has been released to States of the Basic (Untied) Grants.

Further, with a vision to digitalize Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) for empowering rural India, Ministry has developed a simplified work based accounting application– eGramSwaraj (egramswaraj.gov.in) to address various aspects of Panchayat functioning including planning, budgeting, implementation, accounting and monitoring to make them more transparent, accountable and effective as organs of decentralized self-governing institutions.
