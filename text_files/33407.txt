ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c) The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) conducted study through Wild Life Institute of India to assess the impact of the blowout in surrounding areas covering Dibru Saikhowa National Park, Maguri-Motapung Beel Wetland. The MoEFCC also assisted the Expert Committee constituted by Hon’ble National Green Tribunal to look into the adverse impacts of the blowout. Before the blowout incident, the MoEFCC had issued environmental clearance to M/s Oil India Limited on 11-May-2020 for extension drilling and testing of hydrocarbons at seven (7) locations under Dibru Saikhowa National park area. The Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) technology is an environment friendly process, which enables exploration or extraction of oil & natural gas beneath the forestland by accessing the reserves from outside the forest areas. *****
