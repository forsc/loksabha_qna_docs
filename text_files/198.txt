                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a) to (c):  A statement is laid on the Table of the House STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 10* FOR 21ST JUNE, 2019As per National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) 35.7% of under-five children are underweight, 21% wasted, and 38.4% stunted across the country. State/UT-wise detail is enclosed in Annexure – I.  Although malnourished children are more vulnerable than normal children to any infection including bone infection due to lower immunity, there is no data to substantiate increase in bone infection among malnourished children due to which children are becoming vulnerable to disability.  Although main programme for addressing the issue of malnutrition is Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) which is implemented by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, under National Health Mission (NHM), the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is strengthening the health systems which includes various programs to reduce under-nutrition in vulnerable population across the life cycle, such as micronutrients supplementation program, management of sick children with severe acute malnutrition in health facilities, improvement of appropriate Infant and Young Child Feeding Practices, Vitamin A supplementation, National Deworming Day etc. Prevention of Childhood illnesses such as Diarrhoeal diseases in turn prevents childhood malnutrition indirectly. Intensified Diarrhoea Control Fortnight (IDCF) is being implemented for this purpose. Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) which includes provision of free diet for the pregnant mothers and infants during their stay at health facility is another strategy to provide nutritional support. Other programmes like Immunization, Home Base Young Childcare programme (HBYC) inter-alia address malnutrition and improve nutritional status.The specific programs which have bearing on nutritional status of women and children and their expenditure is enclosed at Annexure -II.  As per National Family Health Surveys III and IV, there has been reduction in child malnutrition for stunting, under-weight and anaemia. The details may be seen as follows:
