ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(D. V. SADANANDA GOWDA) (a) to (d):	A statement is laid on the table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (A) TO (D) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 52* TO BE ANSWERED ON 25.06.2019 REGARDING “FERTILIZER SUBSIDY”.(a):    The details of subsidy given by the Government to various fertilizers companies in public, private and co-operative sectors in the country during each of the last three years and the current year, company-wise are given in  Annexure I to IV. (b) to (d): Urea is being provided to the farmers at a statutorily notified Maximum Retail Price (MRP). The MRP of 45 kg bag of Urea is Rs. 242 per bag (exclusive of charges towards neem-coating and taxes as applicable) and the MRP of 50 kg bag of Urea is Rs. 268 per bag (exclusive of charges towards neem-coating and taxes as applicable). The difference between the delivered cost of Fertilizers at farm gate and net market realization by the urea units is given as subsidy to the Urea manufacturer/Importer by the Govt. of India. Accordingly, farmers are getting Urea at affordable MRP because of the subsidy provided by the Government. As far as Phosphatic and Potassic  fertilizers is concerned, Government of India is implementing Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) Scheme w.e.f. 01.04.2010 for P&K fertilizers. Under the said scheme, a fixed amount of subsidy decided on annual basis, is provided on each grade of subsidized Phosphatic & Potassic (P&K) fertilizers depending upon its Nutrient content. This subsidy is given by Govt. of India to the P&K fertilizer companies which are therefore able to provide P&K fertilizers to the farmers at a subsidized MRP which is lower than it would have been, if no subsidy had been given. Accordingly, any farmer who is procuring these fertilizers at MRP, is availing the benefit of subsidy.Government has taken several steps to ensure that the farmers get the benefit of subsidy granted to the Fertilizer Companies:(i)	Introduction of DBT platform to monitor in real time the movement, supply, availability of various fertilizers.(ii)	Monitoring the prices of P&K fertilizers so that no manufacturer/distributor reaps undue benefit.(iii)	Provision of substantial budgetary allocation relating to fertilizer subsidy so that the fertilizer companies are able to supply fertilizer in adequate quantity in a timely manner.(iv)	Invoking the provision of the Fertilizer Movement Control Order, 1973 so that adequate supply of fertilizer is ensured through nooks and corners of the country.(v)	Prevention of diversion of subsidized urea for non-agricultural purposes through sale of fertilizers primarily through authentication based on Aadhar. In absence of Aadhar Card, Kishan Credit Card and Voter Identify Card are accepted for authentication. ***********
