ANSWER




                                                        (a)	and (b):The rapid expansion of Internet in India has also seen many different types of intermediaries in both the existing and the newly emerging categories.  Online gaming is one of the new emerging category of intermediaries that is also rapidly expanding all around the world.  Government is aware of the possible risks and challenges including that of user harms associated with online games and therefore also about the advertisements of these online games. This Ministry has received grievances regarding effects of online games.(c): As per the information provided by National Crime Records Bureau, Ministry of Home Affairs, the total number of cases registered under Gambling Act (Online Gambling) (involving communication devices as medium/target) for Cyber Crimes are 20, 22 and 63 for the year 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The latest published report is for the year 2020.(d): Online gaming platforms are intermediaries and they have to follow the due diligence as prescribed in the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000 and the Rules thereunder. State Governments under List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution have enacted their laws to deal with betting and gambling within their jurisdictions. Some States have recently legislated for online gaming also. MeitY regulate all the intermediaries as per the IT Act and the Rules therein and does not have any role in the sanction or licencing of online gaming platforms currently. (e)	and (f): The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting had issued an advisory to all private satellite TV channels stating that no advertisement should present online gaming for real money winnings as an income opportunity or an alternative employment option. According to the advisory, private television channels will have to follow the guidelines issued by the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) which is available at https://mib.gov.in/sites/default/files/Advisory.pdf.Further, keeping with the MeitY’s objective and goals  to ensure an Open, Safe & Trusted and Accountable Internet, Government has notified the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 under the IT Act, 2000. The said Rules provide for removal of any information/ application violative of any extant law, as and when notified by an appropriate government or its authorized agency.********
