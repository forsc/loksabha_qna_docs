                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a to c) Malnutrition is a multi- faceted problem.  The important determinants are inadequate food, level of poverty leading to low purchasing power, poor socio- economic status of women, female illiteracy, high rate of population growth and low access of population to health education, safe drinking water, environmental, sanitation, hygiene and other social services. Key reasons for malnutrition setting in early life are early marriage, faulty and sub-optimal infant and young child feeding practices, childhood illnesses and low birth weight. The nutritional status of the population is outcome of complex and inter-related set of factors and needs a multi-pronged approach. As per NFHS-4, 35.7% children under 5 years of age are underweight and 38.4% are stunted  as against NFHS-3 conducted in 2005-06, which reported 42.5% children under 5 years of age as underweight and 48% stunted Further, as per the report of Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) (2016-18), prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight among children is 34.7%, 17% and 33.4% respectively, which indicates further reduction when compared to the levels reported by NFHS-4.Government has set up POSHAN Abhiyaan for a three year time frame commencing from 2017-18.The goals of POSHAN Abhiyaan are to achieve improvement in nutritional status of Children from 0-6 years, Adolescent Girls, Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers in a time bound manner during the three years. Poshan Abhiyaan ensure convergence of various programmes i.e. Anganwadi Services, Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, Scheme for Adolescent Girls of Ministry of Women & Child Development; National Health Mission (NHM) of Ministry of Health & Family Welfare; Swachh Bharat Mission of Ministry of Jal Shakti (‘rural’) and Ministry of  Housing and Urban Affairs (‘urban’) ; Public Distribution System (PDS) of Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution (CAF&PD); Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) of Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) etc. Convergence at State, district and block levels is ensured through the following committeesi.	State level Convergence meeting with line departments chaired by Chief Secretary.ii.	District level Convergence meeting with line departments chaired by District Magistrate.iii.	Block level Convergence meeting with line departments chaired by Sub-Divisional Magistrate.Regular reviews and meetings are conducted at National and State/UTs level to monitor the progress of implementation of POSHAN Abhiyaan and other schemes of the Ministry.  National Council under the Chairmanship of Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog and the Executive Committee under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Women and Child Development also monitor the progress of POSHAN Abhiyaan regularly in which States are members of the Committee.(d & e) The Government has accorded high priority to the issue of malnutrition and is implementing several schemes/programmes of different Ministries/Departments through States/UTs to address various aspects related to nutrition. This Ministry is implementing POSHAN Abhiyaan, Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana, Anganwadi Services and Scheme for Adolescent Girls under the Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services Scheme (ICDS) as direct targeted interventions to address the problem of malnutrition in the country.Further steps taken under the National Health Mission (NHM), a flagship programme of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, to address malnutrition inter alia include promotion of appropriate Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices, Anaemia Mukt Bharat, Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) supplementation, de-worming, promotion of iodized salt, Vitamin-A supplementation, Mission Indradhanush to ensure high coverage of vaccination in children, conducting intensified diarrhoea control fortnights to control childhood diarrhoea, management of sick severely malnourished children at Nutrition Rehabilitation Centers, monthly Village Health and Nutrition Days, Home Based Newborn Care (HBNC) and Home Based Young Child care (HBYC) programmes, Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram, etc.All the above schemes/programmes have the potential to improve nutrition outcomes in the country.
