ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI) (a) & (b)   Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) seek issuance of No Objection Certificate (NOC) and other statutory clearances from the respective State Governments. The issue of completion of obtaining NOC within specified time limit has been taken up by Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas with the State Governments for simplifying the NOC process by introducing a Single window clearance system. Till date, the single window clearance has been started in few districts by the State of Madhya Pradesh only.  For setting up of LPG Distributorships, NOC is required from the local bodies such as Gram Panchayat or the urban local body for Godown construction, on the basis of which, licence is issued in Form “F” (under Gas Cylinder Rules, 2016) for storage of LPG in cylinders by Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization. Several State specific guidelines have to be complied for obtaining NOC/Licenses for setting up of LPG distributorships. These requirements are not standardized and vary across States/UT. (c) & (d)   Public Sector OMCs endeavour to meet the demand of LPG customers with its LPG distributors across the country, including in rural areas within 48 hours from the date of refill booking by the customers. However, delay in refill supplies may occur in circumstances beyond their control viz. Natural Calamities, transport breakdowns, Govt. directives, etc. The distributors are under instruction to endeavour to meet the demand of the domestic customers within 48 hours from the time of refill booking. (e) & (f)     The Public Sector OMCs have mandated provision of basic facilities like potable drinking water, public conveniences, facility of free air for vehicles etc. at their ROs. Periodic inspections are carried out by OMCs on their RO to ensure the availability of these basic facilities.  ****
