However, in addition to such pension income he may have also have interest income from the same bank in which he is receiving his pension income;(iii)	This bank is required to be a specified bank.  The Government will be notifying a few banks, which are banking company, to be the specified bank; and(iv)	He shall be required to furnish a declaration to the specified bank. The declaration shall be containing such particulars, in such form and verified in such manner, as may be prescribed.Once the declaration is furnished, the specified bank would be required to compute the income of such senior citizen after giving effect to the deduction allowable under Chapter VI-A and rebate allowable under section 87A of the Act, for the relevant assessment year and deduct income tax on the basis of rates in force. Once this is done, there will not be any requirement of furnishing return of income by such senior citizen for this assessment year.This amendment will take effect from 1st April, 2021.(b) Yes, it is proposed in the Finance Bill, 2021 to insert proviso to clause (11) and clause (12) of section 10 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 providing that the provisions of these clauses shall not apply to the interest income accrued during the previous year in the account of the person to the extent it relates to the amount or the aggregate of amounts of contribution made by the person exceeding two lakh and fifty thousand rupees in a previous year in that fund, on or after 1st April, 2021, computed in such manner as may be prescribed by the Central Government.(c), (d), (e) and (f) The Finance Bill, 2021 has proposed to empower the Central Government to notify a scheme for the purposes of disposal of appeal by the ITAT so as to impart greater efficiency, transparency and accountability by, —(i)	eliminating the interface between the ITAT and parties to the appeal in the course of proceedings to the extent technologically feasible; (ii)	optimising utilisation of the resources through economies of scale and functional specialisation; (iii)	introducing an appellate system with dynamic jurisdiction. It is also proposed to empower the Central Government, for the purpose of giving effect to the scheme made under the proposed sub-section, for issuing notification in the Official Gazette, to direct that any of the provisions of this Act shall not apply or shall apply with such exceptions, modifications and adaptations as may be specified in the notification. Such directions are to be issued on or before 31st March, 2023. It is proposed that every notification issued shall, as soon as may be after the notification is issued, be laid before each House of Parliament.Though the scheme would be notified after the Finance Bill is passed by the Parliament, it is proposed that a National Faceless Income Tax Appellate Tribunal Centre shall be set up under the said scheme.
