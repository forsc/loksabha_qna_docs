ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI RAMVILAS PASWAN)(a) to (d): 	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.****  STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF THE STARRED QUESTION NO. 303 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 10.12.2019 IN THE LOK SABHA.(a) to (d): 		Responsibility for identifying eligible beneficiaries under National Food Security Act(NFSA), 2013 rests with the State /UT Governments.  As per section 12 of NFSA 2013, for reforms in Targeted Public Distribution System, the Central and State Government shall endeavour to progressively undertake necessary reforms in the Targeted Public Distribution System in consonance with the role envisaged for them. The reforms shall, inter alia include application of information and communication technology tools including end-to-end computerization in order to ensure transparent recording of transactions at all levels, and to prevent diversion including leveraging aadhaar for unique identification, with biometric information of entitled beneficiaries for proper targeting of benefits of PDS to eligible beneficiaries.Upon implementation of the End-to-End computerisation scheme, for PDS reforms, identification of beneficiaries in Fair Price shops (FPSs) is done primarily on the basis of Aadhaar authentication of the beneficiaries through electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) mechanism. So far nearly 4.45 lakh FPSs, out of a total of about 5.35 lakh FPSs in the country have been automated with ePoS devices with Aadhaar authentication facility. 86% ration card (20 crore) & about 81.5% (65 crore) of beneficiaries have been seeded with Aadhaar numbers at the national level. Aadhaar authentication of eligible beneficiaries ensures rightful targeting of PDS benefits.However, this Department has reiterated time and again to all State/UT Governments to ensure that no instance of denial of foodgrains or deletion of names of family from the Ration Card database only on the ground of non possession of Aadhaar takes place. Furthermore, in order to ensure delivery of PDS benefits to genuine beneficiaries in the event of failure of Aadhaar authentication certain alternatives modes/documents have been prescribed for providing their identity at the Fair Price Shops.*****
