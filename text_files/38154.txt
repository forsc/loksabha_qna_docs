The environment statement is a tool for self-assessment by industries to know the level of environmental protection measures taken on temporal basis. The resource conservation, energy consumption, water conservation, waste generation and managements and financial expenditure are some of the indicator used to assess the measures taken control pollution and improve environment. Therefore, at present, there is no sector specific format (Form V).  The environment statements are collected and maintained by concerned SPCBs/PCCs as per provisions of  Rule-14 of Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 and the Central  Government do not maintain any such data.*****
