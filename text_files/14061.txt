ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF MINES, COAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a)	to (d): Telangana is one of the major manufacturers / exporters of Granite in India. The Government is aware that Karimnagar district in Telangana is one of the clusters for Granite industry in Telangana.During April, 2019 – January, 2020, exports of granite to China recorded positive growth as compared to the corresponding period previous year. The details of export to China during the current FY till January, 2020 is:-EXPORTS OF GRANITE FROM INDIA TO CHINAValue in US$ MillionGranite and its articles thereof	Apr-Jan''18-19	Apr-Jan''19-20	% ChangeTotal	351.41	359.62	2.34%The export statistics don’t reflect any reduction in exports of Granite to China. Anticipating the impact of Covid-19 outbreak in China on exports, the Government has instructed the industry bodies and Export Promotion Councils to initiate dialogue with the Missions posted abroad so as to explore potential markets to replace China. The mandate of export promotion of Natural Stones, including Granite falls under Chemicals & Allied Products Export Promotion Council (CAPEXIL). For the same, CAPEXIL has identified alternative markets such as Taiwan, USA, Poland, Hong Kong, Vietnam, etc and the Council is in contact with our missions posted in these countries to identify the potential buyers so as to fill the gap created by China.  *****
