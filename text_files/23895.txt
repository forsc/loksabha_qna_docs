ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                                  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) to (d):  In pursuance of Government’s vision of ‘Housing for All’ by 2022, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is implementing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U) since 25.06.2015 for providing assistance to States/ Union Territories (UTs) for addressing the housing shortage of the people in urban areas. States/ UTs have undertaken demand survey under the Scheme for assessing actual demand of housing and assessed demand reported by States/ UTs is around 112 lakhs. So far, 1,10,86,682 houses have been sanctioned under PMAY-U; out of which, 75,78,280 houses are at various stages of construction and 43,54,855 houses are completed/ delivered. A total of 96,20,574 houses have been sanctioned since 2017. The State/ UT-wise details are at Annexure.Sanctioned houses under PMAY-U involve Central Assistance of ?1,78,082 crore of which ?90,782 crore have already been released to States/ UTs/ Central Nodal Agencies. Government is committed to provide approved Central Assistance to fund the sanctioned houses under PMAY-U.(e):	States/ UTs have been requested to expedite the construction of houses approved under the Scheme so that houses may progressively be completed and delivered to the beneficiaries within the Mission period.  PMAY-U has progressed well, which is reflected from the fact that this Ministry has already sanctioned around 111 lakh houses, which is around 99% of total assessed demand of 112 lakh houses. The Scheme is well poised to achieve the vision of ‘Housing for All’ by 2022.                                           *****
