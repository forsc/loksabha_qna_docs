ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICUTLRURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ?? ????? ?????? ??????			                  	   (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	No, Sir. As Per New Education Policy 2020, the professional councils, such as the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Veterinary Council of India (VCI), National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE), Council of Architecture (CoA), National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET) etc., will act as Professional Standard Setting Bodies (PSSBs). They will play a key role in the higher education system and will be invited to be members of the General Education Council (GEC). These bodies, after restructuring as PSSBs, will continue to draw the curricula, lay down academic standards and coordinate between teaching, research and extension of their domain/discipline, as members of the GEC. As members of the GEC, they would help in specifying the curriculum framework, within which Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) may prepare their own curricula. Thus, PSSBs would also set the standards or expectations in particular fields of learning and practice while having no regulatory role. All HEIs will decide how their educational programmes respond to these standards, among other considerations, and would also be able to reach out for support from these standard-setting bodies or PSSBs, if needed.  In this context ICAR would continue to oversee, regulate and facilitate agricultural education and research in the country.(b)	The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) which is functioning under Department of Agricultural Research and Education (DARE) is the apex body for co-ordinating, guiding and managing research and education in agriculture including horticulture, fisheries and animal sciences in the entire country with 102 ICAR institutes, 60 All India Coordinated Research Projects (AICRPs), 19 All India Network Projects (AINPs) and 74 Agricultural Universities (AUs) system including 63 State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), 03 Central Agricultural Universities (CAUs), 04 Deemed  to be Universities and 04 Central Universities with Agriculture Faculty spread across the country. This is one of the largest National Agricultural Research And Education Systems (NARES) in the world. The ICAR has played a pioneering role in ushering Green Revolution and subsequent developments in agriculture in India through its research and technology development that has enabled the country to increase the production of foodgrains by 5.6 times, horticultural crops by 10.5 times, fish by 16.8 times, milk by 10.4 times and eggs by 52.9 times since 1950-51 to 2017-18, thus making a visible impact on the national food and nutritional security. It has played a major role in promoting excellence in research and higher education in agriculture.(c)	Yes, Sir. Institutional arrangement entrusted with DARE and ICAR is efficient, empowered and capable enough to discharge the assigned mandate.(d)	ICAR has following mandates to coordinate agricultural education and research activities taking place in National Agriculture Research and Education System (NARES) in the country: ?	Plan, Undertake, Coordinate and Promote Research and Technology Development for Sustainable Agriculture.?	Aid, Impart and Coordinate Agricultural Education to enable Quality Human Resource Development.?	Frontline Extension for technology application, adoption, knowledge management and capacity development for agri-based rural development.?	Policy, Cooperation and Consultancy in Agricultural Research, Education & Extension.As per the research mandate, the ICAR research institutes have taken up basic and strategic research programmes related to crop science, horticulture science, animal science, fisheries science, natural resources management, agricultural engineering, allied areas etc. crop/fruit improvement and development of production and protection technologies to form a base for applied research. The information so developed is used by respective All India Coordinated Research Projects (AICRPs) and All India Network Projects (AINPs) being carried out in ICAR Institutes and State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) to develop location specific varieties and technologies as per the agro ecological needs for enhancing the production and productivity. Moreover, various novel and cutting edge science-based research programmes are being pursued besides up-scaling the already developed technologies for maximizing the returns in agriculture for overall development of the country. The research programmes are being prioritized to develop new high yielding pest resistant varieties of food crops, pulses, fodder and commercial crop varieties.ICAR is involved in strengthening and streamlining of higher agricultural education system to enhance the quality of human resources through strengthening and development of higher agricultural education in India, human resources development for leadership roles in agricultural sciences, improving quality of agricultural education through innovative approaches in teaching, research, outreach activities etc.To achieve the above objectives of education, the following arrangements are in place:Deans’ Committees:In the frequent changing scenario and current demands of Higher Agricultural education system of the country, periodic exercise has been conducted by ICAR to address the issues on agricultural education including revision of courses and curricula in Agriculture and allied sciences. In pursuance of this goal, ICAR from time to time constitutes Deans’ Committee consisting of Senior faculty members representing diverse disciplines. Till date six Deans’ Committees have been constituted namely: First Deans’ Committee (1965); Second Deans Committee (1981); Third Deans Committee (1995); Fourth Deans Committee (2005); Fifth Deans’ Committee (2013) and sixth Deans Committee (2021) with mandate to restructure UG programmes of Agricultural Universities incorporating entrepreneurship for students.   Broad Subject Matter Area (BSMA) Committees: Academic regulations for Masters and Ph.D. programmes, defining names and curricula of various disciplines for uniformity and revision of syllabi for courses available with Agriculture Universities (AU’s) are undertaken by ICAR through BSMA Committees. During 2020-21 BSMA Committee has submitted report for revising the syllabus of 79 disciplines. National Agricultural Education Accreditation Board (NAEAB): Accreditation is done by ICAR to ensure the quality of higher agricultural education in Agricultural Universities and its constituent colleges. The University/ institution/programme are critically evaluated by a group of experts as per approved guidelines of the Council to achieve the following:i.	Assisting people, prospective students, educational institutions, professional societies, Government and other concerned agencies in identifying institutions and programmes which meet the minimum norms and standards as prescribed by the Council,ii.	Providing guidance for the improvement of existing agricultural education institutions/ programmes, and iii.	Developing new institutions/ programmes. Accreditation of Agricultural Universities is a continuous process, and since the constitution of the Board in 1996, Forty three AUs have been accredited. In order to infuse better accountability and intense monitoring for educational quality improvement in agricultural universities, the Government of India has taken a decision to link accreditation of agricultural universities by NAEAB with the Grant-in- Aid from ICAR, New Delhi.**********
