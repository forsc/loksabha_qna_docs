As per the article 1 of the HCA, the Republic of India shall be a host country for the PCA in the peaceful resolution of international disputes through arbitration, mediation, conciliation and fact-finding commissions of inquiry and in providing other appropriate assistance to government, inter-governmental organisations and other entities. Further, as per article 4 of the HCA, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has to coordinate on behalf of the Government all issues arising with respect to implementation of the agreement. Also article 6 of the HCA states that the PCA including any space provided and used pursuant to article 3 shall enjoy mutatis mutandis, the same privileges and immunities as those accorded to the United Nations in the Republic of India pursuant to Art.

The Scheme is being implemented since 1993-94. Till date the Central Government has sanctioned Rs. 8709.77 crore under the Scheme to States/UTs. The Scheme has been extended from time to time. Under this scheme funds are released by the Central Government for construction of court buildings and residential accommodations for Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Judiciary. The Government has extended the above scheme for a further period of five years from 01.04.2021 to 31.03.2026, with a total budgetary outlay of Rs. 9000 crores, including Central share of Rs. 5307 crores.
