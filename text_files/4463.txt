ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI. V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b) 	India announced its candidature for United Nations Security Council (UNSC) non-permanent seat for the term 2021-2022 for the lone seat available for the Asia-Pacific Group (APG) in November 2013. In June 2019, India’s candidature to UNSC non-permanent seat for 2021-22 term was endorsed by the 55 member APG. As many as 45 countries (including India) from APG made statements supporting India’s candidature, and no country opposed our candidature. Elections for UNSC non-permanent seat for the term 2021-22 will be held in June 2020 in New York. India has been elected to the UNSC as non-permanent member seven times earlier (for the terms 1950-51, 1967-68, 1972-73, 1977-78, 1984-85, 1991-92 and 2011-12). India’s performance as non-permanent member of the UNSC during these terms, along with active participation in UN activities, have strengthened India’s claim to permanent membership of UNSC.(c) to (e) 	India has called for urgent reforms of the UNSC, including its expansion in both permanent and non-permanent categories of membership, to make it more reflective of the contemporary geo-political realities. A series of initiatives involving bilateral and multilateral platforms have been undertaken by the Government in pursuance of this objective. A large number of countries including permanent and non-permanent members of UNSC have supported India’s candidature for permanent membership in an expanded UNSC. This has been expressed in various forms and fora including in bilateral intergovernmental meetings and discussions. India is actively engaged in the ongoing Inter-Governmental Negotiations on UNSC reform at the UN. In September 2016, India participated in the meetings of the "Group of Friends on Security Council Reform" which supports urgent reform of the UNSC including an expansion in both permanent and non-permanent categories of membership and early commencement of text based negotiations in the IGN on this issue. India also has been working alongside other reform-oriented countries through its membership of the G-4 Group (India, Japan, Brazil and Germany) and the L.69 Group (cross-regional grouping of developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America) to build support among UN Member States for expansion of the UNSC.***
