As on 12.06.2019, 12,127 TCs have been empanelled under PMKVY 2016-20.Further, Ministry also promotes establishment of model and aspirational skill centres known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) in every district for imparting skill training through PMKVY 2016-20.

For ensuring quality of training under the scheme, all accreditation and affiliation of training centre is done through an online portal SMART with inspections done by an independent third party assessment agency. Adding to the improved accreditation process, MSDE has initiated a process of continuous monitoring through various channels and mandatory re-accreditation every year. Under this, self-audit reporting, call validations, surprise visits and monitoring through the Skills Development Management System (SDMS) have been adopted. Further, the targets are being assigned to the TCs with a provision for periodic review. The grading is linked to quality of training, infrastructure availability, training capacity, past performance, geographical location and other relevant parameters.Moreover, under PMKVY 2016-20 scheme, placement tracking is mandatory.
