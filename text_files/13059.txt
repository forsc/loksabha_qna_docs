It presented its report to Parliament on 07/01/2019. However, the Bill lapsed after its passing by Lok Sabha. Subsequently, The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 (CAB), which was fundamentally based on the earlier Bill recommended by the JPC, was considered in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and after debates on various aspects of the Bill, both the Houses of Parliament passed it on 9th December, 2019 and 11th December, 2019 respectively. The report of JPC and extensive  debates held in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha are available in public domain.--3--LS.S.Q.NO. 178 FOR 03.03.2020Preparation of National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC) is governed by the provisions of section 14A of The Citizenship Act, 1955 and The Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003.  Section 14A of The Citizenship Act, 1955 provides for compulsory registration of every citizen of India and maintenance of NRIC.  This provision was included in the Citizenship Act, 1955 by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 which came into force on 3/12/2004.Delhi Police has taken several steps to control the law and order situation in Delhi.  Senior Police officers along with adequate police force including 76 companies of Central Armed Police Force were deployed at vulnerable points.  Meetings of the local Peace Committees, Resident Welfare Associations, Market Welfare Associations, Civil Society Groups, representatives of Political Parties etc have been held in the affected areas.  More than 120 FIRs have been lodged and hundreds of miscreants have been arrested.  Investigating Officers are collecting CCTV footage and seeking out Videos from public to bring the guilty to book.  Prohibitory Orders under Section 144 CrPC are being implemented in riot-affected areas.  Police forces have conducted Flag Marches in these areas to instill confidence among the people.  A close watch is being kept on social media platforms which may disseminate rumors and unfounded propaganda.  Appeal has been made to people to maintain peace and not to lay any credence to rumors. ******
