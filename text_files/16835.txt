In addition, the Government has set a target for installing 175 GW of renewable energy capacity in the country by 31st March 2022, against which cumulative renewable energy capacity of 88,793.39 MW has been installed up to 31st August 2020. To achieve the balance target of 86,206.61 MW, an investment of Rs. 4,74,136.35 crore has been estimated. (b) :      	No, Sir. There is no deficit of power generation capacity in the country.
