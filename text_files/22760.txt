                                                        (a) The Bharatmala Pariyojana, an umbrella program of Government of India for the National Highway sector, was approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on October 26, 2017, spanning over a period of five years (2017-2022). The objective of the program is to optimise the efficiency of freight & passenger movement across the country by bridging critical infrastructure Gaps and the implementation of the Pariyojana is being undertaken by Ministry of Road Transport & Highways through its various implementing agencies. A total length of about 24,800 km is being taken up under the Phase-I of Bharatmala Pariyojana. In addition, Phase – I also includes about 10,000 km of residual works of National Highway Development Project (NHDP). There program is divided in to six components to be taken up for implementation:S. No.	Name of Component & Details	Description	Total No. of Projects	Total planned length (km)	Total length to be undertaken as part of Phase I (km)	 Financial outlay for phase – I (INR Crores)1	Development / upgradation of Economic Corridors	Identified highway corridors of economic importance expected to carry 25%of freight in coming years	44	26,200	9,000	120,0002	Development / of Inter-corridor and feeder roads to National Highways and Economic Corridors	Connecting National Highways to link critical nodes with Economic corridors and National highways	Inter Corridor: 65Feeder Routes: 115	Inter-corridor: 8,000Feeder Routes: 7,500	6,000	80,0003	National Corridors Efficiency Improvement	i.

The List of identified MMLP projects is enclosed as Annexure I.(c), (d) & (e) The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways undertook a Logistics Efficiency Improvement Program (LEEP) in 2017, through NHAI to identify the shortcomings of the exiting road transportation and logistics framework along the National Highways. The study was undertaken across multiple logistics related themes, which include, unfavourable inter-modal mix, inefficient fleet mix, under-developed material handling infrastructure, Under-developed Road Infrastructure and Procedural complexities. The study also assessed socio-ecological impact of existing road-based logistics and transportation. A detailed Concept Note on the LEEP Study undertaken by MoRT&H is enclosed herewith as Annexure II.As part of the LEEP Study, it is identified that the cost of Logistics in India is 13-14 per cent of GDP as opposed to 7-8 per cent in developed economies like Japan, USA, Germany and Singapore. Further, this proportion has significantly increased over last 15 years, indicative of structural inefficiencies in logistics. The intent behind development of these MMLPs is to bring the cost of logistics below 10% of GDP by 2025 and to reduce the upto 10% in transportation cost for the top 15 nodes.The detailed Methodology and findings of the LEEP Study have been enumerated in section no. 2 (two), 3 (three), 5 (five) and 6 (six) of the enclosed LEEP Study Report (Annexure II).(f) The MMLPs under Bharatmala Pariyojana are conceived on a ‘Hub & Spoke’ Model and through a thorough Origin & Destination Analysis of cargo flow across the National Highways Grid of the Country, spread across a variety of Industrial, Export-Import (EXIM), Manufacturing and Consumer Hubs of the country. The above parameters were studied during the LEEP Study and the 35 Locations have been derived basis the rationale. List of MMLPs enclosed as Annexure I.(g)  An overlay of INR 100,000 Crores is approved by the CCEA for the National Corridor Efficiency Improvement component of the Bharatmala Pariyojana and the development of MMLPs is being undertaken as part of this allocation. So far, MoRT&H has accorded sanction of INR 794 Crores towards MMLPs, which may be broken down as below:S. No.	Description of Allocation	Fund Sanctioned (INR Crores)	Expenditure as on Feb 2021 (INR Crores)1	Construction of first MMLP at Jogighopa, Assam through NHIDCL	694	23.262	Initial Grant by MoRT&H to ‘National Highway Logistics Management Limited (NHLML)’, a company incorporated under NHAI by renaming ‘Cochin Port Road Company Limited (CPRCL)’, which is a 100% subsidiary of NHAI	100	-
