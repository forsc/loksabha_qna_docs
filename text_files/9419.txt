ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d)  Ministry of Jal Shakti has drafted bills namely National Water Framework Bill, River Basin Management (RBM) Bill and Model Bill to ‘Regulate and Control the Development and Management of Ground Water’ for bringing reforms in water sector.The draft RBM Bill proposes optimum development of inter-State rivers by facilitating inter-State coordination ensuring scientific planning of land and water resources taking basin/sub-basin as unit with unified perspectives of water in all its forms (including soil moisture, ground and surface water). The draft RBM Bill was circulated to all States/Union Territories, concerned Central Government’s Ministries/Departments for pre-legislative consultations. In addition, the Bill was also uploaded on the website of the Ministry for consultation with public at large. Subsequently, in order to reach consensus among the States/UTs on the Bill, a one day Brainstorming Session/Conference was also held on 03.06.2019 for discussion on the RBM Bill among the stake holders.The National Water Framework Bill provides an overarching national legal framework based on principles for protection, conservation, regulation and management of water as a vital and stressed natural resource, under which legislation and executive action on water can take place at all levels of governance. The draft National Water Framework Bill has been circulated to States/UTs and the concerned Central Ministries for obtaining their views/comments.Ministry has also circulated a Model Bill to ‘Regulate and Control the Development and Management of Ground Water’ to all the States/UTs to enable them to enact suitable ground water legislation for regulation for its development which includes provision of rain water harvesting. So far, 15 States/UTs have adopted and implemented the ground water legislation on the lines of Model Bill. *****
