                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) has been encouraging diversified production of crops such as rice, wheat, pulses, coarse cereals, nutri cereals, commercial crops & oilseeds under National Food Security Mission (NFSM). Horticultural crops are promoted under Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH). In addition, Crop Diversification Programme (CDP), a sub scheme of Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), is being implemented in original green revolution states viz. Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh to diversify paddy area towards alternative crops and shifting of tobacco farming to alternative crops/cropping system in tobacco growing states.             Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) conducts extensive research and technology validation through farmers’ participatory research on cropping systems under AICRP-Integrated Farming Systems (AICRP-IFS) in 25 States/Union Territory with the participation of 34 State Agricultural Universities, 6 ICAR Institutes and 1 Central University. Training of farmers and awareness on crop diversification is also undertaken through on-farm research centres in 32 districts of 21 States under the scheme. The studies carried out under the aegis of AICRP-IFS at research farms of 37 centres, representing different agro-climatic regions of the country, during past two decades have indicated that under assured irrigated conditions there is ample scope to include pulses, vegetables, oilseeds and other high value crops.  Contd….2/-- 2 -The farmers are educated on latest crop production technologies, harvesting, marketing etc to choose appropriate crops/cropping system through demonstrations at farmers field, farmer field school, training, kisan melas, conferences, seminars and electronic mass media. Beside, crop related advisories are sent to the registered farmers through Short Message Service (SMS) on mKisan Portal. Information on weather, market, various farm operations, outbreak of pest and disease incidence and their control measures are also given to farmers through SMS.           Further, DAC&FW has launched Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF), a Central Sector Scheme, under Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan for creation of infrastructure at the farm gate through investment in viable projects for post-harvest management infrastructure and community farming assets through interest subvention and financial support.*********
