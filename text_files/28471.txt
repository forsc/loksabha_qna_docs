ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (e)      Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP), now called as Scheduled Tribe Component (STC), is a dedicated source of fund for tribal development. STC is a multi-pronged strategy which includes support for education, health, sanitation, water supply, livelihood, employment generation etc. Major part of infrastructure development in tribal dominated areas and provision of basic amenities to tribal people in the country is carried out through various schemes / programmes of concerned Central Ministries and the State Governments concerned, while the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) provides additive to these initiatives by way of plugging gaps. Name of the schemes alongwith allocation of funds therefor by different Central Ministries / Departments are reflected in the Union Budget as Statement 10B which is laid on the table of the House. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs strives to achieve inclusive and sustainable growth of tribal population in the country including Rajasthan. The Centrally Sponsored Schemes/Grants administered by the Ministry which, inter-alia, supports livelihood and employment generation for tribal population are under: 1        Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS)2         Grant-in-aid under Article 275(1) of the Constitution3.        Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)  Apart from above, the list of schemes of other Central Ministries / Department, which are relevant for provision of livelihood and employment generation is at Annexure 1. Funds available under the relevant scheme(s) are provided to the States to achieve the defined objectives catering to socio-economic development of ST people. Ministry of Tribal Affairs has not received any adverse report from any State Government regarding the schemes not achieving their objectives. State-wise details of beneficiaries (including Rajasthan) under these schemes are not centrally maintained in the Ministry. However, Ministry of Tribal Affairs has recently developed an online portal (https://grants.tribal.gov.in/adigram) to capture physical and financial progress including beneficiary details under various schemes being administered. Besides, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, through TRIFED and NSTFDC, is implementing the following programmes/Schemes which specifically cater to the livelihood needs of the tribal population:1.	Mechanism for Marketing of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) through Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Development of Value Chain for MFP. 2.	 Institutional Support for Development & Marketing of Tribal Products/Produce3.	 Equity Support to National Scheduled Tribes Finance and Development Corporation (NSTFDC)/ State Tribal Finance and Development Corporations (STFDCs) Van Dhan Vikas Karyakram, an initiative under the Scheme ‘Mechanism for Marketing of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) through Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Development of Value Chain for MFP’, targets livelihood generation for tribals by harnessing the wealth of forest i.e. Van Dhan. Under this programme, it is envisaged to set-up tribal community owned Minor Forest Produce centric multi-purpose Kendras in predominantly tribal districts. The Kendras would act as common facility centres for procurement cum value addition to locally available Minor Forest Produce. Value addition of raw produce is expected to increase the value of the MFP considerably and consequently the income of the gatherers. State-wise details of beneficiaries (including Rajasthan) under these schemes are at Annexure 2.
