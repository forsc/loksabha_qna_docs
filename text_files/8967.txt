ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) : The Hon’ble MPs identified 703 Gram Panchayats across the country under Phase-I of SAGY. Further, 500 Gram Panchayats were taken up under Phase-II, 290 Gram Panchayats under Phase-III and 203 Gram Panchayats under Phase-IV for development under SAGY as per the data available on SAGY website (saanjhi.gov.in) as on 27 November 2019. The State-wise and Phase-wise number of Gram Panchayats identified for development under SAGY by the Hon’ble Members of Parliament is given in Annexure.(b) : The Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana utilises resources available from a range of existing Government Schemes and Programmes, including Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) and CSR funds in a convergent manner to achieve the programme objectives. Data on funds utilised through MPLADS, CSR and otherwise for the development of villages adopted by Hon''ble Members of Parliament under SAGY are not maintained centrally. (c) : The scheme Guidelines have been prepared in 14 languages ( English, Hindi, Gujarati, Kannada, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu, Malayalam, Assamese, Kashmiri, Konkani and Oriya) and distributed to all the stakeholders with a view to achieve its intended objectives. As per the Guidelines, the responsibility of implementing the SAGY largely depends on the functionaries concerned at different levels. As the entire programme is implemented in convergence model, the District Collector plays a significant role. In the SAGY guideline, as per component 10 (d) ‘the District Collector is the nodal officer for implementing SAGY. The Members of Parliament concerned chair the review meetings. The heads of the GPs concerned are also invited for these monthly meetings’. Also, the Ministry has provided training on preparation of village development plan and the approaches to convergence to the Charge Officers who are coordinating the implementation at the local level and are fully responsible and accountable for the implementation. The Ministry has prepared compendium on SAGY that contains supporting material that helps the various stakeholders in the implementation of SAGY and the same has been distributed among the participants of the said training programme. Also, the Ministry has published a compilation titled ‘Samanvay’ containing 223 central and 1,806 state schemes available for village development for the benefit of SAGY Gram Panchayats. The SAGY Guidelines, Clause no 12(b) mentioned that State Level Empowered Committee (SLEC) on SAGY headed by the Chief Secretary is to coordinate and ensure seamless convergence of schemes among different State Government Departments. Though the elements of an Adarsh Gram is context specific, the clause No 7 of SAGY guidelines provide the broadly identified important activities for the reference of the officials. (d) : The Gram Panchayats identified under SAGY prepare Village Development Plans (VDP) through a participatory process under the guidance of Hon’ble Members of Parliament. The VDP includes prioritised time-bound activities to achieve holistic progress of the village. So far, 1,327 Gram Panchayats have uploaded their VDPs containing 70,008 projects on the SAGY website (http://saanjhi.gov.in). Out of these, implementation of 42,483 (61%) projects have been completed as per the information available on the SAGY website (saanjhi.gov.in) as on 27 November 2019.
