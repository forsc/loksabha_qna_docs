ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS [SHRI KIREN RIJIJU]   (a) to (d) The Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports recognizes National Sports Federations (NSFs) at the national level for promotion and development of sports in the country. From the year 2010, the Ministry has introduced a system of annual recognition procedure for the NSFs to ensure transparency and accountability in NSFs. During the current year this exercise has been held up due to outbreak of COVID-19 and country-wide lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. Considering this unprecedented situation arisen due to COVID-19 outbreak and the interest of sports and sportspersons, the Ministry had issued letter dated 02.06.2020 renewing the annual recognition for 2020 provisionally till 30.09.2020 to the recognised NSFs. However, in compliance of the order dated 24.06.2020 passed by Hon’ble High Court of Delhi in Writ Petition (C) No. 195 of 2010 the Ministry on 25.06.2020 had withdrawn the said letter dated 02.06.2020. Subsequently, the Ministry has moved for judicial remedy.  Necessary support is being provided through Sports Authority of India to the Olympic bound athletes and the National Coaching Camps have been resumed for their preparation and training for Tokyo Olympics 2021.  ****
