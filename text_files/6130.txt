Hence, the Ministry of AYUSH does not maintain any data on participation of other countries. However, the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) has supported Yoga-related events in 172 countries on the International Day of Yoga, 2019. (c):     Yes. The Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga (MDNIY), New Delhi, an autonomous institute of Ministry of AYUSH conducted Common Yoga Protocol Classes for Diplomats and their family members at Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra, Chanakyapuri. More than 100 people participated in and benefited from the activity.  (d):      The theme selected on the occasion of the 5th International Day of Yoga (IDY) was   ‘Yoga for Heart Care’. There has been a substantial increase in the number of heart disease cases for the last two decades in India. Practicing Yogasanas on daily basis and inculcating certain asanas into the daily routine minimizes the risk of heart diseases. Hence this theme was selected, considering its relevance to the lives of large sections of the population.…………………..
