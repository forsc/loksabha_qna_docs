                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)-Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN) in 2016 for promotion of Regional Connectivity by way of revival of un-served and underserved airports/airstrips, helipads of the State Governments, Airports Authority of India, Civil Enclaves & CPSUs through a budgetary support of Rs.4500 crore.The existing airstrip at Ulundurpet was listed under the RCS. However, RCS is a demand driven scheme and Government of India has not received any demand from the airline operators for operationalization of airport at Ulundurpet in Villupuram district of Tamil Nadu. However, bids were received for commencement of flights from Neyveli Airstrip (under RCS-UDAN scheme) which is barely 24 Kms aerial distance from Ulundurpet airstrip.
