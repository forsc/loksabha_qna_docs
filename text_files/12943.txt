ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) to (e): Some of the unions of Public Sector Bank (PSB) employees went on strike on 31.1.2020 and 1.2.2020 in support of their employment condition related demands for, inter alia, wage revision settlement, five-day banking, improvements sought in pension benefits, etc. Such employment condition related matters are considered by the banks themselves, whose managements also directly engage with employee unions in this regard on an ongoing basis. The impact of such demands is felt only in the event of a demand being acceded to. In the event of employees union giving a call for strike, bank management and employee unions try to resolve issues through mutual discussions. Banks take suitable steps to ensure smooth operations during periods of strike so that customers and business are not adversely impacted. Government also advises banks to take appropriate steps to maintain banking operations during the strike and avoid inconvenience to the general public, including adequate loading of cash in ATMs, ensuring operation of clearing houses, internet banking and core banking solution, etc. 	As regards loss, it is stated that PSBs have posted net profit of Rs. 507 crore in the first three quarters of the current financial year.***
