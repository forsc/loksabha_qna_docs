The Consumer Protection (e-commerce) Rules, 2020 were issued on July 23, 2020 to provide for consumer grievance redressal and to clearly delineate liability and responsibilities of e-commerce platforms. (c) & (d):	 Considering the cross-cutting nature of e-Commerce, different laws and regulations across sectors govern the present e-Commerce activities. The FDI Policy defines e-commerce as the buying and selling of goods and services, including digital products over digital and electronic network. This is akin to the definition prescribed in the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. The Central Government vide Gazette Notification No. 817(E) dated August 28, 2018 had published the draft      e-pharmacy rules wherein “sale by way of e-pharmacy” is defined as a sale whether to a hospital or dispensary or a medical, educational or research institute or to any other person through e-pharmacy by way of retail sale.  These Rules are under  Stakeholder consultations.******
