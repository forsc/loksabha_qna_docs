ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL)(a)	Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) is implementing Central Sector Scheme SVAMITVA with the aim to provide the ‘Record of Rights’ to village household owners possessing houses in inhabited areas in villages. Legal ownership rights (Property cards/Title deeds) are issued by mapping of land parcels using drone technology. It is being implemented with the collaborative efforts of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, State Revenue Department, State Panchayati Raj Department and Survey of India (SoI). States need to sign Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with SoI for implementation of the scheme. So far, 29 States, including the State of Rajasthan, have signed MoU with SoI. The Scheme aims to cover all the villages across the country by March 2025.State-wise details of the number of villages to be covered under SVAMITVA scheme till March 2025 is attached at Annexure-I. The progress of implementation and completion of mapping of a particular area under the scheme depends upon various factors like the State establishing the legal framework for Property Cards, availability of drone teams, the State providing proper chuna-marked villages, weather conditions etc. As on 15th December, 2021, the status of implementation of the scheme is attached at Annexure- II.(b)	Yes Sir. As on 15.12.2021, drone flying has been completed in 1,127 villages and 582 Property Cards in 38 villages have been distributed in Rajasthan. There are 183 villages in Jaisalmer, 850 villages in Dausa and 94 villages in Jaipur district where drone flying has been completed. Property Cards, known as Pattas in Rajasthan, have been distributed in only 38 villages in Jaisalmer district.(c)	As per the Framework of the SVAMITVA scheme, the plan is to cover 13,000 villages in 2021-22 and 33,543 villages in 2022-23 in the State of Rajasthan. The number of villages to be covered over a period of time depends upon various factors like the preparedness of the State, utilization of available drone teams and early ground- verification by the State officials, apart from weather conditions. (d)	One objective of the scheme is to facilitate monetization of properties of the citizens of rural India by enabling them to use their property as a financial asset by taking loans and other financial benefits.  Data for grant of property loan through SVAMITVA Scheme is not maintained by the Ministry.(e)	The adjudicating disputes/objections during the survey and certifications process enshrined in the SVAMITVA scheme aims at reducing the number of land related disputes.  It is upto the State Government to prioritise the coverage of any particular area under the scheme within the ambit of the MoU it has entered into with the SoI.***
