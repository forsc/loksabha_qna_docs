ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a):	Under the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), this Department  provides foodgrains to States/UTs for distribution through the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) to the beneficiaries/households covered under the two categories of NFSA, namely Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and Priority Households (PHH).     To minimize the leakages and diversion of the subsidized foodgrains, this Department, in association with all States/UTs, implemented the scheme of ‘End to End Computerization of TPDS Operations’ which inter-alia comprised digitization of ration cards/ beneficiaries’ data, installation of electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices at all Fair Price Shops (FPSs), etc. for transparent distribution of foodgrains to all beneficiaries under NFSA.......2/--2- (b) & (c): 	Under NFSA, this Department allocates foodgrains to States/UTs for distribution to around 80 crore NFSA beneficiaries in the country on a monthly basis. Further, due to Aadhaar seeding and installation of ePoS devices at the FPSs, at present, around 90% of total ePoS transactions in the country are done in a transparent manner through biometric authentication on a monthly basis. All States/UTs have been advised vide letter dated 24/10/2017 that no genuine  beneficiary/household shall be denied from receiving entitled quota of subsidized foodgrains only for want of Aadhaar or due to failure of biometric/Aadhaar authentication due to network/connectivity/linking related issues, other technical reasons or poor biometrics of the beneficiary.  As per provisions of this Department’s Aadhaar Notification dated 8 February 2017, till the Aadhaar is assigned to the beneficiaries, either of the eight identification documents shall be used for identification purpose i.e. (Voter ID Card, PAN Card, Passport, Driving License, Certificate of Identity with photo issued by Gazetted Officer/Tehsildar on official letter head, Address card having Name and Photo issued by Department of Posts,  Kisan Photo Passbook and any other document as specified by State/UT Governments).    Also, the timeline given to all States/UTs for linking of Aadhaar numbers of beneficiaries with their ration cards has been extended up to 31/03/2022.
