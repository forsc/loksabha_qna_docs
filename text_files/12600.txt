In order to supplement their efforts, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes such as Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) etc. under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY). During 2016-17, ninety-nine (99) on-going Major/Medium irrigation projects (and their 7 phases) under PMKSY-AIBP have been prioritized for completion in consultation with States.  Three projects namely, Dhansiri, Champamati and Borolia of Assam State are covered under this scheme. One project namely Champamati is reported almost complete.
