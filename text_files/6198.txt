                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE; MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MINISTER OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????; ??????? ?? ???????????? ??????; ?? ?????? ??????? ????????. ???? ?????(a)	Yes Sir, the Himalayas are witnessing the impact of the climate change and Global Warming in terms of increase in surface temperatures, decrease in the frequency of cold spells, increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme events, etc. in recent years. (b)	Yes Sir, Government is aware that some of the crop fields in the Indian Himalyan Region are snow and glacier fed. However, as of now, water availability, especially in the Indus basin, of which Ladakh is a part, may be adequate to fulfill the current water requirement for crops and has so far not adversely impacted the crops fields.(c)	The mass balance studies conducted for some Himalayan glaciers revealed that majority of Himalayan glaciers are receding or retreating at varying rates because of various reasons including climate change. However, no abnormal trend in recession of glaciers has been observed. The studies have also shown that large glaciers with an area of more than 10 km2 are less likely to get affected appreciably in near future. However, small glaciers of area less than 2 km2 may undergo rapid changes.(d)	The Recession of glaciers is likely to affect the livelihood of the people dependent on water from glaciers in the Himalaya. Government is aware of the emerging scenario and has been taking necessary steps in terms of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures to minimize the adverse impact of climate change.                                                 ********
