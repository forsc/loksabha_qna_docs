ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) to (d):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. ***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3989 BY SHRI R. K. SINGH PATEL TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 17.7.2019 REGARDING DOUBLING/ELECTRIFICATION OF JHANSI-MANIKPUR RAIL LINE.(a)	and (b) The work of doubling of Jhansi-Manikpur and Kherar-Bhimsen (Kanpur) 411 km and Chord line at Mahoba and Khairar (14 km) was included in Budget 2016-17 subject to requisite approvals.   After requisite approvals, Project was sanctioned with cost of  4329.53 crore in March, 2018 and agencies for construction work in Barwasagar-Mauranipur (42.38 km) and Harpalpur-Mahoba  (52.84 km) sections have been finalized.  (c)	and (d)  The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions  of working agencies/contractors etc.  All these factors affects the completion time and cost of the project, which is finally worked out at the completion stage.  Since so far, complete land has not been acquired and handed over by State Government to Railway, therefore, no confirmed time frame can be fixed for completion of project at this stage.	Nevertheless, in the overall interest of the nation and to ensure that projects are completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, Divisional level, Zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues that are obstructing the progress of projects. Railway has also adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects.      	For important projects, capacity enhancement projects, last mile connectivity etc. institutional financing has been done by arranging loan of   1.5 lakh crore, which has increased Railways’  capacity for committed fund provision for essential projects. *****
