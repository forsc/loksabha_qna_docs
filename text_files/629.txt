ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) & (b):	At present there is no proposal to formulate a national policy to deal with destructive earthquakes in the country. However, under the aegis of Bureau of Indian Standard (BIS) [IS 1983 (Part I):2016], seismic hazard of the country has been assessed and a seismic zoning map of India has been prepared. As per this map, the country is grouped into four seismic zones viz. Zone-II, -III, -IV and –V. Of these, Zone V is seismically the most prone region, while Zone II is the least. 	National Centre for Seismology, under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), recently upgraded the Seismological Network with the--2—L.S.US.Q.NO. 459 FOR 25.06.2019state-of-the art systems for monitoring the earthquake activity in and around the country. At present the network has 115 observatories, spread over the country. The earthquake parameters are disseminated to all the user agencies and the disaster management authorities in the least possible time.	Guidelines have also been published by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), Building Materials & Technology Promotion Council (BMTPC) and Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) etc. for the design and construction of earthquake resistant structures to minimize the loss of life and damage to property caused by earthquakes. These guidelines are in wide circulation amongst the public and the administrative authorities responsible for the design and construction of earthquake resistant structures in earthquake prone areas.	National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has also issued the guidelines (i) “National Disaster Management Guidelines – Management of Earthquakes” and (ii) “National Disaster Management Guidelines – Seismic Retrofitting of Deficient Buildings and Structures” for management of disaster risks due to earthquakes and to minimize the damage due to earthquakes of high intensity. ******
