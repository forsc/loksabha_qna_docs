ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  & (b)  National River Conservation Directorate (NRCD) has been supplementing the efforts of the State Governments in abatement of pollution of identified polluted stretches of rivers under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) on cost sharing basis between the Central and State Governments. Under NRCP, projects for pollution abatement of River Cauvery and Vaigai in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have been sanctioned at total cost of Rs.61687.59 lakhs and Rs.12009.40 lakhs respectively.  The works  include creation of 390.76 MLD of Sewage Treatment Capacity along with works of interception & diversion of raw sewage, construction of sewerage systems, setting up of sewage treatment plants, low cost sanitation facilities, electric/improved wood crematoria, river front development etc. Details of projects for pollution abatement of river Cauvery and Vaigai in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu covered under National River Conservation Plan and State-wise details of South Indian rivers covered under NRCP are given at  Annexure I and Annexure II respectively. (c)   The Feasibility Report of the Cauvery – Vaigai – Gundar link project was prepared by National Water Development Agency (NWDA) in the year 2004. The link project envisages diversion of 2,252 MCM of water from the Kattalai barrage through a 255.60 km long gravity canal for irrigating an area of 3.38 lakh ha.  The command area lies in the drought prone districts of Karur, Tiruchirappalli, Pudukottai, Sivaganga, Ramanathapuram, Virudhunagar and Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu.   The Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar link could not be taken up due to non availability of consensus among the States concerned.                                                                                  *****Annexure-IAnnexure referred to in reply of Parts (a) & (b) of Unstarred Question No. 5321 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 25.07.2019 regarding “Projects on River Cauvery and Vaigai”.Projects for pollution abatement of River Cauvery and Vaigai in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu covered under National River Conservation PlanS.
