ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES & PUBLIC ENTERPRISES(SHRI ARVIND GANPAT SAWANT)(a): The National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) 2020 is a National Mission document providing the vision and the roadmap for the faster adoption of electric vehicles and their manufacturing in the country. This plan has been designed to enhance national fuel security, to provide affordable and environmentally friendly transportation and to enable the Indian automotive industry to achieve global manufacturing leadership.       As part of the NEMMP 2020, the Government approved Phase-I of FAME India Scheme in March, 2015 for a period of 2 years w.e.f 01st April, 2015 with an aim to reduce dependency on fossil fuel and to address issues of vehicular emissions. The Scheme has been extended from time to time and the last extension was allowed up to 31st March, 2019.        In this phase, market creation through demand incentives was aimed at incentivizing all vehicle segments i.e. 2-Wheelers, 3-Wheelers Auto, Passenger 4-Wheeler vehicles, Light Commercial Vehicles and Buses.       The demand incentive was available to buyers of electric & hybrid vehicles (xEV) in the form of an upfront reduced purchase price to enable wider adoption. Further, specific projects under Pilot Projects, R&D / Technology Development and Public Charging Infrastructure components were sanctioned by the Project Implementation & Sanctioning Committee (PISC) for extending grant under the different focus areas of the scheme.         Based on outcome and experience gained during the Phase-I of FAME India Scheme and after having consultations with all stakeholders including Industry and Industry Associations, Department of Heavy Industry finalized with the approval of Cabinet and accordingly notified the Phase-II of FAME India Scheme on 8th March 2019, which is for a period of three years commencing from 1st April 2019 with a total budgetary support of Rs. 10,000 crore. This phase will mainly focus on supporting electrification of public & shared transportation, and aims to support through subsidies 7000 e-Buses, 5 lakh e-3 Wheelers, 55000 electric & hybrid (xEV) four Wheeler and 10 lakh e-2 Wheelers. However, privately owned registered e-2W will also be covered under the scheme as a mass segment.         An Expression of Interest (EoI) has been issued on 4th June 2019 inviting proposals from State/UT Government Departments, State/City Transport Undertakings, Municipal Corporations or any other similar Public Entity interested in the deployment of electric buses for public transport in different cities on an Operational Cost Model, for availing incentives under Phase II of FAME India Scheme. (b): Since Automobile is a liberalized sector and 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) by automatic route is permitted in this sector, the Department of Heavy Industry is not mandated to maintain the data related to manufacturing of vehicles, including EVs. However, the Government of India had supported about 2.75 lakhs xEVs through Incentive amounting to Rs. 343 crores (approx.) under FAME India Scheme since inception of the scheme on 01st April, 2015. Also, 465 Buses have been supported under the scheme. (c): Average level of Particulate Matter (pollutant level) is one of the Qualifying Parameters for selection of cities for funding demand incentive for deployment of e-buses through Expression of Interest (EoI), issued by DHI on 4th June 2019. (d): Through support given for purchase of xEVs under the scheme, approximately 48 million litre of fuel have been saved so far.*****
