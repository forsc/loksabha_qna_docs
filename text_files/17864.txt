ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) to (c):  Under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme, the details of the amount disbursed to the eligible beneficiaries of the State of Chhatisgarh year-wise, under various instalments starting from the 4-monthly period December, 2018 to March, 2019 to the current period, August, 2020 to November, 2020 is given below:Financial Year 2018-19   Rs. 22,37,96,000Financial Year 2019-20  Rs. 13,17,57,32,000Financial Year 2020-21 Rs. 7,69,73,96,000 (As on 15-09-2020). Contd…2/--2-The district-wise details of beneficiaries under the Scheme are given at Annexure-1.   The financial benefits have been directly transferred to the Bank Account of the eligible beneficiaries through Direct Benefit Transfer mode.PM-KISAN is a continuous and ongoing scheme, in which the financial benefits are transferred to the bank accounts of the identified beneficiaries as and when their correct and verified data is uploaded by the concerned States / UTs on PM-KISAN web-portal.(d) & (e): Under the PM-KISAN scheme, the saturation level in respect of number of beneficiaries covered has almost been reached by many of the State Governments. An overall saturation level of about 90% for the entire country has been reached, with data of 11.23 crore farmers having been fed into the PM-KISAN system by the State/UT Governments. Notwithstanding, the State Governments have been continuously requested and vigorously pursued for expeditious registration, correction, and uploading of data of remaining beneficiaries, in mission mode and by organizing camps. Frequent and regular meetings are held through Video Conferencing with all State / UT Governments and other concerned stakeholders so as to remove any handicaps coming in the way of smooth and seamless implementation of the scheme. On the advice of the Union Government, the States have been organizing publicity/awareness camps and saturation drives to achieve 100% saturation by enrolling every eligible farmer family of the country.  Further, a special facility has been provided to the farmers in the PM-Kisan portal, namely, ‘Farmers Corner’, through which, farmers can do their self-registration. The Common Service Centres (CSCs) have also been authorized to do registration of the farmers for the Scheme upon payment of minimal fees. A special Mobile APP has also been launched, which provides self-registration facility to the farmers. The only pendency under the scheme so far is the non-implementation of the scheme by the Government of West Bengal so far. This has deprived about 69 lakh farmers in the State of the benefit of the scheme. The State Government has been repeatedly requested at various levels to join the scheme.
