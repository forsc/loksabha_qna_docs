ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) & (b) 	Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has been interacting with Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) and reviewing the progress of their action-plans for addressing call drops in their mobile networks on a continuous basis. 	DoT has taken several policy initiatives to facilitate infrastructure growth for delivery of quality services. These include permitting trading/sharing/ liberalisation of spectrum already granted, permitting passive & active infrastructure-sharing, Notification of Right of Way Rules- 2016, making available government land/buildings for installations of towers etc.As a result of continuous efforts, about 14.95 lakh additional Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) for 2G/3G/4G-LTE services have been added by TSPs since March 2014 taking the total BTS count in the country to about 21.45 lakh in June 2019. Moreover, about 10.97 lakh 2G/3G Cells rectified/optimised by TSPs during July 2016 to April 2019 (in general, one BTS has 03 Cells). Further, in order to obtain direct feedback from subscribers, DoT has launched an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) wherein, around 2.73 Crore subscribers have been individually contacted since December 2016, out of which 38.3 lakh subscribers have participated in the survey. The feedback is shared with the TSPs every week for taking corrective actions in a time bound manner. About 1 lakh individual cases of call drops reported through IVRS, have been resolved so far.	Significant reduction has been observed in number of complaints pertaining to call drops received on Centralised Public Grievance Redressal And Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) in DoT during last three years. The number of complaints received in 2017 was 4534 which is reduced to 1678 in 2018 and 533 for the period from 1st January 2019 to 31st May 2019.Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) in India are required to ensure that the call-drop rate in their mobile networks remain within the benchmarks laid down by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), as the ultimate responsibility for ensuring quality of services to consumers lies with the TSPs.	Significant improvement has been observed in terms of TSPs’ compliance to TRAI’s Quality of Services benchmarks on Drop Call Rate (DCR) in spite of rapid-increase in traffic volume and more stringent TRAI benchmarks effective 1st October 2017. TSPs are mostly complying to these benchmarks.(c)	 For improving the quality of service and to ensure compliance with benchmarks, TRAI has taken the following steps:•	Close monitoring of performance of service providers, against the benchmarks for various Quality of Service parameters including Call drop laid down by TRAI, through periodic reports from service providers.•	Follow up action with service providers for improving quality of service.•	Audit and Assessment of Quality of Service through independent agencies. •	Publication of results of Audit & Assessment of Quality of Service, including for Call Drop parameters on TRAI website namely www.trai.gov.in for information of stakeholders, encourging the service providers to improve its service.•	TRAI regularly undertakes the drive tests of mobile networks in selected cities, highways and railway routes to assess the Quality of Service and coverage around the areas covered in the drive test routes. The results of Drive tests are shared with the service providers and publish on TRAI website namely www.trai.gov.in for information of stakeholders, forcing the service providers to improve its service.•	TRAI is already implementing its plan for undertaking operator assisted drive tests in all the Long-Distance Charging Areas (LDCA) of the country under the supervision of TRAI’s appointed independent agency and officers of TRAI.  This will give an indication of the coverage, voice quality and call drop issues in the various parts of the country so that the service providers could take necessary action to address the problems in those areas.•	Imposition of financial disincentives for non-compliance with the benchmarks for Quality of Service parameters.	The continuous efforts put-in by the Government, TRAI and Telecom Service Providers have resulted in consistent improvement in compliance to Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (TRAI) Quality of Service Benchmarks. Further, Governments initiatives and augmentation in the installation of BTS has resulted in improvement and expansion of mobile phone coverage in the country.
