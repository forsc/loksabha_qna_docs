ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER FOR MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ANDMINISTRY OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a)	& (b) 	No Sir. Government has not estimated the monsoon to be below average during the current year. Both the first stage Long Range Forecast issued on 15th April and the second stage updated Long Range Forecast issued on 31st May 2019 suggest that the monsoon seasonal rainfall 2019 for the country as whole is likely to be near Normal. Quantitatively, the monsoon seasonal rainfall 2019 is likely to be 96% of the Long Period Average (LPA) with a model error of ± 5%; the LPA of the seasonal rainfall over the country as a whole for the period being 89 cms. Copy of the highlights of the forecast is attached herewith as Annexure-I.(c)	Deficiency of rain has not been predicted for southwest monsoon season 2019 by IMD. However, delay in monsoon is onset over Kerala and its progress further has caused deficiency of rainfall in the month of June. State-wise rainfall statistics for June 2019 is given in Annexure-II.(d)	EL-Nino is one of the factors which can impact monsoon rainfall. The current weak El Nino conditions are likely to continue for some time and then to turn to neutral ENSO conditions during the second half of the monsoon season. Moreover, expected positive Indian Ocean Dipole conditions are likely to compensate the negative aspects (if any) of the unfavourable El Nino conditions, making the seasonal rainfall for the country to be near normal as predicted. (e)	India Meteorological Department (IMD) operates dedicated weather and climate monitoring, detection and warning services useful for various sectors of economy. The weather forecasting systems in the country are at par to most of the developed countries in the world. IMD is fully capable for early prediction and issuance of forecasts and warnings of extreme weather phenomena like heavy Rainfall, tropical Cyclones etc. so as to enable disaster managers to minimise loss of life and damage to property.IMD has well established infrastructure for meteorological observations, data exchange, monitoring & analysis, forecasting and warning services using contemporary digital computerized technology. IMD uses a suite of quality observations from Satellites, Radars and conventional & automatic weather stations for monitoring weather developments. It includes INSAT 3D, 3DR and SCATSAT satellites, Doppler Weather Radars (DWRs) along the coast, automated weather stations (AWS), automatic rain gauges (ARGs), meteorological buoys and ships.Under National Monsoon Mission, MoES has implemented two state of the art dynamical prediction systems for short, medium &extended range forecasts and seasonal forecasts. All these initiatives have helped to improve the accuracy of forecast.The recent upgradation of the High Performance Computing Systems with Mihir and Pratyush commissioned in the recent past has helped in the implementation of the following numerical models which would further refine weather forecasting.•	Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS) at a very high a resolution of 12 km to provide forecast upto 7 days (from 1st June, 2018). •	The Unified Model (UM) and Unified Model Ensemble Prediction System (UMEPS) to provide forecast upto 7 days with 12 km resolution (from 1st June, 2018). In addition to this, IMD also runs cyclone specific multi-nested Hurricane Weather Research & Forecast (HWRF) Model with a resolution of 18 km, 6 km and 2 km for cyclone track and intensity prediction. Upgradation of the forecasting system is a continuous process in IMD with respect to weather monitoring and analysis, forecasting and warning services along with high-end computing and networking infrastructure including effective dissemination system.
