ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) & (b) :	The details of power generation & plant load factor (PLF) of thermal Stations of 25 MW and above in the country during the current year 2019-20 (upto January 2020) is given at Annexure.The generation capacity is created considering the peak demand, because of which there will always be some idle capacity. The PLF/generation of thermal, (coal/lignite based) Stations depends on total electricity demand in the country and generation from various other sources like Hydro, Nuclear, Gas and Renewables etc. Renewable Energy projects have been accorded “Must Run Status” and therefore get dispatched on priority and are generally fully utilized. The hydro power plants are generally fully utilized. The utilization of coal/lignite based plants depends on balance generation required from thermal Stations and the position of the particular plant in the merit order. For these reasons, the thermal Stations do not operate on full capacity.(c) : 		Several measures have been undertaken to relieve stressed power projects. These include amendments to the existing policy and legal issues regarding fuel and commercial linkages between the various stakeholders. Also, there are ongoing Renovation & Modernisation (R&M)/Life Extension (LE) interventions to enhance the capacity or improve the efficiency of the plants already engaged in power generation.***********
