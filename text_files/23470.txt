The vacancies in the service are caused due to factors such as retirement, resignation, death, removal from service etc. resulting into deficit in the cadre. Accordingly, each cadre demands its requirement of IPS officers every year. Allocation of IPS officers, recruited through Civil Service Examination, is made to all the cadres keeping in view the demand and deficit weight of IPS officers in all the cadres annually. *****
