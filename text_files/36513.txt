BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (e): Formulary medicines are sufficiently available in AYUSH dispensaries/ units under Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS). Purchase of medicines through Authorized Local Chemists (ALCs) is made only in case of those medicines prescribed by specialists outside the formulary.

Medical reimbursement facility under the scheme is decentralized. Payment to the serving beneficiaries is made by the concerned Ministry/ Department from its own Budget Head. Payment to the pensioner beneficiaries is made by CGHS. However, bifurcation thereof into AYUSH and Allopathy is not maintained under the scheme. Opening of 53 AYUSH units (26 Ayurvedic and 27 Homeopathic) in the country is approved by Government. Details thereof are as under: -Ayurvedic units: Guwahati, Vishakhapatnam, Gandhinagar, Faridabad, Shimla, Jammu, Ranchi, Bhopal, Jabalpur, Indore, Shillong, Dehradun, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Indirapuram, Noida, Sahibabad and Chandigarh Raipur, Puducherry, Aizawl, Agartala, Panaji, Gangtok, Imphal, Itanagar.Homeopathic units: Visakhapatnam, Gandhinagar, Faridabad, Gurugram, Shimla, Jammu, Ranchi, Bhopal, Jabalpur, Indore, Shillong, Dehradun, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Indirapuram, Noida, Sahibabad, Chandigarh, Bhubaneshwar, Raipur, Puducherry, Aizawl, Agartala, Panaji, Gangtok, Imphal, Itanagar.
