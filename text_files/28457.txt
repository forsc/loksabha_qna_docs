TheKVs are opened primarily to cater to the educational needs of the children oftransferable Central Government employees including Defence & Para-Militarypersonnel, Central Autonomous Bodies, Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs)and Central Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) by providing a common programme ofeducation. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored byMinistries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / UnionTerritories (UTs) Administrations and committing resources for setting up a new KV.The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities found fulfilling themandatory pre-requisites for opening of new KVs have to compete with other suchproposals under the “Challenge Method” and also subject to approval of the competentauthority.(c) & (d) At present, 63 KVs (including 04 KVs in Sundargarh District) are functioning inthe State of Odisha. Proposal for opening of a new KV in Sundargarh District has notbeen received by KVS.
