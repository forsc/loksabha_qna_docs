ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) & (b) Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) aims to establish All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in all the States in the Country in a phased manner. Apart from 22 new AIIMS, which have been sanctioned under PMSSY since its inception, proposals for setting up AIIMS at other places have also been received.  AIIMS are set up in various parts of the country keeping in view gaps in tertiary healthcare infrastructure in different parts of the country.(c) & (d) The diagnosis of all presumptive positive cases of Nipah virus disease is confirmed only after repeating the test at ICMR-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. Therefore, a linelist of positive cases is maintained at ICMR-NIV as well as the state government of Kerala. Data related to signs and symptoms, antigen and antibody positivity and outcome of patients is available. In addition, studies related to positivity of Nipah virus infection in bats in regions from where cases are reported, studies to determine the risk factors for acquisition of disease as well as serosurveys in primary and secondary contacts of Nipah cases have been conducted by ICMR- NIV and National Institute of Epidemiology (NIE), Chennai to understand the proportion of asymptomatic infections. Results of these studies have been pivotal in guiding the public health policies.(e) & (f) ICMR has taken the following steps to enable early detection of Nipah virus disease cases in Kerala:- ICMR recently worked with the Govt. of Kerala to modify the algorithm of surveillance of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) in Kerala to make the surveillance platform sensitive for early detection of cases of Nipah virus disease. - Periodic surveys of bats in Kerala and other high risk states of India to estimate the antigen and antibody positivity for Nipah virus are conducted by ICMR-NIV, Pune.- ICMR-NIV validated the point-of-care TrueNat test for Nipah and the test has now been accorded emergency use authorization by CDSCO. This has enabled on-site testing for Nipah even at district hospitals in Kerala where TrueNat machines are installed either for TB or COVID-19.***********
