                                                        The MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN) (a) to (e) The spread of COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on school education. Schools in many States and Union Territories were closed as a precautionary measure to protect the students from Novel COVID-19 (Corona) virus. This has interrupted the learning and led to disruption of education system in the country. However, during COVID-19 Pandemic, Ministry of Education held continuous consultations with the States and UTs at various levels to assess the various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has conducted a survey in the month of July, 2020 with the help of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS), Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) and Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to understand the scenario of Online Learning of school students in COVID-19 pandemic situation.Accordingly, Pragyata guidelines on digital education were issued with a focus on the methodology, time spent, etc. for online/blended/digital education for students who arepresently at home due to the closure of schools. The guidelines provides sufficient Do’s and Don’ts regarding ergonomics and cyber safety. The guidelines are available at :https://mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/pragyata-guidelines_0.pdfTo provide psychosocial support to students, teachers and families for mental health and emotional well-being during the COVID outbreak and beyond, the Ministry of Education (MoE) undertook an initiative, named, ‘MANODARPAN’, covering a wide range of activities. A Working Group, having experts from the fields of education, mental health and psychosocial issues as its members, was set up to monitor and promote the mental health issues and concerns of students and to facilitate providing of support to address the mental health and psychosocial aspects during and after COVID-19 lockdown, through counselling services, online resources and helpline.Under the extraordinary circumstances, the Central Government decided to provide Mid-Day Meal to meet the nutritional requirements of the eligible children under Mid-Day Meal Scheme in order to safeguard their immunity. The State Governments and Union Territories were advised to provide to every eligible child, hot cooked Mid-Day Meal or Food Security Allowance, consisting of quantity of the food grains as per entitlement of the child and cooking cost prevailing in the State, whichever is feasible, till such time their schools are closed due to Novel COVID-19 (Corona) Virus and also during summer vacation in 2020-21. ****
