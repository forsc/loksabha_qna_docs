ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	The estimated number of landholdings based on the Agri Census-2015-16 data in Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand, are approximately 83,90,136 and 25,55,726 respectively. Eligibility of farmers to join the PM-Kisan Scheme is determined by the respective State/UT Governments on the basis of Operational Guidelines of the Scheme. The District wise information is at annexure-1.(b):	8,44,72,629 farmers have been benefitted under the Scheme as on 06-02-2020 and payments of Rs. 50,522.2 Crore have been made to them in various installments.(c) & (d):	Registration of farmers for this scheme and subsequent installment-wise transfer of benefits to them is a continuous and ongoing process. The transfer of benefits to the identified eligible beneficiaries takes place as and when their correct and verified data are uploaded by the concerned State / UT Governments on PM-Kisan web-portal www.pmkisan.gov.in.Contd….2/-- 2 -The data of beneficiaries   uploaded by the State / UT Governments undergoes a multi-level verification and validation by various concerned agencies, including the banks, which includes rejection of data for errors at various levels and re-uploading of error-free data by the State / UT Governments. Thereafter only the amount is successfully transferred into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. This entire process is replicated for transfer of every installment.The reasons for non-payment of benefits to the eligible farmer families include mismatch of names in land records and Aadhaar Cards, failure in Account validation at the PFMS level due to reasons like wrong Account number, wrong IFSC etc. To release benefits to these farmer families, the data that needs to be corrected has been opened for correction to States/UTs. In addition, the facility of Aadhaar correction by the beneficiary has been provided on the PM-KISAN portal and for this purpose, Common Service Centres (CSCs) have also been authorized.On the advice of the Union Government, the States have organized Publicity/Awareness Camps to ensure expeditious Aadhaar authentication of the data of the beneficiaries along with new registrations and correction of already registered data.
