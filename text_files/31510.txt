                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)       The Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G) is being implemented w.e.f. 01.04.2016 in rural areas across the country with the objective to provide 2.95 crore houses under the programme. The salient features of PMAY-G are given as under:-i.	Identification and selection of beneficiaries are based on the housing deficiency and other social deprivation parameters prescribed in Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC)-2011 and new survey Awaas+ 2018 conducted to identify left out eligible households. The data is subject to verification by Gram Sabha and an appellate process.ii.	The minimum unit size of house is 25 square metres including a dedicated area for hygienic cooking.iii.	Unit assistance of Rs.1.20 lakh in plains and Rs.1.30 lakh in hilly states, difficult areas and IAP districts.iv.	The fund sharing pattern under PMAY-G between Central and State Government is in the ratio of 60:40 except in case of the UT of Jammu & Kashmir, North-Eastern States and Hilly States, wherein the sharing pattern is 90:10. In respect of UTs (including Ladakh), 100% funding is by the Central Government. v.	Assistance (Rs.12,000/-) is provided for construction of toilets through convergence with Swacch Bharat Mission–Gramin (SBM-G), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) or any other dedicated source of funding.vi.	Provision of 90/95 persondays of un-skilled labour wage under MGNREGA for construction of house, over and above the unit assistance.vii.	Convergence with other Government Schemes for provision of basic amenities viz., toilet, drinking water, electricity, clean & efficient cooking fuel, treatment of social and liquid waste etc.viii.	Focus on construction of quality houses by the beneficiaries using local materials, appropriate designs and trained masons. (b)        The Central Assistance under PMAY-G is released directly to the State considering State as a unit. Further release of these funds to beneficiaries in various districts is done by the respective State/UT Governments. Therefore, the district level data related to funds sanctioned, allocated and utilized is not maintained at the Ministry level. However, the details of the funds sanctioned and utilized under this Scheme by the State of Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan in entirety during the last three years and current year is given as under:                                                                                  (Rs. in crore)State	      2018-19	            2019-20	         2020-21	       2021-22 (as on                                                                                  08.12.2021)	      GoI     Utilization*  GoI    Utilization*     GoI    Utilization*    GoI   Utilization*             Release		   Release		   Release                Release		 Tamil Nadu   502.80   1353.68	  487.52     996.93	   78.62    672.61	   0.00	    389.11Rajasthan   2340.13   3159.20	 2933.34    2923.49	 1108.59   3679.45	 639.50	    921.39*including State Share (c)        The details of the number of houses sanctioned and constructed under PMAY-G in Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan including in Shriganganagar and Hanumangarh districts during the last three years and the current year, year, State and district-wise is given in Annexure-I.  (d)   	A total target 2,62,89,083 houses have been allocated to different States/UTs under PMAY-G.  Out of this, 2,13,31,041 houses have been sanctioned to beneficiaries and 1,65,93,678 houses have been completed as on 8.12.2021.  (e) & (f) The achieving of target of “Housing for All” by 2022 has been affected by certain unforeseeable circumstances. During the period of Covid-19 pandemic induced nation-wide lockdown, all construction activities including construction of houses under PMAY-G were also affected which retarded the pace of construction of PMAY-G houses. Besides, the delays are also due cases of unwillingness of beneficiaries, migration, disputed succession of deceased beneficiaries, delay in allotment of land to landless beneficiaries by the States/UTs and at times also due to General, Assembly and Panchayat elections in various States. The Ministry is taking the following initiatives to ensure timely completion of the houses under PMAY-G for achieving the target of Housing for all:i.	Regular review of progress at the level of Ministry to ensure timely completion of targeted houses. ii.	The States/UTs have been requested to expedite the completion of houses approved under PMAY-G with specific focus and priority of houses for which 2nd and 3rd instalments have been released. iii.	Daily monitoring on various parameters like Gaps in sanction of houses, cleaning of PWL of PMAY-G and release of Central Share/State Matching Share from treasury to SNA.iv.	Timely allocation of targets to the States/UTs and release of adequate funds at the level of the Ministry.v.	Promotion of eco-friendly & innovative technologies for house construction. vi.	Regular follow ups with the States to ensure release of central and state share of the scheme and provision of land to landless beneficiaries in rural areas.vii.	Expeditious resolution of technical issues and other constraints faced by the States.viii.	Steps are being taken to increase the coverage of Rural Mason Training (RMT) programme which would increase the availability of trained masons leading to faster construction of quality houses.ix.	Awards to the best performing States/UTs, Districts based on performance index dashboard, thereby creating healthy competition and motivation among the States/UTs for achieving the set targets. *****
