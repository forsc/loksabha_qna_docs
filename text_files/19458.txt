                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (d):	Yes, Sir. The Government is aware about the health issues and other challenges faced by the migrant workers during pandemic. In this context, it is pertinent to mentioned that The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 notified on 29th September, 2020 and commonly known as OSH Code, contains legal provisions for decent working conditions, minimum wages, grievances redressal mechanisms, protection from abuse and exploitation, enhancement of the skills and social security to all categories of organised and unorganised workers including migrant workers.  The Code is applicable to every establishment in which 10 or more inter-state migrant workers are employed or were employed on any day of the preceding twelve months.    To address the health issues of migrant workers, Advisory Guidelines have been issued to all the States and UTs which inter-alia provides to ensure screening and testing of migrant workers as per the protocol devised by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in respect of COVID – 19 and provide face masks, sanitizer and soaps at the premises or work sites.*******
