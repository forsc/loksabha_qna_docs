ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	Several reports from various organisations in the UN system have periodically considered the potential increase in global temperatures. The extent of such increase can be limited depending on the extent to which all countriesare able to reduce or control the increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. There is a significant probability of global temperature increase of 3 to 5°C, compared to pre-industrialization levels, occurring by the end of the century if collectively the world cannot curb GHG emissions.  Climate change is a global phenomenon and requires action from all countries based on the principles of ‘Equity’ and ‘Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities’. Reports from various sources including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlight that the challenges faced due to global warming are mainly due to cumulative historical and current greenhouse gas emissions of the developed countries.(b) and (c)	The inclusion of sustainable lifestyles as well climate justice in the preamble of the Paris Agreement was ensured by India for bringing these ideas to the centre of climate action.India has communicated Nationally Determined Contributions to the UNFCCC in 2015 with the first NDC goal being “To put forward and further propagate a healthy and sustainable way of living based on traditions and values of conservation and moderation.” Goal 2 of the NDC is “To adopt a climate friendly and a cleaner path than the one followed hitherto by others at corresponding level of economic development.” Keeping these goals in mind, the Government has taken several initiatives to educate/create awareness for people towards adopting a environment-friendly lifestyle.Some of the key initiatives of the Government in this regard in the national arena include the National Green Corps, which aims at building a cadre of young children working towards environmental conservation and sustainable development, including climate change. As a part of the initiative, approximately 160,000 Eco clubs are functioning across the country, making it one of the largest environmental networks that enable activities on relevant issues connecting children, youth, and the general public. The Government has also launched a School Nursery Yojana to involvestudentsin planting and growing saplings in nurseries in the schools. Further,‘Green Good Deeds’ campaign is a societal movement launched to protect the environment and promote sustainable lifestyles across the country.India’s other bigclimate change awareness programme was the ‘Science Express Climate Action Special Train’ (SECAS) – a mobile exhibition on climate change aimed to create awareness among various sections of society, especially students. Millions of people, mainly students, visited the train withtheir participation in the climate change awareness programme at the Railway platforms. To promote sustainable lifestyles, sustainable production and consumption, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has brought out three knowledge products, namely, (i) Parampara India’s Culture of Climate Friendly Sustainable Practices (2015) (ii) Low Carbon Lifestyles - Right Choices For Our Planet (2016), and (iii) Samanvay Harmonizing Traditions and Modernity (2017) (http://moef.gov.in/division/environment-divisions/climate-changecc-2/natcom/).***
