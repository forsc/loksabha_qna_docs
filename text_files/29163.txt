ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE (SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a)	 to (d) : Gender  justice is an important commitment of the Government.  The issue involved needs careful consideration on the basis of the consensus among all political parties before a Bill for amendment in the Constitution is brought before Parliament.	  In the past three Bills were introduced in the Parliament on the said subject which lapsed due to one reason or the other.    As per Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy document, all the draft legislations are to be published/ placed in public domain in such manner as specified by the Department/Ministry concerned for pre-legislation consultation.	However, an exception has been carved out in the document that if the Department/Ministry concerned is of the view that it is not feasible or desirable to hold pre-legislative consultation, it may record the reasons in the note for the Cabinet*******
