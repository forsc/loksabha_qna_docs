The existing legal provisions such as mandatory disclosures, accountability of the CSR Committee and the Board, provisions for statutory audit of accounts of the company etc. provide sufficient safeguards for implementation of CSR by the companies. Whenever any violation of CSR provisions is reported, action against such non-compliant Companies are initiated as per provisions of the Act after due examination of records and following due process of law. *****                                                                                     Annexure-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3154 FOR 15.03.2021Development Sector	FY 2015-16Amount Spent (INR Cr.)
