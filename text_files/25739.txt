ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS (SHRI DEVUSINH CHAUHAN)(a) & (b) 	Department of Telecommunications has not published any such ranking report. No authentic information is available with the Department on the global mobile internet speed ranking.	However, there are many mobile apps providers which measure internet speed. According to White Paper on Measurement of Wireless Data Speeds published by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) in February 2018, the measurement methodology adopted by different app providers may differ and there is possibility of variations in the measured values or reported values of internet speed. Different measurement methodology adopted and processing approaches may give different results.TRAI has been monitoring the performance of service providers against the benchmark for various Quality of Service parameters laid down by TRAI by way of Quality of Service regulations issued from time to time, through Quarterly Performance Monitoring Reports(PMRs) prescribing the benchmarks submitted by service providers. The performance is reported license area-wise and the performance is accessed for the license service area as a whole. As per PMR reports all the service providers have met the benchmarks related to Broadband speed, Packet Loss & Network Latency in the periods Quarter Ending March-2020, June-2020 and September-2020(except Digital Satellite Connect Pvt. Ltd. in Maharashtra (download speed) in March, 2020). The PMRs are published in public domain on TRAI websites.As the parameters are accessed over the entire license service area on an average basis, there can be few areas or few days where some users might be experiencing poor quality although ISP’s have met the benchmarks.Further, TRAI has been obtaining crowd-sourced Data about download and upload speed for different service providers for different wireless technologies through crowd sourcing using the TRAI MySpeed App and the reports are available to the public on TRAI website-“MySpeed” Portal. The portal is interactive and presents the information in a visual manner.The Government always endeavours to improve the Quality of Services and speed of internet.******
