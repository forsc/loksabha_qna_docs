ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (d): Jet Airways (India) Limited reported aggregated losses during last few quarters which eroded its liquidity and jeopardized its ability to sustain its operations. As a result there were significant overdues towards all creditors including the lessors of the aircrafts, pilots, suppliers, oil companies etc.;Due to the suspension of operation by Jet Airways, large number of employees of different category working with the airline have been adversely affected. Each airline prepares its business plan on the basis of its own market assessment and liabilities. Mobilizing financial resources and ensuring efficient operations as per business plans are the responsibility of the airline. Government of India has no role in raising funds for M/s Jet Airways (India) Limited, as it is an internal matter of the airline. State Bank of India has filed an application under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC), which has been admitted by National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai on 20th June, 2019 to work out a resolution plan under the said code. Revival of the airlines is now possible only under IBC.
