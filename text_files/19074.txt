                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                                         (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)	to (d) The total area of land for public use that has been notified to restricted Government use to implement the Central Vista Project is NIL. The Central Government offices are permitted use in  Public and Semi-Public Facilities (PSP) land use zones, vide Notification S.O.3348(E) dated 17.10.2017. In view of the said notification, the land use of four plots from Public/ Semi-Public (Socio Cultural) to Government Office use have been carried out.  These plots are mostly being used at present for Government Office purpose only. There were 1,292 representations received by DDA which broadly included objections with regard to grant of Environmental Clearance, Change of Land Use, conservation of heritage, current economic scenario and COVID-19 health emergency. All representations and suggestions were duly considered.(e) & (f) There is no link between withdrawal of Delhi’s candidature as a UNESCO World Heritage Site with Central Vista Project as the withdrawal was done in the year 2015 and the Central Vista Project has been conceived in 2019.                                                *****
