This has been possible due to resolute implementation of the National Policy and Action Plan to combat LWE which was launched by the Government of India (GoI) in 2015. There has been an overall 77% reduction in violent incidents (from all time high of 2258 in 2009 to 509 in 2021) and 85% reduction in LWE related deaths (from all time high of 1005 in 2010 to 147 in 2021) in the country.   The number of security forces personnel killed in LWE related violence has reduced by 84% from all time-2-L.S.US.Q.NO.4168 FOR 29.03.2022 high of 317 in 2009 to 50 in 2021 and the number of civilian deaths has also gone down by 86% from all time high of 720 in 2010 to 97 in 2021. The geographical spread of LWE has also reduced from all time high of 464 Police Stations in 96 districts affected by LWE reporting violence in 2010 to 191 Police Stations in 46 districts in 2021.  (b) & (c):	Improvement of telecommunication connectivity in LWE affected areas has been one of the major initiatives by the GoI wherein GoI has implemented scheme to provide mobile connectivity in LWE affected areas. Apart from providing mobile services to the people of the area and security forces deployed there, the scheme will give impetus to                  e-governance activities, digital economy, employment opportunities, educational opportunities etc. 2343 mobile towers were installed under Phase – I of this project and approval for 2542 mobile towers under Phase – II has been issued.	In addition, 4312 Mobile Towers have been approved in 37 LWE affected districts under another scheme supported by Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) for mobile connectivity in uncovered aspirational districts.*******
