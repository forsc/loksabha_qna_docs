As a result, the Gross Revenue (GR) and Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) of all TSPs has declined since last three financial years. Detail of GR andAGR for the last three years is as under:(in Rs. lakh crore)<pre>S.No.	Financial Year	Amount of GR	Adjusted GR1	2016-17	2.65	1.852	2017-18	2.46	1.503	2018-19	2.24	1.39</pre>Accordingly, License Fee (LF) which is 8% of AGR and Spectrum Usage Charges (SUC) which is 3 to 5 percent of AGR, has also decreased. (b) 	Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) has informed that to remain competitive in the market, BSNL also reduced tariff and the same has been reflected in the financial statements.  Despite increase in the subscriber base, revenue earned from mobile services has declined in the last three years.  Details of mobile subscribers of BSNL and revenue from mobile services of BSNL is as under:<pre>Year	Number of subscribers as on 31st March of FY (in crore)	Revenue from mobile service(in Rs. crore)2016-17	10.14	11271.952017-18	11.19	7185.412018-19	11.57	4708.63</pre>The Cabinet approved the revival plan for BSNL on 23.10.2019 which inter-alia, includes the measures to reduce the Staff cost through a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) to the employees of age 50 years and above, administrative allotment of Spectrum to BSNL for providing 4G services, monetisation of assets of BSNL, and debt restructuring by raising of sovereign guarantee bonds.(c) 	TRAI has informed that revision of Interconnect Usage Charge (IUC) rates is a periodic exercise.  Last time, Domestic Termination Charge (for wireless to wireless calls) vide “The Telecommunication Interconnection Usage Charges (Thirteenth Amendment) Regulations, 2017” dated 19.09.2017 and International Termination Charge vide “The Telecommunication Interconnection Usage Charges (Fourteenth Amendment) Regulations, 2018” dated 12.01.2018 were downward revised.

These rates are uniformly applicable to all Telecom Service Providers.
