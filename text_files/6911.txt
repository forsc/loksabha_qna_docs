Further one Gauge conversion project of Bankura-Damodar Valley (97 km) with New line Material Modifications (MMs) Bowaichandi-Khana, Rainagar-Mashagram, Bankura(Chhatna)-Mukutmonipur, Mukutmonipur-Uprasol, Bankura(Kalabati)-Purulia via Hura and Mukutmonipur-Jhilmili leading to total length of project as 305.25 kms had been sanctioned, presently costing `2372 crore. Out of which, Gauge conversion of Bankura-Rainagar (96 km) and Material Modification of new line Rainagar-Mashagram (20.9 km) has been commissioned.  Work on balance MMs is held up as, State Government of West Bengal has not provided requisite land. Bankura station is presently being served by 51 Mail/Express/Passenger train services which connect Bankura to various prominent places like Delhi, Kolkata, Guwahati, Chennai Mumbai, Bangaluru, Asansol, Dhanbad, Hatia/Ranchi, Kharagpur, Patna, Bhubneswar, Visakhapatnam, Ernakulum, Allahabad etc. which are considered adequate for the present level of traffic. Introduction of new train from Bankura is not feasible, at present, due to operational and resource constraints. However, introduction of train is an ongoing process over Indian Railways and is done keeping in view the traffic justification, operational feasibility, resource availability, competing demands etc.*****
