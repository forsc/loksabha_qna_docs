                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) is periodically monitoring the ground water levels throughout the Country on a regional scale, through a network of monitoring wells. In order to assess the decline in water level on a long-term basis, Pre-monsoon water level data collected by CGWB during Pre-monsoon 2019 has been compared with the decadal average (2009-2018). Analysis of water level data indicates that about 61% of the wells monitored have registered decline in ground water levels, mostly in the range        of 0 – 2 m. 	    In the state of Rajasthan, 66% of the wells show decline in water level, out of which around 16% wells show more than 4m decline. In the district of Alwar, 89% of the wells analysed show decline in ground water level, out of which 68 % wells show decline in more than 4 m range. (b) & (c) Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management including conservation and water harvesting in the Country is primarily States’ responsibility.  Further, to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes.Further, a number of States have done notable work in the field of water conservation/harvesting.  Of these, mention can be made of ‘Mukhyamantri Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan’ in Rajasthan, ‘Jalyukt Shibar’ in Maharashtra, ‘Sujalam Sufalam Abhiyan’ in Gujarat, ‘Mission Kakatiya’ in Telangana, ‘Neeru Chettu’ in Andhra Pradesh, ‘Jal Jeevan Hariyali’ in Bihar, ‘Jal Hi Jeevan’ in Haryana among others.Contd...P/2//2//Government of India launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), a time bound campaign with a mission mode approach intended to improve water availability including ground water conditions in the water stressed blocks of 256 districts in India. In this regard, teams of officers from Central Government along-with technical officers from Ministry of Jal Shakti were deputed to visit water stressed districts and to work in close collaboration with district level officials to undertake suitable interventions. Further, to promote water conservation and water resource management, five target interventions viz. water conservation & rainwater harvesting, renovation of traditional & other water-bodies/tanks, reuse and recharge of bore-wells, watershed development and intensive afforestation etc implemented.In addition, Government of India has approved Atal Bhujal Yojana (Atal Jal), a Rs. 6000 Crore Central Sector Scheme, for sustainable management of ground water resources with community participation. Atal Jal is being implemented in 78 water stressed districts of Seven States viz. Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. 	Central Government supports construction of water harvesting and conservation works primarily through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana – Watershed Development Component (PMKSY-WDC).
