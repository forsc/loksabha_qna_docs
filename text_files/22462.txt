ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a):     As on 01.03.2021, total number of cases pending with the Supreme Court is 66,727. Various measures have been taken by the Supreme Court from time to time to effectively dispose of the cases including during corona virus pandemic while adhering to the Covid protocol norms notified by the Government. Hearing of the matters is being done through video conferencing mode. Considering the special circumstances due to the pandemic, the summer vacation of the Supreme Court for seven weeks was curtailed to two weeks only and five weeks were declared working weeks. Even during the vacation of two weeks, Vacation Bench was constituted for hearing urgent  matters. Further, in order to reduce the number of pending cases, miscellaneous weeks for listing only fresh admission cases etc. were declared from time to time so that maximum number of cases could be listed. An Arrrears Committee has been constituted at the Supreme Court to formulate steps to reduce pendency of cases.              Disposal of cases in courts is within the domain of the judiciary. Timely disposal of cases in courts depends on several factors which, inter-alia, include availability of adequate number of judges, supporting court staff and physical infrastructure, complexity of facts involved, nature of evidence, co-operation of stake holders viz. bar, investigation agencies, witnesses and litigants and proper application of rules and procedures. The Government is, however, fully committed to speedy disposal of cases. The Government has taken several initiatives to provide an ecosystem for faster disposal of cases by the judiciary.  The National Mission for Justice Delivery and Legal Reforms established by the Government has adopted a coordinated approach for phased liquidation of arrears and pendency in judicial administration through various strategic initiatives, including improving infrastructure for courts, leveraging Information and Communication Technology for better justice delivery, and filling up of vacant positions of Judges in High Courts and Supreme Court.  (b) & (c): The existing ratio of judges in comparison to cases in Supreme Court is 1:2301. The Chief Justice of India had requested the Government in June, 2019 to consider augmenting the Judge-strength in the Supreme Court appropriately. Though there has been no criteria for fixing the judge strength of the Supreme Court, in view of the number of cases pending disposal, an increase in the judge strength was considered by Government. The sanctioned strength of Supreme Court of India has been increased from 30 to 33 (excluding the Chief Justice of India) w.e.f 09.08.2019 vide GOI notification.*****
