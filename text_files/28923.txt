                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ?????? 			(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (d) :   As reported by the State Government of Maharashtra total claims of Rs. 223.35 crore  in Maharashtra including Rs. 7.40 crore for Nanded district for Kharif 2020 are pending for settlement by concerned insurance companies under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY). Similarly claims of Rs. 48.36 crore including Rs. 17.98 crore are pending for settlement for Rabi 2020-21 season.  These claims are pending as the State Government has not released its share of premium subsidy of Rs. 942.62 crore for Kharif 2020 and Rs. 293.59 crore for Rabi 2020-21. The PMFBY is a multi-agency scheme involving farmers, insurance companies, financial institutions and Governments both Centre and State, therefore this Department is regularly monitoring the implementation of PMFBY including timely settlement of claims through weekly video conference of stakeholders, one to one meetings with insurance companies/States etc.  Further, penalty provisions for late settlement of claims by insurance companies and late release of funds by State Governments have also been stipulated under the revised/revamped operational guidelines of the scheme.  Insurance companies have to pay penal interest @12% per annum to the farmers for the period beyond the stipulated period in the PMFBY Guidelines from the date of receipt of final yield data from the State Government and completion of crop damage survey.  *****
