Quality- cum-cost based method for bidding has been adopted only for engagement of consultant for comprehensive architecture and engineering planning for development/ redevelopment of Central Vista.(e): The ongoing works at the Central Vista have provided direct livelihood opportunities to more than 10,000 skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers on site and off site and generated more than 24.12 lakh man days of employment. In addition, substantial employment in manufacturing and transportation of cement, steel and other building materials have been provided.
