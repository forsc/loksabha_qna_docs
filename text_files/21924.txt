ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a):		Migration of workers from one place to another  is a continuous process. The workers  migrate out of their native places in search of livelihood. The Constitution of India guarantees the right to every citizen to move and reside in any State/UT in search of Occupation/Job. According to the Economic survey 2016-17 the size of the workforce as per Census 2011, was 482 million (48.2 crore) people and based on extrapolation, this figure could have exceeded 500 million (50 crore) in 2016. If the share of migrants in the workforce is estimated to be even 20%, the size of the migrant workforce can be estimated to be over 100 million (10 crore) in  2016 in absolute terms.Contd..2/-:: 2 ::(b) to (d):	In order to safeguard the interest of the migrant workers, the Central Government had enacted the Inter-state Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979. This Act has now been subsumed in the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSH) Code, 2020. The OSH Code provides for decent working conditions, minimum wages, grievances redressal mechanisms, toll free helpline, protection from abuse and exploitation etc. for all category of workers including migrant workers. Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) provide for life & disability cover due to natural or accidental death. Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Man Dhan Pension Scheme (PM-SYM) provides for old age social security in the form of monthly pension. Healthcare benefits are catered by Pradhan Mantri - Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) to the eligible workers. Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has recently launched a scheme called Affordable Rental Housing Complexes to address the accommodation needs of migrant workers. ******
