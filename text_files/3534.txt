                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) The forest land diverted for mining activities under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 is returned back after completion of mining operation and biologically reclaimed. In the last three years 47469.49 ha. of forest land has been diverted for different non-forestry purposes including mining activities, against which a total of 62769.58 ha land has been stipulated for compensatory afforestation during the same period. Moreover, to reduce environment pollution, various mitigative measures are stipulated while granting environment clearance for such mining activities. Hence, the mining activities in forest areas do not contribute to cascading effect on the depletion of rainfall and environment pollution.(b) &(c) There are provisions under Scheduled Tribe & Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA, 2006), for protection/safeguard of rights of Tribals and Other Forest Dwellers. The district collector is one of the key authorities who is concerned with ensuring safeguard of rights of Tribals and Other Forest Dwellers. During diversion of any forest land under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, for non-forestry purpose, compliance under FRA, 2006 is ensured to safeguard the rights of Tribals. There are well laid down procedure in Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and FRA, 2006 to process the settlement/disposal of rights of Tribals displaced from the forest areas involved in mining activities. Moreover, wherever necessary, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) Plan is prepared as per R&R Policy for mitigating displacement of inhabitants if any, from forest areas due to approved mining activities.
