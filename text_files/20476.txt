ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) : 		Setting up of a power plant is a de-licensed activity. Utilities take their own decision to retire/shut down their units based on techno commercial assessment, non-compliance to environment norms etc. 19 coal/lignite based units of 1640.00 MW capacities (Details at Annexure-I) have retired/shut down from 01.02.2020 (date of Finance Minister''s Budget Speech) until 31.01.2021.(b) :		List of coal-based power plants, along with their location and developer information, which were given Environmental clearance by Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC) during the last three years is at Annexure-II.(c) :		51 coal/lignite units of 5454 MW capacities have been retired during last 3 years (Jan’ 2018 to Jan’ 2021). List is enclosed at Annexure-III.(d) to (f) :	Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC) notified new emission norms for coal based Thermal Power Plants (TPP) on 7th December 2015 to be complied within 2 years. However, keeping in view the techno economic feasibility and in order to ensure uninterrupted power supply position in the country, a phased/yearly implementation plan (to be implemented by 2022) for installation/upgradation of additional pollution control equipment was submitted to MoEF&CC on 13.10.2017. Accordingly, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has issued directions under section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to thermal power plants to comply with emission norms in a phased manner while compressing the timelines for 9 TPPs upto December 2019. As per the schedule for implementation of the new emission norms, 35 units of 15 plants (details at Annexure-IV) failed to achieve compliance. CPCB issued directions under section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to these plants in 2020, imposing Environmental Compensation (EC) @ Rs. 18 lakh per month per non-compliant unit. All the plants have approached Hon’ble Supreme Court against CPCB’s directions dated 08.05.2020 by filing IAs in W.P.(C) 13029/1985. Hon’ble Supreme Court has granted stay on recovery of EC in case of 14 plants, whereas, the case of one plant (Hinduja Thermal Power Station, Vizag) has been admitted/heard on 02.02.2021. Therefore, the matter is sub-judice in Hon’ble Supreme Court. Further, CPCB on 16.10.2020 has subsequently revised the timelines in case of 9 TPPs where the timelines were compressed, as per the plan submitted by MoP on 13.10.2017 to MoEF&CC.(g) :		Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and CPCB are periodically reviewing the status of milestone-wise progress made by TPPs for compliance of the new emission norms.**************
