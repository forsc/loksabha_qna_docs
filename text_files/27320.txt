ANSWER




                                                               THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                    (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a) to (c) : Government of India launched the Smart Cities Mission (SCM) on 25 June 2015 for development of 100 cities as Smart Cities. The selection of 100 Smart Cities has been completed through 4 rounds of selection from January 2016 to June 2018. A total of 5,151 projects worth of Rs. 2,05,018 crore were proposed by the 100 Smart Cities as part of their Smart City Proposals (SCPs). The objective of SCM is to promote cities that provide core infrastructure, give a decent quality of life and foster clean and sustainable environment through application of ‘Smart’ solutions. The focus is on sustainable and inclusive development and the idea is to look at compact areas, create a replicable models which will act like  `light-houses’ to other parts of the city/other aspiring cities. Illustrative elements in a Smart City, inter alia, may include assured supply of water and electricity, adequate sanitation facilities, efficient mobility, affordable housing, slum development, vibrant public spaces, good governance, health and education, etc. Most importantly, prioritization of projects from one or more of the above categories has been done by the Smart Cities after a comprehensive exercise of citizen engagement.Land and Colonization are State subjects. It is the responsibility of States/Union Territories (UTs) to collect data, frame policies and implement schemes for developing slums. However, Government of India through various programmatic interventions has been making overarching efforts by assisting States/UTs both technically and financially to address housing shortages including the issues relating to slums. As on 9 July, 2021, under SCM, 23 Smart Cities have reported 41 slum re-development projects at an estimated cost of Rs. 3,009.6 crore. Smart City-wise details of these projects are given in Annexure-I.  In pursuance to Government of India’s vision of ‘Housing for All’ by 2022, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has also been implementing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) since June 2015 to provide all weather pucca houses to all eligible urban beneficiaries. When slum redevelopment/rehabilitation projects are included as part of a city’s Smart City Proposal, benefits provided under PMAY-U are utilized by the concerned Smart City. The ‘In-situ’ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) component under PMAY-U provides houses to slum dwellers specifically using land as a resource and aims to bring them into the fold of formal urban settlements. So far, 4.54 lakh slum households have been benefitted under the scheme, details of which are at Annexure-II.                                          *****
