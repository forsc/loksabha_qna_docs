ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b): To achieve the objective of “Housing for All” by 2022, the Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana - Gramin (PMAY-G) w.e.f. 01.04.2016. The target number of houses for construction under PMAY-G is 2.95 Crore in two phases i.e. 1.00 Crore in Phase I (2016-17 to 2018-19) and 1.95 Crore in Phase II (2019-20 to 2021-22).  Under PMAY-G, selection of beneficiaries has been done using housing deprivation parameters in the Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011 data and as verified by Gram Sabhas. The SECC data captures housing deprivation and therefore households living in zero, one and two room houses with kutcha wall and kutcha roof can be segregated for benefit under PMAY(G). As on 12.03.2020, as verified by Gram Sabhas, the State of Bihar has 33,48,928 eligible beneficiaries in the Permanent Wait List (PWL). Out of this, a target of 21,85,181 households has been allotted to the State of Bihar during 2016-17 to 2019-20 under PMAY(G). Out of the allotted target, 19,93,783 houses have been sanctioned to beneficiaries by the State and construction of 9,09,121 houses have been completed. The Central Government has also allocated target of 8,06,698 houses for the year 2020-21.  As on 12.03.2020, the cumulative target fixed for Gopalganj district by the State Govt. of Bihar is 17,479 houses out of which 12,021 houses have been sanctioned to beneficiaries and 7,134 houses have been completed. *******
