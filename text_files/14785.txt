ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a): Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), supplied to domestic airlines attracts Central Excise duty at the rate of 11%. ATF being supplied to schedule commuter airlines (SCA) from the regional connectivity scheme (RCS) airports, attract Central Excise duty at the rate of 2%. Moreover, the supply of ATF to foreign owned airlines and to Indian airlines operating in International sectors is exempted from Central Excise duty. States apply VAT at varying rates. As there are varying rates of duty/taxes on ATF in India and other countries, comparison thereof is not feasible.(b), (c) and (d): Certain references have been received for inclusion of ATF in GST. As per Article 279 A (5) of the Constitution, the Goods and Service Tax Council shall recommend the date on which the goods and services tax be levied on petroleum crude, high speed diesel, motor spirit (commonly known as petrol), natural gas and aviation turbine fuel (ATF). As per the section 9(2) of the CGST Act, inclusion of these products in GST will require recommendation of the GST Council. So far, the GST Council has not made any recommendation for inclusion of ATF under GST. Implication of inclusion of ATF in GST would be dependent on several factors.*****
