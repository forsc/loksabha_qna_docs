                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) & (b) Climate model simulation studies done by various agencies including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) project possible linkages of climate change with frequency and intensity of weather-related events. However, the causal link between climate change and loss of life and property or financial loss has not been established. The inventories for the methodologies to assess losses due to climate change have yet not been developed under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).However, India is taking ambitious actions to combat climate change , including mitigation and adaptation, under the overarching framework of the National Action Plan on Climate Change.(c) to (f)According to the Global Climate Risk Index(GCRI) 2020 by German watch, India is ranked as the 5th most vulnerable country globally.Japan, Philippines and Germany are reported to be the most affected countries in 2018, followed by Madagascar, India and Sri Lanka.The Ministry of Home Affairs has been designated as the Nodal Ministry with respect to the GCRI. India has raised the issue of climate finance, as well as support for capacity building and technology transfer under Paris Agreement, in the UNFCCC.The Government is implementing National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which comprises of missions in specific areas of solar energy, energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan eco-system, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. The NAPCC provides the overarching framework for all climate actions. Thirtythree States /Union Territories have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) in lines with NAPCC taking into account State’s specific issues relating to climate change. These SAPCCs inter-alia outline sector specific and cross sectoral priority actions including adaptation. The Government is also implementing the scheme, “National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change” to support adaptation measures of States/UTs in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate Change. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued several disaster specific guidelines for managing extreme weather-related disasters such as cyclones, floods and heat wave. National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) has been formulated to assist all stakeholders including State Governments in disaster risk management of various hazards including hazards related to climate change.Further, advance and early warning systems are being implemented by Indian Meteorological Department to facilitate timely evacuation in the event of floods/cyclones and prevent the loss of lives. At the United Nations Secretary General’s Summit in 2019, India also launched the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, a platform for generating and exchanging knowledge to promote the resilience of new and existing infrastructure systems to climate and disaster risks, thereby ensuring sustainable development. ***
