                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a):		In pursuance of the pro-poor measures  under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package as part of the Economic Response to COVID -19, Govt of India had launched scheme i.e Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana(PMGKAY) for additional allocation of food-grains from the Central Pool @ 5 kg per person per month free of cost for all the beneficiaries covered under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS)/National Food Security Act(NFSA) (Antyodaya Anna Yojana(AAY) & Priority Households(PHH)) including those covered under Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) for a period of 8 months i.e April-November, 2020. During the period of 8 months, about 322 Lakh Metric Tons (LMT) of food-grains had been allocated to approx. 80 crore beneficiaries..........2/--2-		The above PMGKAY scheme has also been implemented during the year 2021 for the period of 7 months i.e May-November, 2021. Accordingly, about 278 LMT foodgrains have been allocated free of cost to approximately 80 Crore NFSA beneficiaries.  		In addition  to foodgrains, during the year 2020, under PMGKAY- pulses have also been provided @ 1kg per household per month for 8 months i.e April to November, 2020 free of cost to all beneficiaries under NFSA covering 19.4 crore households. During the period April-June, 2020 an adjusted allocation of about 5.65 LMT pulses have been made in comparison to 5.82 LMT pulses allotted originally for 3 months and during the period July-November, 2020 an adjusted allocation of about 8.82 LMT whole chana have been made in comparison to 9.38 LMT of whole chana allotted originally for 5 months.Also, under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Package (ANBP), allocation of free foodgrain(wheat and rice) for migrants/stranded migrants,  who are  not covered under NFSA or state ration card, @ 5 kg per person per month for two months i.e May and June, 2020 was made. Under ANBP, whole Chana was also provided @ 1kg per household per month for two months, May and June, free of cost to migrants, who were not covered under NFSA, 2013 or were without ration card in the States/UTs in which they were stranded. Accordingly, a quantity of 27,001.19 MT whole Chana was allotted for two months (May-June, 2020).  The allocation of foodgrains/pulses/chana under PMGKAY and ANBP is in addition to normal allocation done under the NFSA.(b): 	Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and the State/UT Governments, wherein the operational responsibilities pertain with the State/UT. No specific challenges were reported by the States/UTs. Distribution of free of cost foodgrains under PMGKAY was monitored constantly through virtual meetings with States/UTs. In addition, Monitoring institutions engaged by the Govt. have conducted evaluation studies and reported a very high level of satisfaction with implementation of food security measures during COVID-19. The distribution of foodgrains under NFSA and PMGKAY was found to be on the average of nearly 93-94%. Foodgrains have been distributed to nearly  75 crore  beneficiaries every month during the lockdown. ......3/--3(c): 	There has been no significant changes in the current status of Public Distribution System (PDS) and Targeted Public Distribution System(TPDS). Department of Food & Public Distribution makes allocation of foodgrains(wheat and rice) to the States/UTs under TPDS in terms of NFSA, 2013. Under the Act eligible households, which comprise of AAY households and priority households, are entitled to receive foodgrains @ Rs 1/2/3 per kg for nutri-cereals/wheat/rice respectively. NFSA is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and the State/UT Govt. Central Govt is responsible for allocation and transportation of foodgrains upto the designated depots of the FCI. The operational responsibilities for allocation of foodgrains within the States/UTs, identification of eligible beneficiaries, issuance of ration cards to them, distribution of foodgrains to eligible beneficiaries rest with the concerned State/UT Govt. During  2020-21, additional foodgrains (free of cost) to the tune of nearly 298 LMT was distributed all over the country to NFSA beneficiaries.(d): 	State/UT-wise details of allocation of foodgrains under PMGKAY schemes since its inception is placed at Annexure-I(e): 	Yes Sir. In addition to PMGKAY and ANBP, Govt of India has also allocated foodgrains under Open Market Sale Scheme(Domestic)(OMSS(D)). Under (OMSS(D), foodgrains have been allocated for all the beneficiaries to whom ration cards have been issued by the State Governments under their own scheme but who are not covered under NFSA, @ 5 kg per person per month for distribution to such beneficiaries for three months from April to June, 2020 at  Rs. 21/- per Kg. wheat and Rs. 22/- per Kg. rice. GoI had directed FCI to make available the required quantity of foodgrains, as per the demands of the States/UTs, from Central Pool Stocks for distribution to such person holding valid cards issued by the State/UT Govts. There is no upper limit for allocation of foodgrain to such organisations from any FCI depot.
