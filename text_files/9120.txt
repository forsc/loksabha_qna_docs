                                                           THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)	The Ministry captures data of persons going abroad for employment to the Emigration Check Required (ECR) countries who require clearance. Majority of such persons are holder of ECR passports. Emigration Check Not Required or ECNR passport holders going for employment generally do not require clearance. They can register voluntarily. Therefore, it is difficult to arrive at accurate figures of Indian nationals who have gone abroad. The data captured in the eMigrate system, through which clearance is given for employment to Gulf Countries from the district of Gopalganj and neighbouring districts, namely, Siwan, East Champaran, West Champaran, Muzaffarpur and Saran since 2015 is as follows.<pre>YearGopalganjSiwanEast ChamparanWest ChamparanMuzaffarpurSaran2015216202489442926040279337742016156361658631934902242628232017156461518728444187232623452018122111259326614061202423612019 (31 Oct.907488862208302214891873Total741877814615198222121105813176</pre>As far as earning of foreign revenue is concerned, Indian workers in Gulf Countries do send remittance to India from time to time during the period of their employment there.(c)   The Government has taken several steps to safeguard the interests of Indian emigrants in the Gulf and other ECR countries. These include:(i)	The on-line MADAD portal enables the emigrant workers and their family members to register their consular grievances on-line and track their redressal.(ii)	Grievances related to Overseas Employment in notified Emigration Check Required (ECR) countries can also be lodged directly by emigrants/relatives or through the Pravasi Bharatiya Sahayata Kendra, Delhi (PBSK) which is linked to e-Migrate portal. These grievances are settled by respective jurisdictional Protectors of Emigrants (PoEs) as per laid down procedures.(iii)	Pravasi Bharatiya Sahayata Kendras (PBSK) have been set up at Dubai (UAE), Sharjah (UAE), Riyadh, Jeddah (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) and Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), to provide guidance and counseling on all matters pertaining to overseas Indian workers.(iv)	Kshetriya Pravasi Sahayata Kendras (KPSK) have been setup in Delhi, Kochi, Hyderabad, Chennai and Lucknow to assist emigrants or their relatives to redress their problems/complaints regarding overseas employment.(v)	Grievances brought to the notice of the Ministry and the Missions through social media, including twitter, are promptly addressed.(vi)	Missions have established 24x7 Helplines and Toll Free Helplines for the benefit of Indian workers to seek help.(vii)	The Missions utilise the Indian Community Welfare Fund (ICWF) to provide assistance to overseas Indian nationals in times of distress. The guidelines of the Indian community welfare fund have been revised recently to expand the scope of welfare measures and to cover three key areas, namely, assisting overseas Indian nationals in distress situations, community welfare activities and improvement in consular services.(viii)	Labour and Manpower Cooperation MoUs/Agreements are in place with the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries that provide the institutional framework to comprehensively discuss and review labour related issues.  In accordance with the Labour and Manpower Cooperation/Agreement, Joint Working Group (JWG) meetings are held on regular basis to discuss various labour related issues.(d)	According to information sent by our Missions in the Gulf, no such cases have been registered with any of them.***
