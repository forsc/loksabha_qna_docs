Further,  the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018 was  enacted to prescribe even more stringent penal  provisions including death penalty for rape of girls below the  age of 12 years.  The Act also inter-alia mandates completion  of  investigation  and filing of charge sheet in rape cases in 2 months and trials to also be completed in 2 months (Section 173 CrPC).ii.	Emergency Response Support System provides a pan-India, single internationally recognized number (112) based system for all emergencies,  with  computer  aided  dispatch  of  field   resources to the location of distress.iii.

In order to improve investigation, MHA has taken steps to strengthen DNA analysis units in Central and State Forensic Science Laboratories.  This includes setting up of State-of-the-Art DNA Analysis  Unit  in  Central  Forensic  Science Laboratory, Chandigarh. MHA  has also  sanctioned setting-up and upgrading of DNA Analysis units in State Forensic Science Laboratories in 20 States/UTs.viii.	MHA   has  notified   guidelines   for  collection  of  forensic  evidence  in  sexual   assault   cases  and  the  standard  composition   in   a  sexual   assault   evidence   collection   kit. To facilitate adequate capacity in manpower, training and skill building programs have been undertaken for Investigation Officers, Prosecution Officers and Medical Officers.
