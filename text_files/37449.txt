The jewellery brought by the consumer shall be weighed in presence of the consumer.d. 	Each article shall be tagged with a serial number for identification.e. 	Each jewellery piece should be individually checked by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) for purity of gold and also for the absence of prohibited elements such as Iridium, Ruthenium, Cadmium and Osmium.f. 	Sampling should be done in such a way that there is minimum damage to the jewellery. The consent for the sampling method shall be obtained from the consumer beforehand.g.	 If desired by consumer the report may be issued for the jewellery tested only based on the XRF however in the report it should be specifically mentioned that XRF gives gold content of surface only and the purity checked by XRF may vary by ±5 ppt.h. 	After testing by fire assay a test report should be issued to the consumer by the AHC in the prescribed format. The photograph and weight of the jewellery shall also be mentioned in the report.i. 	The jewellery along with cornets and remnants, if any, should be returned to the consumer on the same day.

Before testing, the following should be informed to the consumer and also displayed at a prominent position in AHC that is easily visible to the consumer:• 	That the purity of gold shall be tested by two methods - a) XRF method b) Fire assaying method.• 	XRF method is a non-destructive, preliminary method and gives gold content of surface only. It may and may not represent average purity of the gold article. Purity certificate cannot be issued on the basis of XRF test only.•		Fire assaying method is a destructive method. It is, however, most widely used and accurate method for gold content globally.******  ANNEXURE-IIANNEXURE REFERRED IN REPLY TO PART (c) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.4536 TO BE ANSWER ON 30-03-2022 REGARDING HALLMARK JEWELLERY.State wise/UT wise list of AHCs as on 28 March 2022Sl No	State/UT	No. of AHC 1	Andhra Pradesh	572	Assam	113	Bihar	374	Chandigarh	 65	Chhattisgarh	106	Delhi	427	Goa	 28	Gujarat	889	Haryana	2510	Himachal Pradesh	 311	Jammu & Kashmir	 412	Jharkhand	1013	Karnataka	6714	Kerala	8515	Madhya Pradesh	2716	Maharashtra	                      13017	Odisha	2418	Pondicherry	 219	Punjab	3020	Rajasthan	4421	Tamil Nadu	                      12322	Telangana	3623	Tripura	 224	Uttar Pradesh	7025	Uttarakhand	 526	West Bengal	                      138	Grand Total	                    1078*****
