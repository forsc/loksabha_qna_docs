ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a):	As per the Unorganised Workers Social Security Act, 2008, the Central Government is mandated to provide Social Security to unorganised sector workers including daily wagers, home maker and construction labourers by formulating suitable welfare schemes on matters relating to (i) life and disability cover, (ii) health and maternity benefits, (iii) old age protection and (iv) any other benefit as may be determined by the Central Government. The Unorganised Workers Social Security Act, 2008 has been subsumed in the code on Social Security, 2020.Condt..2/-:: 2 ::            Life and disability cover is provided through Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti  Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Surksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) launched in 2015.  The benefits under the scheme are Rs. 2 lakh on death due to any reason and permanent disability, Rs. 4 lakh on death due to accident and Rs. 1 lakh on partial disability.  The annual premium is Rs. 342/- (Rs. 330/- for PMJJBY + Rs. 12/- for PMSBY) depending upon their eligibility.     	The health and maternity benefits are addressed through Ayushman Bharat Scheme which is a universal health scheme launched in 2018. Under the scheme, Rs. 5 lakh health coverage per family is provided for secondary and tertiary treatments free of cost.     	 In order to provide old age protection to unorganised sector workers, the Government of India has launched a flagship scheme namely Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan Dhan Yojana (PM-SYM) launched in March, 2019 to provide a monthly minimum assured pension of Rs. 3000/- after attaining the age of 60 years. This is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme. The workers in the age group of 18-40 years whose monthly income is Rs. 15000/- or less and not a member of EPFO/ESIC/NPS (Govt. Funded) can join the  scheme. Under the scheme, 50% monthly contribution is payable by the beneficiary and equal matching contribution is paid by the Central Government. (b):	India, being a founding member of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has deep respect for its principles and objectives. The Government of India has always upheld the basic tenets of tripartism. The four Codes, namely, the Code on Wages, 2019, the Industrial Relations Code, 2020, the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code on Social Security, 2020 have been notified in Gazette of India. Prior to that the Government had done extensive consultations inviting all Central Trade Unions, Employers’ Associations and State Governments. All these Codes were also placed on the website for inviting comments from all stakeholders including general public.******
