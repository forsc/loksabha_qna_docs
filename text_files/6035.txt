A regional biomaterial centre has also been established at Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (ROTTO), Chennai, Tamilnadu.(e):     The ‘National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO)’, ‘Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organizations (ROTTOs)’ and ‘State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organizations (SOTTOs)’ disseminate relevant information about organ donation in the public. A 24x7 call centre with a toll free helpline number (1800114770) has been made operational. A number of activities, for generating awareness and for imparting training to all those associated with transplant activities including doctors and transplant coordinators, such as celebration of Indian Organ Donation Day, seminars, workshops, debates, sports events, walkathons, participation in marathons, nukkad Natak, etc. are organized at different places in the Country.
