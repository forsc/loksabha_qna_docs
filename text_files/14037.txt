ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a)	   The Research and Information Systems (RIS) works as an autonomous institution under the administrative control of the Ministry of External Affairs. Government makes extensive use of RIS in pursuing its foreign policy goals. Apart from working very closely with the Ministry of External Affairs, RIS also carries out projects and studies for other Ministries/Departments of  Government like  the Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Department of Science and Technology, Department of Biotechnology and NITI Aayog.Some of the other mechanisms by which the government is making use of RIS are as follows:  Promoting India’s interests at Track 1.5 and Track 2 platforms on areas of India’s interests with partner countries and partner institutions from other countries and international bodies like WTO, United Nations, World Bank, ADB, AIIB, etc. Facilitating international development cooperation for countries of the Global South through its annual international Conference called ‘Delhi Process’. Providing empirical evidence-based research inputs on issues pertaining to bilateral and regional trade, commerce, finance, connectivity, health, science technology and innovation.Strengthening linkages with ASEAN countries through the   ASEAN-India Centre (AIC) at RIS Conducting numerous academic/training/fellowship programmes such as ITEC Capacity building programmes, RIS-EXIM Bank Summer School on ‘International Trade Theory and Practices’ IBSA Fellowship Programme and BRICS Fellowship Programmes.  (b) to (d)	  The list of discussions held between RIS and think-tanks in other  countries, including a note on the role played by RIS in promoting trade have been provided in the annexure. Further details about outcomes etc are available in RIS annual reports, which have been tabled in Parliament, and are also available on the RIS website for ready reference.(e) 	 Government values RIS’s role. RIS is a unique research institution. It was created at the request of the Nonaligned Movement. It has been mandated to assist the Global South in its efforts to protect and promote core trade and economic interests under India’s leadership. RIS research  will continue to focus on the global public good  with particular reference to access, equity and inclusiveness.  Since  countries of the Global South,  particularly those belonging to Africa, South and  South-East Asia and Latin America,  look up to India’s leadership role in defending their trade and economic interests,  Government would continue to extend its full   support to RIS and provide all required assistance in expanding its engagements as a credible global research  institution.  ***
