ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) & (b): Total 22 posts of Vice Chancellors in Central Universities under this Ministry werevacant out of which appointments to 12 posts have already been made by the Visitor. TheState/UT-wise, University-wise and Grade-wise vacant posts of teachers in CentralUniversities are at Annexure.(c): The incidence and filling up of vacancies in Central Universities is a continuous process.Ministry of Education and University Grants Commission (UGC) continuously monitor itwith Universities. UGC vide its D.O. letter No.F.1-14/2019 (CPP-II) dated 4th June, 2019 hasprepared the Guidelines for Recruitment of Faculty in Universities, Colleges and InstitutionsDeemed to be Universities outlining the selection procedure and the time frame forrecruitment which has been circulated to all Universities to adhere the guidelines. The UGCvide its letter dated 31st July 2019, 7th August 2019, 5th September 2019 and 22nd October2019 has again requested the Universities to ensure that vacant positions in University as wellas colleges affiliated to Universities are filled at the earliest. However, the onus of filling upthe teaching posts lies on Central Universities which are autonomous bodies created underActs of Parliament.(d) & (e): As per the clause 13 of UGC Regulations on Minimum Qualifications forAppointment of Teachers and Other Academic Staff in Universities and Colleges andMeasures for the Maintenance of Standards in Higher Education 2018, the teachers should beappointed on contract basis only when it is absolutely necessary and when the student teacherratio does not satisfy the laid-down norms. In any case, the number of such appointmentsshould not exceed 10% of the total number of faculty positions in a College/University. Thequalifications and selection procedure for appointing them should be the same as thoseapplicable to a regularly-appointed teacher. The fixed emoluments paid to such contractteachers should not be less than the monthly gross salary of a regularly appointed AssistantProfessor. Such appointments should not be made initially for more than one academicsession, and the performance of any such entrant teacher should be reviewed for academicperformance before reappointing him/her on contract basis for another session. Suchappointments on contract basis may also be resorted to when absolutely necessary to fillvacancies arising due to maternity leave, child-care leave, etc.*****
