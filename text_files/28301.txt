                                                        (a)	to (e):A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARREDQ. NO *47 FOR 01.12.2021 REGARDING NATIONAL SOCIAL REGISTRY*******(a)	to (c): Currently there is no such proposal to develop a “National Social Registry” by the Government. Since a large number of government welfare programmes provide benefits to family as the unit, an accurate family database is considered important for administering such programmes. Various departments of State and Central Governments have been developing such databases for specific schemes like Public Distribution System (PDS), Housing, Healthcare etc. To understand the feasibility of preparing a common data base with family as the unit, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India initiated Proof of Concept (PoC) in July, 2021.(d):Yes, Sir.Government is aware of the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s observations in the case of Puttaswamy vs. Union of India. (e):The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India has taken adequate measures to ensure integrity and security of data in the Proof of Concept(PoC) referred to above.*******
