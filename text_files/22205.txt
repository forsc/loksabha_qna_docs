                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	 to (c)  The Ministry of Rural Development is implementing various schemes/programmes to bring about overall improvement in the quality of life of the people in rural areas and make them self reliant through employment generation, strengthening of livelihood opportunities, promoting self-employment, skilling of rural youths, provision of social assistance and other basic amenities. The details of the schemes/programmes implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development are given below: (i) Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme: The principal objective of the scheme is to provide for the enhancement of livelihood security of the households by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. It stresses on creation of durable and sustainable assets to make the beneficiaries self-dependant.  (ii) Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM): The Ministry is implementing DAY-NRLM to tackle the problem of unemployment, especially among women, in a mission mode with the objective of organizing the rural poor women into Self Help Groups (SHGs) and continuously nurturing and supporting them to take up economic activities till they attain appreciable increase in income over a period of time to improve their quality of life and come out of abject poverty. Besides, Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Programme (SVEP), the sub-scheme under DAY-NRLM, has the objective of helping Self Help Group (SHG) and their family members to set-up small enterprises in the non-farm sector. (iii) Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen KaushalyaYojana (DDU-GKY) and Rural Self Employment and Training Institutes (RSETIs): The Ministry is implementing two Skill development initiatives for rural poor youth under National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) to improve the economic condition of the rural population, namely, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushal Yojana (DDU-GKY), a placement linked skill development scheme for rural poor and Skill development through Rural Self Employment and Training Institutes (RSETI), which provides skilling, thereby enabling the trainee to take bank credit and start his/her own Micro-enterprise. Some of such trainees may also seek regular salaried jobs.  (iv) Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G): PMAY-G aims to provide a pucca house with basic amenities to all rural houseless households and households living in kutcha and dilapidated houses in rural areas. The target under PMAY-G is to construct 2.95 crore houses during the period 2016-17 to 2021-22. (v) Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY): PMGSY was started in the year 2000 with the objective to provide all-weather road connectivity to eligible unconnected habitations. The mandate of the scheme was subsequently widened and new interventions viz. PMGSY-II and PMGSY-III were added for upgradation of the existing rural road network which connect habitations to the various facilities and services. The implementation of the ongoing PMGSY has helped immensely in lifting the socio–economic conditions of rural masses by providing them access to the various services and facilities, market place and employment opportunities in various forms. (vi) National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP):  It is a social welfare programme for the aged, widows, disabled and in the cases of death of the primary breadwinner belonging to Below Poverty Line (BPL) Households.
