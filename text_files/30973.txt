ANSWER




                                                        (a)        Under Skill India Mission, Ministry is implementing its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) to impart skill development training to youth of the country. PMKVY has two training components, namely, Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). Under PMKVY, placement opportunities are being provided to STT certified candidates, while RPL does not mandate placements as it recognizes the existing skills of candidate. The State-wise including State of Rajasthan number of candidates trained, certified and placed in STT component of PMKVY candidates oriented and certified in RPL component of PMKVY in the last three years (i.e. 2018-21), as on 21.11.2021, is given at Annexure. (b)        Under PMKVY, STT is linked to placement, while RPL does not mandate placements as it recognizes the existing skills of candidate. Under PMKVY-STT, in the last three years (i.e. 2018-21) 26.68 lakh candidates have been certified and out of which, 15.28 lakh candidates have been provided with the placement which is around 57%.  (c)        In order to enhance the placements under PMKVY-STT, placement is linked with payout to training providers. The last tranche, i.e., 30 percent of total payout is disbursed to training providers only on ensuring placement of the candidates. Further, Rozgar Melas are organised with the support of Sector Skill Councils, training providers and implementing agencies to directly link the candidates with the potential employers. Under present phase of the PMKVY, i.e., PMKVY 3.0, demand driven and bottom-up approach has been provisioned to boost demand for job roles which are prevailing at regional/local level. In addition, informed choices / aspirations of the candidates have been given primacy which aims to support the self-employment as well. This scheme also supports the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat by encouraging candidates to opt for local skills with local jobs.  Annexure The State-wise including State of Rajasthan number of candidates trained, certified and placed in PMKVY-STT and candidates oriented and certified in PMKVY-RPL in the last three years (i.e. 2018-21), as on 21.11.2021: S.
