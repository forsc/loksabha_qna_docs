ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) to (c): 	The Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) is operated in joint responsibilities of the Central and State/UT Governments, wherein, inter-alia the operational responsibilities for inclusion/exclusion of households/beneficiaries under NFSA rests with the concerned State/UT Government. Further, the addition and deletion of ration cards under TPDS is a continuous process and the States/UTs regularly review their list to identify and weed-out ineligible ration cards and to include other left out and genuinely eligible households/beneficiaries under NFSA, up to their respective ceiling limits of population coverage under the Act. Accordingly, and due to the use of technology in TPDS operations i.e. de-duplication due to digitization of ration cards data, Aadhaar seeding, detection of ineligible, duplicate, bogus ration cards, migration, death of beneficiaries, etc. the States/UTs have deleted a total of about 4.39 Crore ineligible, duplicate and fake ration cards during the years 2013 to 2020 so far. The States/UTs have been advised to undertake proper verification, which may also include field verification of each identified/suspected case to ensure that ration cards of genuine beneficiaries are not deleted or suspended. Further, the timeline given to the States/UTs for linking of Aadhaar numbers of beneficiaries with their ration cards under the Notification of this Department dated 08/02/2017 (as amended from time to time)has been extended up to 30/09/2021. Until then, as per extant instructions of this Department, vide letters dated 24/10/2017 and 08/11/2018, all States/UTs are advised that no ration card / beneficiary shall be deleted only for want of Aadhaar and no genuine beneficiary/household shall be denied from receiving their entitled quota of subsidised foodgrains for not possessing an Aadhaar number or failure of biometric/Aadhaar authentication due to network/ connectivity/ linking related issues, poor biometrics of the beneficiary or any other technical reasons.*****
