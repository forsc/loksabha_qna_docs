ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):	The state wise number of ICU beds and ventilators in in different Government (Central and State) run Dedicated COVID Hospitals is at Annexure-I.(b):	At the start of the Pandemic, India''s domestic manufacturing of ventilators was insignificant. Empowered Group-3, constituted in February, 2020 was mandated to ensure availability of essential medical equipments including ventilators. As part of Make in India initiative, manufacturers, both in Government and private sector, were identified and provided with the requisite specifications. They were also provided with technical guidance by DGHS   to test and rectify the shortfalls and undergo technical evaluation. Further orders were placed with them to ensure market for the product and its viability. (c):	The Central Government has already issued orders to purchase 60,948 ventilators. As on 15th September 2020, 32,109 ventilators have been allocated to States of which 30,663 have been delivered. The distribution to States was based on evolving scenario and need based requirement of the State.(d):	A total number of 58850 ‘make in India’ ventilators are being manufactured. The agencies assigned for manufacturing these ventilators are (i) AMTZ (Andhra Pradesh), (ii) AgVA Healthcare (Uttar Pradesh), (iii) Jyoti CNC Automation Ltd. (Gujarat), (iv) Bharat Electricals Limited (Karnataka). State - wise allocation of these ventilators are at     Annexure-II.(e):	The technical specifications for these COVID ventilators have been laid down by a Technical Committee of domain knowledge experts headed by the Director General Health Services (DGHS), MoHFW.  The ventilators were tested for their functional parameters. Approval for production was based on fulfilling the laid down specifications.(f):	On this front, globally, there are around 145 candidate vaccines in preclinical evaluation and currently 35 vaccines in clinical trial. In India, a major focus has been on facilitating the development of COVID19 vaccine. More than 30 vaccine candidates have been supported which are in different stages of development, 3 candidates are in advanced stage of Phase I/II/III trials and more than 4 are in advanced pre-clinical development stage.Health is a State subject. The responsibility of engaging private hospitals in treating COVID cases is that of the State Government. Union Health Secretary has written to all States/UTs to engage private hospitals through mutually agreeable arrangements. Rates under PM-JAY and CGHS packages have been advised. A large number of States have accordingly issued instructions to that affect.
