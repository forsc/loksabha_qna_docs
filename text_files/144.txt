                                                        THE MINISTER FOR MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND MINISTRY OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a)	Three desalination plants each with a fresh water production capacity of one lakh litre per day have been established at Kavaratti, Minicoy, and Agatti islands of the Union Territory of Lakshadweep, based on the Low Temperature Thermal Desalination (LTTD) technology indigenously developed by the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), an autonomous body of the Ministry of Earth Sciences. (b)	Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) is now setting up LTTD based desalination plants in Amini, Androth, Chetlat, Kadamat, Kalpeni and Kiltan islands of Lakshadweep, each with a fresh water generating capacity of 1.5 lakh liters per day. Work to establish these six plants has already started. However, the Ministry of Earth Sciences does not have any plan of setting up desalination plants along the Indian coast. (c)	The cost per liter of desalination would depend on the technology used and cost of electricity which varies from place to place. According to the cost estimates made by an independent agency for LTTD technology, the cost per liter of desalinated portable water is about 61 paise for Island based plants.(d)	Does not arise.
