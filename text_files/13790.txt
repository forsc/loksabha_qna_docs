Stunting has reduced from 48% in NFHS-3 to 38.4% in NFHS-4, however, wasting has increased from 19.8% in NFHS-3 to 21% in NFHS-4. One of the reason for slight increase is wasting while other indicator of malnutrition which has come down in NFHS 4 has been identified as seasonality.   The Government of India has initiated various interventions to address the issues of under-nutrition in the country. POSHAN (Prime Minister’s Overarching Scheme for Holistic Nourishment) Abhiyaan has been launched to address malnutrition challenges in India by engaging all the important stakeholders through convergence. The goals of POSHAN Abhiyaan is to prevent and reduce stunting, underweight and low birth weight by 2% per annum and the reduction of anaemia by 3% per annum.The Government of India has also launched several schemes under the aegis of Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) to tackle the malnutrition in the country including Aanganwadi Services, Schemes for Adolescent Girls (SAG) and Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojna (PMMVY) to improve the nutritional and health status of children in the age group of 0-6 yrs.

In addition to aforementioned interventions, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, Adolescent Health and Nutrition (RMNCAH+N) under National Health Mission (NHM) is also implemented to reduce malnutrition across the life cycle. The details of various health and nutrition interventions under National Health Mission (NHM) are as follows: •	Early initiation, Exclusive breastfeeding for first six months and Complementary Feeding are important for the prevention of malnutrition in under five children.  The Mothers’ Absolute Affection (MAA) program is being implemented to promote age appropriate IYCF practices while capacitating health care providers at the facility and community level as well as awareness generation of the mothers and care providers through mother’s meeting,•	Home Based Care for Young Children (HBYC) has been initiated as an extension of Home Based Newborn Care (HBNC) to provide community based care by ASHA workers with focus on improvement in child rearing practices, nutrition counselling and breastfeeding promotion till 15th month of life. •	Sick children with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) are being treated and managed for medical complications at special units called as Nutrition Rehabilitation Centres (NRCs), set up at public health facilities. •	Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) is being supported to provide vaccination to children against life threatening diseases such as Tuberculosis, Diphtheria, Pertusis, Polio, Tetanus, Hepatitis B, Measles, Rubella, Pneumonia and Meningitis caused by Haemophilus Influenzae B. The Rotavirus vaccination has also been rolled out in the country for prevention of Rotaviral diarrhoea. Mission Indradhanush is targeted to immunize children who are either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated i.e. those that have not been covered during the rounds of routine immunization for various reasons.•	Biannual Vitamin A supplementation (VAS) rounds are being conducted for children from 9 months to 5 yr. of age group. •	National De-worming Day is being implemented as a fixed day strategy to administer Albendazole tablets to all the children in the age group of 1-19 years through the platform of AWCs and schools for good nutritional outcomes and prevention of anaemia.•	Prevention of childhood illness such as diarrheal diseases which in turn prevents childhood malnutrition.
