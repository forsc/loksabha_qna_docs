These projects are delayed mainly due to land acquisition, utility shifting, non-availability of soil/aggregate, poor performance of contractors, environment/forest/wildlife clearances, ROB & RUB issues with Railways, public agitation for additional facilities, arbitration/contractual disputes with contractors etc. To fast-track these projects, various steps such as streamlining of land acquisition &environment clearances, premium re-scheduling, close coordination with other Ministries, revamping of dispute resolution mechanism, frequent review meetings with project developers, State Government and contractors at various levels etc. have been taken up.(d) & (e)	Though projects get delayed due to various reasons such as land acquisition, utility shifting, environment/forest/wildlife clearances, ROB/RUB issues with the railways, however to overcome these, it has been now decided that projects are awarded only when 90% of the land required is available and all the statutory clearanceshave been obtained. During execution stage, regularmeetings at higher level are held time to time to monitor the ongoing projects.*****
