ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL)(a) & (b) Panchayat, being “Local Government”, is a State subject and part of State list of Seventh Schedule of Constitution of India. Mandate for setting up of Panchayats is provided by Article 243 in Part IX of the Constitution of India. Accordingly, the Panchayats are setup and operate through the respective State Panchayati Raj Acts. Panchayat being a State subject, it is for the concerned State Government to endow Panchayats with such powers and authority to enable to function as institutions of self-governance, and plan and implement schemes for economic development and social justice including the basic facilities. Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) supplements the efforts of the States through Central Finance Commission Grants and Rashtriya Gram SwarajAbhiyan(RGSA). The RGSA scheme provides financial and technical support to the states for Capacity Building and Training (CB&T) of elected representatives and functionaries of Panchayati Raj Institutions with focus on Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) so as to enable them to discharge their mandated functions effectively. State-wise allocation and release of Central Finance Commission Grants for Rural Local Bodies, including West Bengal, during the last three years and current year is given at Annexure.(c) 	MoPR reviews the performance of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) throughout the country from time to time through studies, review meetings, field visits, video conferencing, Information Technology applications, Common Review Missions (CRMs) etc. (d) 	To strengthen functioning of PRIs across the country, MoPR has launched eGramSwaraj(https://egramswaraj.gov.in), a user friendly web-based portal, which aims to bring in better transparency in the decentralised planning, progress reporting, financial management, work-based accounting and details of assets created. Further, for ensuring timely audit of Panchayat accounts i.e. receipts and expenditures of Gram Panchayats, MoPR has rolled out an online application – AuditOnline (https://auditonline.gov.in). This application not only facilitates the auditing of Panchayat accounts but also provides for maintaining of audit records. This application streamlines the process for audit inquiries, draft local audit reports, draft audit paras etc. and thus ensures proper maintenance of accounts by Panchayats to improve transparency and accountability.To deliver various citizen centric services online in the rural areas and Gram Panchayats, Common Service Centres(CSCs) have been setup through a ‘Common Service Centre - Special Purpose Vehicle’ (CSC-SPV), a society of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. Under the Fourteenth Finance Commission (XIV FC) award for the period of 2015-2020, grants to the tune of Rs. 2,00,292.20 crore were allocated to GPs in 26 States. The grant was provided to GPs for delivering basic services. Under Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV FC), Grants to the tune of Rs. 60,750 crore were allocated for the interim period FY 2020-21 and Rs.2,36,805 Crore are allocated for the period FY 2021-26 to Panchayats in all the three tiers and Traditional Local Bodies and Sixth Schedule areas in 28 States. The XV FC Grants have two components—Tied and Untied. Tied Grants are to be used for drinking water, rainwater harvesting, water recycling, sanitation and maintenance of ODF status. Untied grants are to be used for felt needs under the 29 subjects enshrined in the XI schedule, except for salaries and other establishment costs. ***
