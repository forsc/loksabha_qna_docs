ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PETROLEUM & NATURAL GAS(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)******(a) & (b): Government of India has notified the National Policy on Biofuels-2018, which inter-alia aims to develop alternate fuels and to reduce import dependency as one of the objectives. The Policy envisages an indicative target of 20% blending of ethanol in petrol and 5% blending of bio-diesel in diesel by the year 2030. Under the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) programme, ethanol blending in petrol is being undertaken by the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) in whole country except island of Union Territories (UTs) of Andaman Nicobar and Lakshadweep. Further, Government has directed Indian Oil Corporation Limited to blend 15% methanol in petrol i.e. M15 for retail sale in Assam and North Eastern States on a pilot basis. Department of Food and Public Distribution (DFPD) has informed that presently, the ethanol production capacity of distilleries in country is about 350 crore litre per annum. Major share of ethanol produced by the distilleries are supplied to OMCsunder EBP. State-wise production data are not available as the inter-state supplies of ethanol to OMCs are permitted. During last three ethanol years 2015-16 to 2017-18 the distilleries have produced and supplied approximately 112, 67 and 150.5 crore litres of ethanol respectively.The percentage of ethanol blending envisaged under the EBP Programme has increased from 5% since its introduction and presently, OMCs blend up to 10% ethanol in petrol under this programme, as per ethanol availability.(c): Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) are setting twelve second generation (2G) ethanol bio-refineries for production of ethanol from various lignocellulosic biomass i.e. rice/wheat straw, bamboo, corn cob, etc. It is estimated that one bio-refinery of 100 kilo litre per day may generate direct/indirect employment to approximately 1200 persons.****
