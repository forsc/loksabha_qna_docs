                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(DR. SUBHAS SARKAR)(a) & (b): The Ministry of Education has announced the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 on 29.07.2020 after obtaining approval of the Union Cabinet. The NEP-2020, inter-alia, envisions setting up of Model public Universities for holistic and multidisciplinary education, at par with IITs, IIMs, etc., called MERUs (Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities) which will aim to attain the highest global standards in quality education. NEP further states that all programmes, courses, curricula, and pedagogy across subjects, including those in-class, online, and in ODL modes as well as student support will aim to achieve global standards of quality. The NEP-2020 also envisions setting up of a Higher Education Commission of India as an umbrella body with four independent verticals to perform distinct functions of regulation, accreditation, funding, and academic standard setting. Accordingly, the Ministry is in the process of drafting a Higher Education Commission of India Bill. (c) & (d): The University Grants Commission (UGC) has informed that it has notified the UGC (Open and Distance Learning Programmes and Online Programmes) Regulations, 2020 on 04.09.2020 and further amendment on 01.07.2021. These regulations lay down the minimum standards of instruction for the grant of degrees through Open and Distance Learning mode and online mode. The UGC has further informed that in view of the recommendation of National Education Policy (NEP)-2020 to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio in higher education including vocational education from 26.3% (2018) to 50% by 2035 and to further promote Open and Distance Learning (ODL) and online education, the UGC has constituted an Expert Committee to review existing ODL and Online regulatory framework while ensuring quality, driven by simplified recognition system and processes. *****
