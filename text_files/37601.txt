ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a), (b) and (d):    The Election Commission of India (ECI) has stated that the ECI organises National Voters Day every year on 25th January. The relevant information is enclosed at Annexure-I & Annexure-II.(c):  The details of electors of 18-19 years age group enrolled during summary revision of electoral rolls of last three years. (i.e. SSR, 2020, 2021 & 2022), as furnished by the ECI are enclosed at Annexure-III.(e):  As per the ECI, the finally published electoral roll, 2022 (w.r.t. 01.01.2022 as the qualifying date), the total number of electors in India is 95,24,81,459 (Annexure-IV). Out of this, the total number of male electors is 49,18,60,931 (51.64%) and the total number of female electors is 46,05,74,630 (48.35%).  Further, as per the Projected Population, 2022 (as per data received from States), the percentage of male and female population are approx. 51% and 49% respectively.  This indicates that enrolment of female electors in electoral roll is in the lines of census gender ratio.  The Gender ratio in electoral roll has been maintained and is in the same proportion as their share in total population.  There is no question of lesser enrolment of women in electoral roll and therefore, no corrective steps seems required to be taken.******* Annexure-INoteNational Voters’ Day’’ (NVD) is celebrated on January 25 every year since 2011.
