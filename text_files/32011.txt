ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c):  The Government of India on 15.6.1999 (further amended on 25.6.2002) has laid down the modalities for deciding the claims for inclusion in, exclusion from and other modifications in Orders specifying Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes lists. As per the modalities, only those proposals which have been recommended and justified by the concerned State Government / UT Administration and concurred with by Registrar General of India (RGI) and National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) are to be considered and legislation amended. All actions are taken as per the approved modalities in respect of ''Dora'' community. The proposal of the State Government of Odisha to include ‘Jhodia’ as synonym of ‘Paroja’ in the Scheduled Tribes list of Odisha has not been supported by the Registrar General of India twice. Hence the same was not considered by the Government and communicated to the State Government of Odisha in terms of Clause (f) of the approved modalities that prescribes that claims recommended by the concerned State Governments/Union Territory Administrations, but not agreed to by the RGI,  concerned State Government/ UT Administration would be asked to review and further justify their recommendations in the light of comments of RGI.On receipt of the further clarification from the State Government/ Union Territory Administration, the proposal would again be referred to the RGI for comment .In such cases, where the RGI does not agree to the point of view of the State Government/ Union Territory Administration on a second reference, the Government of India may consider rejection of the said proposals. . *****
