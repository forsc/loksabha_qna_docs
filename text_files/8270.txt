                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a)  	Under the Anganwadi Services {under Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Schemes}, 14 lakh Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) have been sanctioned out of which 13.77 lakh are operational. State/UT-wise details of these AWCs are given at Annexure-I. There is no proposal to expand the scheme, presently. (b) 	As decided by the Government, NITI Aayog is to conduct the third party evaluation of ICDS Scheme.(c) 	Ministry has received 141 complaints/grievances during this year i.e. January, 2019 to November, 2019 in respect of malpractices in the implementation of Anganwadi Services. The implementation, administration, management & monitoring of the Anganwadi Services are done by the concerned State Government/UT Administration. Therefore, complaints/grievances are forwarded to concerned States/UTs for taking further appropriate action. (d) 	The Government of India allocates the funds to the States/UTs annually on the basis of Annual Programme Implementation Plans (APIPs) submitted by the States/UTs. These APIPs are considered and recommended by the Empowered Programe Committee and funds are released quarterly on the basis of SoEs (Statement of Expenditures) and UCs (Utilization Certificates). Funds in the form of grants-in-aid are released to States/UTs through PFMS. Further disbursement of funds are to be done by the respective State Governments/UT Administrations. (e)  	To strengthen the performance of Anganwadi Services Scheme, Government has introduced 5-tier monitoring & review mechanism at different levels (National/State/District/Block and Anganwadi Level) for which guidelines have been issued on 31.03.2011.		Further, POSHAN Abhiyaan empowers the frontline functionaries i.e. Anganwadi Workers and Lady Supervisors by providing them with smart phones. ICDS-Common Application Software (ICDS-CAS) have been developed under POSHAN Abhiyaan which enables data capture, ensures assigned service delivery and prompts for interventions wherever required. It enables collection of information on ICDS service delivery interventions and its impact on nutrition outcomes in beneficiaries. 	This data/information is then available on web-based ICDS-CAS dashboard on a near real time basis, for monitoring, at the Block, District, State and National level for action and decision making at their end. The dashboard displays data and provides reports on various programme areas to the administrative officers to interpret and use the information for improving service delivery. As on 25.11.2019, a total number of 5,43,863 Anganwadi Workers are using the ICDS-CAS Application across 36 States/UTs as per details in Annexure-II. (f)  	The Government has, recently, enhanced honorarium of AWWs from ? 3,000/- to ? 4,500/- per month; AWWs at mini-AWCs from ? 2,250/- to ? 3,500/- per month; AWHs from ? 1,500/- to ? 2,250/- per month. The Government has also introduced performance linked incentive of ? 250/- per month to AWHs effective from 1st October, 2018. AWWs are paid performance linked incentive of ? 500/- per month for using ICDS-CAS (Common Application Software) under POSHAN Abhiyaan. Most of the States/UTs are also giving monetary incentives to these workers out of their own resources. (g)  	There is no proposal to establish more than the approved number of Anganwadi Centres in the country, at present.*********                  Annexure-IStatement referred to in part (a) of Lok Sabha Un-Starred Q.
