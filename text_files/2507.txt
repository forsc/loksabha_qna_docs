Several reform measures have been proposed in the Draft NEP 2019, so that allstudents have equitable access to quality education across the country.The Draft NEP 2019 proposes that for 3-8 year olds (Foundational Stage) - aflexible, multi-level, play-based, activity-based, and discovery-based system of learning isfollowed. It also proposes that school complexes can house shared facilities and equipmentat the secondary school that cannot be provided separately to each individual school. Itstates that audio-video systems with a portable generator can be taken around from school toschool. Similarly, a secondary school may have a good laboratory, musical instruments, andplaygrounds with sports equipment that students from the pre-primary, primary, and upperprimary schools in the complex may be given access to on a regular basis.The Draft NEP 2019 also proposes that the undergraduate degree will move towardsa strong liberal education approach, and can be of either three- or four-year duration. HigherEducation Institutions (HEIs) may offer multiple exit options within this period, withappropriate certification, such as an advanced diploma in a discipline or field (includingvocational and professional areas) after completing two years of study or a diploma aftercompleting one year. The three-year programme will lead to a Bachelors degree. A fouryearduration programme will offer the full possibilities for a transformed liberalundergraduate education programme, and shall be called a Liberal Arts programme,resulting in a Bachelor of Liberal Arts (BLA) or Bachelor of Liberal Education (BLE)degree with Research.At this stage, the draft NEP 2019 has been uploaded on MHRD’s website and also atinnovate.mygov.in platform to elicit suggestions/comments from all stakeholders includingthe public, Government of India Ministries and State Governments. The Government willfinalize the National Education Policy only after considering the inputs/suggestions andcomments of all stakeholders.**********
