VASANTHAKUMAR REGARDING DEFICIENCIES IN NATIONAL HIGHWAYS(a) to (c)	The development and maintenance of National Highways (NHs) is a continuous process. The main reason for deficiencies in certain NH stretches are due to inadequate pavement thickness / composition of State roads while handing over them to the Central Government after declaration of these roads as new NHs. The works on such NHs as well as other NHs are taken up from time to time as per inter-se priority, traffic density and availability of funds to keep the NHs in traffic worthy conditions. The Ministry took up development of NHs/ roads under various phases of National Highways Development Project (NHDP), Special Accelerated Road Development Programme for the North East Region (SARDP-NE) including Arunachal Pradesh Package of Roads, Special Programme for Development of Roads in the Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas, Externally Aided Projects (EAP), National Highways (Original) [NH(O)] scheme, including construction of stand-alone Railway Over Bridges (ROBs) / Railway Under Bridges (RUBs), construction / reconstruction of bridges and permanent engineering measures for rectification of accident prone areas, etc.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the proposal for investment approval for Phase-I of “Bharatmala Pariyojana” during its meeting held on 24.10.2017. “Bharatmala Pariyojana” Phase–I includes development of about 24,800 km length of NHs / roads and balance length of about 10,000 km of NHs under NHDP. The programme is targeted for completion in 2021-2022. Scope of Bharatmala Pariyojana Phase-I includes comprehensive development of the NHs/roads including removal of choke points / congestion points through development of bypasses, ring roads, etc. and through development of Multimodal Logistics Parks to enable freight aggregation and disaggregation and effective modal transfer, development of wayside amenities, construction / reconstruction of bridges, other structures, ROBs/RUBs, etc.The approved Financing Plan of the Bharatmala Pariyojana Phase-I and other NH/road development schemes under Central Roads Sector envisages total investment of Rs. 6,92,324 crore upto 2021-22.The above programmes envisage capacity augmentation and development of NHs, including construction of ROBs / RUBs, construction / reconstruction of bridges, removal of congestion, etc., with due regard to safety aspects. The Maintenance and Repair (M&R) of stretches of NHs, where either Development works have commenced or Operation, Maintenance and Transfer (OMT) Concessions/ Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Contracts have been awarded, are the responsibility of the concerned Concessioners/ Contractors till the Defect Liability Period (DLP) / the Concession Period. M&R of balance stretches of NHs, are carried out annually as per available budgetary outlay, inter-se priority and traffic density to keep such NHs in traffic worthy conditions.*****
