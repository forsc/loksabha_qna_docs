                                                        THE MINISTER OF MINES, COAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a) to (c): Yes, Sir. A large number of mines are non-functional in the State of Jharkhand. As per information provided by Indian Bureau of Mines (a subordinate office of this Ministry), there are 110 mines non-working in the State of Jharkhand as on 01.04.2019. Details of such mines are given at Annexure. Commencement of mining operations in such leases would be subject to obtaining the necessary clearances. Reportedly, these mines are non-functional/non-working for not having the Environment Clearance and the Forest Clearance from the concerned authorities. Action for resumption of mining activity is an ongoing activity undertaken by the State Government on a case-to-case basis.***** ANNEXURE-PQ 3992Mineral wise working and non-working mines as on 01.04.2019 in the State of Jharkhand              State 	Mineral	Working	Non-Working	Total    JHARKHAND         	BAUXITE	19	25	44	GRAPHITE	2	14	16	LIME STONE	1	39	40	FLINTSTONE	0	2	2	GARNET	0	1	1	MEGNETITE	0	3	3	COPPER	2	1	3	GOLD	1	1	2	IRON	10	14	24	IRON & MN	1	3	4	MN	1	0	1	KYANITE	0	7	7	TOTAL	37110147Source: Indian Bureau of Mines
