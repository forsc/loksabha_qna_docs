In order to assess the declining/rising trend in water level on a long-term basis, pre-monsoon water level data 2018 has been compared with the decadal average (2008-2017) water level.  Analysis of data indicates decline in ground water level in about 52% of the wells being monitored.  State-wise details including Rajasthan are given at Annexure. (d) to (e) Water being a State subject, efforts to conserve and manage ground water is primarily States responsibility.
