ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) & (b) :     Sir, no constraints are faced in the implementation of ‘One Nation One Grid’ Scheme. In fact, ‘One Nation One Grid’ has already been achieved by integrating the five electricity regional grids into one interconnected and synchronous National electricity grid. The capacity of inter-regional transmission links in the country has increased from 37,950 MW on 31.03.2014 to 100,550 MW on 30.11.2019.  (c) :	        Electricity is a concurrent subject. As per provision of the Electricity Act, 2003, the responsibility for fixing retail supply tariff of electricity falls under the purview of respective State Electricity Regulatory Commissions. Retail Supply tariff of electricity depends upon various factors like power purchase cost and other operational and financial parameters of Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) and it varies across the DISCOMs throughout the country.  Hence, there is no plan of the Government for having uniform electricity tariff plan for all sectors of power in country. (d) :		As per the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003, the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions while determining the tariffs are guided by the Tariff Policy. Tariff Policy, 2016 provides that the State Government can provide subsidy to the extent they can consider appropriate as per provision of section 65 of the Act by adopting the following broad principles: (i)	Consumers below poverty line who consume below a specified level, as prescribed in the National Electricity Policy may receive a special support through cross subsidy. Tariffs for such designated group of consumers will be at least 50% of the average cost of supply. (ii)	For achieving the objective that the tariff progressively reflects the cost of supply of electricity, the Appropriate Commission would notify a roadmap such that tariffs are brought within ±20% of the average cost of supply. The roadmap would also have intermediate milestones, based on the approach of a gradual reduction in cross subsidy.(e) :       Government of India is extending financial assistance to all States including Bihar through their various Centrally Sponsored Schemes like Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) and Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana -Saubhagya for upgradation and augmentation of the electricity distribution infrastructure and for providing universal electricity access to all villages and households so that the concerned State Government/DISCOMs can provide reliable and quality 24x7 power to their consumers, which inter-alia would enhance the per-capita consumption.**************
