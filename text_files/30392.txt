                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (e): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1821 BY SHRI  GUMAN SINGH DAMOR TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 08.12.2021 REGARDING INDORE-DAHOD RAILWAY LINE(a) & (b) :  Dahod-Indore via Sardarpur, Jhabua & Dhar (204.76 km)  new line project was included in Budget 2007-08. Subsequently, a change in alignment via Amjhera (4.82 km) as a material modification to the main work was also sanctioned. The anticipated cost of the project is ` 1640.04 crore. An expenditure of ` 867.38 crore has been incurred upto March 2021. An outlay of ` 20 crore has been provided for this project in Budget 2021-22.  In addition, ` 50 crore has also been provided to this project.	Indore-Rau-Tihi section (21 km) has been commissioned. Further, Tihi-Pithampur (8.9 km) including 3 km tunnel work and Katwara-Dahod (11.40 km) sections are taken up.	The completion of any Railway project(s) depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, deposition of cost share by State Government in cost sharing projects, priority of projects, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project(s) site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions etc. and all these factors affect the completion time of the project(s). As such, a confirm time frame for completion of this project cannot be given.(c)  Ratlam-Dungarpur via Banswara new line (188.85 km) project was sanctioned in 2011 with a cost sharing arrangement of 50:50 between Government of Rajasthan and Ministry of Railways and land to be provided free of cost by Government of Rajasthan. However, Rajasthan Government later on expressed inability to share the cost of the project .Bankability Study for the project was carried out and as per the bankability report, cost of the project (excluding cost of land) has been assessed as ` 4262 crores with Rate of Return (RoR) of only 2.4% without the cost of land, and a negative RoR with the cost of land. Rajasthan Government was requested for exploring the possibility of implementing the project either through Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) or State Joint Venture (JV), and providing the land free of cost, to make the project viable. No response has been received so far from the State Government in this regard. (d) & (e) :  Dahod will be connected to Khandwa on completion of Dahod-Indore new line project and Mhow-Khandwa gauge conversion project. On the suggested alignment one survey for Khandwa-Dhar via Khargone and Barwani has also been taken up.****
