                                                        MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a) & (b): Coal India Limited endeavours to obtain all statutory clearances/licenses before commencement of coal production.  During the course of coal production all statutory provisions under various Acts, Rules and Regulations are observed for conducting various activities. As such, there is no illegal mining in the lease-hold areas of Coal India Limited. Illegal mining of coal is reported to be carried out mainly from abandoned mines, shallow coal seams situated at remote/isolated places from the mines and are scattered over a large area. It is a Law & Order problem which is a State subject, hence primarily; falls under the domain of the State/District administration to take necessary deterrent action to stop/curb illegal mining of coal. The Management of subsidiary companies lodges FIR with local Thana to take necessary action. State/District administration take further action against the lodged FIR. Following steps are taken to check Illegal mining of coal in CIL:•	Concrete walls have been erected on the mouth of the abandoned mines to prevent ccess and illegal activities in these areas.•	Surprise raids/checks being conducted jointly by security personnel and law and order authorities of the concerned State Government.•	Dumping of the overburden is being done on the outcrop zones.•	Installation of check-posts at vulnerable points.•	Training of existing security/CISF personnel, refresher training and basic training of new recruits in security discipline for strengthening the security setup;•	Maintaining close liaison with the State authorities.•	Committee/task force has been constituted at different level (block level, sub-divisional level, district level, state level) in some subsidiaries of CIL to monitor different aspects of illegal mining. However, in addition to the above provisions, the Government of India has launched one mobile app namely “Khanan Prahari” and one web app Coal Mine Surveillance and Management System (CMSMS) for reporting unauthorized coal mining activities so that monitoring and taking suitable action on it can be done by Law & Order authority. (c): Cumulative Monthly Report of Coal Mines Surveillance and Management System (CMSMS – Khanan Prahari) upto February, 2021 is attached as Annexure-I.(d): No such racket is reported in CIL.(e) & (f): Not applicable in view to reply given at (d) above. ******* Annexure-ICumulative Monthly Report of Coal Mines Surveillance and Management System(CMSMS-Khanan Prahari) upto February-2021I.
