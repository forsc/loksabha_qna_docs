MURALEEDHARAN] 	   	The Ministry of External Affairs does not capture detailed State-wise data on persons going abroad. The Ministry has data on emigration check required (ECR) passport holders and nurses who go for employment to the 18 ECR designated countries, as such persons need to take clearance through the E-migrate platform before being allowed to emigrate. According to this data, the number of persons who have emigrated from the State of Odisha district-wise, for employment may be seen at Annexure ‘A’.Majority of the workers have gone for work in Construction, welding, carpentary and technical sector.
