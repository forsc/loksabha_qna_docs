ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c) :	The Government monitors the retail and wholesale prices of 22 essential food commodities submitted by the 179 price monitoring centres that have been set up with Central assistance by State Governments and UT Administrations across the country. Taking into account price trends, the Government takes various measures from time to time to augment domestic availability and stabilize prices of essential food commodities. These steps, inter alia, include releases from the buffer to cool down prices, imposition of stock limits, monitoring of stocks declared by entities to prevent hoarding as also requisite changes in trade policy instruments like rationalization of import duty, changes in import quota, restrictions on exports of the commodity etc.In May, 2021 advisories were issued to States/UTs to monitor prices of essential food commodities and to ensure disclosure of pulses stocks held by millers, importers and traders under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Imposition of stock limit on all pulses except Moong was notified on 2.7.21. Thereafter, an amended order was issued on 19.7.21 imposing stock limits on four pulses, namely, Tur, Urad, Masur, Chana for a period up to 31.10.2021.To improve availability and stabilise prices of pulses, the Government has allowed import of Tur, Urad and Moong under ‘Free category’ w.e.f May 15, 2021 till October 31, 2021 in order to ensure smooth and seamless imports. The Free regime was thereafter extended till March 31, 2022; the last date for Bill of Lading is March 31, 2022, and for Customs clearance, it is June 30, 2022. This policy measure has been supported with facilitation measures and close monitoring of its implementation by the concerned Departments/organisations. The import policy measures have resulted in substantial increase in import of Tur, Urad and Moong as compared to the corresponding period for the past two years. In order to soften the impact of higher international prices on domestic consumers, the Government reduced the basic import duty on Masur from 10% to zero and AIDC (Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess) from 20% to 10% from 27th July, 2021. To augment the availability of pulses in the market, 3 Lakh Metric Ton of Chana stock has been released between June and August, 2021 through open market sales and to stabilise prices, futures trading in Chana has been suspended from 16th August, 2021. State Governments have been supplied pulses from the buffer on an ongoing basis for their nutrition and welfare programmes. In order to stabilise retail prices of onion, a buffer stock of 2.08 LMT onion has been built in 2021- 22. Open market releases of onion from the buffer had been targeted towards States/Cities where prices are increasing over the previous month and also in source markets to augment the availability in these key mandis and thereby reduce retail prices. States/UTs had been offered onion at Rs.21/kg ex-storage locations and same has been lifted by some States. Through these measures, the Government has made effective interventions for containing the prices of onion.In order to improve the domestic availability of edible oils and to keep prices under control, the Government has rationalized the duty structure on edible oils by reducing the effective duties. As per the notification dated 14-10-2021, the total duty on crude palm oil has been reduced from 22.5% to 7.5%, and on crude soyabean oil and sunflower oil it has been reduced from 22.5% to 5%. The basic duty on RBD palmolein oil, refined soyabean oil and refined sunflower oil has been reduced from 32.5% to 17.5%. Thereafter, the basic duty on refined palm oil has been further reduced from 17.5% to 12.5% w.e.f 21-12-2021. Futures trading in essential commodities relating to food security has been suspended to curb speculative trading. Stock limits on edible oils and oilseeds have been imposed for a period upto 31st March, 2022 to prevent hoarding. Further, the Government has issued advisory to States/UTs to set up the State-level Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) corpus with central assistance, and has requested States which have set up the Fund already, to make appropriate interventions for cooling down retail prices of essential food commodities. All-India Average Retail Prices of 22 essential food commodities for the last five years are at Annexure. ***** ANNEXURE ANNEXURE REFERRED IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 77 FOR 02.02.2022 REGARDING HIKE IN PRICES OF COMMODITIES.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ALL-INDIA RETAIL AVERAGE PRICES OF 22 ESSENTIAL FOOD ITEMS (Rs./Kg.)S.No.	Commodities	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21	2021-22*1	Rice	27.71	29.57	30.09	32.46	35.26	35.652	Wheat	23.80	23.75	24.74	27.50	28.22	26.983	 Atta (Wheat)	25.64	26.08	26.80	28.95	31.17	30.504	 Gram Dal	98.21	80.00	65.11	65.92	70.42	75.795	Tur/Arhar Dal	121.19	78.66	71.17	84.90	99.57	105.766	Urad Dal	128.57	85.33	70.23	83.77	104.49	107.707	Moong Dal	89.14	76.24	74.03	86.27	106.01	103.508	 Masoor Dal	81.60	66.81	61.33	64.12	78.04	89.989	Groundnut Oil (Packed)	133.42	129.18	125.80	132.57	153.62	178.5810	Mustard Oil (Packed)	109.41	106.04	106.81	111.92	130.63	174.5811	Vanaspati (Packed)	75.83	78.09	80.73	82.26	99.03	133.8412	Soya Oil (Packed)	83.77	85.62	90.29	94.04	109.45	150.9913	Sunflower Oil (Packed)	94.71	93.13	97.33	101.87	123.89	168.5414	Palm Oil (Packed)	70.15	71.14	77.13	79.44	98.79	130.8415	Potato	18.78	15.11	19.35	20.84	30.54	21.1416	Onion	15.62	27.27	19.18	39.47	34.73	30.4617	Tomato	24.26	32.77	22.32	31.45	33.44	33.1118	Sugar	40.37	42.38	38.26	38.92	39.91	40.7419	Gur	42.74	44.98	42.71	45.16	48.24	47.5720	Milk (Rs./Ltr.)	40.20	41.91	42.53	44.36	47.24	49.2121	Tea Loose	198.86	204.46	209.46	214.82	238.36	280.5722	Salt Pack (Iodised)	14.99	15.11	15.28	15.50	16.74	18.17*-till Dec, 2021*****
