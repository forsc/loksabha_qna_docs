T.R. PAARIVENDHAR TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 18.03.2020 REGARDING EXPANSION OF RAIL NETWORK(a) to (e): Yes, Sir. Railways is giving a big thrust to infrastructure creation and capacity augmentation. Railway Projects are taken up on the basis of remunerativeness, last mile connectivity, missing links and alternate routes,  augmentation of congested/saturated lines, socio-economic considerations etc. depending upon throwforward of ongoing projects, overall availability of funds and competing demands and sanctioning of projects is a continuous process.  Railway Projects are sanctioned Zone-wise and not State-wise, as, Indian Railway’s network is straddled across various State boundaries. Further, details of ongoing Railway Projects in the country including Southern Railway is appended and with progressive commissioning of sections, existing rail network would also expand accordingly.  The project-wise detail including cost, expenditure and outlay are available in public domain on Indian Railways’ website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in >Ministry of Railways >Railway Board >About Indian Railways >Railway Board Directorates >Finance (Budget) >Pink Book (year) >Railway-wise Works Machinery & Rolling Stock Programme.BUDGET ALLOCATION ON INDIAN RAILWAYSAverage Annual Budget allotment for New Line, Gauge Conversion and Doubling Projects on Indian Railways, during 2014-19 has increased to `26,026 crore, from `11,527 crore (during 2009-14), which is 126% more as compared to average allotment during 2009-14.
