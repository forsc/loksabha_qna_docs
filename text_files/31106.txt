THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI SOM PARKASH)(a): 	The number of jobs generated in last three years in the country, as reported by startups recognized by DPIIT, is as follows:<pre>Year	Jobs Reported by Recognized Startups (as on 08th  December  2021)2018	935272019	1426462020	1697242021             (till 08th December)	192427Total	598324 </pre>The number of jobs generated in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh in last three years, as reported by startups recognized by DPIIT, is as follows:<pre>Year	Jobs Reported by Recognized Startups from Maharashtra (as on 08th December  2021)	Jobs Reported by Recognized Startups from Madhya Pradesh (as on 08th December  2021)	 2018	18779	2419	 2019	25389	4561	 2020	33108	3614	 2021 (till 08th December)	37257	6425	  Total	114533	17019	 </pre> There is no centralized compilation of information on year-wise contribution made by startups in the Gross Domestic Production of the country. (b): 	Government of India as part of Startup India initiative has implemented Fund of Funds for Startups (FFS) Scheme and Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS) across all States/UTs to promote private investment in the Startups through Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) and incubators. Under FFS, a corpus of Rs. 10,000 crore has been sanctioned, spread over 14th and 15th Finance Commission cycles. Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) is the nodal bank under this Scheme. The FFS Scheme does not directly provide financial assistance to startups, instead supports SEBI- registered Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), who in turn invest money in growing Indian startups through equity and equity-linked instruments.Under the Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS), Rs. 945 crore has been sanctioned for period of 4 years starting from 2021-22. The funds are released to Startups through approved Incubators. Further, 49 key regulatory changes to enhance ease of doing business, raising capital and reducing compliance burden have been undertaken. This includes insurers, EPFO, non-government provident funds, superannuation, and gratuity funds to invest in AIFs, thereby enabling billions of dollars’ worth of domestic capital being made available for the Indian startup ecosystem. The list of the 49 key regulatory reforms is placed at Annexure-I. Furthermore, requirement of prior turnover and experience has been relaxed to encourage startups to participate for tenders. Startups have been exempted from requirement of earnest money deposit. ‘GeM Startup Runway’ has been launched with dedicated corner for startups to sell products and services to Government. As on 3rd October, 2021, 11,386 startups had been on boarded on GeM, with 93,908 orders from public entities.*****
