                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (e) : In order to ensure effective implementation of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act (the SH Act), 2013, Ministry of Women and Child Development has developed an online complaint management system titled the Sexual Harassment electronic–Box (SHe-Box, www.shebox.nic.in) for registering complaints related to sexual harassment of women at workplace. The portal has been developed to provide a platform to women working or visiting any workplace of Central Government (Central Ministries, Departments, Public Sector Undertakings, Autonomous Bodies and Institutions etc.), State Government or private organisation to file complaints related to sexual harassment at workplace under the SH Act. Those who have already filed a written complaint with the concerned Internal Committee (IC) or Local Committee (LC) constituted under the SH Act are also eligible to file their complaints through this portal.  The objective of SHe-Box is to help in creating an enabling environment at workplace so that more and more women could join the workforce. In addition, the Ministry has also developed an online platform known as ‘Sakhi Dashboard’ for monitoring cases of women approaching One Stop Centres (OSCs), Women Help Lines (WHLs) and Mahila Police Volunteers (MPVs) in situations of distress, violence or harassment. *****
