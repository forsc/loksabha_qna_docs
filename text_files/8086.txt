ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): The Government is committed to the strategic disinvestment of Air India and has constituted an Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM) to guide the process of strategic disinvestment from time to time. Earlier, Preliminary Information Memorandum (PIM) for inviting Expression of Interest (EOI) for the strategic disinvestment of Air India was issued on 28.03.2018. However, no bids were received till the last date for receiving the bids. AISAM has now approved the re-initiation of the strategic disinvestment of Air India and its subsidiaries. The preparation of Preliminary Information Memorandum (PIM) for inviting Expression of Interest (EOI) for the strategic disinvestment of Air India is in process.The Government has decided to disinvest Air India due to its fragile finances and its continued and accumulated losses. Further financial support to revive the airline in a mature and competitive aviation market would not be the best use of scarce financial resources of the Government. ;
