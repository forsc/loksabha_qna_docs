                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) to (d):  ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibility to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens including women are with the respective State Governments. The State governments are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provision of law. As per provisions of Section 357A of Cr.PC, States/ Union Territories (UTs) must notify the Victim Compensation Scheme. In terms of “Compensation Scheme for Women Victims/ Survivors of Sexual Assault/ Other Crimes – 2018”, amount of compensation, as decided by the State Legal Services Authorities or District Legal Services Authorities, shall be paid to the women victims or her dependents who have suffered loss or injury of an offence and who require rehabilitation.  However, Ministry of Home Affairs has released financial assistance of Rs.200.00 crores as one time grant out of Nirbhaya Fund to States and UTs during 2016-17 to support and supplement their existing Victim Compensation Schemes under the Central Victim Compensation Fund (CVCF).  *****
