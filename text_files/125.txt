The Government is promoting innovations and start-up activities in a big way. In order to enhance and improve crop productivity, district-level Agro-advisory services for farmers have been implemented. A number of  water technology initiatives have been initiated to promote R&D activities for providing safe drinking water at affordable cost. Several initiatives aimed at producing clean and green energy have been initiated. Some major successes have been achieved in the area of health, hygiene and sanitation to fulfill the dream of Swasth Bharat.
