ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a)	Details of India’s exports of value-added agricultural products/ processed food items during the last three years and the current year are at Annexure.(b)	Data on share of India in the global trade of value-added agricultural products and processed food items is not maintained. (c)	Promotion of exports of agriculture products, including processed food products, is a continuous process. The Government has taken several steps at State/ District levels to promote exports. State specific Action Plans have been prepared and State Level Monitoring Committees (SLMCs), Nodal Agencies for agricultural exports and Cluster Level Committees have been formed in a number of States. Country and product-specific action plans have also been formulated to promote exports. It has also been decided that the District as Export Hub Initiative of the Department of Commerce would be utilized to achieve the objectives of Agriculture Export Policy.	A Farmer Connect Portal has been set up for providing a platform for farmers, Farmer-Producer Organizations (FPOs) and cooperatives to interact with exporters. Buyer-seller Meets (BSMs) have been organized in the clusters to provide export-market linkages. Regular interactions, through videoconferences, have been held with the Indian Missions abroad, to assess and exploit export opportunities. Country specific BSMs, through Indian Missions, have also been organized.The Government has also introduced a Central Sector Scheme – ‘Transport and Marketing Assistance for Specified Agriculture Products’ – for providing assistance for the international component of freight, to mitigate the freight disadvantage for the export of agriculture products. The Department of Commerce provides assistance through several other schemes, to promote exports, including exports of processed food products viz. Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES), Market Access Initiatives (MAI) Scheme etc. In addition, assistance to the exporters of processed food products is also available under the Export Promotion Schemes of Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), Tea Board, Coffee Board, and Spices Board.(d)	Yes, Sir. The Agriculture Export Policy provides that the processed agricultural products will not be brought under the ambit of any kind of export restriction (viz. Minimum Export Price, Export duty, Export bans, Export quota, Export capping, Export permit etc.) even if the primary agricultural product is brought under some kind of export restrictions. This step is aimed at providing a stable policy environment for non-essential agricultural products and encouraging exports of processed/ value-added products rather than the basic commodities. As quantity of exports of value added agricultural/ processed food items vis-a-vis total domestic production is not very high, the impact on domestic prices is likely to be insignificant.  *****  AnnexureExport of Value-Added Agricultural Products/ Processed Food ItemsQty. in ''000 units; Value in USD millionPrincipal Commodity Groups	UNIT	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21	2021-22 (Apr-Nov) 	 	QTY	VAL	QTY	VAL	QTY	VAL	QTY	VALSPICES	KGS	1133889.44	3322.45	1193440.93	3621.38	1607058.51	3983.98	996017.35	2661.28SUGAR	TON	3989.66	1360.29	5798.53	1966.44	7517.92	2789.91	5409.02	2267.64BUFFALO MEAT	TON	1233.38	3587.15	1152.32	3199.60	1085.61	3171.13	764.15	2216.97CASTOR OIL	KGS	619376.57	883.78	593907.47	894.36	734336.46	917.24	513761.60	812.30MISC PROCESSED ITEMS	 	0.00	659.18	0.00	647.07	0.00	866.04	0.00	740.71OIL MEALS	TON	4493.29	1508.65	2655.79	827.90	4366.55	1585.04	1909.32	628.93COFFEE	KGS	282839.90	822.34	257032.45	738.86	245209.80	719.66	210458.23	621.45PROCESSED FRUITS AND JUICES	KGS	594487.33	639.65	568883.01	646.83	532870.72	695.56	410113.33	506.13TEA	KGS	270306.40	830.93	254800.66	826.53	212687.66	756.26	134867.73	501.52CEREAL PREPARATIONS	TON	347.81	551.72	342.65	548.29	403.99	636.97	266.77	418.54AYUSH AND HERBAL PRODUCTS	KGS	108051.06	448.07	92241.99	428.08	120558.43	539.88	84479.32	390.82GROUNDNUT	TON	489.19	472.59	664.44	715.81	638.32	727.21	301.95	374.06DAIRY PRODUCTS	KGS	180688.06	481.55	111171.61	280.43	118334.27	323.09	105444.60	314.69CASHEW	TON	78.22	654.43	84.37	566.82	70.11	420.43	56.23	302.22PROCESSED VEGETABLES	KGS	228967.00	293.96	223308.25	311.71	367098.92	424.70	264905.70	285.49GUERGAM MEAL	TON	513.22	674.88	381.88	461.53	234.88	262.99	209.37	257.72TOBACCO MANUFACTURED	 	0.00	411.04	0.00	374.77	0.00	359.17	0.00	226.59ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES	LTR	231601.93	300.91	139453.18	232.68	250333.16	330.22	125572.67	186.30MILLED PRODUCTS	KGS	307419.30	151.86	286450.15	151.56	397056.20	207.13	367249.48	163.55VEGETABLE OILS	TON	49.96	106.79	85.24	170.09	302.22	604.12	49.43	123.07MOLLASES	TON	845.96	83.79	593.62	72.97	1317.68	178.75	726.05	111.37COCOA PRODUCTS	KGS	27607.09	192.69	27432.78	180.10	25776.77	149.78	18118.98	100.97ANIMAL CASINGS	KGS	14882.83	68.27	12816.18	56.10	13887.74	56.23	10212.67	46.74SHEEP/GOAT MEAT	TON	21.67	124.65	14.37	92.62	7.11	44.64	5.65	39.04CASHEW NUT SHELL LIQUID	KGS	5300.66	3.87	4605.09	3.25	3735.92	2.66	3205.26	2.75PROCESSED MEAT	TON	0.41	2.00	0.44	2.17	0.78	1.71	0.38	1.06TOTAL	 	18637.46	 	18017.94	 	20754.48	 	14301.93Source: DGCI&S******
