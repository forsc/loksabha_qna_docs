ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)  (a)	 to (e):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 416  FOR ANSWER ON 24th MARCH, 2021  REGARDING   “EXPORT OF RICE”.(a) & (b): Yes, Sir. Reduction of import duty on rice by Bangladesh is likely to result in higher imports of rice by that country which may result in higher exports of rice from India to Bangladesh. During the current financial year (April, 2020 – January, 2021), India’s export of non-basmati rice to Bangladesh has increased to 1.47 lakh MT, as compared to 0.12 lakh MT during the corresponding period of 2019-20. However, as exports are affected by several factors such as demand, supply and relative prices, both domestic and international prevailing, an estimate of the quantity of export of non-basmati rice to Bangladesh and amount of foreign exchange to be earned, potentially, is difficult to make.(c) :	The promotion of exports of agricultural commodities like non-basmati rice is an ongoing process. The Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), an autonomous organisation under the administrative control of the Department of Commerce, has the mandate to promote exports of non-basmati rice. APEDA provides assistance to the exporters of non-basmati rice under various component of its scheme “Agriculture & Processed Food Export Promotion Scheme of APEDA” viz. Infrastructure Development, Quality Development and Market Development. An Export Promotion Forum (EPF) has also been established under the aegis of APEDA to promote exports of basmati as well as non-basmati rice. Assistance is also provided to exporters / State Governments under various other schemes of Department of Commerce viz. Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES), Market Access Initiative (MAI) Scheme, etc.(d) :	The details of total export of non-basmati rice from the country during the last three years and the current financial year (Apr-Jan), along with the names of countries to which these exports were made, are at Annexure-I.(e): 	Basmati rice is a notified commodity under the Export (Quality Control and Inspection) Act, 1963, and is subject to quality control and inspection prior to export in accordance with Export of Basmati Rice (Quality Control and Inspection) Rules, 2003 and related orders issued from time to time. Registration of contracts with APEDA, prior to shipment, is also mandatory for export of Basmati rice.********  Annexure-IEXPORT OF NON-BASMATI RICEQty in ''000 MT; Value in USD million 	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21 (Apr-Jan)COUNTRY	Qty	Value	Qty	Value	Qty	Value	Qty	ValueBENIN	778.78	314.19	699.01	264.16	535.25	195.90	987.76	353.44NEPAL	624.86	240.40	768.97	281.15	681.17	245.30	1034.60	319.64TOGO	123.60	47.98	252.38	93.18	302.83	107.90	710.03	257.56COTE D'' IVOIRE	398.49	148.95	438.09	163.17	293.89	107.70	549.51	196.97GUINEA	461.98	173.81	467.69	175.93	327.42	120.41	519.36	191.09SENEGAL	833.06	263.22	720.48	220.83	217.77	67.49	615.28	183.78MALAYSIA	9.15	6.09	30.33	13.77	73.34	28.62	353.63	135.59U ARAB EMTS	273.77	149.21	291.58	147.69	249.53	130.92	239.34	118.85SOMALIA	328.26	125.38	326.92	120.89	346.06	122.95	342.31	117.03MADAGASCAR	184.28	65.16	148.73	48.96	10.95	3.69	366.76	111.34IRAQ	77.33	50.20	61.24	36.53	87.96	50.33	217.34	108.81LIBERIA	264.15	100.20	301.11	116.97	219.85	79.94	285.28	105.45DJIBOUTI	220.02	80.19	267.18	90.70	192.79	69.04	288.88	96.58SAUDI ARAB	129.33	73.38	184.80	98.29	115.28	62.08	163.41	88.11SOUTH AFRICA	142.72	55.08	149.88	54.35	149.64	51.90	218.19	76.88BANGLADESH PR	2037.98	835.39	529.94	219.35	13.08	12.12	147.29	63.85MOZAMBIQUE	2.07	0.80	10.97	3.90	12.81	4.51	161.30	55.04RUSSIA	53.93	22.33	71.67	28.16	91.64	35.03	118.99	45.17CAMEROON	47.14	19.02	7.54	2.37	9.64	3.49	125.11	44.43KENYA	10.69	5.28	31.35	12.18	7.54	3.41	120.85	43.31U S A	40.49	33.28	42.77	34.49	39.26	31.36	52.94	41.44SINGAPORE	66.50	35.74	66.16	32.86	81.93	41.01	94.26	40.55ALGERIA	28.38	11.64	56.56	22.43	50.29	18.66	105.07	39.44QATAR	97.44	54.05	101.72	53.25	86.98	45.54	77.17	39.11VIETNAM SOC REP	0.93	2.45	0.88	2.18	0.39	0.78	115.50	35.44OMAN	64.07	34.88	76.83	38.41	54.34	28.69	68.22	34.69YEMEN REPUBLC	84.78	52.00	75.71	45.42	42.19	24.76	60.35	33.27ANGOLA	17.09	6.42	33.57	13.12	33.21	13.62	79.11	29.45PHILIPPINES	6.67	15.62	106.67	57.79	7.13	16.98	23.11	27.47CHINA P RP	0.09	0.05	0.97	0.97	1.57	0.78	87.45	26.93ETHIOPIA	58.74	21.52	87.51	31.21	67.15	24.30	76.01	25.38SIERRA LEONE	46.32	17.63	48.17	17.70	33.65	12.48	71.51	25.10GHANA	77.44	30.37	68.83	26.94	55.46	21.22	67.96	24.81BURKINA FASO	20.05	7.70	47.51	17.33	36.28	12.66	64.33	22.89NIGER	101.44	39.94	76.19	27.23	21.67	7.49	54.65	19.22KUWAIT	36.93	22.29	45.05	25.48	36.13	20.02	35.18	19.16TURKEY	92.89	41.39	45.27	21.52	23.93	13.36	38.61	18.40BHUTAN	4.42	1.75	2.35	0.88	37.23	12.90	43.81	17.80CONGO P REP	2.32	0.99	2.85	1.12	5.84	2.12	43.34	15.80GAMBIA	26.53	9.05	59.57	20.14	11.07	4.12	44.60	13.76SUDAN	58.86	23.74	56.46	21.86	74.22	27.80	32.63	12.50TIMOR-LESTE	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	36.57	12.40BRAZIL	0.10	0.04	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	39.87	11.24BAHARAIN IS	19.74	11.27	18.97	10.34	13.39	7.48	17.14	9.25AUSTRALIA	6.82	5.49	11.81	6.86	15.93	8.92	15.18	9.09CONGO D.
