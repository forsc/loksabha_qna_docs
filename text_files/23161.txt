Keeping in view developments in the banking sector and the regulation thereof over time, amendments have been made through the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2020 for extending such provisions to co-operative banks as well. While providing for better management with proper regulations, the Act aims to ensure that the affairs of the cooperative banks are conducted in a manner that protects the interest of depositors by increasing professionalism, enabling access to capital, improving governance and ensuring sound banking through the Reserve Bank of India. *****
