ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS            (SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI(a) & (b)   The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has launched a scheme for setting up of Driving Training Centre (DTC)  to provide quality training to commercial vehicle drivers,  improve road and  environment safety and strengthen overall mobility on roads. Any entity such as a State Undertaking/ NGO/ Trust/ Cooperative Society/ Vehicle Manufacturer/ Firm etc. i.e. any legal entity registered under a State or Central Government Law are eligible to apply under the scheme. No project has been sanctioned under the scheme as on date. (c) & (d)   Implementation of provisions of Central Motor Vehicles Rule, 1989 (CMVRs) issuance of driving licence comes under the purview of State Transport Departments. As per the Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Act, 2019, passed in the Parliament recently and the provisions notified with effect from 1st September, 2019 the requirement of minimum educational qualification for driving a transport motor vehicle has been done away with. Ministry has notified the omission of rule 8 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 vide GSR 681 (E) dated 23.09.2019, which provided for requirement of minimum educational qualification for driving a transport vehicle. Further, driving is a skill which is not dependent on educational qualification.*****
