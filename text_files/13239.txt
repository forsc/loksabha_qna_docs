                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) to (c):	The details of terrorist incidents in the Jammu & Kashmir during the last three years are as under: -Year	No. of terrorist incidents	Terrorists arrested	Terrorists killed	Civilian killed	Civilian injured	Security personnel killed	Security personnel injured2017	342	97	213	40	99	80	2262018	614	105	257	39	63	91	2382019	594	115	157	39	188	80	140-2-L.S.US.Q.NO.2032 FOR 03.03.2020The problem of terrorism in India is largely sponsored from across the border.  The ISI of Pakistan has close links with terrorist outfits like Lashker-e-Toiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) etc. and it provides them safe havens, material support, finance and other logistics to carry out terrorist activities in India.  No major terror attack took place in the hinterland of the country during the last three years, except a grenade attack which took place on 18th November, 2018 at a prayer hall in Adliwal Village, PS Rajasansi, Amritsar, wherein 03 persons were killed.  As per available information, the involvement of Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) and International  Sikh  Youth  Federation (ISYF) have come  to  notice in this incident.  The Punjab Police has arrested three persons involved in this attack.  (d):	The data of undertrial prisoners is maintained by the State Governments since ‘Public Order’, ‘Police’ and ‘Prison’ are State subjects as per the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.  At the level of Central Government, the cases relating to terrorist acts are investigated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).  For speedy trial of the terror related cases, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008 provides for constitution of Special Courts, registered by NIA, where such cases are heard on day to day basis and get precedence over other cases.  Accordingly, 49 Courts all over India have been designated as Special NIA -3-L.S.US.Q.NO.2032 FOR 03.03.2020Courts for speedy disposal of cases relating to all accused arrested by NIA in terror cases.  (e):	The Central Government administers a Scheme titled “Central Scheme for Assistance to Civilian Victims of Terrorists/ Communal/ Left Wing Extremism Violence and Cross Border Firing and Mine/IED Blasts on Indian Territory”.  According to the said Scheme, the State Government  concerned initially gives financial relief to the civilian victim/ next of kin of victim, which is Rs. 5 lakh in case of death/ permanent incapacitation (50% and above) and then seeks reimbursement of the expenditure from the Government of India.  The details of the reimbursement made to States during the last three years are as under: -Sl. No.	Year	Amount reimbursed (in ?)1	2016-17	1,54,50,0002	2017-18	2,04,00,0003	2018-19	72,30,000Apart from it, the concerned State Governments also provide assistance to the victims as per their policy. 	The ex-gratia/compensation is paid to the families of security personnel as per the extant guidelines of CAPFs/Army/State Governments and under the ‘Security Related Expenditure (SRE) Scheme’ for the State Police/Security Personnel/civilian victims.  *******
