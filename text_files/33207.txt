STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (A) TO (D) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 71 TO BE ANSWERED ON 07.02.2022 ASKED BY SHRI P.P. CHAUDHARY AND SHRI NAYAB SINGH REGARDING TRAINING TO STREET VENDORS(a) to (d)	Yes, Sir. Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) in organized as well as unorganized sectors which also cover street food vendors across the country.Further, in the recent time post-COVID, the Ministry has developed several special skilling projects under PMKVY targeting marginalized and vulnerable groups such as street vendors and artisans’ clusters to deliver skills in the clusters of demand in partnership with private sector. Under this, special project to revive the traditional Namda craft of Jammu & Kashmir and Upskilling of Weavers & Artisans on traditional crafts of Nagaland, Jammu and Kashmir, and Upskilling of Street Food Vendors (for e-kart license) are being implemented. MSDE has launched a pilot project for ‘Upskilling for Street Food Vendors (for e-cart license)’ in East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on 30.11.2021 to train over 2,500 street food vendors over a period of 4 months. The purpose of this skill development is to provide skills which would lead to better services to consumers, more opportunities to the vendors in revenue generation and awareness of regulations, and adherence to stipulated rules and better services for the local bodies. Candidates would be provided with the dual certification from the Tourism & Hospitality Skill Council, and the FSSAI. Despite disruption caused due to COVID-19 pandemic, 686 street food vendors have been enrolled and out of which, 417 street food vendors have been oriented till date. This pilot project also helps in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on street food vendors.Under PMKVY, more than 20 thousand street food vendors have been benefited covering 18 States/UTs. The State-wise details, as on 31.12.2021, are given at Annexure.  Annexure State-wise number of street food vendors benefitted under PMKVY (as on 31.12.2021): S.
