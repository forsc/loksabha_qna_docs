                                                        THE MINISTER OF MINES, COAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFARIS(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a) & (b): Yes, Sir. Ministry of Mines, through Indian Bureau of Mines, has developed a Mining Surveillance System (MSS), in collaboration with Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and Bhaskaracharya Institute for Space Applications and Geo-informatics (BISAG), Gandhinagar, to use space technology for detecting probable illegal mining activities around lease hold areas. This satellite-based monitoring system viz. Mining Surveillance System (MSS) aims to check illegal mining activity through automatic remote-sensing detection technology in order to establish a regime of responsive mineral administration. The system records activity upto 500m outside the lease boundary and generates trigger for action on part of the State Government to investigate encroachment and take necessary action. MSS has been made functional throughout the country. A user-friendly mobile app has also been developed which will be used by district level mining officials of state Government to submit compliance reports of their inspections. A mobile app is also developed for use of general public, whereby, the general public will be able to raise complaint of illegal mining and then same is forwarded to the Concerned State Government for the necessary action at their end, as illegal mining is exclusive domain of the State Governments only and MSS is only to facilitate State Governments to check illegal mining. (c): Not applicable in view of reply furnished at item (a&b) above. *****
