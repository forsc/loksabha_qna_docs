MGNREGA, Pradhan Mantri Employment Guarantee Program (PMEGP), Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana, Make in India, Digital India, Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY), Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan etc. Government has also announced measures to strengthen Infrastructure Logistics, Capacity Building, Governance and Administrative Reforms for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Processing Sectors. Further, Government of India has launched PM SVANidhi Scheme to facilitate collateral free working capital loan upto Rs.10,000/- of one- year tenure, to approximately 50 lakh street vendors, to resume their businesses.As per the Census 2011 and NSSO (68th Round) data, it is estimated that 104 million fresh entrants to the workforce will require skill training by 2022, and 298 million of the existing workforce will require reskilling/upskilling to access emerging employment opportunities. The National Policy for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, 2015, also projected that 40 crore workforce are required to be skilled by 2022. The Government of India launched a National Skill Development Mission in 2015 to skill at scale with speed and standards.

Directorate General of Training (DGT) under the Ministry is also entrusted with the responsibility of long term vocational training in the country through about 15000 Industrial Training Institutes with a seating capacity of about 24 lakhs. Besides above, MSDE is also implementing Jan Shikshan Sansthan Program to address the skill requirement of the illiterate and neo literate and National Apprenticeship Programme to make available Industry ready workforce.As of March 2020, 42.20 lakhs candidates have been trained under the short term training (STT) programme of PMKVY out of which 17.54 lakhs candidates have been placed in jobs, while 49.12 lakh candidates have been oriented under Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) out of which 28.81 lakhs have been certified. Under National Skill Development Mission, many other Central Ministries / Departments besides MSDE are also implementing various skill training programmes to achieve this objective. The total number of persons trained under Skill India Mission since 2015-16 is around 5.53 crores, with around 3.31 crores being trained under MSDE, and 1.81 crores under other Ministries/ Departments.(e) To create an enabling ecosystem through entrepreneurship education, training, advocacy and easy access to entrepreneurship network, MSDE is implementing a pilot scheme, Pradhan Mantri YUVA (PM YUVA) Yojana.The scheme focuses on the students/trainees and alumni coming out from skilling ecosystem {i.e. Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), Polytechnics, Pradhan Mantri Kuashal Kendras (PMKKs) and Jan Sikshan Sansthans (JSS). The scheme is being implemented in 10 States and 2 Union Territories {viz. i.e. Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Kerala , Delhi and Puducherry}.Besides, different Ministries/ Departments of Government of India have been implementing a number of schemes viz; Start-up India by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) by Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, etc to  give a boost to entrepreneurship development.
