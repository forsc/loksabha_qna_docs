ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) & (b) Many studies by different Organizations have been published from time to time, estimating mortality, morbidity, life expectancy, etc. attributable to air pollution based on models and simulations. Also these studies are based on secondary data and extrapolation of findings based on small sample size to a larger population. These estimates do not depict the actual status as there are no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct correlation of death/ disease exclusively due to pollution. Health effects of pollution, including air pollution, are synergistic manifestation of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity, etc., of the individuals.(c) The Government has taken several steps to combat air pollution in the country, which inter alia, includes the following:•	Notification of National Ambient Air Quality Standards.•	Revision of emission standards for industrial sectors from time to time.•	Setting up of monitoring network for assessment of ambient air quality. •	Monitoring of ambient air quality at 793 locations covering 344 cities/ towns in 28 States and 7 Union Territories across the country under National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP).•	Launching of National Air Quality index.•	Notifications of 6 waste management rules covering solid waste, plastic waste, e-waste, bio-medical waste, construction & demolition waste and hazardous wastes issued in 2016.•	Introduction of cleaner / alternate fuels like gaseous fuel (CNG, LPG etc.).•	Leapfrogging from BS-IV to BS-VI fuel standards.•	Streamlining the issuance of Pollution Under Control Certificate.•	Issuance of directions under Section 18(1)(b) of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and under Section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for controlling air pollution.•	Installation of on-line continuous (24x7) monitoring devices by major industries.•	Launched National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) in January 2019 to tackle the problem of air pollution in a comprehensive manner with targets to achieve 20 to 30% reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations by 2024. The plan includes 102 non- attainment cities, across 23 States and Union Territories.•	Notification of Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) for Delhi and NCR.•	Comprehensive Action Plan (CAP) for air pollution control in Delhi and NCR.•	Organization of clean air campaigns, etc. *****
