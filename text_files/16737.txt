ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	to (d): Due to significant enhancement in the domestic production of pulses, the Government of India, in order to protect the interests of farmers, notified restrictions, with quota, on import of peas and pulses. These Notifications were challenged in various High Courts. Based on ex-parte stay orders against the operations of these Notifications, certain importers brought in quantities of pulses in excess of the quota for the years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20. The Government contested the cases before various High Courts and in order to obtain a common judgment, sought transfer of all cases filed before the various High Courts to the Supreme Court. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in its Judgment dated 26th August, 2020 has upheld the notifications and the trade notices and has rejected the challenge made by the importers and further directed that the imports, if any, made relying on interim order(s) would be held to be contrary to the notifications. The Peas and Pulses stocked at various sea ports have been imported by private importers in violation of the Foreign Trade Policy and notifications issued thereunder.  Such imports by these private importers were not for supply to the Public Distribution System. As regards food grains, Government has not imposed any restrictions on their import.  *****
