State-wise details are placed at Annexure.  Generation of revenue from sale of surplus solar power is available for solarisation of grid connected pumps under Component-C of the Scheme. The solarisation of pumps under this component is either under progress or recently completed and surplus solar generated and amount received by farmers can be exactly assessed only on completion of one year of operation.(d) Under PM-KUSUM Scheme, Central Government has not put any bar on land size for farmers installing solar pumps. (e) & (f) Central Ground Water Board from time-to-time notifies the areas for control and regulation of ground water. These areas are considered as ‘dark zones’ under PM-KUSUM Scheme. Only existing pumps can be solarised in the ‘dark zones’. So far no existing grid connected pumps are reported solarised under the Scheme in ‘dark zones’.*****
