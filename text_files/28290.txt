The category-wise status of these beneficiaries as on 24.11.2021, is given below:  Category	Enrolled	Trained	CertifiedSC	1,03,97,563	89,22,690	67,88,527ST	48,69,800	40,70,145	29,26,211Women	2,80,38,385	2,42,22,349	1,85,71,710Differently-abled	9,65,209	8,20,350	5,86,291(c) and (d):  Yes, Sir.  In line with the recommendations, the training under the PMGDISHA scheme was scaled up and as on date, a total of 5.36 Crore candidates have been enrolled under the PMGDISHA Scheme, out of this, 4.54 Crore candidates have been trained and 3.37 Crore candidates have been duly certified.So far, three impact assessment studies of the Scheme have been carried out. First impact assessment study was carried out by Council for Social Development (CSD) in 2017-18. The second impact assessment study was conducted by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi in the year 2019. The last impact assessment study of the scheme was carried out by Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA) in FY 2020-21. The aim of the study was to analyse the ground level situation of the scheme, with a larger aspect of continuation of the scheme beyond the 12th plan period. IIPA, after the comprehensive and methodological evaluation of scheme, concluded in the report that PMGDISHA as a digital literacy programme plays an indispensable part in not only bridging the digital gap in the country but also transforming it into a knowledge economy and society. IIPA recommended the continuation of PMGDISHA Scheme.*******Annexure State-wise Status of PMGDISHA scheme as on 24.11.2021S.N.
