ANSWER




(a) to (c): The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) has received applications for upward price revision under para 19 of the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO, 2013) citing various reasons like increase in Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) cost, increase in cost of production, exchange rate variation etc. resulting in unviability in sustainable production and marketing of the drugs. Based on the recommendation of Standing Committee on Affordable Medicines and Health Products (SCAMHP), ceiling price of shortlisted 21 scheduled formulations of 12 medicines were revised by allowing one time price increase of upto 50% from the present ceiling price in public interest as an exceptional measure by invoking para 19 of the DPCO, 2013. The detail of price revision is as below:Sl. No.	Name of the Scheduled Formulation	Dosage form & Strength	Unit	Revised Ceiling Price(Rs.)(1)	(2)	(3)	(4)	(5)1.	BCG vaccine	 	Each Dose	8.752.

Co-trimoxazole (Sulphamethoxazole (A)+Trimethoprim (B)]	Oral Liquid 200mg(A)+40mg(B)/5ml 	1 ml	0.3217.	Pheniramine	Injection 22.75 mg/ml(10ml pack)	1 ml	1.6718.	Pheniramine	Injection 22.75 mg/ml (2ml pack)	1 ml	2.2419.	Prednisolone	Drops 1%	1 ml	4.9220.	Clofazimine	Capsule 50 mg	1 Capsule	2.1321.	Clofazimine	Capsule 100 mg	1 Capsule	3.63(d):	A Committee comprising of Adviser (Cost), Adviser DGHS and Deputy Drug Controller, DCGI under the convenorship of Director (Pricing), NPPA examined such formulations based on parameters of essentiality, market share of the applicant company and available alternatives etc. It was noted that these scheduled formulations are low priced drugs and have been under repeated price control. Most of these drugs are used as first line of treatment and are crucial to the public health program of the country. Many companies have applied for discontinuation of the product on account of unviability. Therefore, these formulations were considered for upward price revision to enable manufacturing and continued availability to the consumers.(e):	The Paragraph 19 of the DPCO, 2013 has been used to reduce the drug price, however the provisions also provides that in case of extra-ordinary circumstances the Government may allow an increase or decrease in the ceiling price or the retail price, as the case may be, irrespective of annual wholesale price index for that year in public interest. *******
