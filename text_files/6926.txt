                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. *****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 673 BY SHRI PASHUPATI NATH SINGH AND SHRIMATI ANNPURNA DEVI TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 20.11.2019 REGARDING SURVEY OF RAILWAY PROJECTS IN JHARKHAND.(a)	to (d) : At present, Railways have taken up 30 railway projects falling fully/partly in the State of Jharkhand, comprising 14 New Line projects having length of 1463 Km with aggregate cost of          ?25,535 crore and 16 Doubling projects having 1145 Km with aggregate cost of ?14485 crore. All these projects are under different stages of planning/approval/execution.The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions  of working agencies/contractors etc. All these factors vary from project to project and site to site and affect the completion time and cost of the project, which is finally worked out at the completion stage. To ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects.    For capacity enhancement projects, etc. institutional financing has been done by arranging loan of ?1.5 lakh crore, which has increased Railways’ capacity for committed fund provision for essential projects. In the overall interest of the nation and for smooth execution of works lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, divisional level, zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and authorities concerned to resolve the pending issues that are obstructing the progress of projects.*****
