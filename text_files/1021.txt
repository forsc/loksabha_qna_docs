ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)   (a) to (c): Upgradation/Development of airports is a continuous process and is undertaken by Airports Authority of India(AAI) from time to time depending on the availability of land, commercial viability, socio-economic considerations, traffic demand / willingness of airlines to operate to/from such airports. AAI has undertaken the work of strengthening of runway, taxiway & apron including construction of isolation bay with link taxiway at Dimapur Airport with a cost of Rs. 43.22 Crore. The State Govt. has requested Government of India to develop an alternate airport for Kohima at Ciethu. A multi-disciplinary team consisting of officials from DGCA, Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change and AAI visited the site in August, 2018 and estimated the cost for the development of the Ciethu Airport at approx. Rs. 6000 Crores (Rs. 5500 Crores for site development + Rs. 500 Crores for airport infrastructure). Given the huge cost in development of Ceithu Airport, the site has not been found economically viable in the preliminary report.
