ANSWER




                                                        (a): Government has adopted a multi-pronged strategy for overall development of tribal people living across the country, which includes support for education, health, sanitation, water supply, skill development, livelihood etc. Major part of infrastructure development and provision of basic amenities in tribal areas/regions in the country is carried out through various schemes/programmes of concerned Central Ministries and the State Governments concerned, while the Ministry of Tribal Affairs provides additive to these initiatives by way of plugging critical gaps. The schemes / prgogrammes of the Ministry are equally implemented in North Eastern States including Assam. A list of Schemes / Programmes being implemented by the Ministry including in North-Eastern States and Assam is at Annexure-I and details of funds released to North Eastern States including Sikkim is at Annexure-II.(b) to (d): During 2018-19, Ministry of Tribal Affairs had introduced a separate Scheme of  Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS) with the objective to provide quality middle and high school level education to Scheduled Tribes (STs) students  in remote areas. Earlier, it was a component of Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution of India. As per approval of the Government, every block with more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons, will have an Eklavya Model Residential School by the year 2022.  Across the country, as per census 2011 figures, there are 564 sub-districts i.e. blocks/taluka/tehsil having more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons.  Out of these sub-districts, EMRS have been sanctioned in 102 sub-districts at the inception of the Scheme and in remaining sub-districts shall have an EMRS by the year 2022 which includes 119 new Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRSs) in the blocks in North-Eastern States. The scheme of Mechanism for Marketing of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) through Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Development of Value Chain for MFP covers various activities including procurement of MFPs when their market price falls below their notified MSP, setting up/expansion of storage facilities, expanding the knowledge base on MFP, training for sustainable collection, value addition, etc. The activities involving expanding knowledge base, training for sustainable collection, value addition, etc. are done through TRIFED and the Central Government bears 100% of the expenditure incurred for these activities. While there is no proposal to introduce a separate scheme/policy on this matter, TRIFED desired to brand the activities being undertaken by it under the existing scheme of Mechanism for Marketing of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) through Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Development of Value Chain for MFP as “Van Dhan Vikas Karyakram”. Thus, Van Dhan Vikas Karyakram is nothing but the training and development of value chain components of the scheme of Mechanism for Marketing of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) through Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Development of Value Chain for MFP.       The schemes of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs are demand driven and funding are made in various sectors including for employment-cum-income generation and covers activities such as establishment of Agro/Forest/Natural Resource based micro / village industries through training of tribal cooperatives, SHGs and individual entrepreneurs, promotion and skill development in traditional tribal culture areas like tribal jewelry, painting, dance forms, music and culinary art, Village tourism, Eco-tourism, etc. ***** Annexure-IAnnexure referred in reply to part (a) of  Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.†239 for 24.06.2019 raised by SHRI DILIP SAIKIA:  M.P.  regarding “Tribal Welfare Schemes for NE States”.LIST OF SCHEMES/PROGRAMMES OF THE MINISTRY OF TRIBAL AFFAIRSSl.No.	Names of Schemes / Programmes1	Pre Matric Scholarship Scheme for ST students 2	Post Matric Scholarship Scheme for ST students3	National Overseas Scholarship for ST students for studying abroad.4	National Fellowship and Scholarship for Higher Education of ST students(a) Scholarship for Higher Education (earlier known as Top Class Education For ST Students).(b) Fellowship (earlier known as Rajiv Gandhi National Fellowship Scheme for ST students).5	Grants-in-aid to Voluntary Organisations Working for welfare of STs6	Strengthening Education among ST Girls in Low Literacy Districts 7	Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) 8	Grants under Article 275 (1) of the Constitution of India 9	Special Central Assistance(SCA) to Tribal Sub-Scheme(TSS) 10	Grants-in-aid to Tribal Research Institutes11	Institutional Support for Development and Marketing of Tribal Products/Produce 12	Support to National/State Scheduled Tribe Finance and Development Corporations13	Minor Forest Produce (MFP) through Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Mechanism of marketing of Development of Value Chain for MFP14	Research Information & Mass Education, Tribal Festival and Others  Annexure-IIAnnexure referred in reply to part (a) .. of  Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.†239 for 24.06.2019 raised by SHRI DILIP SAIKIA:  M.P.  regarding “Tribal Welfare Schemes for NE States”.Scheme-wise Details of funds released / uti      lised under the schemes / programmes of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs to North Eastern States including Sikkim during the last three years (2016-17, 2017-18 & 2018-19).I.
