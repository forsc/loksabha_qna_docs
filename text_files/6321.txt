ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT (SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a)	to (c)  MHRD has designed a matrix called Performance Grading Index (PGI) based on 70 indicators to grade the States/UTs. PGI is a tool which provides insights on the status of school education in States and UTs including key levers that drive their performance and critical areas for improvement. The purpose of PGI is to help States and UTs to pinpoint the gaps and accordingly prioritize areas for intervention to ensure that the school education system is robust at every level. To collect timely and accurate data, a well functioning and sustainable Educational Management Information System called UDISE + (UDISE plus) has been launched in 2018-19. (https://mhrd.gov.in/summary-report-performance-grading-index-pgi-states-and-uts-2017-18-1) (http://udiseplus.gov.in)The National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) conducts periodic national surveys to assess learning achievement of children in Classes – III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017 was held on 13th November for assessing the competencies developed by the children at the grade levels III, V and VIII from across 701 districts covering all the 36 States and UTs and covered 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act  by the Government of India. Similarly, National Achievement Survey for Class X was also conducted throughout the country on February 05, 2018 in government, government aided and private schools. The learning levels of 1.5 million students in 44,304 schools across 610 districts in 34 States and UTs were assessed, in 5 subject areas of English, Mathematics, Science, Social Science and Modern Indian Language (MIL). The NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level and devise strategies for further improvement. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools. (https://mhrd.gov.in/nas)Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education: <pre>(i)	Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D. El. Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017.  More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses and out of these about 9.58 Lakh teachers have cleared the same. (https://mhrd.gov.in/rte)(ii)	The Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE), with effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels.  The main objectives of the scheme are providing quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions. (http://samagra.mhrd.gov.in) (iii)	e-¬ PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ¬resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-¬print materials. (http://epathshala.nic.in)(iv) 	MHRD has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9th July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. (https://swayam.gov.in)(v)	A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. Central Institute of Educational Technology (CIET)-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers of Secondary and Senior Secondary levels and for sign language. (https://www.swayamprabha.gov.in) (vi)	In order to provide supplementary learning material for students and for upgrading the skills of teachers, MHRD has developed a dedicated Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing (DIKSHA) platform.  High quality e-learning material both for students and teachers is being uploaded by Ministry and States/UTs on this portal. (https://diksha.gov.in/) (vii) 	Integrated Teacher Training Programme NISHTHA (National Initiative for School Heads and Teachers’ Holistic Advancement) was launched in August, 2019 for capacity building of all the teachers and school principals at the elementary stage to provide training in core areas to 42 Lakh teachers across the country. The aim of this training is to motivate and equip teachers to encourage and foster critical thinking in students, handle diverse situations and act as first level counsellors. (nishtha.ncert.gov.in)(viii)	 Government of India has decided to participate in the Programme for International Students Assessment (PISA) to be conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2021. PISA is a competency based assessment which unlike content-based assessment, measures the extent to which students have acquired key competencies that are essential for full participation in modern societies.
