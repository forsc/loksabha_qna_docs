It envisages to transform 1,50,000 Sub-Health Centres (SHCs) and Primary Health Centres (PHCs), both Rural & Urban, into Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) by December, 2022. As on 23rd March, 2022, a total 1,00,768 Ayushman Bharat-Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs) are functional in the country which includes 73,668 SHC-HWC, 22,472 PHC-HWC and 4,628 UPHC-HWC, as reported by the States/UTs on AB-HWC portal. State/UT wise Central Release under Ayushman Bharat- Health & Wellness Centres (AB-HWC) under NHM from the FY 2018-19 to 2021-22 is given at Annexure-I.As per RHS 2019-20, the present status and achievements of Community Health Centres (CHCs) and Primary Health Centres (PHCs), State/UT-wise, including Tamil Nadu, are given at Annexure-II. Government of India has laid down Indian public Health Standards (IPHS) for services, infrastructure, human resource, diagnostics, equipment, medicines, etc. They are used as the reference point for planning and up-gradation of public health care infrastructure in the States and UTs.  These IPHS have given population norms for establishing the public health facilities. As per RHS, 2019-20, average rural population covered by the health facility (based on the mid-year population as on 1st July, 2020)  is given belowHealth Facility	Norm as per IPHS	Average Rural Population  covered (RHS-2019-20)Primary Health Centre	20,000-30,000	35730Community Health Centre	80,000-1,20,000	171779Besides this, States have the flexibility to propose for funding under the overall ambit of NHM for up-gradation of infrastructure, HR and services as per IPHS for public health facilities, after due gap analysis. States also have the flexibility to establish PHCs at 20,000 population and CHCs at 80,000 population in hilly/tribal/difficult areas.All the States/UTs submit the proposals for opening of new CHCs and PHCs, through Program Implementation Plan (PIP) annually before the commencement of next financial year. Year-wise Record of Proceedings (RoPs) and PIPs of all the States /UTs under NHM, including Tamil Nadu, are available at the link  https://nhm.gov.in/index4.php?lang=1&level=0&linkid=59&lid=72.The State of Tamil Nadu has submitted a proposal to MoHFW, GOI during PIP 2022-24 for establishment of 25 New Primary Health Centre and 25 New Urban Primary Health Centre under NHM.The ISO 9001:2008, now ISO 9001:2015 standards were initially framed for the manufacturing industry and later adapted for service industry like healthcare industry. However, these standards are generic in nature. Therefore, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare have formulated National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) in November 2013 to improve the quality of care delivered at different level of public health facilities. The Standards are accredited by apex international accrediting Agency ISQUA (International Society for Quality in Healthcare). Over the years, the programme has expanded its scope based on the emerging requirements and responses to newer initiatives taken up by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Quality Assurance Program has provision for national and state level quality certification of Health facilities on meeting the predetermined certification criteria. The program is being implemented across all states and UTs. As on 16th March, 2022, 1463 public health facilities are quality certified at the national level and 3576 health facilities at the NQAS certified at the State level.The National Quality Assurance Standards are broadly arranged under 8 "Areas of Concern"– Service Provision, Patient Rights, Inputs, Support Services, Clinical Care, Infection Control, Quality Management and Outcome. More details on the latest National Quality Assurance Standards are available at http://qi.nhsrcindia.org/sites/default/files/1596%20NQAS%20for%20PHF%202020_16%20Dec%202021.pdf
