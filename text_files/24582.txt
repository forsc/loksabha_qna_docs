ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) & (b): Under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik),  Hindon-Ayodhya-Hindon routes were awarded to a Selected Airline Operator (SAO) in 2019. This award was subsequently terminated due to non-compliance of contractual obligations of Selected Airline Operator Agreement (SAOA). These terminated routes have been offered in Special Round of bidding  under UDAN 4.1. ;      Varanasi and Gorakhpur being the served airports, air connectivity to these airports can be considered by airlines based on their commercial viability. (c)        After the repeal of the Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation market has been deregulated. Consequently, airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type for selecting whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate across the country. Thus, it is up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and their commercial viability, in compliance with the relevant guidelines in this matter. The Ministry regularly interacts with the stakeholders from time to time with an aim to promote air connectivity.
