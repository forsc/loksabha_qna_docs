ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)&(b):       As per section 6(1) of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA), the Central Government may, by notification, specify the wage rate for its beneficiaries.  Accordingly, the Ministry of Rural Development notifies Mahatma Gandhi NREGA wage rate every year for States/UTs.  To compensate the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA workers against inflation, the Ministry of Rural Development revises the wage rate every year based on change in Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labour (CPI-AL).  The wage rate is made applicable from 1st April of each Financial Year.  Centrally, this Ministry does not maintain minimum wage rates in respect of States/UTs, agricultural or otherwise.  However, each State/UT can provide additional wage over and above the wage-rate notified by the Central Government.  The wage rate for the States/UTs, applicable for the FY 2020-21, was notified on 23.3.2020.  On an average, there is an increase of Rs.20 in  wage rate from Rs.182 of last financial year to Rs.202 in the current financial year. (c):     A Committee was constituted to study, inter-alia, the appropriate index for revising Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA) wages. The Committee recommended using Consumer Price Index-Rural (CPI-R) instead of the existing Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labour (CPI-AL) for revising Mahatma Gandhi NREGA wage every year. The Committee also recommended use of annual average instead of the existing practice of using December month index only.  The recommendations of the Committee are under examination in consultation with other Ministries including the Ministry of Finance.********
