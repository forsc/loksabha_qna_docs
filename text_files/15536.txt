                                                        (a) & (b)   Yes, Sir. Infrastructure development and capacity augmentation of Major Ports is a continuous process. It involves construction of new berths and terminals, mechanization of existing berths and terminals, capital dredging for deepening of drafts for attracting larger vessels, development of road and rail connectivity etc. As a result, the cargo handling capacity of the Major Ports has gone upto 1524.91 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) as on February, 2020. This is adequate to handle the present level of EXIM and Coastal cargo and also increased requirements in near future. The traffic handled by Major Ports during 2018-19 was 699.10 Million Tonnes (MT) and during current year traffic handled upto February, 2020 has been 642.96 MT. The Non-Major ports (under the administrative control of State Government) having a capacity of 863.50 MTPA as on 31.03.2019 handled total traffic of 582.59 MT as on 31.3.2019.(c) & (d)   A number of infrastructure development projects with a total cost of Rs. 13308.41 crore have been awarded by various major ports during the last three years. The projects, once awarded, are executed as per the relevant contractual timelines. Details of these projects are as given below:<pre>F.Y.

Major Ports submit monthly status report on projects to be awarded and projects to be completed to the Ministry, which is reviewed regularly.                                            ******
