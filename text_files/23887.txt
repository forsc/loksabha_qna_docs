                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                            (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a)	Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs (MoHUA) is administering a Centrally Sponsored Scheme named "Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM), through the respective States/UTs, to reduce poverty and vulnerability of urban poor households by enabling them to access gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities, for improvement in their livelihoods on a sustainable basis. The mission also aims to build strong grassroot level institutions of the urban poor; provide shelters equipped with essential services to the urban homeless and address livelihoods concerns of the urban street vendors by facilitating access to suitable spaces, institutional credit, social security, etc.(b)	It is the primary responsibility of Governments of the States/UTs to provide shelter for the urban homeless. However, in order to complement their efforts, Ministry of 	Housing and Urban Affairs is administering ‘Shelter for Urban Homeless (SUH)’ scheme under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana –National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM), through respective States/Union Territories. It focuses on providing permanent shelters equipped with basic facilities for the urban homeless.(c)	TheState/UT level Project Sanctioning Committee (PSC) is competent to approve the proposals for establishment of shelters. So far, 1,587 shelters for urban homeless are operational in 30 States/UTs with a total capacity of 86,486 persons under the Mission. In Gujarat, 50 shelters are operational with a total capacity of 4,325 persons. A city-wise details of shelters operational in Gujarat are given in the Annexure. 	There is no provision of providing houses to homeless under DAY-NULM.
