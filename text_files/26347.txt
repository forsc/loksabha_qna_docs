SUJAY RADHAKRISHNA VIKHE PATIL AND SHRI DHAIRYASHEEL SAMBHAJIRAO MANE REGARDING TRAINING PROVIDERS ENROLLED WITH NSDC(a)       Under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, short term training is being imparted through empanelled training centres. The empanelment of training centres (TCs) is being done online through Skill India Portal (SIP) combined with a third party inspection which is same for all the TCs irrespective of the States. The State-wise number of empanelled TCs under PMKVY (i.e. PMKVY 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0) since 2015 is given in Annexure I.(b)           PMKVY has two components namely Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). Under STT component, candidates are being trained in short duration courses through empanelled TCs whereas under RPL component, candidates with prior learning experience or skills are being oriented and certified. Under PMKVY since inception i.e. 2015, 65.95 lakh candidates have been trained under STT and 63.98 lakh candidates have been oriented under RPL.STT is linked to placement, while RPL does not mandate placements as it recognizes the existing skills of candidate. Under STT-PMKVY, as on 10.07.2021, 52.46 lakh candidates have been certified; out of which, 23.25 lakh candidates have been placed.The State-wise number of candidates trained, certified and placed under STT through empanelled TCs and candidates oriented under RPL under PMKVY since 2015, as on 10.07.2021, is given in Annexure II.(c)        Yes Sir. Under PMKVY, targets for STT and RPL have been fixed phase wise. The phase wise and component wise target is given below:[figures in Lakhs]Phase	STT	RPL	TotalPMKVY 1.0 (2015-16)	14	10	24PMKVY  2.0 (2016-20)	60	40	100PMKVY 3.0 (2021-22)	2.2	5.8	8Total	76.2	55.8	132            Out of total target to train 132 lakh candidates, 129 lakh candidates have been trained/oriented.(d)       Under PMKVY 2.0, there are various provisions for monitoring of Training Centres (TC) as well as candidates. The life cycle of training process of candidates (enrollment-training-assessment-certification-placement) is tracked or monitored on real-time basis through the Skill India Portal (SIP) which is linked with Aadhaar enabled biometric attendance. Empanelled TCs are being monitored effectively through various methodologies such as self-audit reporting, call validations, surprise visits, etc. Appraisal of the on-going schemes and consequent improvements is an ongoing process.            Further, in order to improve the monitoring under PMKVY, District Skill Committee (DSC) is being involved and entrusted with the monitoring under PMKVY 3.0. DSC acts as an on-ground monitoring agency for conducting inspection of empanelled TCs.
