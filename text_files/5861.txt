                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (f) : 	At present 36 nos. of Hydro-electric projects (above 25 MW) aggregating to 12034.5 MW and 67 nos. of thermal power projects aggregating to 63676.15 MW are under construction in the country including Tamil Nadu.  The details of the original/ sanctioned cost & expenditure incurred during the last three years and the current year along with original/anticipated commissioning schedules as well as reasons for time and cost overrun in respect of the under construction Hydro-electric projects are given at Annexure-I.		In respect of Thermal Power Projects, as per Section 7 of the Electricity Act, 2003, “any generating company may establish, operate and maintain a generating station without obtaining a license/permission under this Act, if it complies with the technical standards relating to connectivity with the grid. Accordingly, sanction of the Government is not required for setting up of thermal power projects.”		The details of original cost, commissioning schedule along with anticipated revised cost and schedule of completion, and reasons for delay in respect of under construction thermal projects are given in Annexure-II.  The steps being taken for timely completion of these power projects are as given below:(i)	Ministry of Power/Central Electricity Authority (CEA) monitors the process of under construction power projects through frequent site visits and interaction with the developers and equipment suppliers. CEA holds review meetings periodically with the developers and other stakeholders and identify issues critical for commissioning of projects and help in resolving them.(ii)	Regular reviews are also undertaken by Ministry of Power, Ministry of Heavy Industries and Cabinet Secretariat to identify the constraint areas and facilitate faster resolution of inter-ministerial and other outstanding issues.(iii)	In case of Central Power Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) projects, the project implementation parameters/ milestones are incorporated in the annual MoU signed between respective CPSU’s and MoP and the same are monitored during the quarterly performance review meeting of CPSU’s and other meetings held in MoP/CEA.(iv)	Matters are taken up with State Government/District Administration for extending help to the project implementing agencies in resolving Right of Way (ROW) issues. (v)	As and when required, issues are also reviewed in the PRAGATI portal of PMO for proactive governance and timely implementation.****************
