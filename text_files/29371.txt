ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana(PMUY) was launched on 01.05.2016 to release 8 crore deposit free LPG connection in the name of adult woman member of poor households and the target of the scheme has been achieved in September, 2019. Further, Ujjwala 2.0  has been launched on 10th August, 2021 to release 1 crore deposit free LPG connections in addition to 8 crore LPG connections released under PMUY. (b)	Government has issued detailed guidelines to OMCs for implementation of PMUY and Ujjwala 2.0. State/UT-wise details of no. of connections released under PMUY as on 01.11.2021 since inception, are at Annexure. (c)  To increase LPG coverage, the Government has taken several steps which include, deposit free LPG connection under PMUY, hassle free connections, 5 kg cylinders, secondary connections for an existing LPG connection holder, option to apply online for new connection including PMUY and release of e-subscription vouchers, organizing LPG panchayats and public awareness campaigns involving State/UT Governments etc. Under Ujjwala 2.0 beneficiaries are given deposit free connections along with free first refill and stove. The prospective PMUY beneficiaries have been allowed to apply for new LPG connections in online mode and submit a self declaration for family details and address proof. Due to implementation of PMUY, the national LPG coverage, which was 62% as on 01.05.2016, has increased to 102.2% as on 01.11.2021. (d) to (f) Implementation of PMUY is monitored closely in terms of number of eligible beneficiaries identified and the actual number of connections released vis-a-vis LPG coverage in States/Districts. The difficulties faced by OMCs mainly related to identification of households, difficult terrain, low awareness on usefulness of LPG etc.  OMCs launched awareness programme through print and electronic media highlighting the benefit of usage of LPG.-------
