ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL) (a) to (d): Under its scheme of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA), the Ministry of Panchayati Raj releases funds to States/UTs for strengthening the Panchyati Raj Institutions (PRIs). The funds are utilised by undertaking the activities sanctioned / permitted under their approved annual action plans. The progress of implementation of the schemes, including utilisation of funds, is closely monitored through meetings, video-conferences with the concerned States/UTs. For further release of funds to the States/UTs, the status of utilization of funds released earlier is also taken into account. In addition to this, an online monitoring and reporting system (MIS) for RGSA has been developed and operationalised. Moreover, transaction based Public Financial Management System (PFMS) has been introduced for release and tracking of funds under RGSA. Similarly, the utilisation certificates is insisted upon and obtained for the funds released under the scheme of Incentivisation of Panchyats before release of further funds as financial incentives to the good performing Panchyats selected under National Panchayat Award competition held annually. No complaints on misutilisation of funds under the two above schemes have been received in the Ministry.  ***
