As per the NUP-2015, the existing gas based urea units has been classified into three groups based on pre-set energy norms. Further, these urea units have been given the target energy consumption norms which have been made effective for 11 urea units w.e.f. 1st April, 2018 and for the remaining 14 urea units w.e.f. 1st October, 2020.Further, the Government has dis-incentivized the use of Naptha/ Fuel Oil (FO)/ Low Sulphur Heavy Stock (LSHS) for the production of urea due to which all such units have been converted to Natural Gas as feedstock.*****
