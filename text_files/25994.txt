ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS (SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) & (b)     The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has implemented a national-wide scheme for setting up of Driving Training Institutes (DTIs) since FY 2002-03. The scheme was renamed as Institute of Driving Training & Research (IDTR) in 12th FY Plan period (2012-17) with central financial assistance of Rs.17.00 crore and land requirement of 10 acre. A new component as Regional Driving Training Centre (RDTCs) with less capacity with financial assistance of Rs. 5.00 crore and land requirement (3 acre) as Tier II in the 12th Five Year plan period was added.  The financial implication of IDTR was revised from 17.00 crore to 18.50 crore during the 14th Financial cycle.            The basic objective of the scheme is to set up a full-fledged training institute with driving test track to provide quality training to commercial vehicle drivers, improve road and environment safety and strengthen overall mobility on roads. The details of main activities/programmes at these institutions are      •	Impart Induction Training Course in Heavy Motor Vehicle Driving.•	Impart Induction Training Course in Light Motor Vehicles Driving.•	Conduct Training Course for Driving Instructors of Private Driving Schools.•	Conduct three-days Training Course on Safe Transportation of Hazardous Goods.•	Conduct one-day Refresher Training Course on Safe Transportation of Hazardous Goods.•	Conduct Refresher and Orientation Training Course for Drivers who are in service.•	Test and select drivers by various organisations. Till date, 31 IDTRs and 6 RDTCs have been sanctioned by the Ministry in different States/UTs as detailed in Annexure - I.  (c)     Taking into account the continuous rise in requirement for transportation of liquid oxygen (LOX), extended period of oxygen management, addition to the inventory of cryogenic tankers and high fatigue/ attrition rate due to 24X7 operations, the Ministry issued advisory in May 2021 to States to create a pool of trained drivers for transporting “hazardous cargo”, as implementation of provisions of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 comes under their purview.Further, Department of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce & Industry on the directions of the Empowered Committee of Secretaries (EG - 2), initiated a skill development program for Liquid Medical Oxygen tanker drivers. With the help of Indian Chemical Council (ICC), Logistics Sector Skill Council (LSSC) and National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), a detailed program for capacity building for heavy commercial drivers was also prepared.
