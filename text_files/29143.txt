ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) to (c) Monitoring and ensuring water quality in the water bodies and ground water recharged through rainwater harvesting, lies in the domain of the State Government concerned. Role of Government of India is limited to providing technical support, issue of guidelines and notifications and, in some cases, partial financial assistance under the existing schemes.  Quality of water being stored in the water bodies, including rejuvenated water bodies, is to be monitored by State Governments, for which norms have been formulated, based on use, by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).  As far as ground water recharge is concerned, Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) under this Ministry has published broad guidelines for planning and design of ground water recharge structures, to optimize the quality of water percolating to the aquifers. Further, CGWB generates ground water quality data of the country on a regional scale, as part of its ground water quality monitoring programme and various scientific studies.*****
