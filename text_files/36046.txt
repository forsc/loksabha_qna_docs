ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS (SHRI DEVUSINH CHAUHAN) (a) to (c) 	Government of India is implementing various schemes under Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) to enhance telecom connectivity in the rural and predominately tribal areas of the country including North Eastern Region (NER) and areas affected by Left Wing Extremism (LWE), Border areas, Aspirational Districts and Islands. Further the scope of BharatNet has been recently extended up to all inhabited villages beyond Gram Panchayats (GPs) in the country. The infrastructure created under BharatNet project can be utilized to provide internet services such as Wi-Fi, FTTH, by the village level entrepreneurs also.  With the provision of above telecom infrastructure, public participation in digital communication is likely to increase further.
