ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a): 	Complaints received by Food Corporation of India during last three years  and current year including state of West Bengal are as under: Year 	No. of complaints across the country (excluding the State of West Bengal)	No. of complaints of West Bengal)	Total complaints2018-19	8	0	82019-20	3	0	32020-21	6	0	62021-22 (till Oct) 	7	0	7.......2/--2-(b): 	The main reasons are irregularities in operation of procurement centres, irregularities of bogus purchase, transportation of paddy at higher rates and delay in payment of Minimum Support Price (MSP) to farmers by private player engaged in paddy procurement.  (c): 	The complaints related to paddy procurement are investigated and action taken in accordance with prescribed procedure in this regard. Further, the following initiatives/measures have been taken by the Government in streamlining the Procurement Operations:i) 	Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) of MSP has been implemented across the country. This has brought in responsibility, transparency, real time monitoring and reduces pilferage in the system. DBT eliminates purchase from fictitious bogus farmers,  reduces diversion and duplication of payment as payment is made directly to farmer’s bank account which in many States is linked with Aadhaar number of the farmers. ii) 	FCI and most of the State Governments have developed their own online procurement system which ushers in transparency and convenience to the farmers through proper registration and monitoring of actual procurement. The online procurement system has largely eliminated the procurement from middlemen and has resulted in better targeting of the MSP to farmers. (iii) 	The State agencies have to also ensure the use of Expenditure Advance Transfer module (EAT) of Public Financial Module System (PFMS) while making payment, as mandated by the Ministry of Finance, GOI by integrating their online payment system with PFMS to maintain financial integrity.iv) 	Minimum Support Price (MSP) operations are given wide publicity through pamphlets, banners, sign boards, radio, TV and advertisements through print & electronic media. v) 	Farmers are made aware of the quality specifications and purchase system, etc. to facilitate bringing their produce conforming to the specifications. vi) 	Procurement centres are opened by respective State Government Agencies/  Food Corporation of India, taking into account the production, marketable surplus, convenience of farmers and availability of other logistics / infrastructure such as storage and transportation, etc. Large number of temporary purchase centres, in addition to the existing Mandis and depots/godowns are also established at key points for the convenience of farmers.****
