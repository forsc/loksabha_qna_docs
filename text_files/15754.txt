ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (c) 	Pollution load in rivers has increased over the years due to rapid urbanization and industrialization. Rivers in the country are polluted mainly due to discharge of untreated and partially treated sewage from cities/towns and industrial effluents. Non-point sources of pollution like agricultural runoff, open defecation, runoff from solid waste dump sites, etc. also contribute to pollution of rivers. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in collaboration with the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) is regularly monitoring the water quality of rivers & other water bodies in the country through a network of monitoring stations. As per CPCB report of September, 2018, 351 polluted river stretches have been identified on 323 rivers based on monitoring results in terms of Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) levels, an indicator of organic pollution. State-wise details of polluted river stretches are given at Annexure-I.Cleaning and rejuvenation of rivers is a continuous process and Central Government is supplementing the efforts of the State Governments and Union Territories in addressing the challenges of pollution of rivers by providing financial and technical assistance through schemes like National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) and Namami Gange. The NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches of 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country with a sanctioned cost of Rs. 5870.54 crore and sewage treatment capacity of 2522.03 million litres per day (mld) has been created. Under Namami Gange, the rejuvenation of Ganga and its tributaries have been taken up. So far, a total 310 projects have been sanctioned at an estimated cost of Rs. 28790.66 crore under Namami Gange. Of these, 116 projects have been completed and made operational. Out of 310 projects, 152 projects are in sewerage sector for creation of sewage treatment capacity of 4857 mld & sewerage network of 4972 kms.Contd...P/2//2//	In addition, sewerage infrastructure is created under programs like Atal Mission For Rejuvenation & Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and Smart Cities Mission of Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs.	Besides, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had issued directions on 21.04.2015 to the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) in the country under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 for collection, transportation and treatment of sewage generated in urban areas in their respective States. CPCB also issued directions on 09.10.2015 under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to local authorities of metropolitan cities, State capitals & towns along river Ganga to ensure proper treatment & disposal of sewage in accordance with the stipulated standards.  	As per the  Provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution), Act 1974, industrial units are required to install effluent treatment plants (ETPs) and treat their effluents to comply with stipulated environmental standards before discharging into water bodies.Steps taken by the Government to stop discharge of effluents into rivers inter alia, include issuance of notification of specific  discharge standards, revision of the criteria for categorization of industries and issuing  directions to all State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) to adopt the same, issuance of consent to establish/consent to operate by the SPCBs/PCCs, regular inspections of Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) by CPCB for compliance verification, installation of Online Continuous Effluent Monitoring System (OCEMS) for assessment of effluent quality and compliance status. In addition, the industries are encouraged to reduce their waste water generation by technological advancement, reuse/recycle of wastewater and maintain Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) where ever possible. 	Further, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), SPCBs and PCCs monitor industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under  provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. (d)  Details of State-wise and year-wise funds released to the State Governments/Union Territories during last three years on rivers under NRCP and Namami Gange program is given at Annexure-II.. ***** ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) to (c) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.†4142 to be answered on the 19th March, 2020 regarding Discharge of Polluted Waste into RiversState-Wise Polluted River StretchesS.No.	Name Of State 	Name Of Polluted River Stretches 	Number1	Andhra Pradesh	Kundu, Tungabhadra, Godavari, Krishna, Nagavali 	52	Assam	Bharalu, Borsola, Deepar Bill, Digboi, Kamalpur, Panchnai Brahamputra, Kharsang, Pagldia, Barak, Baroi Bega, Beki, Bhogdoi, Boginadi, Borbeel, Bordoibam Beelmukh, Burhidihing, Dhansiri, Dikhow, Dikrong, Diplai, Disang, Gabharu, Holudunga, Jai Bharali, Jhanji, Kalong, Kapili, Killing, Kohora, Kulsi, Malini, Mora Bharali, Parashali, Puthimari, Ranga, Samaguri, Sankosh, Silsako, Sorusola, Son, Sonai, Tenga Pukhuri 	443	Bihar	Sirsia, Farmar, Ganga, Poonpun, Ram Rekha, Sikrahna 	64	Chhattisgarh	Hasdeo, Kharoon, Mahanadi, Seonath, Kelo 	55	Daman, Diu and Dadra Nagar Haveli	Damangang 	16	Delhi	Yamuna, 	17	Goa	Sal, Mandovi, Talpona, Assonora, Bicholim, Chapora, Khandepar, Sinquerim, Tiracol, Valvant, Zuari 	118	Gujarat	Amlakhadi, Bhadar, Bhogavo, Khari, Sabarmati, Vishwamitri, Dhadar, Triveni, Amravati (Tributary Of Narmada), Damanganga, Kolak, Mahi, Shedhi, Tapi, Anas, Balehwar Khadi, Kim, Meshwa, Mindhola, Narmada 	209	Haryana	Ghaggar, Yamuna 	210	Himachal Pradesh	Sukhana, Markanda, Sirsa, Ashwani, Beas, Giri, Pabbar 	711	Jammu & Kashmir	Devika, Banganga, Chunt Kol, Gawkadal, Tawi, Basanter, Chenab, Jhelam, Sindh 	912	Jharkhand	Garga, Sankh, Subarnarekha, Damodar, Jumar, Konar, Nalkari 	713	Karnataka	Arkavathi, Lakshmantirtha, Malprbha, Tungabhadra, Bhadra, Cauvery, Kabini, Kagina, Kali, Krishna, Shimsha, Asangi Nalla, Bhima, Kumardhara, Netravathi, Tunga, Yagachi 	1714	Kerala	Karamana, Bharathapuzha, Kadambayar, Keecheri, Manimala, Pamba, Bhavani, Chitrapuzha, Kadalundy, Kallai, Karuvannur, Kavvai, Kuppam, Kuttiyady, Mogral, Periyar, Peruvamba, Puzhackal, Ramapuram, Thirur, Uppala 	2115	Madhya Pradesh	Chambal, Khan, Kshipra, Betwa, Sone, Gohad, Kolar, Tapi, Bichia, Chamla, Choupan, Kalisot, Kanhan, Katni, Kunda, Malei, Mandakini (Mp), Newaj, Parvati, Simrar, Tons, Wainganga 	2216	Maharashtra	Godavari, Kalu, Kundalika, Mithi, Morna, Mula, Mutha, Nira, Vel, Bhima, Indrayani, Mula-Mutha, Pawana, Wainganga, Wardha, Ghod, Kanhan, Kolar (Mah), Krishna, Mor, Patalganga, Pedhi, Penganga, Purna, Tapi, Urmodi, Venna, Waghur, Wena, Bindusar, Bori, Chandrabhaga, Darna, Girna, Hiwara, Koyna, Pehlar, Sina, Titur, Amba, Bhatsa, Gomai, Kan, Manjeera, Panchganga, Panzara, Rangavali, Savitri, Surya, Tansa, Ulhas, Vaitarna, Vashisti 	53Contd…17	Manipur	Nambul, Imphal, Iril, Khuga, Khujairok, Lokchao, Manipur, Thoubal, Wangjing 	918	Meghalaya	Umkhrah, Umshyrpi, Kyrhukhla, Nonbah, Umtrew, Lukha, Myntdu 	719	Mizoram	Tiau, Tlawng, Tuipui, Tuivawl, Chite, Mat, Saikah, Tuikual, Tuirial 	920	Nagaland	Dhansiri, Dzuna, Chathe, Dzu, Dzucha, Sano 	621	Odisha	Gangua, Guradih Nallah, Kathajodi, Nandirajhor, Daya, Kuakhai, Banguru Nallah, Bheden, Brahamani, Budhabalnaga, Kusumi, Mahanadi, Mangala, Nagavalli, Nuna, Ratnachira, Rushikulya, Sabulia, Serua 	1922	Puducherry	Arasalar, Chunnambar 	223	Punjab	Ghaggar, Satluj, Kali Bein, Beas 	424	Rajasthan	Banas, Chambal, 	225	Sikkim	Maney Khola, Rangit, Ranichu, Teesta 	426	Tamil Nadu	Cauvery, Sarabanga, Thirumanim Uthar, Vasista, Bhavani, Tambirapani 	627	Telangana	Musi, Manjeera, Nakkavagu, Karakavagu, Maner, Godavari, Kinnersani, Krishna 	828	Tripura	Burigaon, Gumti, Haora, Juri, Khowai, Manu 	629	Uttar Pradesh	Hindon, Kalinadi, Varuna, Yamuna, Gomti, Ganga, Ramganga, Betwa, Ghaghara, Rapti, Sai, Saryu 	1230	Uttarakhand	Bhela, Dhela, Suswa, Kichha, Kalyani, Ganga, Kosi, Nandour, Pilkhar 	931	West Bengal	Vindhadhari, Mahananda, Churni, Dwarka, Ganga, Damodar, Jalangi, Kansi, Mathabhanga, Barakar, Dwarakeshwar, Kaljani, Karola, Mayurkashi, Rupnarayan, Silabati, Teesta 	17Grand Total :	351 ANNEXURE-IIAnnexure referred to in reply to part (d) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.†4142 to be answered on the 19th March, 2020 regarding Discharge of Polluted Waste into RiversDetails of State-wise and year-wise funds released to the State Governments/Union Territories during last three years and current years on rivers under NRCP         (excluding river Ganga and its tributaries) Sl.
