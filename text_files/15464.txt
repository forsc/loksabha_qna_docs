The Post Office Savings Bank is quite popular and spread to the every nook & corner of the country including rural areas, through a network of more than 1.56 lakh Post Offices. The details of number of Post Offices and accounts opened in Small Savings Schemes is as under-<pre>No. of Post Offices	Accounts opened (In Crores)Urban	Rural	Urban	Rural15,599	1,41,001	22.41	16.47         </pre>             Further, since the nationwide launch of IPPB (India Post Payments Bank) on September 1, 2018, the  IPPB has enabled more than 1.36 Lakh Post Offices and 1.90 Lakh Postmen/Gramin Dak Sevaks to provide a complete suite of banking services at the doorstep of the customer providing access to any Aadhaar linked bank account, leading to an increase in rural banking infrastructure by almost 2.5 times. The sheer ability of the last mile doorstep banking service providers (Postmen/Gramin Dak Sevaks) to reach every village on an almost daily basis has brought down the distance to access banking services to ‘0 kms’, truly capturing the essence of Aapka Bank, Aapke Dwar. As on 10.03.2020, IPPB has acquired 2.26 crores customers have accumulated balance of Rs. 781 crores and have conducted financial transaction worth Rs. 14,191 crores.

The emphasis, as the words ‘small savings’ suggest, is to bring the small depositor into the fold of the savings movement. The Post Office Savings Bank has been the main vehicle for these plans across the length and breadth of India since its establishment. (d) 	Yes, sir.  The money deposited/invested in Post Office Savings Schemes during the last three financial years is as under.<pre>Sl.
