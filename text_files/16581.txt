ANSWER




The point-wise reply is as under: (a)  About 6,601 Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Kendras (PMBJKs) are functional across the country as on 10.09.2020, of which 703 PMBJKs are functional in the State of Karnataka. (b)  The product basket of the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) comprises 1,250 medicines and 204 surgical & consumables covering all major therapeutic groups such as Anti-infectives, Anti-allergics, Anti-diabetics, Cardiovascular, Anti-cancers, Gastro-intestinal medicines, Nutraceuticals, etc. Presently, 825 medicines and 122 surgical & consumables are available for sale at PMBJKs. The Price list of these items is enclosed at Annexure. (c)  The Department makes sincere and continuous efforts by requesting the State/UT Governments  to expedite opening of PMBJKs so as to make  quality generic medicines at affordable prices available to the citizens of the country. The opening of PMBJKs at any place, however, depends on receipt of application from individual entrepreneurs and availability of the pharmacists. The Government has set a target to open 10,500 PMBJKs by March 2025 all across the country. All districts of the State of Karnataka have been covered by opening at least one PMBJK in each district. About 364 applications (online and offline) have been received for  opening of PMBJKs in the current financial year from the State of Karnataka, out of which in-principle approval to 291 applicants have  been accorded.
