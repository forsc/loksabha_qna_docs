Further, as per the 5th Minor Irrigation Census conducted by this Ministry, there are 5,16,303 water bodies in the rural areas of the country being used for minor irrigation, out of which 53,396 are not in use for various reasons such as non availability of water, less and erratic rainfall, siltation, salinity etc.(b)  Works related to water resources development & management are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priorities.  In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes. Contd…P/2//2//Central Assistance (CA) for restoration of water bodies is provided by the Ministry under the scheme of Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies, which is a component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY).  The scheme aims at restoring the lost irrigation potential by improvement and restoration of existing water bodies. The restoration of water bodies also helps in ground water recharge.Under the RRR of Water Bodies scheme, a total of 2219 water bodies with an estimated cost of Rs.1910.68 crore have been taken up for restoration in various states since XII Plan onwards as per eligible proposals received from the concerned State Governments, out of which 1160 water bodies have been reported to be completed upto March, 2019. Total Central Assistance amounting to Rs.369.11 crore has been released to the States upto March, 2019 for completion of works of these water bodies. Further, such works are undertaken through MGNREGA also. States-wise detail of works carried out under RRR of Water Bodies Scheme and MGNREGA are at Annexure – I.(c)  Initiatives on water management including conservation and artificial recharge to ground water comes under the purview of concerned State Government. However, Central Government is also taking several measures towards sustainable management of ground water resources in the country. Some of the key ground water management initiatives taken by the Central Government are given at Annexure-II.(d) to (e)  Matter related to encroachment of water bodies comes under purview of the concerned State Government. However, considering the importance of water bodies for socio economic development, Secretary (WR, RD & GR) vide letter dated 26.02.2016 requested State Governments to take necessary steps for keeping all the water bodies encroachment free. Further, Secretary (WR, RD & GR) vide letter dated 07.11.2016 requested the State Governments to take appropriate action in respect of inclusion of water bodies in land records, inclusion of water bodies as integral part of town planning process, strict action for the encroachers, etc.Further, water bodies are included under RRR of Water Bodies scheme only after concerned State Government certify that these are encroachment free.***** ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred to in reply of Part – (b) of Unstarred Question No. †1764 to be answered on 28.11.2019 in Lok Sabha regarding “Restoration of Water Bodies”.States-wise details of works carried out under RRR of Water Bodies Scheme and MGNREGAS No.	State	Works completed under MGNREGA (last 5 years)	RRR of Water Bodies (XII Plan onwards)		Ponds	WELLS	Renovation of traditional water bodies	CA Released(in crore)	Completed Water Bodies1	ANDAMAN & NICOBAR	79	1	24		2	ANDHRA PRADESH	630839	45358	81473	2.70	3	ARUNACHAL PRADESH	1043	67	84		4	ASSAM	12056	1141	2164		5	BIHAR	12981	2778	6726	6.26	6	CHHATTISGARH	62470	10553	23031		7	GOA	14	4	320		8	GUJARAT	16035	4795	20322	8.81	9	HARYANA	1643	830	2172		10	HIMACHAL PRADESH	50827	1726	3013		11	JAMMU AND KASHMIR	3565	2824	4825		12	JHARKHAND	264966	63921	9224		13	KARNATAKA	93503	27279	35940		14	KERALA	19787	29404	87425		15	LAKSHADWEEP	0	0	2		16	MADHYA PRADESH	91416	133743	11693	37.70	12117	MAHARASHTRA	30199	106616	12493		18	MANIPUR	1134	169	295	10.37	19	MEGHALAYA	2147	364	913	5.18	420	MIZORAM	7223	889	543		21	NAGALAND	1254	125	113		22	ODISHA	36785	8062	23815	110.65	71523	PUDUCHERRY	74	0	2157		24	PUNJAB	211	879	12141		25	RAJASTHAN	111846	15625	18454	50.23	5226	SIKKIM	67	50	5		27	TAMIL NADU	42202	4488	161290	16.25	10428	TELANGANA	97088	23626	9552	104.56	16429	TRIPURA	30161	11213	9173		30	UTTAR PRADESH	53990	8267	47041	16.41	31	UTTARAKHAND	9961	1143	3916		32	WEST BENGAL	204667	11657	88626			Total	1890233	517597	678965	369.11	1160 ANNEXURE-IIAnnexure referred to in reply of Part – (c) of Unstarred Question No. †1764 to be answered on 28.11.2019 in Lok Sabha regarding “Restoration of Water Bodies”.Some of the key ground water management initiatives taken by the Union Government:•	Hon’ble Prime Minister has written a letter to all sarpanchs regarding the importance of water conservation and harvesting and exhorted them to adopt all appropriate measures to make water conservation a mass movement.•	Ministry of Jal Shakti has recently launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan- a campaign for water conservation and water security in 1592 stressed blocks in 256 districts.

So far, 15 States/UTs have adopted and implemented the ground water legislation on the lines of Model Bill.•	Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has prepared a conceptual document titled “Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Ground Water – 2013” which provides information about area-specific artificial recharge techniques to augment ground water resources based on the availability of source water and capability of subsurface formations to accommodate it. The Master Plan is available in public domain and has also been circulated to the State Governments for implementation.•	Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has been constituted under Section 3 (3) of the “Environment (Protection) Act, 1986” for the purpose of regulation and control of ground water development and management in the country.

Aquifer maps and management plans have been shared with the respective State Government agencies. Public Interaction Programs are being organised at grass root level for disseminating the tenets of the Aquifer Management Plans for the benefit of the stakeholders.•	Central Ground Water Board is implementing innovative schemes for Aquifer Rejuvenation under ‘Ground Water Management and Regulation’ scheme in select overexploited blocks of the Aspirational districts on pilot basis. Water Harvesting and Recharge Augmentation are proposed to be piloted through construction of Bridge cum Bhandaras in parts of Maharashtra. Further, a Joint Action Plan has been prepared with the Ministry of Rural development for effective implementation of water conservation and artificial recharge structures in convergence with MGNREGS. Nine water stressed blocks in the State of Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have been identified, where work is in progress.•	Best practices of water conservation by various entities including private persons, NGOs, PSUs etc. have been compiled and put on the web site of the Ministry for the benefit of general public.
