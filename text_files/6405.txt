ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c) 	The National Policy on Skill Development and Skill India Mission was announced in 2015 with the aim to tackle the skill challenges of India by addressing, inadequate overall capacity for skilling and acute shortages in critical areas;on an average poor quality and employability of the skilling eco-system;low aspirational value associated with skill acquisition; and lack of vertical progression pathways for vocational education.The Indian Institute of Skills (IISs) was conceptualized to address above mentioned issues and to develop state of art skill institutions. The vision behind setting up IIS is to build world-class skill training centres by learning from and imbibing best practices from internationally renowned existing skill institutions. IISs are envisaged to have the unique features that would make them different from the existing setup of Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), Polytechnics, Advanced Training Institutes (ATIs) (which are now known as National Skill Training Institutes).The Union Cabinet has approved the proposal of setting up of IISs at three locations in the country at Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh), Mumbai (Maharashtra) and Ahmedabad (Gujarat). This Ministry has requested the Government of Gujarat for locating/ identifying the landfor setting up of IIS at Ahmedabad.
