                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d):	Yes Sir, there was some delay in arrival of Monsoon this year. However, as per the second Long Range forecast released by India Meteorological Department (IMD) rainfall during the monsoon season 2019 over the country as a whole is likely to be normal.  The proper distribution of rainfall is more important for normal crop production. Therefore, it is too early to determine the drought like situation in any areas from agriculture point of view. Till date, no State Government has submitted any Memorandum seeking financial assistance from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) during Kharif, 2019 season.India Meteorological Department (IMD) runs an operational Agrometeorological Advisory Service (AAS) viz., Gramin Krishi Mausam Sewa (GKMS) scheme for the benefit of farming community in the country. Under the scheme, medium range weather forecast at district level is generated and issued and based on the forecast, Agromet Advisories are prepared and communicated by the Agromet Field Units (AMFUs) located at State Agricultural Universities, institutes of ICAR and IIT etc.Contd….2/-- 2 -Keeping the need for Agromet Advisory Services (AAS) to be more crop and location-specific and to be extended to all farming households in the country into consideration, the network of GKMS scheme is being extended to district level by establishing additional 530 District Agromet Units (DAMUs) in the premise of Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVK) in collaboration with Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). District Agromet Units (DAMUs) are being established in KVKs under ICAR network in a phasewise manner for rendering block level AAS.ICAR-Central Research Institute of Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA) Hyderabad in collaboration with State Agriculture Universities has prepared crop contingency plan for 648 districts in the country to sustain agriculture production in the eventually of any sudden change in weather. Besides, inter Departmental meetings are held every week to monitor rainfall situation, sowing of crops and status of water storage and inputs availability.  Weekly video conference with all States and UTs is also held to review and monitor the progress of area coverage, rainfall situation, crops condition and issuing advisory to the States as and when required.  There is also system to send weather based advisory to registered farmers by SMS through m-kisan portal apart from information through DD Kisan.In the eventuality of drought and other natural calamities, State Governments are empowered to initiate necessary relief measures from State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) which is readily available with them. Additional financial assistance, over and above SDRF, is also considered from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) on receipt of Memorandum from State Governments.*******
