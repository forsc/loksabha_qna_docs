ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (c) Private Coaching Institutes do not come under the purview of thisMinistry. Many of these operate at the school level and hence are under the directpurview of the State Governments. However, this Ministry has issued directions to allState Governments to take steps for effective regulation of such centres. In theinterest of students including the most disadvantaged, Government has launchedStudy Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds (SWAYAM), which offersinteractive course content such as video lectures, reading material, self-assessmentthrough tests and quizzes and online discussion forum for clearing doubts forstudents from Class 9 to post-graduation. The content can be accessed free of costby anyone, anywhere at any time. Another initiative of the Government called IndianInstitute of Technology - Professor Assisted Learning (IIT-PAL) provides video contentin Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics prepared by IIT Professors andKendirya Vidyalaya (KV) teachers for Class XI and Class XII students aspiring to joinIITs and other Institutions. The content is available free of cost on dedicated DTHchannels of SWAYAM PRABHA.*****
