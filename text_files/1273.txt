                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE; MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MINISTER OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????; ??????? ?? ???????????? ??????; ?? ?????? ??????? ??????(a)	Yes Sir, Government has set up a Prime Minister’s Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council (PM-STIAC) in August 2018 with the mandate to facilitate assessment of current status in specific science and technology domains, comprehend challenges in hand, formulate and coordinate major inter-ministerial missions, develop futuristic roadmap for policy interventions in science, technology and innovation and render advice to the Prime Minister on a periodic basis. The office of the Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA) to the Government of India serves as the Secretariat to the Council with the PSA as its ex-officio chairman. (b)	The Composition of the PM-STIAC is as follows:1.	Prof. K Vijay Raghavan, PSA to  GoI (chair)2.	Dr. V.K. Saraswat, Member, NITI Aayog and Former DG, DRDO3.	Dr. A.S. Kiran Kumar, Former Chairman, ISRO4.	Prof. Ajay Kumar Sood, Professor IISc, Bengaluru5.	Maj. Gen. Madhuri Kanitkar, Dean, Armed Forces Medical College, Pune6.	Prof. Sangamitra Bandopadhyay, Director, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata7.	Prof. Manjul Bhargava, Professor, Princeton University, USA8.	Prof. Subash Kak, Professor, Oklahoma State university, USA, &9.	Shri Baba Kalyani, Chirman and MD, Bharat Forge, Pune.The PM-STIAC has so far,  met on four occasions.(c)	Yes Sir, PM-STIAC meetings have resulted in the formulation of several new inter-departmental technology missions including Natural Language Translation, Quantum Frontier, Artificial Intelligence, National Biodiversity Mission, Electric Vehicles, Bio-Science for Human Health, Waste to Wealth, Deep Ocean Exploration, and Accelerating Growth of New India’s Innovations (AGNIi). An Apex Committee Chaired by PSA provides overall direction to each of the mission towards its coordinated implementation.(d)	Yes Sir. There is a partnership MoU between the Office of PSA and Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi for providing holistic, integrated and sustainable scientific & technological solutions for transforming ‘Waste to Wealth’. The immediate objective is to implement technologies that are available with various national and international academia, industries, and research laboratories by setting up pilot projects on-site and demonstrate conceptual proof of the technology under Indian conditions.(e)	A number of ministries/departments of Government of India have taken steps for promoting waste to wealth technologies practiced worldwide and implement them at ground level at Indian cities. The Department of Science & Technology (DST) had initiated a programme named “Waste Management Technologies” in the year 2015 that aims to promote development of suitable indigenous technologies with potential to ameliorate the environmental load from residuals generated by industrial development and consumption lifestyle. The revised focus of the programme is six areas, i.e. Electronic Waste, Hospital Waste, Plastic Waste, and Solid Waste from Mining, Metallurgical, Ceramic Industries, Agricultural waste & Stubble Management and Laboratory Hazardous & Nonhazardous waste. Technology Development Projects proposed by R&D agencies, in association with industry, aimed to develop pre-competitive technologies/ techniques/ processes are funded with the criteria of novelty & scientific uniqueness, DST thereby aims to promote innovative technologies that can have commercial potential. Some Technology Business Incubators supported by Department of Science & Technology have ‘Waste management’ as one of the Technology thrust area and are promoting startup ventures working on waste management. Department of Biotechnology (DBT) has supported 10 R&D projects during 2016 under “Swachh Bharat Mission” for treatment of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), out of which, three are Demonstration Level Projects and seven are R&D level projects related to MSW treatment technologies. One demonstration plant has been set up. The emerging technology is validated by an expert group constituted by DBT for taking it forward at pre-commercial level. Work on technologies transferred / implemented on ‘Waste to Wealth’ are being undertaken by 47 laboratories under Council of Scientific and Industrial research (CSIR) across the country.                                                  ********
