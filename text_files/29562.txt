ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a): Yes, Sir. The Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, at the 26th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 26) held in Glasgow, United Kingdom, expressed to intensify India’s efforts to address the challenge of climate change by presenting to the world five nectar elements (Panchamrit) of climate action by India. One of these elements is to achieve net zero emissions by 2070which presents vision for our long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies.He also emphasized the need for climate justice and climate friendly lifestyles to safeguard future generations and the planet from the impacts of climate change.He also articulated that India’s historical cumulative emissions and per capita emissions are very low despite being home to more than 17% of the global population. (b) and (c):The overarching decision titled Glasgow Climate Pact, adopted by all countries, noted with deep regret that the goal of developed country Parties to mobilize jointlyUSD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation actions andtransparency on implementation has not yet been met. In the same context, on behalf of developing countries, Hon’ble Prime Minister put forth strongly that the global call towards increased ambition in climate mitigation should be correspondingly matched by adequate additional means of implementation encompassing new and additional financial support and technology transfer to the developing countries. Different studies and institutions have projected variously in terms of the financial requirement for India’s enhanced climate ambitions. India’s vision to achieve net zero emissions by 2070 have been carefully considered after taking in to account the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and the national circumstances.India’s intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) has provided a preliminary estimate that at least USD 2.5 trillion (at 2014-15) would be required for meeting India’s climate actionsfrom 2015 to2030. India’s INDC submission also noted that substantial scaling up of climate actions would require correspondingly greater resource and technology transferfor India. A detailed and full scale assessment on international climate finance needs would depend upon the gap between actual cost of implementing India’s plans and what could be made available from domestic resources. (d):Providing new and additional financial resources as well as transfer of technology to address the global climate change challenge are among the commitments and responsibilities of the developed countries under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Paris Agreement. India will also require its due share from such international financial resources and technological support. (e) and(f):  Under the UNFCCC, India, in 2009, made a voluntary declaration to reduce the emissionintensity of GDP by 20-25 per cent from 2005 levels by 2020. Subsequently, under the Paris Agreement, India, in 2015, has submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) with quantified targets to reduce the emissions intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level, to achieve about 40% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, and to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2eq through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. The Government is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), which is the overarching policy framework and comprises of national missions in specific areas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan eco-system, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. Further, 33 States/Union Territories have prepared State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs) consistent with the objectives of NAPCC. In addition, the Government has launched many schemes and programs to scale up India’s action on both, the adaptation and mitigation.Appropriate measures are being taken under these schemes and programs across many sectors including water, agriculture, forest, energy and enterprise, sustainable mobility and housing, waste management, circular economy and resource efficiency, etc. The Net Zero target by 2030 by India Railways alone will lead to a reduction of emissions by 60 million tonnes annually. Similarly, India massive LED bulb campaign is reducing emissions by 40 million tonnes annually. Apart from resolutely addressing climate change domestically, for the world India has created and continue to nurture International Solar Alliance (ISA) and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. India is also taking lead with Sweden in innovation for hard to abate sectors. As a result of the aforesaid measures, India has progressively continued decoupling of economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions. India’s emission intensity of gross domestic product (GDP) has reduced by 24 per cent between 2005 and 2016. Installed capacity of solar energy in India has increased by more than 18 times from 2.63 GW in March 2014 to 47.66 GW in October 2021. India’s current share of non-fossil sources based installed capacity of electricity generation is more than 40%. Forest and tree cover has increased by 1.3 million ha between the 2015 and 2019 as per assessments of the Forest Survey of India.India’s Landuse, land-use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sink (CO2 removal) is on the rise by 3.4 per cent between 2014 and 2016 and by approximately 40 per cent between 2000 and 2016.***
