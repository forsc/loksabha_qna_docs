                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)   About 62 percent of the utilizable water in the country is being utilized for various purposes.(b)  Water being a State subject, State Governments allocate and supply water for different purposes including irrigation as per their priorities and requirements. The data on water requirement and water supplied for irrigation is not maintained on yearly basis. The utilizable water has been estimated to be 1122 Billion Cubic Meter (BCM) which comprises of 690 BCM of surface water and 432 BCM of replenishable ground water resources. Also, it has been estimated that 699 BCM of water (including 450 BCM of surface and 249 BCM of ground water) is being utilized for various purposes. Further, the Twelfth Five Year Plan (2012-17) document indicates that agriculture consumes around 80% of India’s available water resources. (c)  Government of India, in partnership with the states, has launched Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) to enable every household in the country to have potable water at service level of 55 litre per capita per day (lpcd) by 2024 through Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC). Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is implementing Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) in 500 cities with mission components such as water supply, storm water drainage, etc. To mitigate the problem in drinking water sector, the water supply component inter-alia, provides for rehabilitation of old water supply systems including treatment plants and rejuvenation of water bodies, specifically for drinking water supply and recharging of ground water. Irrigation Projects are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priority. In order to supplement their efforts, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programme. Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) is being implemented with an aim to enhance physical access of water on farm and expand cultivable area under assured irrigation, improve on farm water use efficiency, introduce sustainable water conservation practices etc. Out of 99 prioritized projects under Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) component of PMKSY, 40 projects have been reported to be completed/almost completed.
