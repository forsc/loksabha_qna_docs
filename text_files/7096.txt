World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) has suspended accreditation of National Dope Testing Laboratory (NDTL) w.e.f 20/08/2019 for a period of six months due to some shortcomings notedby the WADA Laboratory Expert Group during its visit in September, 2018. At the time of suspension NDTL had already complied with 38 of the 47 action points to the satisfaction of WADA. For the remaining a compliance letter to WADA had been sent in October, 2019. WADA has assured to send its Expert Group in January, 2020 to facilitate lifting of the suspension.(c) No Sir, this Ministry has not constituted any Committee to enquire into issues relating to prevalence of doping in the recent past.

Justice Mudgal submitted his report in May, 2012 and appropriate action was taken.(d) The stage for testing of athletes for Tokyo Olympics has not yet come.(e) & (f) No doping scandal has come to the notice of the Government. As and when the result of dope testing is found positive for any athlete, appropriate action is taken by NADA.*****
