ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (g) Petroleum & Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) is the authority to grant authorization to the entities for the development of City Gas Distribution (CGD) network inGeographical Areas (GAs) as per PNGRB Act, 2006. PNGRB identifies GAs for authorizing the development of CGD network in synchronization with the development of natural gas pipeline connectivity and natural gas availability. CGD would be accessible in 229 GAs covering 406 districts spread over 27 States and UTs covering approximately 70 percent of India’s population and 53 percent of its geographical area including Solapur and Palghar districts of Maharashtra, districts of Chhattisgarh and districts of Madhya Pradesh. As per the minimum work plan submitted by the entities to PNGRB under 9th and 10th Round, details of GA-wise CNG Stations, are at Annexure – I & II.As per information provided by Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC), approximately 18,646 MMSCM of Natural gas has been produced domestically and approximately 19,031 MMSCM of LNG has been imported in the country during the period April-October, 2019. This gas also caters to demand of Piped Natural Gas (PNG) and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG).Entities operating in the State of Tamil Nadu face issues for acquiring Right of Use/Right of Way, delay in grant of permission/clearances and resistance from villages for laying of Natural Gas/other Pipelines.With regard to development of natural Gas coverage in Tripura, PNGRB has provisionally authorized Indradhanush Gas Grid Limited for development of North-East Natural gas Pipeline. PNGRB has also authorized Gomati District and West Tripura (Except area already authorized) to Tripura Natural Gas Company under 9th CGD bidding round.In order to promote the expansion of CGD networks and enhance the usage of natural gas in cities, the Government has taken following steps:i. Domestic gas, which is cheaper than imported gas, has been allocated to meet the entire requirement of PNG (Domestic) and CNG (Transport) segments of CGD sector and it has been kept under no cut category.ii. Public Utility Status granted to CGD Projects by Ministry of Labour and Employment.iii. Ministry of Defence has issued guidelines for use of PNG in its residential areas/unit linesiv. Department of Public Enterprises has issued guidelines to Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) to have the provisions of PNG in their respective residential complexes.v. Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has issued advisory to State Governments on following aspects:a. To standardize the Road Restoration/permission charges along with time bound permission in accordance with the local conditions.b. Earmarking of land plot for development of CNG Stations at the planning stage of town/city and same should be specified in the revised Master Plan.c. Relevant modification in building by-laws for providing gas pipeline infrastructure in residential & commercial buildings at architectural design stage.vi. Further, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has directed Central Public Works Department& National Building Construction Corporation to make provisions of PNG in all Government Residential complexes.
