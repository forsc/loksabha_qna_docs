Anganwadi Services Scheme: A Centrally Sponsored Scheme and is one of the flagship programmes of the Government of India and represents one of the world’s largest and unique programmes for early childhood care and development. It is the foremost symbol of the country’s commitment to its children and nursing mothers, as a response to the challenge of providing pre-school non-formal education on one hand and breaking the vicious cycle of malnutrition, morbidity, reduced learning capacity and mortality on the other. The beneficiaries under this scheme are children in the age group of 0-6 years, pregnant women and lactating mothers. 2. Ujjawala Scheme: A Comprehensive Scheme for Prevention of Trafficking and Rescue, Rehabilitation and Re-Integration of Victims of Trafficking for Commercial Sexual Exploitation is implemented by the Government.  The funding pattern for the release of funds will be shared between the Central Govt., States and implementing agencies in ratio 60:30:10, except North Eastern and Himalayan States where the applicable sharing ratio shall be 80:10:10 respectively and in case of UT administrations the sharing ratio shall be 90:10 between the Central Govt and implementing agency. 3. One Stop Centre (OSC) and Universalisation of Women Helpline: Women Welfare Division is implementing two schemes from Nirbhaya Fund namely, One Stop Centre (OSC) and Universalisation of Women Helpline (WHL). Both the schemes are 100 percent Centrally funded. The scheme of One Stop Centres was initiated in March 2015 for facilitating access to an integrated range of services including police, medical, legal, psychological support and temporary shelter to women affected by violence. The Scheme is funded through Nirbhaya Fund. Under the scheme, it has been envisaged that One Stop Centres would be set up across the country in phased manner. In the first phase, one Centre was sanctioned per State/UT. Out of the 733 sanctioned OSCs, a total of 704 One Stop Centres are operational in 35 States/UTs. They have assisted almost 4.54 lakh women.  The Scheme of Universalisation of Women Helpline is being implemented since 1st April 2015 and is intended to provide 24 hours emergency and non-emergency response to women affected by violence through referral (linking with appropriate authority such as police, One Stop Centre, hospital) and information about women related government schemes/programmes across the country through a single uniform number (181). Women helpline is operational in 33 States/ UTs and handled more than 54.00 lakh calls assisting the aggrieved women. 4. Working Women Hostel Scheme: Working Women Hostel Scheme is implemented by the Government with the objective to provide safe and conveniently located accommodation for working women, with day care facility for their children, wherever possible, in urban, semi urban, or even rural areas where employment opportunity for women exist.  5.

For the purpose of counting number of beneficiaries paid in a financial year, the beneficiary is counted if a beneficiary is paid any instalment in a year. If the same beneficiary receives any instalment in subsequent years, the beneficiary will be counted in number of beneficiaries paid in that year as well. The total beneficiaries paid across the years cannot be added to get the total beneficiaries paid. However, in case of enrolment, the beneficiary is counted for enrolment only in the first year of registration. 2.
