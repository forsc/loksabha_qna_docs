Drip & Sprinkler irrigation are  being promoted under the ‘Per Drop More Crop’ component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY-PDMC).  Under the scheme, financial assistance is available @ 55% for small and marginal farmers and @ 45% for other farmers for installation of Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation systems. Further, 25% higher unit cost have been taken into calculation of subsidy for the North Eastern and Himalayan states and 15% higher for States with low penetration of Micro Irrigation for larger adoption of systems by the farmers under the scheme. In addition, some States provide additional incentives / top up subsidy for encouraging farmers to adopt Micro Irrigation.(b) & (c):	 The PDMC scheme emphasises on promotion of micro irrigation for water intensive/guzzling crops to minimise water requirement in all the States including the States providing free or subsidized power to farmers.         Farmers are encouraged to take advantage of the scheme by wide publicity through press & print media, publication of leaflets/booklets, organization of workshops, exhibitions, farmer fairs, information on State/Government of India web portals etc.  Trainings and Field Level Demonstrations etc. are conducted to educate farmers through Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVK).          Farmers are given advisories for adoption of modern agronomic practices like raised bed sowing, alternate furrow irrigation, furrow irrigation, mulching, Direct Seeded Rice (DSR), System of Rice Intensification (SRI), laser land leveling, adoption of drought tolerant varieties, and diversifying cropping pattern with low water requiring crops like pulses, oilseeds, maize and agro-forestry.********
