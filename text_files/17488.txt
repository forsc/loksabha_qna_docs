MINISTER OF EDUCATION (SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a)	 As per UDISE+ 2018-19 (Provisional), total number of schools in the country is 15.50 lakh, out of which, 14.14 lakh schools have functional drinking water facility and 14.45 lakh schools have functional toilets. (b) and (c) Education is in the concurrent list of Constitution and most of the schools are under jurisdiction of concerned States & UTs. State and UT Governments are the appropriate Governments under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009. The appropriate Governments have the responsibility and mandate to provide school infrastructure including drinking water and toilet facilities in schools in accordance with the norms laid down in the Schedule to the RTE Act, 2009 and as per respective State RTE Rules. States and UTs have been repeatedly advised to ensure that all the schools, including those under the non-Government sector (private, aided schools, etc.) in their jurisdiction should have provision for separate toilets for boys and girls; and safe and adequate drinking water facilities for all children.The Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Centrally Sponsored Scheme for School Education – Samagra Shiksha w.e.f. 2018-19, which subsumes the three erstwhile Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). Under Samagra Shiksha, States and UTs are supported for strengthening of existing Government schools, and for creation and augmentation of infrastructure facilities including drinking water and toilets as per proposals received from respective State/UT. The scheme also envisages an annual recurring composite school grant varying upto Rs. 1,00,000/- per annum depending upon the number of students, for all government schools. Each school is required to spend at least 10% of the composite school grant on activities related to Swachhata Action Plan for maintenance and repair of school building including toilets and other facilities to keep the infrastructure in good condition.Under erstwhile SSA till 2017-18 and Samagra Shiksha effective from 2018-19, provision of 2.50 lakh drinking water facilities, construction of 4.08 lakh Boys’ toilets, 5.28 lakh separate girls’ toilets and 1.54 lakh toilets for Children with Special Needs (CwSN) have been sanctioned for elementary schools to States and UTs.  Out of which, States and UTs have reported completion of 2.35 lakh drinking water facilities, construction of 3.84 lakh Boys’ toilets, 5.14 lakh separate girls’ toilets and 1.27 lakh toilets for CwSN till 31.08.2020.  Under erstwhile RMSA till 2017-18 and Samagra Shiksha from 2018-19, provision of 12,388 drinking water facilities, construction of 33716 Boys’ toilets, 35866 Girls’ toilets’, 1,856 toilets for CwSN have been sanctioned for secondary and senior secondary schools to States and UTs. Out of which, States and UTs have reported completion of  10,331 drinking water facilities, construction of 25087 Boys’ toilets, 25214 separate girls’ toilets and 105 toilets for CwSN till 31.08.2020.During 2020-21, under Samagra Shiksha Scheme, approval has been given for the provision of drinking water facilities in 4840 schools with an estimate of Rs.7995.54 lakh and for construction of 4124 boys’ toilets, 2957 girls’ toilets and 4022 CwSN toilets with an estimate of Rs. 23069.31 lakh.The Department of School Education & Literacy had undertaken Swachh Vidyalaya initiative to provide separate toilets for girls and boys in all Government schools within one year upto 15thAugust, 2015. Under the initiative, construction/re-construction of 4,17,796 toilets was completed in 2,61,400 Government elementary and secondary schools in one year till 15thAugust 2015.             The Ministry of Panchayati Raj has also advised the Panchayati Raj Departments of all States to include the provision for rehabilitation/repair of existing toilets and drinking water systems in schools as per the norms and requirements, while preparing Gram Panchayat Development Plans for using Fourteenth Finance Commission Grants. The Ministry of Education (Department of School Education & Literacy), Ministry of Panchayati Raj and Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation have also jointly requested the State/UT Governments to improve water supply and sanitation systems in schools through the Gram Panchayats.*****
