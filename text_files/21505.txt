ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2590 BY SHRI ARJUN LAL MEENA AND SHRI P.P. CHAUDHARY TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 10.03.2021 REGARDING RAILWAY PROJECTS IN RAJASTHAN(a): Railway projects are sanctioned Zonal Railway-wise, not State-wise, as Indian Railways’ network spans  across various State boundaries. However, as on 01.04.2020, 30 projects (11 new lines, 05 gauge conversion and 14 doubling) covering a total length of 5,173 km and costing `57,247 crore, falling fully/partly in the State of Rajasthan are in different stages of Planning/Sanction/Execution. Rajasthan is covered by Northern Railway, Western Railway, North Western Railway, West Central Railway, and North Central Railway Zones of Indian Railways. The details of allotment of funds and expenditure project-wise and Zonal Railway wise are made available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in> Ministry of Railways> Railway Board> About Indian Railways>Railway Board Directorates> Finance (Budget)>Railway wise Works Machinery & Rolling Stock Programme.(b):   Timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions, priority of projects, etc. and all these factors affect the completion of the project. (c): Average Annual Budget allocation for infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/partly in the State of Rajasthan, during 2014-19 has been increased to  `2,951 crore per year,  from  `682 crore per year (during 2009-14). Thus, an increase of 333% over the average annual budget allocation of 2009-14 (`682 crore per year).Budget allotment for infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/partly in the State of Rajasthan for financial year 2019-20 was  `4686 crore, which is 587% more w.r.t. 2009-14. Budget allocation of `4582 crore has been provided for Financial Year 2020-21, which is 572% more with respect to average Budget outlay for 2009-14.(d): Coach factories are set up keeping in view the overall requirement of Railways. With the increase in productivity of the existing coach factories over the past few years and the available production capacity, there is no requirement to set up additional coach production unit at Bhilwara, at present. Jaisalmer and Barmer are already connected by Broad Gauge line to Kandla Port. However, for direct connectivity, surveys for Jaisalmer to Barmer and Barmer to Bhabhar were completed in 2012-13. As these projects were not viable financially and since adequate connectivity already exists, the projects have not been taken up.  *****
