Recently, the Government has initiated the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme, effective from 1.12.2018, to provide income support to all small and marginal landholder farmer families across the country, subject to certain exclusions, to enable them to take care of expenses related to agriculture and allied activities as well as domestic needs. The Scheme provides a payment of Rs.6000/- per year, in three 4-monthly installments of Rs.2000/-, to the farmers’ families with cultivable land holding upto 2 hectare, subject to certain exclusions relating to higher income groups. The ambit of the Scheme has now been expanded to cover all farmers in the country irrespective of the size of their land holdings, subject to all other exclusions.Contd…..2/-- 2 –For giving a major boost for the income of farmers, the Government had approved an increase in the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for all Kharif and Rabi Crops for the         2018-19 season at a level of atleast 150 percent of the cost of production.With a view to provide better insurance coverage to farmers for risk mitigation on account of natural calamities and other factors, the Government has launched a Crop Insurance Scheme namely Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) from Kharif 2016 season. This scheme provides insurance cover including post-harvest risks in specified instances.
