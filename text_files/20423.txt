ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a) to (d)	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. ***** STATEMENT TO BE LAID ON THE TABLE OF LOK SABHA IN RESPECT OF PARTS (a) TO (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION No. *153 FOR 11.02.2021 REGARDING “SLUDGE MANAGEMENT” ASKED BY DR. BEESETTI VENKATA SATYAVATHI AND SHRI N. REDDEPPA, M.P.(a) & (b)  No Sir. However, a Research Collaboration Agreement has been signed between IIT, Kanpur and Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research regarding development of Sludge Management Framework.(c)  In general, sludge deposited in the river bed during the lean flow season (pre-monsoon season) gets washed off annually and transported downstream due to scouring of river bed during high stages in the river when velocities are high and lot of turbulence is generated. Desludging of river beds, therefore, is usually not done. However, need based desludging in specific reaches of rivers / drains / conveyance channels is carried out by State Government as per priority. The conventional method used for desludging the rivers, conveyance channels / drains, is by using mechanical dredging. The dredged sludge / material is, thereafter, deposited at designated locations in terms of environment laws.(d)  The proven technologies at the Lab level and pilot scale are available for further uptake and replication by the line Ministry and relevant state organisations.  *****
