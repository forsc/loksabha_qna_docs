ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STEEL			   (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a)&(b): Yes,  Sir.  In order to achieve the target of 300 MTPA of steel production capacity by 2025, High Level Committee on Manufacturing in its meeting dated 9.7.2013 & chaired by the then Prime Minister, had suggested a concept of Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for setting up of large Integrated Steel Plants in the country. Four mineral rich states namely Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand and Karnataka were identified for developing such SPVs. However, as per the National Steel Policy, 2017 approved by the Union Cabinet, the target of 300 MTPA capacity is to be met by 2030-31.(c)&(d): Steel being a deregulated sector, decisions relating to setting up of Steel Plants are taken by individual steel producers private or public sector, based on commercial consideration and market dynamics.********
