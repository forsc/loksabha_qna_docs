                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS [SHRI KIREN RIJIJU]   (a) to (d) National Games are organized by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), IOA decides the venue and dates for the National Games.  The Central and State Government assist IOA for organizing the National Games.  The IOA has not been able to organize the National Games at regular intervals.  The need to organize National Games at regular intervals has been impressed upon the IOA.  The last National Games were held in 2015 in Kerala.  The next National Games are scheduled in Goa from 20th October to 4th November, 2020.  IOA has allotted 37th, 38th and 39th National Games to Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Meghalaya respectively.  This Ministry is organizing Khelo India Games since 2018.  The first Khelo India Games were held in Delhi from 31st January to 8th February 2018.  The second and third Khelo India Games were held at Pune from 9th January to 20th January, 2019 and at Guwahati from 10th January to 22nd January, 2020 respectively.  The Central Government is also starting annual Khelo India University Games to promote sport and athletes. The first Khelo India University Games are scheduled at Cuttack and Bhubaneshwar from 22nd February to 1st March, 2020.  (e)  No proposal for sports infrastructure in Karur district of Tamil Nadu is pending for consideration in this Ministry.  Sports being a State subject the primary responsibility for sports infrastructure, including at district and sub district level, rests with the State Government.   *****
