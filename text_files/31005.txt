  MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)  (a): The average cost of production of Coal in Coal India Limited (CIL) including its subsidiary companies is Rs. 1310.88/Tonne. Private coal companies are not mandated to share information on production cost of coal from their mines. (b) & (c):  In view of reply (a) above, question does not arise. (d): One mine has been closed in WCL as per the Mine closure plan. Further, the following 7 mines of Western Coalfields Limited (WCL) were suspended due to economic unviability and safety issues during the period 2017-18 to 2019-20.

(f): There is no such proposal with the government. (g): The PBT (Profit Before Tax) of WCL during the year 2020 - 21, was 352.56 Crores.
