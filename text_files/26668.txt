                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)	 & (b): As per National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), NSS 64th Round report, migration rates, including those of rural youths, for the period 1983 to 2007-08, from different NSS rounds are as under:                                      All-India (Rural)Round(Year)	                        Migration Rates (per 1000 persons)64th (July 07-Jun 08)	                          26155th (July 1999-June 2000)	                  24449th (Jan-June,1993)	                          22843rd (July 1987- June 88)	                  23238th (Jan-Dec,1983)	                          209(c)	 & (d):   Citizens of the country migrate to different parts of the country in quest of better job opportunities and prospects. In this regard, Ministry of Labour and Employment has informed that in order to regulate the employment of the inter-state migrant workers and to provide for their condition of service, the Government has enacted the Inter-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service), Act, 1979. This Act has now been subsumed in the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 which provides for decent working conditions, minimum wages, grievance redressal mechanism, toll free helpline and social security to all categories of organized and unorganized workers including Migrant Workers. The Code is applicable to every establishment in which 10 or more inter-state migrant workers are employed or were employed on any day of the preceding 12 months.So far as the Ministry of Rural Development is concerned, the Ministry is implementing various rural development schemes for creating employment opportunities and rural infrastructure. All these measures encourage people to stay in rural areas, earn their livelihood and raise their quality of life near their places of residence and hence act as a deterrent to distress migration of rural population to cities.  The details are as under:i.	Under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), guaranteed wage employment of 100 days in a financial year is provied to a rural household whose adult members are willing to take up manual work. Further, an additional 50 days of wage employment is provided over and above 100 days in the notified drought affected areas or natural calamity affected areas in the country on recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.ii.	Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission  (DAY-NRLM) is implemented with the objective of providing self-employment to the women members  of the rural poor families by mobilizing them into Self Help Groups(SHGs). iii.	Rural Self Employment and Training Institutes (RSETIs) provides for skill development programme for self employment. This training with access to Bank loans helps in creating self-employment opportunities at local level. iv.	Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM) is aimed at developing 300  rural growth clusters called ‘Rurban Clusters’ which have latent potential for growth, in all  States and UTs with the objective to bridge the rural urban divide and reduce migration from rural to urban areas and eventually facilitate reverse migration.v.	Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana  (PMGSY) is aimed at providing connectivity by way of an all-weather road to eligible unconnected habitations in rural areas so that these habitations can have access to basic health services, education and markets for their produce.******
