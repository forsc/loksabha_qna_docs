ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a): Under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik), 250 routes (including in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand) have been operationalized. The details of such RCS routes are attached at Annexure-A.  ;;(b): Requests have been received for providing air connectivity from cities of Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand to the neighbouring States that includes requests from Hon''ble Members of Parliament . ;With repeal of Air Corporation Act in March, 1994, the Indian domestic aviation sector was deregulated. Airlines are now free to select any market and network they wish to service and operate. In this regard, Government has laid down Route Dispersal Guidelines, with a view to achieve better air connectivity to different regions in the country. It is, however, up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places keeping in view traffic demand and commercial viability subject to compliance of Route Dispersal Guidelines issued by Government. ;
