                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) to (d)  A statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****        STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *418 TO BE ANSWERED ON 31.03.2022 ON “STUDY ON POLLUTION LEVEL IN RIVERS”. (a) to (d) Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in association with Pollution Control Boards/Committees in different States/Union Territories (UTs), have been monitoring the water quality of rivers and other water bodies through a network of  monitoring stations under the National Water Quality Monitoring Programme. Based on water quality monitoring results, pollution assessment of rivers has been carried out by CPCB from time to time. As per the last report published by CPCB in September 2018, 351 polluted stretches were identified on 323 rivers based on monitoring results in terms of Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), an indicator of organic pollution. The 351 Polluted river stretches have been categorized into 5 Priority Classes based on BoD levels as underPriority	BOD level in mg/L	No of Polluted river stretchesPriority  I	exceeding 30	45Priority  II	between 20-30	16Priority  III	between 10-20	43Priority  IV	between 6-10	72Priority  V	between 3-6	175Total	 	351State-wise details of polluted river stretches including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal  are given at Annexure. Cleaning and rejuvenation of rivers is a continuous process. Rivers and other water bodies in the country are polluted mainly due to discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage from cities/ towns and industrial effluents in their respective catchments.   It is the responsibility of the States/Union Territories (UTs), Local Bodies and Industrial Units to ensure required treatment of sewage and industrial effluents to the prescribed norms before discharging into rivers and other water bodies, coastal waters or land to prevent and control of pollution therein. For conservation of rivers, the Department of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation (DoWR, RD & GR) has been supplementing the efforts of the States/UTs by providing financial and technical assistance for abatement of pollution in identified stretches of rivers in the country through the Central Sector Scheme of Namami Gange for rivers in Ganga basin, and the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) for other rivers. Proposals for pollution abatement works in the towns along polluted river stretches are received from the States/UTs from time to time for consideration under NRCP and sanctioned based on their prioritization, conformity with NRCP guidelines, availability of plan funds, etc. NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches on 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country with the project sanctioned cost of Rs. 6,050.18 crore, and inter-alia, a sewage treatment capacity of 2,677 million liters per day  (mld) has been created. Under the Namami Gange programme, a total of 364 projects, including 160 projects for sewage treatment of 5,024 mld and a sewer network of 5,227 kms, have been sanctioned at a cost of Rs. 30,853 crore. In addition, sewerage infrastructure is created under programs like Atal Mission for Rejuvenation & Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and Smart Cities Mission of Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs. Further, priority for effective rejuvenation of small rivers has been accorded under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). Steps taken by the Government to stop discharge of industrial effluents into rivers, inter-alia include issuance of notification of specific discharge standards, revision of the criteria for categorization of industries and issuing directions to all  SPCBs/PCCs to adopt the same, issuance of consent to establish/consent to operate by the SPCBs/PCCs, regular and surprise inspections of Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) for compliance verification against stipulated environmental norms, installation of Online Continuous Effluent Monitoring System (OCEMS) for assessment of effluent quality and compliance status. In addition, the industries are encouraged to reduce their waste water generation by technological advancement, reuse/recycle of wastewater and maintain Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) where ever possible. As per the provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution), Act 1974, industrial units are required to install effluent treatment plants (ETPs) and treat their effluents to comply with stipulated environmental standards before discharging into river and water bodies. Accordingly, CPCB, State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) and Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) monitor industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under provisions of these Acts. Besides, in compliance of the orders of National Green Tribunal (NGT) in Original Application No.673/2018 regarding rejuvenation of polluted river stretches in the country, States/UTs are required to implement approved action plans for restoration of the polluted stretches in their jurisdiction as identified by CPCB and published in their report of 2018, within the stipulated timelines. As per the orders of NGT, regular review on implementation of action plans is undertaken in the States/UTs and also at Central level. ***** ANNEXURE ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.418 TO BE ANSWERED ON 31.03.2022 REGARDING ‘STUDY ON POLLUTION LEVEL IN RIVERS’   State / UTs Wise Polluted River Stretches   Polluted River Stretches- Priority I & Priority II STATE	 RIVER NAME	 RIVER STRETCH	BOD RANGE/ MAX VALUE(mg/l)	 PRIORITY ASSAM	BHARALU	GUWAHATI TO CHILARAI NAGAR	52.0	I	BORSOLA	Along SARABBHATTI, GUWAHATI	34.0	I	SILSAKO	Along chachal, Guwahati	34.0	I	SORUSOLA	Along Paltan Bazar, Guwahati	30.0	IIDAMAN, DIU AND DADRANAGAR HAVELI	 DAMANGANG A	 SILVASSA TO DAMAN JETTY, MOTI DAMAN	 10 -
