ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) NEP has Chapter 23 on TECHNOLOGY USE AND INTEGRATION and Chapter 24 on ONLINE AND DIGITAL EDUCATION, where details of all policy initiatives and action points are given.The highlights are:<pre>•	An autonomous body, the National Educational Technology Forum (NETF) to be created (Para 23.3).•	E-content will continue to be developed by all States in all regional languages, as well as by the NCERT, CIET, CBSE, NIOS, and other bodies/institutions, and will be uploaded onto the DIKSHA platform (Para 23.6). CIET will be strengthened to promote and expand DIKSHA as well as other education technology initiatives. (Para 23.6).•	Pilot studies for online education.•	Apart from these other initiatives in paras 24.4 & 24.5 such as: Digital infrastructure, Online teaching platform and tools, Virtual Labs, Online assessment and examinations, Laying down standards, Creating a Dedicated Unit for Building of World Class Digital Infrastructure etc. will address the issues of reach of digital education and preparing students for the 21st century.</pre>(b) NEP 2020 took into consideration the previous policies and The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education, 2009 and is built on the foundational pillars of Access, Equity, Quality, Affordability and Accountability. The policy is synchronized with the basic objective of RTE Act which is to provide free and compulsory elementary education and is also aligned to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and holistic development of learners.(c) & (d)  NEP 2020 Para 4.13 states that the three-language formula will continue to be implemented while keeping in mind the Constitutional provisions, aspirations of the people, regions, and the Union, and the need to promote multilingualism as well as promote national unity. However, there will be a greater flexibility in the three-language formula, and no language will be imposed on any State. The three languages learned by children will be the choices of States, regions, and of course the students themselves, so long as at least two of the three languages are native to India. In particular, students who wish to change one or more of the three languages they are studying may do so in Grade 6 or 7, as long as they are able to demonstrate basic proficiency in three languages (including one language of India at the literature level) by the end of secondary school. NEP 2020 Para 4.14 states that all efforts will be made in preparing high-quality bilingual textbooks and teaching-learning materials for science and mathematics, so that students are enabled to think and speak about the two subjects both in their home language/mother tongue and in English.***************
