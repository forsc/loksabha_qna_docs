Price capping of Coronary Stents by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority in 2017 and 2018 resulted in price reduction upto 85%. The price fixation of coronary stents has resulted in the annual notional saving of Rs.4,547 crores to the public.Under para 19 of DPCO, 2013, Government fixed the ceiling prices of Orthopaedic Knee Implants for knee replacement vide notification dated 16th August, 2017.  This has resulted in average price reduction of various type of Knee implant upto 69% resulting in annual notional savings of Rs.1,500 crore to the consumer.  The MRPs of remaining 20 medical devices, being non-scheduled category, are monitored by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority to ensure that no manufacturer increases the maximum retail price of a drug more than ten percent of maximum retail price during preceding twelve months.NPPA so far has issued 27 demand notices to 23 Medical Device companies for violation of para 20 of DPCO,2013 for a total amount of Rs.185 crore (overcharge amount and interest) of which, an amount of Rs.25.50 crore has been recovered from the companies till 15.11.2019.

The said scheme is a Central Sector Scheme with a total financial outlay of Rs. 480 Crore. Under the sub-scheme ‘Assistance to Medical Device Industry for Common Facility Centre’, financial assistance would be provided for creation of common facilities in any upcoming Medical Device Park promoted by State Governments/State Corporations.

So far, the following proposals have been received:i.	Andhra Pradesh Medtech Zone Ltd. (AMTZ) for creation of CFC for Superconducting Magnetic Coils Testing & Research. AMTZ is an enterprise under the Government of Andhra Pradesh located at Visakhapatnam.ii.
