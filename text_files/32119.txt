ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)  Developed countries, in 2009, had committed to a climate finance mobilization goal of USD 100 billion per year, by 2020. The overarching decision titled Glasgow Climate Pact, adopted by all countries at COP 26, noted with deep regret that the goal of developed country Parties to mobilize jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation has not yet been met. In this regard, the COP 26 has requested the Standing Committee on Finance to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to prepare a report in 2022 on progress towards achieving the goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion per year to address the needs of developing countries.  As regards India’s climate actions are concerned, it has so far largely financed from domestic sources, including government budgetary support as well as a mix of market mechanisms and fiscal instruments and policy interventions. As per India’s Third Biennial Update Report (BUR) to the UNFCCC in February 2021, the domestic mobilization of finance fully overshadows the sum total of international funding. During 2014 to 2019, while Global Environment Facility and Green Climate Fund have provided grants to a total of only US $ 165.25 million, the corresponding domestic mobilization amounts to US$ 1.374 billion. (b) Under the Paris Agreement, India has submitted Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) with quantified targets to reduce the emissions intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level, to achieve about 40% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, and to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2eq through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.  Further, India, as a part of the National Statement, delivered by Hon’ble Prime Minister at the 26th Session of the Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC in Glasgow, United Kingdom in November 2021, has made the following further announcements: i.	India''s non-fossil energy capacity to reach 500 GW by 2030.ii.	India will meet 50 per cent of its energy requirements with renewable energy by 2030.iii.	India will reduce its total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes from now to 2030.iv.	India will reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 45 per cent by 2030, over 2005 levels.v.	By 2070, India will achieve the target of net zero emissions.While making the above announcements, Hon’ble Prime Minister has further stated that India resolved to move forward with new commitments and in such times, the transfer of climate finance and low cost climate technologies becomes more important. Providing new and additional financial resources as well as transfer of technology to address the global climate change challenge are among the commitments and responsibilities of the developed countries under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Paris Agreement. India will also require its due share from such international financial resources and technological support. The Government is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), which is the overarching policy framework and comprises of national missions in specific areas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan eco-system, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. Further, 33 States/Union Territories have prepared State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs) consistent with the objectives of NAPCC. In addition, the Government has launched many schemes and programs to scale up India’s action on both, the adaptation and mitigation. Appropriate measures are being taken under these schemes and programs across many sectors including water, agriculture, forest, energy and enterprise, sustainable mobility and housing, waste management, circular economy and resource efficiency, etc.  Apart from resolutely addressing climate change domestically, for the world India has created and continue to nurture International Solar Alliance (ISA) and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. India is also taking lead with Sweden in innovation for hard to abate sectors. As a result of the aforesaid measures, India’s emission intensity of GDP has reduced by 24 per cent between 2005 and 2016. Therefore, India is on track to meet its voluntary declaration to reduce the emission intensity of GDP by 20-25 per cent from 2005 levels by 2020. India’s non fossil fuel based installed capacity is 156 GW, which is around 39.98% of the total installed capacity.  Forest and tree cover has increased by 1.3 million ha between the 2015 and 2019 as per assessments of the Forest Survey of India. India’s Land use, Land use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sink (CO2 removal) is on the rise by 3.4 per cent between 2014 and 2016 and by approximately 40 per cent between 2000 and 2016.***
