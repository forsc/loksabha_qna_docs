The Interdisciplinary Ayush Research and Development Task Force has formulated and designed clinical research protocols for prophylactic studies and add-on interventions in COVID-19 positive cases through thorough review and consultative process of high repute experts from different organizations across the country for studying different interventions. AYUSH-64 is one of the formulation identified for the clinical studies. The drug was developed Central Council of Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), an autonomous research organization, under Ministry of AYUSH in 1980 through extensive pharmacological, toxicological, and clinical studies for infective febrile conditions like Malaria.        Based on the empirical evidence, AYUSH-64 was repurposed for COVID-19 and extensive studies viz. in-silico, in-vitro and clinical studies were conducted to evaluate its therapeutic potential. Accordingly, CCRAS conducted five clinical trials on AYUSH-64 in asymptomatic and mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 as standalone or adjunct to standard conventional care. Other clinical studies on AYUSH-64 were conducted at Institute of Teaching and Research in Ayurveda (ITRA), Jamnagar and National Institute of Ayurveda (NIA), Jaipur, autonomous organizations under Ministry of Ayush. These studies were registered with Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) under Indian Council of Medicinal Research (ICMR). These clinical studies on AYUSH 64 were monitored and reviewed periodically by Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The clinical studies on AYUSH 64 were undertaken in collaboration with 09 reputed institutions which include King George Medical University, Lucknow, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jodhpur, Government Medical College, Nagpur, Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences, Wardha, Bombay Municipal Corporation COVID Care Centre, Mumbai, Shri Dhanwantri Ayurvedic College, Chandigarh, Guru Govind Singh Government Medical Hospital, Jamnagar, Ayurveda and Unani Tibbia College, New Delhi and Chaudhary Brahm Prakash Ayurved Charak Sansthan, New Delhi.c)	The research outcomes of the clinical trials has demonstrated efficacy of AYUSH-64 in the treatment of asymptomatic & mild cases as standalone and for the management of mild and moderate COVID-19 as an adjunct to standard care. It was observed that AYUSH-64 as adjunct treatment to Standard Care resulted in significant improvement in clinical recovery, reduced duration of hospital stay without any progression of the disease to severe or critical stage. Also, there was improvement in Quality of life (QoL) parameters. AYUSH-64 was found to be well tolerated and clinically safe. The preprints of three clinical trials are available online. d)	Yes, Sir. The AYUSH-64 has been repurposed for the management of asymptomatic and mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 and has been recommended in National Clinical Management Protocol based on Ayurveda and Yoga for management of COVID-19.During the second outbreak of COVID-19 in India, the Ministry of AYUSH has also launched nation-wide campaign through its Research Councils and National institutes for mass distribution of AYUSH-64 to asymptomatic and mild to moderate COVID-19 patients in home isolation. Further, the technology of Ayush-64 has been transferred to 29 Ayush Pharmaceutical manufacturing units for repurposing of COVID-19.**********
