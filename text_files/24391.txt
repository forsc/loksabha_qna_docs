                                                          MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI) (a): 	The National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) provides for coverage of upto 75% of the rural and 50% of the urban population which at Census 2011 comes to 81.35 crore persons, for receiving highly subsidized foodgrains i.e. rice/ wheat/ coarse grains @ Rs.3/2/1 per kilogram respectively. At present, about 79.51 crore persons are covered under the Act across the country.  A statement indicating the State/Union Territory-wise number of beneficiaries presently covered under the NFSA is at Annexure. In addition to the entitlement under the NFSA, these  beneficiaries are also entitled to receive 5 kg of foodgrains (rice / wheat) per person per month, free of cost from May to November, 2021 under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana to mitigate the impact of the Covid pandemic......2/--2-(b) to (e): 		The National Food Security Act is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and the State Governments. The responsibility of identification of eligible beneficiaries under the Act rests with the State Government as per the provisions of the Act. The Central Government has issued an advisory to all the States/Union Territories to identify all eligible and poor persons/ households including vulnerable Sections of the Society for inclusion under the NFSA. States are undertaking cleaning up of their beneficiary database so that bogus ration cards get deleted and better targeting of rightful beneficiaries is ensured. There is no report from any of the States/Union Territories regarding exclusion of nearly 1.97 crore poor particularly from vulnerable groups.*** ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN PART (a) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.244 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 20.07.2021 IN THE LOK SABHAState-wise number of beneficiaries covered under the National Food Security Act, 2013Sl.
