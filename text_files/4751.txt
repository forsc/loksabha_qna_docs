                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)&(e) With the objective of assessment of impact of climate change on the coastal areas of the country, the National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), Ministry of Earth Sciences is carrying out work on developing a decision support system for climate change impact assessment on geographical areas and socio economic impact in the coastal areas. NCCR has also prepared shoreline change maps for the period 1990-2018.  The Ministry of Earth Science also monitors the shoreline changes along the Indian coast on an annual basis. Studies indicate various patterns namely, advancement of the sea landwards (erosion), advancement of the land towards sea (accretion) and stable shoreline respectively. Such shoreline changes have been observed for Southern Indian Coastal States, which have impacted the local habitations.A national strategy for coastal protection along with guidelines for coastal protection measures have been framed for all Coastal States and Union territories by the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change.The Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, under the Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project (ICZMP) have undertaken delineating and demarcating the hazard line along the entire coastal belt of the country, including the inter-tidal areas. The hazard line is indicative of the shoreline changes, including the sea level rise due to climate change and is a projection of impact due to sea level rise, and shoreline changes over a long period of time viz. over 100 years. This line is required to be used by the Coastal State agencies concerned as a tool for Disaster Management for the coastal environment, including planning of adaptive and mitigation measures. The hazard line for the entire coast of the country has been mapped and is featured in the new Coastal Zone Management Plans of the coastal States / Union territoriesapproved by the Ministry.The ICZMPalso envisages large-scale assessment of the risks associated with shoreline changes and preparation of a framework for development of management solutions to combat these risks.  Under the Phase-I of the project, shoreline management plans are prepared for five (05) identified coastal stretches in Gujarat, Odisha and West Bengal, on a pilot basis.***
