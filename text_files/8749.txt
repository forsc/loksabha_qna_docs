B. cancer, AIDS and leprosy, destitute widows including those of farmers who committed suicide, destitute divorced women and women in process of divorce, women freed from prostitution and outraged women. Under this scheme, Rs.1000 per month is given to a beneficiary whose family annual income is up to Rs. 21,000/-. The demand of increasing present ceiling to Rs. 50,000/- is being made by people’s representatives. Since this is a state sponsored scheme, the Government of Maharashtra has to take decision in this regard.  ************
