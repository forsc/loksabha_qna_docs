ANSWER




                                                        (a):  The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021 notified on 25th February 2021, have been formulated to ensure accountability to users and their safety. The Rules also prescribe the additional due diligence to be followed by significant social media intermediaries. These Rules are as a result of public consultation, comments and suggestions received during stakeholders’ meetings and supercede the erstwhile Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011. There is no proposal with Ministry to review the Rules.(b) and (c): Section 79(1) of the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000 grants intermediaries exemption from liability with regard to any third party content uploaded on their platforms. This exemption is subject to the provisions of sections 79(2) and 79(3) of the Act and compliance with the Rules.(d): Section 79 of the IT Act already provides safe harbor protection to intermediaries. Freedom of speech and expression is a constitutionally guaranteed right to citizens under Article 19(1) with restraints as stated in Article 19(2). These fundamental rights cannot be infringed by anybody.******
