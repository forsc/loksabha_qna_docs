Cotton is produced at large scale in Maharashtra and Rajasthan. The Cotton Advisory Board (CAB) has estimated the cotton production in Maharashtra and Rajasthan for the current cotton season 2019-20 at 82 lakh bales and 25 lakh bales respectively. (b):	There are sufficient processing units available in Maharashtra.(c):	Does not arise, in view of (b) above.(d):	Cotton is primarily an agricultural produce. Post harvesting of Cotton and having reached to the Ginning and Pressing factories, the processed Cotton becomes industrial raw material for the Textile Mills. Farmer sells their produce and his role ends there. Government provides conducive policy environment, facilitate creation of enabling conditions for the industry and private entrepreneurs to set-up manufacturing units including modern spinning mill.  Government has been assisting entrepreneurs to set-up textile units under various programmes and schemes such as Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme, Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks, PowerTex India, a Comprehensive Scheme for Powerloom Sector, etc. The benefit of above Schemes is available across the States / regions of the country for the entire textile value chain.Further, to safeguard the interest of cotton farmers and to give them remunerative price of their produce, Government has nominated Cotton Corporation of India (CCI), as a nodal agency to undertake Minimum Support Price (MSP) operations of seed cotton (kapas) in all cotton growing States. During the crop year 2019-20 (as on 14.09.2020), CCI procured 26.25 lakh bales of seed cotton (kapas) under MSP in Maharashtra.(e):	There is no such proposal for setting-up a branch of Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) in Nagaur District of Rajasthan as CCI is already operating in the state with its two branches at Bhilwara and Sriganganagar along with 25 procurement centers in 10 districts under their jurisdictions. In Nagaur District, CCI is having two cotton procurement centres viz, Merta City and Nagaur under its branch office at Bhilwara.  During cotton season 2019-20, CCI has procured around 28000 quintals kapas (equivalent to 5300 bales) in Merta City and 87,000 quintals kapas (equivalent to 16,500 bales) in Nagaur.****
