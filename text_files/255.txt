ANSWER




                                                                                             MINISTER OF FINANCE                                  (SMT. NIRMALA SITHARAMAN)(a), (b) and (c): The total number of Income Tax Returns (ITRs) (including e-Returns and paper-Returns submitted in Original, Revised or in reply to notices) filed during the last four Financial Years (F.Y.) are as below:Number of ITRs filedF.Y. 2015-16	F.Y. 2016-17	F.Y. 2017-18	F.Y. 2018-19    46,304,070	55,804,275	68,707,674	67,331,157       This apparent decrease in the number of ITRs  filed during F.Y. 2018-19  as compared with F.Y.2017-18 was due to an amendment in  sub-section(5) of section 139 of the Income-tax Act, 1961(‘Act’)  brought  in vide Finance Act, 2017, w.e.f. 01.04.2018, which had reduced the time limit available for filing of revised return by one year. As per the amended provisions, a revised return can be furnished only up to the end of the relevant Assessment Year (A.Y.)  or completion of assessment whichever is earlier. As a result, only 0.14 crore ITRs pertaining to A.Y. 2017-18 were filed during F.Y. 2018-19 as these were the revised ITRs for the relevant A.Y. which could only be filed during the F.Y 2018-19 due to change in law. However, during F.Y. 2017-18, apart from the ITRs for the A.Y. 2017-18, nearly 1.21 crore ITRs were filed for A.Y. 2016-17. The balance number of ITRs filed for A.Y. 2015-16 and prior A.Ys is 0.06 crore. 	In this regard, it is relevant to mention that during  F.Y. 2018-19, a total of 6.49 crore  ITRs of A.Y. 2018-19 were e-filed compared with 5.47 crore ITRs  of  AY 2017-18 e-filed in F.Y. 2017-18 marking an increase of almost  19% of the  ITRs filed  for the A.Y 2018-19 when compared with previous A.Y.2017-18.                                      *****
