                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a) & (b):   Yes Sir, MPEDA has adopted multipronged strategy to assist the aquaculture sector to recover from the crisis caused by the pandemic. Since January 2020 till December 2021 MPEDA has released Rs. 176.50 crores as subsidies for aquaculture development, production, promotion and export. To facilitate the aquaculture sector, all the services being provided by MPEDA such as export facilitation, registration of exporters, payments to suppliers, release of subsidies etc. were made online & validity of certificates were extended. The issues related to logistics, shortage/clearance of containers, delayed payments etc., were promptly addressed. In addition, Covid-19 guidelines booklet was issued to spread awareness on safety and hygiene in seafood, both forward and backward linkages were provided to aquaculture farmer, uninterrupted supply of inputs for fish hatcheries and farms and availability of raw and packing materials for the processing plants were ensured, Buyer Seller Meets were organized and an e-commerce platform was launched for better marketing of the shrimp. Due to these efforts, exports of marine products have registered a growth of 35% during April 2021- December 2021 as compared to the same period of previous year. *****
