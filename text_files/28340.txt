ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b): For environment protection, the Government has taken various steps like notification of industry specific emission and effluent standards under the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, and their enforcement through consent mechanism, regular monitoring, issuance of directions for installation of online effluent and emission monitoring systems for continuous check on pollution levels; categorization of industries based on their pollution potential; issuance of various directions under Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, etc. There are adequate legal and regulatory frameworks at national and state levels in the country which regulate protection, conservation and management of the natural resources including forests of the country for maintaining a better environment.Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change, has notified environmental standards for 86 categories of pollution sources, out of which 63 are from industrial sectors including Coal based Thermal Power Plants (TPPs) and oil refineries. Besides, ambient air quality standards and general standards for emission and effluent for source not covered by sector specific norms have also been notified. The Ministry implements the provisions of Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006, for assessing the impact of developmental projects on environment. The EIA Notification, 2006, as amended from time to time envisages the process for granting Environmental Clearance (EC) which includes Screening, Scoping, Public Hearing and Appraisal.(c) to (e) and (g):  The National Forest Policy, 1988, states that “a massive need-based and time-bound programme of afforestation and tree planting, with particular emphasis on fuel-wood and fodder development, on all degraded and denuded lands in the country, whether forest or non-forest land, is a national imperative.” As per provisions of National Forest Policy, 1988, a participatory approach in forest management named as Joint Forest Management has been implemented for creating massive people’s movement through the involvement of village committees for the protection, regeneration and development of degraded forests lands situated in the vicinity of villages. The National Afforestation Programme (NAP) scheme is implemented by three tier institutional setup through the State Forest Development Agency (SFDA) at the State level, Forest Development Agency (FDA) at the forest division level and the Joint Forest Management Committees (JFMCs) at the village level, which are registered societies.	National Mission for a Green India (GIM) is one of the ongoing eight Missions outlined under the National Action Plan on Climate Change. GIM activities were started in 2015-16. So far, a sum of Rs. 492.20 Crores have been released to fifteen states namely Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram, Odisha, Punjab, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, West Bengal and Arunachal Pradesh and Union territory of Jammu & Kashmir for undertaking the afforestation activities over 184161 ha through Joint Forest Management Committees. The Mission funds are also being utilized for activities related to enhancement of livelihood income of people living in and around forest areas.In addition, the outlay of Annual Plans of Operation (APOs) under Compensatory Afforestation Fund (CAMPA) approved for the State of Uttar Pradesh during 2019-20 and 2020-21 is Rs. 285.68 crore and Rs. 442.01 crore respectively. The activities of APO include compensatory afforestation, assisted natural regeneration, artificial regeneration and other afforestation works.(f): Steps for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases are being coordinated under the overarching framework of the National Action Plan for Climate Change (NAPCC), which comprises of several National Missions including on Solar energy and energy efficiency. India has embarked on one of the largest clean energy transitions in the world, through ambitious targets in non-fossil and renewable energy. India has also made strong strides in sustainable mobility as exemplified, for example, in its policies for incentivising e-vehicles, rapid development of mass/public transportation networks, electrification of Indian Railways and net zero Railways by 2030, leapfrogging from BS IV to BS VI fuel norms, 20% ethanol blending in fuel by 2025, etc. Forest and tree cover in India is also on the rise, and these also serve as sinks for greenhouse gases. Under the Paris Agreement, India has submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) with quantified targets  to reduce the emissions intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level, to achieve about 40% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, and to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2eq through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. India, as a part of the National Statement delivered at COP-26 in Glasgow in November 2021, has made the following further announcements: i.	India''s non-fossil energy capacity to reach 500 GW by 2030.ii.	India will meet 50 per cent of its energy requirements with renewable energy by 2030.iii.	India will reduce its total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes from now to 2030.iv.	India will reduce the carbon intensity of its economy by 45 per cent by 2030, over 2005 levels.v.	By 2070, India will achieve the target of net zero emissions.*****
