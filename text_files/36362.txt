In addition, pumping arrangement has also been made in identified RUBs, to drain out water expeditiously in case of emergency. Wherever natural drainage is not available, pumping arrangement is provided during monsoon at all identified Road Under Brides (RUBs) having water logging possibility.  No such case of any nearby industry getting affected due to water logging in RUB has been reported to Railways.(d) to (f):  There is no case reported of loss of life due to short circuiting in the accumulated  water on the RUBs/Subways constructed and maintained by Railways.*****
