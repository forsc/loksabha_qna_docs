                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a)	 The Overseas Indian Facilitation Centre (OIFC) was set up in 2007 as a not for profit Trust in partnership with Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). Following merger of erstwhile Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs (MOIA) with the Ministry of External Affairs in February 2016 and transfer of work relating to promotion of investment in India by overseas Indians to Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP) (now renamed as Department for Promotion of Industry & Internal Trade, (DPIIT)), Ministry of Commerce & Industry, it was decided with the approval of Cabinet to wind up the OIFC. The organization ceased to exist from 30 March, 2017. Therefore, there have been no activities of the OIFC in the last three years.(b) 	The objective of OIFC was to engage with prospective overseas Indian investors and inform them about the facilities and benefits available to them for investment in India. OIFC’s activities facilitated economic engagement of overseas Indians with India, advised them about investment opportunities and facilitated their business partnerships in India.

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy is reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to making it more investor friendly, including for NRIs. The extant FDI policy allows special dispensation for NRI investments in various sectors such as Construction Development, Civil Aviation etc. Further, investments made under Schedule IV of FEMA (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019 on non-repatriation basis by NRIs and Companies, Trusts and Partnership Firms incorporated outside India and owned by such NRIs are deemed to be domestic investment at par with investment made by residents.***
