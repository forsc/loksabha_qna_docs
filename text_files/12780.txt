ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STEEL			   (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a)to(c): No, Sir.  Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) has not launched special incentive scheme aiming to provide impetus to local MSMEs based in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh during the last five years.	However, a new scheme “Ispati Illakon ka Vikas: SAIL ke Saath” for incentivizing MSMEs, located in the same districts as the five integrated steel plants (ISPs) of SAIL, has been launched recently. Workshops have also been conducted at all the four coordinating branch locations i.e. Rourkela, Bokaro, Bhilai and Durgapur (for Durgapur Steel Plant and IISCO Steel Plant) for creating and spreading awareness about the scheme amongst the target customers. ********
