ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (d): The Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) is being implemented by the Ministry from 1st April, 2016 across the country. The beneficiaries under PMAY-G are identified based on housing deprivation parameters, as per Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011 data, and after due verification by Gram Sabha followed by an appellate process. As per Framework For Implementation of PMAY-G, it is the beneficiary who constructs his/ her house himself/ herself or get it constructed under his/ her supervision. The minimum unit size of a house constructed under PMAY-G is to be 25 Sq. m. with dedicated area for hygienic cooking. The State/UT Governments provides the beneficiaries of PMAY-G with a bouquet of options of house designs suitable to their area, but ultimately, it is the choice of the beneficiary to construct the house as per the design suitable to him and on his/her own land. PMAY-G Scheme encourages convergence of benefits e.g. Individual Household Latrine, Electricity connectivity, gas connection under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana among others. States/UTs are encouraged to converge more benefits to PMAY-G beneficiaries, for a dignified living. (e):  The Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) is unique and transformative as it has a holistic approach towards development of selected villages. It envisages integrated development of the village across multiple areas such as agriculture, health, education, sanitation, environment, livelihoods etc. It seeks to not only provide physical infrastructure and access to basic amenities but also improve the standard of living, enrich social capital and build community spirit. The development of SAGY Gram Panchayats is envisaged through effective convergence and implementation of existing Development Schemes of Government under the administrative control of respective Ministries without allocation of any additional fund. Under PMAY-G, special preference is given to SAGY villages to saturate eligible beneficiaries on priority. SAGY aims to encourage and amplify the positive features of rural area in implementing activities its Village Development Plan (VDP). *****
