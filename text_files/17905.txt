ANSWER




                                                        ???????  ??? ?????? ?????? (???? ????? ????) THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI  PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) & (b):   Since e-commerce and e-market opens up opportunities for firms, including major companies, traders & local businessmen, to reach newer markets and expand their area of operation, it is expected that it is going to benefit them significantly. Though, no data is collected by the Government, on sales/profits made by various companies, exclusively due to expansion of e-markets. Representations have been received, wherein traders associations have informed that their business has been impacted by activities of large e-commerce companies. During the lockdown, home delivery of goods was encouraged, in order to minimize the movement of individuals outside their homes, as per consolidated guidelines issued by Ministry of Home Affairs on March 28, 2020 and businesses have started home delivery of goods during this period. (c) & (d):    	The draft National e-commerce policy, which was placed in public domain on February 23, 2019, seeks to create a facilitative regulatory environment for growth of e-commerce sector. It has been formulated with a vision to provide a level-playing field to all stakeholders, including the individual consumers, MSMEs and start-ups and promote exports, which will help small manufacturers.More recently, the Consumer Protection (e-commerce) Rules, 2020 have been notified as on July 23, 2020, which provides a legal framework for all goods and services bought or sold over digital or electronic network, with a clear structure of liability borne by e-commerce entities and sellers.*******
