ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA) (a) & (b)  For a water resources project, proposal for Financial Assistance through this Ministry can be taken up only once the Detailed Project Report (DPR) of the project is appraised and accepted by the Advisory Committee of this Ministry on Irrigation, Flood Control & Multipurpose Projects (Advisory Committee).In case of Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project (ERCP), appraisal by Central Water Commission (CWC) revealed that against the prevailing norms of planning a project for water availability at 75% dependability, Government of Rajasthan has carried out the planning with water availability at 50% dependability in case of ERCP. Also, as is the norms for all projects proposed on inter-state rivers, the other co-basin State(s), which in this case is Madhya Pradesh, are to be taken on board. Government of Madhya Pradesh has so far refrained from issuing No Objection to the project, on account of planning being at lower dependable yield.In view of the impact the project would have in the water-stressed eastern part of Rajasthan, Ministry of Jal Shakti is seized of the issue. Alternative methods for augmenting the water for the project are being explored, in consultation with both the State Governments. Further, this Ministry is also holding frequent consultation with the two Governments, to seek convergence. Also, a Working Group has been formulated recently under Member (Water Projects & Planning), CWC for this purpose. However, techno-economic appraisal followed by acceptance by the Advisory Committee, which is an essential pre-requisite for forwarding proposal for any financial assistance through this Ministry, can be taken up only once the above issues are resolved.(c) to (e)  Water resources projects are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priorities. Role of Government of India is limited to being catalytic, providing technical support and in some cases partial financial assistance in terms with the existing schemes being implemented by the Ministry of Jal Shakti. Further, techno-economic clearance of medium and major irrigation projects on inter-state river systems, is required to be appraised by Central Water Commission under this Ministry.*****
