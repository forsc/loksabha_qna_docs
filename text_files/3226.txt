The country has been divided into 20 river basins. The basin-wise details of the rivers and their length are given at Annexure-I & Annexure-II respectively. (c)  There is no classification of rivers as big and small rivers. Central Water Commission (CWC) monitors important/major rivers only.(d) & (e) Two types of rivers exists in the country; (1) Perennial Rivers and (2) Non-Perennial Rivers. In Perennial Rivers water remains available throughout the year. Non-perennial rivers are rain fed rivers in which water flows only during the rainfall period. The flow in the rivers is dynamic parameter and depends on many parameters such as rainfall, its distribution and intensity in the catchment, catchment characteristics and withdrawals / utilizations of water. 	Considering annual average flows of last 20 years of terminal sites of major rivers, no appreciable increasing / decreasing trend in water availability has been observed. ***** ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (A) AND (B) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.*279 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 11.07.2019 REGARDING “EXTINCTION OF RIVERS/TRIBUTARIES” Annexure - IBasin-wise details of the rivers*S.
