ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	to (e) Central Pollution Control Board is monitoring air quality at four  identified locations namely, Taj Mahal, Itmad-ud-daulah, Ramgarh  ( all Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) protected monuments ) and Nunhai ( Industrial areas)  in Agra, Uttar Pradesh since 2002. Air quality monitoring data of these locations are available at https://cpcb.nic.in/agra-airquality-data.php.Taj Trapezium Zone Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority is formulated for prevention and control of pollution of  TTZ. Initiatives taken by TTZ authority inter alia, include restriction of plying of petrol, diesel driven vehicles around 500 meter of Taj Mahal,  plying of battery operated buses and other vehicles within 500 meter of Taj Mahal, green belt development  and other infrastructure development near monuments, prohibition of establishment / expansion of polluting industries, use of natural gas as fuel in industries in Agra and Firozabad, ban on burning of biomass/ solid waste, leather cuttings and cow dung in Agra, etc. The  Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC)  has initiated ‘Beach Environment and  Aesthetic Management System’ (BEAMS) at identified beaches namely; Ghoghla (Diu), Shivrajpur (Gujarat), Kasarkode  and Padubidri (Karnatka), Kappad (Kerala) Kovalam (Tamil Nadu), Eden (Pduducherry), Rushikonda (Andhra Pradesh), Golden (Odisha) and Radhanagar (Andaman & Nicorbar Island).BEAMS project intervention deals with pollution abatement in coastal water by ensuring international best practices of treatment of solid  and liquid waste, scientific waste management processes including responsible disposal, water quality monitoring, promotion of  sustainable development of beach facilities, protection and resource efficiency through 3 R principles- reduce, recycling and reuse. The water analysis data on Physico-chemical parameters such as; Colour, Turbidity, PH, Dissolved Oxygen, BOD, Microbiological parameter namely; Intestinal Enterococci, and Escherichia coli of each identified beach for every month during tourist season are recorded. The details of daily collection of solid waste  are recorded. Solid waste (marine litter) is collected with the help of mechanized systems, segregated  and  part of it is recycled at the beach itself. The strategic placement of twin bin system for collection encourages visitors to use them and is to create awareness amongst tourists towards cleanliness. The plastic waste and other solid waste mainly comprising of glass, metal, thermocol, leather, rubber, etc. is handed over to the municipality recycler and organic waste is recycled on site through bio-composting.Provisions of bio toilets and grey water treatment plant under BEAMS program have direct impact on the environment as open defecation is completely stopped , therefore, is protecting seawater from possible biological contamination. The treated grey water used for irrigation and toilet flush drastically reduces dependence on fresh water and saving of thousands of liters of fresh water annually for the local community.Further, MoEF&CC has organized a week long mass cleanliness-cum-awareness drive in 50 identified beaches in 10 coastal States/ UTs during November, 2019.  Further, under Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project, several initiatives such as; beach-front development have been carried out at Digha Beach in West Bengal and Dandi Beach in Gujarat .Considering the importance of cleanliness and hygiene, Ministry of Tourism is implementing the Swachhta Action Plan (SAP) activities since 2017-18 across the country to create awareness among tourists, School / college students and stake-holders at tourist centers. The awareness activity covers 1000 tourists, 500 students and 60 stake-holders at each site involving activities of awareness on cleanliness amongst tourists, school/college students, and stake-holders of tourist centers, pilgrimage centers & famous archaeological monuments etc., In addition, Ministry of Tourism had organized Swachhta Pakhwada activities during September, 2020 on virtual platform, audio-visual etc. across the country through its India-tourism offices, India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) and Institutions under Ministry of Tourism like Indian Institute of Tourism and Travel Management (IITTM), Institute of Hotel Management (IHM) etc., a total number of 534 activities had been organized across  the country. *****
