                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)		(a) and (b)	The Ministry is primarily responsible for development and maintenance of National Highways (NHs). The Ministry took up development of NHs / roads under various phases of National Highways Development Project (NHDP), Special Accelerated Road Development Programme for the North East Region (SARDP-NE) including Arunachal Pradesh Package of Roads, Special Programme for Development of Roads in the Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas, Externally Aided Projects (EAP), National Highways (Original) [NH (O)] scheme, etc. Various phases of NHDP envisaged development of NHs to 4/6 lane and 2 lane NH standards, development of expressways, etc. Development of most of the roads/ NHs under other schemes envisages their upgradation to 2 lane NH standards.	The Ministry had taken up detailed review of NHs network with a view to develop the road connectivity to Border areas, development of Coastal roads including road connectivity for Non-Major ports, improvement in the efficiency of National Corridors, development of Economic Corridors, Inter Corridors and Feeder Routes along with integration with Sagarmala, etc., under “Bharatmala Pariyojana”. Under this proposal, the Ministry identified stretches for development of about 26,200 km length of Economic Corridors, 8,000 km of Inter Corridors, 7,500 km of Feeder Routes, 5,300 km Border and International connectivity roads, 4,100 km Coastal and Port connectivity roads, 1,900 km Expressways, National Corridor Efficiency improvement by development of ring roads around 28 cities, decongestion of about 125 choke points and 66 congestion points, development of 35 nos. of Multimodal Logistics Parks.	The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the proposal for investment approval for Phase-I of “Bharatmala Pariyojana” during its meeting held on 24.10.2017. “Bharatmala Pariyojana” Phase–I includes development of about 9,000 km length of Economic corridors, about 6,000 km length of Inter-corridor and feeder roads, about 5,000 km length of National Corridors Efficiency improvements inter-alia entailing development of ring roads/ bypasses, etc., for decongestion of choke points/ congestions points, about 2,000 km length of Border and International connectivity roads, about 2,000 km length of Coastal and port connectivity roads, about 800 km length of Expressways and balance length of about 10,000 km of roads under NHDP.

The Ministry considers declaration of some State roads as new NHs from time to time based on requirement of connectivity, inter-se priority and availability of funds. The Ministry had devised an 11 point criteria for declaration of State roads as new NHs. the main criteria for declaration State roads as new NHs included the roads running through length / breadth of the country, connecting adjacent countries, roads linking National Capital with the State Capitals, connecting one state capital with another state capital, major ports, non-major ports, large industrial centers or tourist centers, roads meeting very important and critical strategic requirements in hilly and isolated areas, arterial roads which enable sizeable reduction in travel distance and achieve substantial economic growth thereby, roads which help in opening up large tracts of backward areas and hilly regions (other than strategically important ones), achieving a National Highways grid, and above all, roads with high traffic density, and the availability of Right of Way etc.(d)	The details of works undertaken on NHs in the State of Rajasthan during last three years is as below:Rs.
