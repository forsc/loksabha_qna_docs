                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (f) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (f) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. 224 BY SHRI DEEPAK BAIJ TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 10.03.2021 REGARDING TRAINS FROM JAGDALPUR(a) to (f) To prevent the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, Indian Railways discontinued all regular passenger carrying trains w.e.f. 23rd March, 2020 as per the extant guidelines issued by Government of India.  For effective management of the pandemic, at present, only special trains with limited stoppages keeping in view the concerns and suggestions of State Government are being operated. Prior to the discontinuation, Jagdalpur station was being served by 01 pair of Passenger trains and 05 pair of Mail/Express trains including 18513/18514 Visakhapatnam-Kirandul Express and 58501/02 Visakhapatnam-Kirandul Passenger train providing connectivity between Jagdalpur and Visakhapatnam. Besides, major cities like Bhubaneswar, Rourkela, Sambalpur, Rayagada, Koraput etc. were also connected with Jagdalpur.  In view of the prevailing situation, Indian Railways, w.e.f. 21st January, 2021, has started operating 08515/16 Visakhapatnam-Jagdalpur Special Express inter alia to cater to the needs of passengers of Jagdalpur, whose occupancy is being closely monitored. Over Indian Railways, regular monitoring of waiting list, temporary augmentation and running of clone trains is being done. Train services are also being operated as per operational and commercial justification and also based on suggestions and concerns of State Governments due to Covid-19 Pandemic. Indian Railways is keeping a close watch on the situation and is resuming train services in a phased manner. The overall profit or loss of Indian Railways is calculated at the close of a financial year. Owing to adverse impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic and consequential discontinuation/partial resumption of passenger services there has been a decline of ` 34,750.51 crore in passenger revenues over Indian Railways at the end of January, 2021 compared to corresponding period of the previous year. Out of this decline, East Coast Railway which includes Jagdalpur station has witnessed a passenger revenue decline of `1082.40 crore to end of January, 2021 compared to the corresponding period of previous year.*****
