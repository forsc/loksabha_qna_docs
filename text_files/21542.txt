                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION                                     (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a)	to (d) A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2611 BY SHRI S. MUNISWAMY TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 10.03.2021 REGARDING ESTABLISHMENT OF RAILWAY WORKSHOP(a) The work of setting up of composite repair workshop at Kolar has been sanctioned in the year 2020-21. The land was to be provided by the State Government whereas the set up cost is to be shared between Ministry of Railways and Government of Karnataka on 50:50% basis. The Government of Karnataka has confirmed availability of 315 acres land only against the requirement of 560 acres and is not willing to share the cost of the project.(b) Project-wise current status is as under:-Whitefield-Kolar (53 km) New line: The project was sanctioned in 2011-12 with provision that the State Government provides land free of cost and also share 50% construction cost of the project. Project involves acquisition of 337 hectare land. Land is yet to be provided by Government of Karnataka. Kolar-Mulbagal-Madaghatta (50.52 km) New line: This new line work is part of Kadapa–Bangalore new line project. Project was sanctioned in 2008-09. Government of Andhra Pradesh is sharing 50% cost of the complete project. Land acquisition for the project has been taken up. Work on Kolar-Mulbagal-Madaghatta will be further expedited after deposition of its share by Government of Andhra Pradesh. Srinivaspur-Madanapalli (75 km) New line: The project was included in Budget 2013-14 subject to requisite approvals. In Principle Approval was not granted by Planning Commission. Project was found financially unviable even with 50% cost sharing and providing land free of cost by Government of Karnataka. Also Cuddapa-Kolar new line will run parallel to this line and no substantial traffic is expected on this new line. The project could not be taken forward due to these reasons.(c) and (d): Proposals/representations/requests regarding Railway projects are received from various sources, both formal and informal. This is a continuous and dynamic process and compendium of such requests is not maintained.                                              *****
