ANSWER




                                                        ???????  ??? ?????? ???????? ??? ????? ?????? (???? ??? ??????)  THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI SOM PARKASH)(a) to (d):  	‘Make in India'' is an initiative which was launched on 25th September, 2014 to facilitate investment, foster innovation, build best in class infrastructure, and make India a hub for manufacturing, design, and innovation. Development of a robust manufacturing sector continues to be a key priority of the Indian Government. It was one of the unique ''Vocal for Local'' initiatives that promoted India''s manufacturing domain to the world. Make in India initiative has made significant achievements and presently focuses on 27 sectors under Make in India 2.0. Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade is coordinating action plans for 15 manufacturing sectors, while Department of Commerce is coordinating 12 service sector plans.  The Government of India is making continuous efforts under Investment Facilitation, including financial assistance to Invest India, for implementation of Make in India action plans to identify potential investors. Support is being provided to Indian Missions abroad and State Governments for organizing events, summits, road-shows and other promotional activities to attract investment in the country under the Make in India banner. Investment Outreach activities are being carried out for enhancing International co-operation for promoting FDI and improve Ease of Doing Business in the country. DPIIT, in consultation with the State Governments, started a comprehensive reform exercise in States and UTs in December 2014. Under Business Reforms Action Plan (BRAP), all States/UTs in the country are ranked on the basis of reforms implemented by them on designated parameters. This exercise has helped in improving business environment across States. Steps taken to improve Ease of Doing Business include simplification and rationalization of existing processes. As a result of the measures taken to improve the country’s investment climate, India jumped to 63rd place in World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business ranking as per World Bank’s Doing Business Report (DBR) 2020 from a rank of 142 in 2014. DPIIT has also undertaken ranking of States/UTs under the BRAP since last 4 years.It has been the continuous endeavor of the Government of India to put in place an enabling and investor friendly FDI Policy. The intent has been to make the FDI policy more investor friendly, in keeping with national interest and national security and remove the policy bottlenecks that have been hindering the investment inflows into the country. FDI policy provisions have been progressively liberalized and simplified across various sectors in the recent past to make India an attractive investment destination. Some of the sectors include Pension, Other Financial Services, Asset reconstruction Companies, Broadcasting, Pharmaceuticals, Single Brand Retail Trading, Construction & Development, Power Exchanges, e-commerce activities, Coal Mining, Contract Manufacturing, Digital Media, Civil Aviation, Insurance, Telecom etc.Measures taken by the Government on FDI Policy reforms have resulted in increased FDI inflows in the country year after year. India registered its highest ever annual FDI inflow of US$ 81.97 billion (provisional figures) in the financial year 2020-21 despite the COVID related disruptions. These trends in India''s FDI are an endorsement of its status as a preferred investment destination amongst global investors. In the last seven financial years (2014-21), India has received FDI inflow worth US$ 440.27 billion which is nearly 58 percent of the FDI reported in the last 21 years (US$ 763.83 billion). (e): 	Government has taken various steps in addition to ongoing schemes to boost domestic and foreign investments in India. These include improving the Ease of Doing Business, Reduction in Compliance Burden, the National Infrastructure Pipeline, Reduction in Corporate Tax, easing liquidity problems of NBFCs and Banks, policy measures to boost domestic manufacturing through Public Procurement Orders, Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP), Schemes for Production Linked Incentives of various Ministries, India Industrial Land Bank, Industrial Park Rating System etc. Further, with a view to support, facilitate and provide investor friendly ecosystem to investors investing in India, the Union Cabinet on 03rd June, 2020 has approved constitution of an Empowered Group of Secretaries (EGoS), and also Project Development Cells (PDCs) in all concerned Ministries/ Departments to fast-track investments in coordination between the Central Government and State Governments, and thereby grow the pipeline of investible projects in India to increase domestic investments and FDI inflow. Also a National Single Window System (NSWS) has been soft launched on 22nd September,2021 as one-stop for taking all the regulatory approvals and services in the country.*****
