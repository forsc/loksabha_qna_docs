In addition, as per GLOBEFISH, FAO, India is the fourth largest exporter of seafood, largest supplier of frozen shrimp to USA, third largest supplier of shrimp to the European Union, fourth largest supplier of frozen shrimp to Japan and largest supplier of cephalopods to the European Union. (b)	The State-wise and year-wise details of total fish production in the country during last 03 years are furnished at Annexure I.
