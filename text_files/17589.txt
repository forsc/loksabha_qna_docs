ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a) & (b): As per UDISE+ 2018-19 (provisional), the Drop-out rate in Odisha in 2018-19 at Elementary and Secondary level is 3.95 and 9.53, respectively. (c): As per the Survey conducted by this Department through an independent agency (IMRB) and Report of NSS 75th Round, one of the reasons for students dropping out of schools and colleges was financial/economic reasons. (d): The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, provides for free and compulsory elementary education to children in the 6 to 14 years age group. Further, Education is a subject in the Concurrent List of the Constitution and majority of the schools are under the jurisdiction of the respective State and Union Territory (UT) Government. Thus, the matter relating to fees and its components in schools are regulated in terms of Rules and Instructions of the concerned State and UT Government. The Government of India through the Samagra Shiksha scheme supports all States & UTs in reducing drop-out rate through opening/strengthening of new schools upto senior secondary level, construction of school buildings & additional classrooms, setting up, up-gradation and running of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas, setting up of residential schools/hostels, free uniforms, free text books, transport allowance and undertaking enrolment drives, residential as well as non residential trainings, Seasonal Hostels/ residential camps etc. Financial assistance is also provided for Inclusive Education of children with special needs. Also, Mid-Day-Meal is provided to students at the elementary level of education. The University Grants Commission vide D.O. letter 1-1/2020/UGC(TF-COVID-19/Fee) dated 27th May, 2020, has requested the universities and colleges to consider individual requests from students, concerning payment of fees, in a considerate manner, keeping in view the present COVID-19 pandemic. A copy of the same is available at https://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/3032596_Letter_Payment_of_Fee.pdf. *****
