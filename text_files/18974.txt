ANSWER




MINISTER OF  PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a):	During 2019-20, 248.54 Million Tonne (MT) of coal was imported in the country. The total coal resource of the country as per Coal Inventory of India published by GSI as on 01.04.2019 is 326.495 Billion Tonnes (BT).(b):	As per the current import policy, coal is kept under Open General License (OGL) and consumers are free to import coal from the source of their choice as per their contractual prices on payment of applicable duty.   In view of limited domestic availability of coking coal, coking coal will continue to be imported for use by the steel sector.    Further, coal imported by power plants designed on imported coal and high grade coal required for blending purposes will also be imported in the country as this cannot be fully substituted by domestic coal. However, coal import is being reduced by increasing availability of domestic coal in India. Import of coal has reduced from a level of 165.57 MT during April-November -2-2019 to 134.35 MT (Provisional) during April-November-2020 showing a negative growth of 18.86 %. For the long term, Government has taken many measures including commercial coal mining, with a provision for 100% foreign direct investment to increase domestic availability of coal.  (c):	The detail of estimated revenue to be generated from auction of coal mines having peak rated capacity of more than 2 MTPA, under the 11th Tranche under Coal Mines (Special Provisions), Act, 2015 and 1st Tranche under Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 is enclosed as Annexure.  (d):     Yes, Sir.(e):	Ministry of Coal has floated a tender for selection of consultant for providing strategic and implementation management consulting services to assist the Ministry of Coal in the process of setting up Coal Trading Platform/Coal Trading Exchange in the country. The scope of the work of the consultant is assessing the current state of coal sales transaction in Indian Coal Sector, study of global experience for development of coal trading exchanges, identification of various trading hub concepts/models, identify regulatory prerequisites, evaluate other aspects around coal marketing policies and recommend changes and program management during implementation and on boarding of implementation partners. (f):	There is no such proposal under consideration in the Ministry of Coal.  (g):	Does not arise in view of reply of part (f) above.<><><> AnnexureSl.
