                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI A. NARAYANASWAMY)(a) to (c): Whereas Casteism and Communalism are social evils which can be eliminated through social movements, this Ministry contributes to this effort by taking steps to abolish untouchability, providing level playing field for all to progress, and providing equal economic and educational opportunities for all. This Ministry also incentivises inter-caste marriages, where one of the spouses is a member of a Scheduled Caste. The Ministry of Home Affairs has issued the Communal Harmony guidelines in 2008, suitable advisories and alert messages are sent to the State Governments/Union Territory Administrations from time to time.  Activities of organizations having a bearing on communal harmony in the country are also kept under the watch of law enforcement agencies, and requisite legal action is taken, wherever necessary.*****
