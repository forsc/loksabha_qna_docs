ANSWER




MINISTER OF  PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a): Demand of coal is higher than the current level of supply of coal in the country. All India demand and supply of coal during last three years is given below:-Year	2016-17	  2017-18  	2018-19 Actual Demand (MT)	836.93	898.55	969.47Domestic Supply (MT)	645.98	690.28	734.23State-wise demand of coal is not assessed separately. Sector-wise demand / supply of coal during last three years are given below:-  Sector-wise  Demand and Supply of Coal  2016-17 to  2018-19 (Estimated & Actual) (in MT)Sl No	Sectors	2016-17Estimateddemand	2016-17Actualsupply	2017-18 Estimateddemand	2017-18ActualSupply	2018-19Estimateddemand	2018-19Actual Supply (P)1	Coking -Steel + Coke Oven	56.62	51.98	63.17	58.45	58.37	69.342	Power (Utility)	598.73	489.57	 622.96	519.58	655.66	545.713	Power (Captive)	91.11	44.06	 90.34	65.91	105.00	89.304	Cement	34.37	6.36	 22.32	7.71	37.99	8.665	Steel DRI	24.05	5.56	 24.61	8.53	41.33	12.156	Others	80.00	238.27	 85.00	238.10	93.00	 243.98	Total N-Coking	828.25	783.82	 845.23	839.83 	932.98	899.80	Total	884.87	835.80	 908.40	898.28	991.35	969.14 .P- Provisional  (Source:  CCO/CIL)Demand / supply for the current year is not available.(b): No information with regard to impact of cancellation of coal blocks by Supreme Court of India and delay in reallocation of such coal blocks on production and supply of coal in the country is available. However, upon cancellation of 204 coal blocks by the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its order dated 24/09/2014, it was considered expedient in public interest by the Central Government to take immediate action so as to ensure energy security of the country. Accordingly, the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 was enacted w.e.f. 30th March, 2015. The Coal Mines (Special provisions) Rules, 2014 were notified on 11/12/2014. All India raw coal production has increased from 565.77 MT in 2013-14 to 730.35 MT (Prov.) in 2018-19, an absolute increase of 164.58 MT as compared to increase of coal production of 73.01 MT between 2008-09 and 2013-14.(c): Reallocation of coal blocks cancelled by the Supreme Court is made under the provisions of Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015.(d): No such study has been conducted by the Government.(e): The gap between demand and supply of coal cannot be bridged completely as there is insufficient domestic availability of coking coal and power plants designed on imported coal will continue to import coal for their production. However, there has been a consistent effort to increase domestic coal production.  Further, the focus of the Government is on accelerating domestic production of coal through allocation of more coal blocks, pursuing with State Government for assistance in land acquisition and coordinated efforts with Railways for movement of coal.In order to enhance coal production, CIL has taken the following steps:•	Opening of 55 greenfield projects having capacity of 92 MTPA and expansion of 193 brownfield projects having capacity of about 310 MTPA in next five years.•	Portal based monitoring of on-going projects to ensure timely completion of projects.•	Introduction of state of the art technology to improve its work efficiency with high capacity Heavy Earth Moving Machinery (HEMM), like 42 cum Shovel and 240 T Rear Dumpers in Gevra Expansion, Dipka & Kusmunda open cast mines.•	Introduction of Surface Miners in opencast mines to improve operational efficiency & to cater to environmental needs.  During 2018-19 in CIL, around 50% of the opencast coal production was trough Surface miners.•	Introduction of IT enabled Operator Independent Truck Dispatch System (OITDS) in 11 nos. of mines of CIL.•	Introduction of Mass Production Technology in underground coal mines, 2 mines are worked with Powered Support Longwall technology and 9 mines are worked with Continuous Miner technology.•	For rapid coal evacuation, 19 nos. Coal Handling Plants with silos and rapid loading system having existing capacity of 152.5 million tonnes are in operation.   ****
