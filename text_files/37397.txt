                                                    (a) whether the Government is aware of the difficulties faced by the passengers in the absence of required domestic flight services from the Calicut International Airport and if so, the details thereof; (b) whether the Government proposes to operate domestic air services from Calicut International Airport, if so, the details thereof and if not, the reasons therefor?






ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) & (b): The current domestic flight connectivity of Calicut airport is 98 ( arrivals plus departures) per week. The cities connected to Calicut are Bengaluru, Mumbai, Kannur, Delhi, Hyderabad and Chennai. After repeal of the Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation market has been deregulated. Consequently, airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type for selecting whatever markets and networks they wish to operate across the country including Calicut International Airport. Thus, it is up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and their commercial viability, in compliance with the extant relevant guidelines in this regard.******
