Presently, a flagship scheme namely “Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY)” with  highest ever estimate investment of ?20050 crore in fisheries sector is implemented for a period of 5 years with effect from the financial year 2020-21. In addition, a dedicated fund namely, ‘Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund’ (FIDF) with a total fund size of Rs.7,522.48 crore has been set up for providing concessional finance for creation and strengthening of fisheries infrastructure facilities. Enhancement of fish production and productivity is one of the primary objectives of the schemes implemented by the Department of Fisheries, Government of India.  The success of the schemes is gauged from the fact that the fisheries sector has shown impressive growth on an average 10.87% during the years 2014-15 to 2018-19. The fish production in India has registered an all-time high at 141.64 lakh tones during the year 2019-20. Today, India is one of the leading fish producing countries with about 8% share in global fish production. Besides, the export of marine products showed an impressive growth in recent years and valued at Rs.46,662 crore during the year 2019-20. The efforts of the Government has led to India emerging as one of the leading fish producing nation in the world.  (d) :	The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying under (i) CSS on Blue Revolution had accorded approval to the fisheries development projects worth Rs. 734.94 crore, (ii) under FIDF projects worth Rs. 857.78 crore approved for Tamil Nadu and (iii) Under PMMSY project amounting to Rs. 69.88 crore have been approved during the current financial year(2020-21). Further, under PMMSY, an investment of Rs. 1565 crore is envisaged in Tamil Nadu by 2024-25. (e) : Technology adaptation in fisheries sector has  increased during last few years. Technology infusion has been identified as one of the key strategies under PMMSY for further strengthening technology adaptation.
