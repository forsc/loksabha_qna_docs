ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES(SHRI BHANU PRATAP SINGH VERMA)(a):	 As informed by Reserve Bank of India, the details of the State-wise credit outstanding to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) Sector by Scheduled Commercial Banks during the last two years, is at Annexure I.(b) & (c):	 The Government has not assessed the changes taken place in MSMEs during economic reforms. However, one of the objectives of the Expert Committee on Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, constituted by Reserve Bank of India in December, 2018, under the chairmanship of Shri U.K. Sinha was to study the impact of the recent economic reforms on the sector and identify the structural problems affecting the growth of MSMEs in India (which includes all States and also Bundelkhand region). The Committee had stated that the services sector has gained greater importance within Gross Domestic Product (GDP); MSMEs in services have increased in number and range of activities; formalisation of MSMEs has increased; value chains have become longer; payment systems have become electronic and alternate data is being used for lending decisions.
