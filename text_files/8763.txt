It is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme, with entry age of 18 to 40 years. The subscribing farmer is required to contribute to a Pension Fund between Rs.55 to Rs.200 per month depending on the entry age, with equal contribution from the Central Government. The Pension Fund is managed by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). In case of death of the farmer before reaching 60 years of age, the spouse has the option of continuing the scheme by payment of remaining contributions under the scheme. If the spouse does not wish to continue or there is no spouse, the subscriber’s contributions along with fund interest earned or Savings Bank Interest whichever is higher is payable to the spouse or the nominee. On the death of the pensioner, the spouse is entitled to receive 50% of the assured pension as family pension. For enrollment in the Scheme, the farmer is required to approach the nearest Common Service Center (CSC) or the Nodal Officer (PM-Kisan) nominated by the State / UT Governments. The Scheme was formally launched on 12th September, 2019.Contd….2/-- 2 -(b):	So far (as on 28.11.2019), 18,78,721 farmers have registered for the Scheme.
