The Unorganised Workers Social Security Act, 2008 has been subsumed in the code on Social Security, 2020. Contd..2/-:: 2 ::Life and disability cover is provided through Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti  Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Surksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) launched in 2015. The benefits under the scheme are Rs. 2 lakh on death due to any reason and permanent disability, Rs 4 lakh on death due to accident and Rs. 1 lakh on partial disability.  The annual premium is Rs. 342/- (Rs. 330/- for PMJJBY + Rs. 12/- for PMSBY) depending upon their eligibility. In Gujarat, as on 30.06.2021, the cumulative enrolments under PMJJBY and PMSBY are 37,19,328 and 91,62,480 respectively.       		The health and maternity benefits are addressed through Ayushman Bharat Scheme which is a universal health scheme launched in 2018. Under the scheme, Rs. 5 lakh health coverage per family is provided for secondary and tertiary treatments free of cost.  In Gujarat, as on 20.07.2021, the benefit of Ayushman Bharat Scheme has been extended to a total of 2015959 individuals.      		 In order to provide old age protection to unorganised sector workers, the Government of India has launched a flagship scheme namely Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan Dhan Yojana (PM-SYM) launched in March, 2019 to provide a monthly minimum assured pension of Rs. 3000/- after attaining the age of 60 years. This is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme. The workers in the age group of 18-40 years whose monthly income is Rs. 15000/- or less and not a member of EPFO/ESIC/NPS (Govt.

In Gujarat, as on 19.07.2021, the beneficiaries enrolled under the scheme is  3, 68,378.        		Further, the Government of Gujarat has set up a portal gujaratuwin.csccloud.in for registration of the unorganised workers. The said portal is integrated   with Common Service Centres in the state and after the registration, the UWIN Card is issued. In Gujarat, the district wise pockets of unorganised workers viz. Street vendors, retail workers, fishermen, textile market workers, rickshaw drivers, kite making workers, vegetable sellers, Beedi making workers, tailors etc. have already been identified for registration. *******
