ANSWER




                                                        (a) and (b): There is no proposal to provide basic amenities like electricity, drinking water, roads and community halls specifically in SC dominated settlements in Ratlam Lok Sabha constituency. However, the Ministry is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana(PMAGY) since 2009-10 for holistic development of Scheduled Castes majority villages having SC population more than 50%. The Scheme envisages all such infrastructure and basic services to the selected SC majority villages that are necessary for its residents to have a dignified living, creating thereby an environment in which everyone is enabled to utilise her/his potential to the fullest. The implementation guidelines have been revised extensively in 2018-19 and according to this the aim of the scheme is to fulfill the gap arising out of need assessment being done on 50 preset critical socio-economic monitorable indicators under the 10 domains namely Drinking Water & Sanitation, Education, Health & Nutrition, Social Security, Rural Road and Housing, Electricity and clean fuel, Agricultural practices, Financial inclusion, Digitization, Livelihood and Skill Development in selected villages. In the Ratlam District a total of 10 villages each have been selected in 2018-19 and 2019-20 respectively.(c): Does not arise.*****
