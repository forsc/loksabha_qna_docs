ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)     The details of state and quantity wise export of marine products and the revenue earned through exports during the last five years are annexed at Annexure-I.(b)	  No sir. US has not recently imposed anti dumping duty on Indian shrimp exports. However, US had imposed anti dumping duty on import of frozen warm water shrimps from certain countries including India in 2004, based on the representations of Southern Shrimp Producers Alliance, an association of local shrimp producers in USA.(c)	The Initial anti dumping duty imposed by US was 10.17% which was reviewed subsequently. Every year there is an administrative review on the duty to be collected, and so far 12 administrative reviews have been conducted. The final result of the 12th administrative review for the period of import from 01.02.2016 to 31.01.2017 has pegged the anti dumping duty at 1.35 %, which is currently applied to the exporters from India including those from Andhra Pradesh. On 23rd April 2019, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of the 13th administrative review of the anti dumping duty order on certain frozen warm water shrimp from India. Based on these preliminary results for anti dumping duty rate for Indian companies were at 1.87% and the final result of this review is awaited. Even with the  imposition of anti- dumping duty the shrimp exports to US have shown a growing trend over the years.*****Annexure-ISTATE WISE  AQUACULTURE  PRODUCTS EXPORT FOR THE LAST 5 YEARS  AND 2018-19 Q: Quantity in Tons, V: Value in Rs.
