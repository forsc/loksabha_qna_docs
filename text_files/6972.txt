ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS [SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a)	The Spokesperson of the Secretary General to the United Nations, in a statement on 8 August, 2019 inter alia, referred to the 1972 Simla Agreement between India and Pakistan which provides for resolution of differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations. Subsequently, in a statement to media on 11 September, 2019 the Spokesperson appealed to both sides to deal with the issue through dialogue.(b)	Government continues to consistently raise the issue of Pakistan’s continued support to cross-border terrorism and terrorist infiltration in bilateral, regional and multilateral fora. As a result of Government’s persistent efforts, there is enhanced concern in the international community at terrorism emanating from Pakistan, including the continuing activities of internationally designated terrorist entities and individuals such as Jamaat-ud Dawa (JuD), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad, Hizbul Mujahideen. International community strongly condemened the cross-border terrorist attack in Pulwama in February 2019. Major partner countries have called upon Pakistan to not allow its territory to be used for terrorism in any manner.Many terrorist entities and individuals who find shelter in Pakistan and are also engaged in terrorism against India have been proscribed by the United Nations (UN), the European Union and other countries. On 01 May 2019, the United Nations 1267 Sanctions Committee designated Masood Azhar, the self styled leader of Jaish-e-Mohammad as a UN proscribed terrorist. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), at its plenary in October 2019, decided to retain Pakistan in the ‘Grey List’ due to continuing terror financing related concerns, including with respect to the UN proscribed terrorist entities like LeT, JuD and Falah-i-Insaniyat Foundation. These vindicate India’s consistent stand that internationally designated terrorist groups and individuals continue to operate from and raise financial resources with impunity in Pakistan, and use territories under its control for carrying out cross-border terrorism in India and elsewhere in South Asia. India’s call to condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestation; zero tolerance to terrorism; rejection of any justification for an act of terror; delinking terror from religion; need for all forces believing in humanity to unite in fight against terrorism has found greater acceptance among the international community, and is reflected in a number of outcome documents issued after bilateral Summit meetings with various countries, and at regional and multilateral fora, such as Shangai Cooperation Organization; G20; BRICS, among others. (c)	India and Pakistan maintain regular channels of communication. It has been consistently conveyed that India desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan and is committed to addressing issues, if any, bilaterally and peacefully. However, any meaningful dialogue can only be held in an atmosphere free of terror, hostility and violence. The onus is on Pakistan to create such a conducive atmosphere.***
