The interventions under these schemes include feeder segregation, Information Technology (IT)/Operational Technology (OT) measures such as SCADA, DMS, ERP and remote monitoring of feeder. 		Further, the Central Government has approved a “Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme - A Reforms based and Results linked Scheme” with the objective of improving the quality and reliability of power supply to consumers through a financially sustainable and operationally efficient distribution Sector. The Scheme aims to reduce the AT&C losses to pan-India levels of 12-15% and Average Cost of Supply (ACS) - Average Revenue Realized (ARR) gap to zero by 2024-25. The Scheme has an outlay of Rs.3,03,758 crore. Under the scheme, eligible DISCOMs would be provided financial support for upgradation of the Distribution Infrastructure and Smart Metering Systems for the network as well as prepaid smart metering systems for consumers linked to initiation of reforms and achievement of results. A DISCOM which does not improve as per Action Plan, will not be able to access funds under this Scheme.Furthermore, based on the recommendations of Fifteenth Finance Commission, Govt. of India have also decided to provide performance based additional borrowing space of 0.50 % of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) to the States on certain performance criteria linked to operational efficiency and financial sustainability of DISCOMs.**********
