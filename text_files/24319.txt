However, the Ministry of Tourism does not compile data on FDI in the tourism sector in India.(c) to (d):	Development of tourism, including setting up of tourism centres, is primarily the responsibility of the concerned State/UTs. However, Ministry of Tourism provides financial assistance under the schemes of ‘Swadesh Darshan’ and ‘National Mission on Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual, Heritage Augmentation Drive (PRASHAD)’ for development of tourism infrastructure in the country, including those in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Haryana. Submission of project proposals by the State Government/UTs and its sanctioning is a continuous process.

The details of the projects sanctioned under Swadesh Darshan and PRASHAD scheme are given at Annexure.********
