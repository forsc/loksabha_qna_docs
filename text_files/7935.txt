The fact that the combined mail traffic of the Department has grown from 609 crore mail articles in 2013-14 to 635 crores in 2017-18 cutting across urban and rural profile, is a testimony that the customers continue to avail mail services offered by the Department.  -2-The Department has diligently taken action against the postmen where such service fault is noticed. The details of complaints received and action taken against postmen at fault in the last three years and the current year is shown below: -<pre>Year	Complaints received against postmen	No. of cases where action is taken against the postmen at fault2016-17	12176	7212017-18	11383	9102018-19	12467	10282019-20 (up to October 2019)	6736	561</pre>(b) 	The Government has already launched a National Helpline Number for redressal of grievances regarding postal services on 01.06.2018.
