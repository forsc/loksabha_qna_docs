                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a):  Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) was launched on 23rd September 2018. The salient features of AB-PMJAY are at Annexure - I.As regards procedure involved, AB-PMJAY is an entitlement-based scheme. All the eligible beneficiary families are covered from day one of the implementation of the scheme in the States/UTs. AB-PMJAY does not require enrolment. However, beneficiary verification process is being undertaken to verify the genuineness of the beneficiary. Ayushman cards are issued to all eligible beneficiaries as part of this process to ensure easy availing of health benefits. Targets are not fixed for AB-PMJAY as the scheme operates on the basis of beneficiary demand for healthcare services. All the eligible beneficiaries of the implementing States/UTs are entitled for free healthcare services under the scheme from the day of launch of the scheme. A total of 1.96 crore hospital admissions worth Rs. 24,315 crore have been authorized through a network of approximately 23,000 Empanelled Health Care Providers (EHCPs). The State/UT wise details are at Annexure – II.The funds allocated for the scheme for the current financial year 2021-22 are Rs. 6400 crore.Following the onset of Covid-19, AB-PMJAY provided valuable support to the healthcare ecosystem by ensuring that beneficiary registration process was kept active and empanelled hospitals continued to provide services to the scheme beneficiaries. However, there was a noticeable impact on the uptake of the scheme on account of factors such as restriction of mobility, restrictions on elective surgeries, reluctance from scheme beneficiaries to visit hospitals due to fear of infection and designation of public facilities as dedicated COVID centres. During the period from 01stMarch 2020 –19thJuly 2021, a total of approx. 1.05 crore hospital admissions worth approx. Rs. 11,862 crore have been authorized under AB-PMJAY.As on 20.07.2021, a total of 16.14 crore Ayushman cards have been issued to the scheme beneficiaries.(b): AB-PMJAY provides services only for inpatient treatment, therefore, only hospitals providing inpatient services are empanelled under this scheme.Accordingly, NHA has developed guidelines for empanelment of hospitals under the scheme. The empanelment of hospitals under AB-PMJAY is done for general treatment and for treatment under particular speciality. The guidelines for empanelment of hospitals under AB-PMJAY can be accessed on PMJAY website.   (https://pmjay.gov.in/sites/default/files/2020-06/Empanelment-and-De-empanelment-guidelines.pdf )            Since the empanelment of hospitals under AB-PMJAY is primarily done by the respective State/UT Governments, flexibility has been provided to the State/UT Governments to modify the empanelment criteria based on local requirements including supply and demand. As on 20th July 2021, approx. 23,000 hospitals have been empanelled under AB-PMJAY by various State/UT Governments. The State/UT wise details of the empanelled hospitals are at Annexure-III. (c): Under Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness centre, Government of India is committed to establish 1,50,000 Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs) by upgrading the Sub Health Centres (SHCs) and rural and urban Primary Health Centres (PHCs) to bring health care closer to the community.As on 20th July 2021, 77,406 AB-HWCs are operational across the country. Details are at Annexure - IV.Details of financial assistance provided to States/UTs are at Annexure – V. (d): AB-PMJAY provides treatment corresponding to a total of 1669 procedures under 26 different specialties including chronic diseases like Cancer, Diabetes, Heart Disease and other non-communicable diseases and renal and corneal transplant. The specialty wise breakup of packages is provided under Annexure – VI.Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy packages, along with surgical oncology are covered as part of cancer treatment under the scheme.Additionally, there is a category of unspecified packages which can be booked for procedures which are not defined in the Health Benefit Packages (HBPs).(e): The following measures have been adopted by NHA to offer state-of-the-art healthcare service delivery under AB-PMJAY•	Public hospitals empanelled under AB-PMJAY are reimbursed for treatment provided under the scheme at par with cost reimbursed to their private sector counterparts. These funds can be leveraged by such institutions to carry out infrastructural development and establish state-of-the-art facilities. NHA has issued necessary guidelines and instructions to the SHAs and public hospitals to encourage the same. Many States have effectively used the funds allotted to public hospitals for infrastructure upgradation and for providing better amenities to beneficiaries.•	A targeted approach is being followed to empanel the top corporate hospitals in the country under AB-PMJAY. •	NHA has partnered with Quality Council of India to develop a quality certification program for empanelled hospitals. AB-PMJAY quality certifications include Bronze, Silver and Gold Quality certifications. Hospitals achieving PMJAY Gold, Silver and Bronze certifications are provided 15%, 10% and 5% higher package rates respectively. As on 19th July, 2021 over 200 empanelled hospitals have been Quality Certified under the scheme. •	Further, if an empanelled hospital attains entry level NABH accreditation, it is incentivized by reimbursing the cost of treatment at a rate which is 10 per cent higher that the standard package rates. Similarly, a PMJAY empanelled hospital attaining full NABH accreditation is paid 15 percent higher rate.These incentives have been designed to promote state-of-the-art healthcare service delivery under AB-PMJAY.  (f): Beneficiary families under AB-PMJAY have been identified from the SECC-2011 database on the basis of 6 deprivation criteria and 11 occupational criteria across rural and urban areas respectively. Details are at Annexure – I. Representations have been received regarding the inclusion of families under AB-PMJAY. However, the beneficiary database under the scheme has been frozen with the approval of the Union Cabinet.At the same time, it may be noted that the 33 States/UTs implementing the scheme have expanded the scope of AB-PMJAY to include other categories of beneficiaries beyond SECC 2011 at their own cost. As on 20th July, 2021, approximately 13.44 crore beneficiary families are covered under AB-PMJAY. With respect to Assam, it may be noted that in addition to AB-PMJAY, the Government is implementing a local health insurance scheme known as “Atal Amrut Abhiyan” (AAA). AAA is an enrolment based scheme, providing insurance coverage of up to Rs. 2 Lakh per year to every entitled family in the State. Moreover, those families belonging to the APL category with income between Rs. 1.2 Lakh and 5 Lakh per annum can also avail the benefit of AAA by paying a nominal premium of Rs. 100/- per year per member. Thus, eligible beneficiaries can avail services under either of these schemes.(g):  National Health Authority has entered into a collaboration with WHO to carry out research and evaluation studies. In this regard, a study on “Mainstreaming quality in empanelled hospitals under PMJAY” is being conducted in three States viz. Haryana, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh.
