ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b)  For the development of rural areas, different programmes and schemes are being implemented by the Government of India in the country including Madhya Pradesh. These schemes are being run at the State/District/Block/Gram Panchayat level. The details of the main schemes for rural development of Ministry of Rural Development are as given below:- (i) The Department of Rural Development (DoRD), Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS), Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), Deen Dayal Upadhayay – Gramin Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETI), National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) and Shyama Prasad  Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM).  (ii) The Department of Land Resources (DoLR), Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Watershed Development Component (WDC) of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) in 28 States (except Goa) including Madhya Pradesh, which is principally development of rainfed portions of net cultivated area and culturable wastelands.          The above mentioned Schemes/Programmes are being implemented in various States/UTs in the country including Madhya Pradesh for the development of rural areas.  However, no other new Rural Development Scheme is being run at the Panchayat level by this Ministry. (c)  The Aspirational Districts Programme covers 112 districts, across 26 states and 1 Union Territory, which had shown relatively less progress in the socio-economic parameters. The main strategy of the Programme is bringing convergence of existing schemes and programs of the Central, State and District Administration, and as such, the programme is in the nature of an additionality. Under the programme, 49 Key Performance Indicators have been identified across five sectors, which are Health & Nutrition, Education, Agriculture & Water Resources, Financial Inclusion & Skill Development, and Basic Infrastructure.       Since the main strategy of the Programme is bringing convergence of existing schemes and programs of the Central, State and District Administration, which have their own funding arrangements, large infusion of additional funds is not envisaged under this programme. However, to foster a competitive spirit and address critical gaps, a provision of additional allocation has been devised for districts securing good ranks based on their monthly incremental progress. On a monthly basis, the best performing district receives additional allocation upto Rs.10 crore, the second-best performing district receives Rs.5 crore and districts performing well in the five sectors receive Rs.3 crore each.  ****
