                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a) & (b) : In order to prevent drop outs, lower enrolments and loss of learning, the Ministry of Education has issued guidelines for identification, smooth admission process and continued education of marginalised children on 13th July, 2020, inter-alia, requesting the States to identify and enrol all such children without any procedural formalities and maintain a database of children so admitted. Further, to ensure that children have access to education with quality and equity and to minimize the impact of the pandemic on school education in the country, Ministry of Education has shared guidelines dated 7th January, 2021 with all States  to identify  out of school children in the age group of 6-18 years, conducting enrolment drives and awareness generation, student support while schools are closed, continued education for children with Special Needs (CWSN), student support on school reopening and Teacher capacity building. (c) & (d) – For the year 2020-21, the Budget  allocation for the Schemes comprising  Anganwadi Services, POSHAN Abhiyan and  Scheme for Adolescent Girls was Rs.24,482 crore.  In  2021-22, after rationalization,  these three schemes   have been clubbed and named as ‘Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0’ having budgetary provision of  Rs. 20,105.00 crore. A robust ICT enabled platform named Poshan Tracker has been designed to capture real time data on implementation and monitoring of Anganwadi Services across the country.  This would help in close monitoring of the activities of the Anganwadi Centre, Anganwadi Workers and other beneficiaries.  Additional funds, if required, would be sought at R.E stage from Ministry of Finance.  *****
