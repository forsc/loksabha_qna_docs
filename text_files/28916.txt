DIGITAL SOLUTIONS FOR EASE-OF-DOING BUSINESS • CAR-D (Cargo Data) Portal: CAR-D is a web based portal for collection & compilation, analysis and dissemination of all cargo and cruise movement data of National Waterways to the stakeholders. • PANI (Portal for Asset & Navigation Information): PANI is an integrated solution bringing river navigation and infrastructure information on a single platform. It provides detailed information of various features of National Waterways and the assets such as fairway, infrastructure facilities, cross-river structures, connectivity at jetties, emergency services for facilitating transportation of cargo. These solutions increase collaboration across divergent stakeholders, improve organizational consistency, increased resource agility, enhances ownership and accountability for each stakeholder leading to improved management of activities.  By having public access to key work being done by IWAI for the sector, will enhance IWAI’s standing in the market and will increase trust in the sector.2. OTHER INITIATIVES FOR GROWTH OF TRAFFIC ON NATIONAL WATERWAYS 1. Revision of Levy & Collection of Fees: Taking ahead the vision of the Government of India to promote Inland Waterways as a supplementary mode of transport, the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways has considered waiver of waterway user charges initially for a period of three years. 2. Enhanced regional trade using IWT mode: a. Addition of new Ports of Call and routes in India and Bangladesh under PIWT&T: With 7 new ports of call agreed to be added on each side along with addition/ extension of waterway routes under PIWT&T between India and Bangladesh, the accessibility of IWT mode for trade between India and Bangladesh is expected to increase and result in growth of traffic on NWs. b. Inclusion of IWT mode in the Indo-Nepal trade treaty: Inland waterways mode has been agreed for inclusion in the trade treaty between India and Nepal. This will allow Nepal bound cargo (coming from 3rd country via Kolkata port and India’s exports) to take waterway up to Sahibganj MMT (Jharkhand), proposed Kalughat terminal near Patna (Bihar) and Varanasi MMT (UP) and further movement to Nepal via road. c. Trade between Bhutan and Bangladesh: Stone exporters from Bhutan have identified Inland waterways as an alternate mode of transportation considering the benefits associated with waterways mode such as lower transportation cost, larger shipment size compared to road, avoiding congestion on land routes etc. The first movement under supervision of IWAI was successfully executed in July, 2019.  This trade using the IWT mode is expected to continue and reach a significant scale in the coming years. 3. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for facilitating the Stakeholders to use Inland Water Transport and access the various information related to National WaterwaysThe list of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for various National Waterways which are available at IWAI website is as given below: i. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) of the Agreement on the use of Chattogram and Mongla Ports for movement of goods to and from India between the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and the Government of Republic of India. ii. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) of MoU on Passenger and Cruise Services on the Coastal and Protocol Route between the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and the Government of Republic of India. iii. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the MoU on use of Inland Waterways for Transportation of Bilateral Trade and Transit cargoes between the Government of People’s Republic of Bangladesh and the Government of Republic of India. iv. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the Movement of Vessels on Protocol on Inland Water Transit and Trade (PIWT&T) to contain the spread of COVID-19. v. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and Check List for Ro-Ro/ Ro-Pax vessel operations on National Waterways. vi. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Car-D Portal.4. Ro-Ro/Ro-Pax Service Commenced in Various National WaterwaysThe Operation of Ro-Ro / Ro-Pax vessels inaugurated by Hon’ble Prime Minster during February, 2021 for the following routes: 1. Neamati and Kamalabari (Majuli) (Assam),2. Guwahati and North Guwahati (Assam), 3. Dhubri and Fakirganj (U/S Hatsingimari) (Assam) and4. Wellingdon Island and Bolghaty (Kerala).                             ****
