                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)& (b): 	Sporadic incidences of illegal import of areca nut into the country through Myanmar and Nepal have been reported. However, these incidences involve small quantity as compared to import of 18152 MT of areca nut during 2018-19 in the country.(c)  & (d):	Department of Revenue have been requested to check the rules of origin with utmost care so as to ensure that areca nut grown in countries other than South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) is not imported through our neighboring countries taking advantage of low import duty under South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA).The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) have advised its field offices to stringently adhere to the quality standards of areca nut before clearing the import consignments. (e) & (f):	To protect our domestic areca nut farmers, import duty of 100% has been imposed. Further, Minimum Import Price (MIP) has been fixed at Rs. 251/ kg on areca nut and import of areca nut is prohibited, if the CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight) value is below Rs. 251/kg. Thus, adequate measures have been placed so as to prevent import of cheap areca nut into the country.                                                                            ********
