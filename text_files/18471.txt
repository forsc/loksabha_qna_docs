                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)  (a)  to (c) : National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) compiles and publishes information on crimes in its publication “Crime in India”. The published reports are available till the year 2018. The year-wise, State-wise data of crime committed against women is available on the website of NCRB, https://ncrb.gov.in. ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. Maintenance of law and order, protection of life and property of citizens including prevention of crime against women is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments and Union Territory Administrations.  Nevertheless, giving high priority to safety of women, the Central Government has also taken a number of initiatives in this regard during the last six months. The Government has ensured that their schemes of One Stop Centres (OSCs), Universalisation of Women Help Line (WHL), Ujjawala Homes, Swadhar Greh, Emergency Response Support System (112) and various authorities under women and child centric laws such as  ‘The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005’, ‘The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961’, ‘The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006’, etc. remain operational and available for providing assistance to women during the period. The Government has also undertaken sensitisation programs for the concerned officials of States and UTs for this purpose. Further, the National Commission for Women (NCW), in addition to handling complaints through regular mode, helps women in distress through a dedicated WhatsApp Number at 72177 35372 for reporting domestic violence cases. Since the launch of this number on 10.04.2020, 1443 cases of domestic violence have been reported on this number. NCW takes cognizance of the grievances relating to domestic violence reported in social media. The complaints received by NCW are acted upon by coordinating with victims, police and other authorities to provide immediate assistance.******
