The National Scholarships Portal (NSP) was developed and launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minster of India under Digital India Programme in July 2015.

The prime objective of the NSP is to create a unique, simplified and user-friendly platform for students to help them avail benefits of educational scholarships in an efficient and transparent manner. Any Ministry/Department/State can on-board NSP. At present, 114 scholarships schemes belonging to 16 Ministries/Departments and 14 States are on-boarded on NSP. The main features of the NSP portal are:•One-Page single scholarship form designed for every scholarship on-boarded on NSP to simplify scholarship application.•Visibility of more than 100 schemes on a single portal has brought transparency in government operations to a new benchmark in India. •Financial assistance is directly passed to user accounts through DBT.•The system is updated every year for faster and effective verification and finalization of applications based on values received from different systems on near real time basis through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). (c):  During the financial year 2020-21, more than 1.28 crore students applied on National Scholarships Portal, out of which 68.48 lakh applications were finally verified and about Rs.2899 crore was disbursed to the students’ bank accounts through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). *******************
