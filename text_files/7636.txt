ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one Jawahar NavodayaVidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country. Opening of new JNVs is a continuous processwhich depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government/UT administration to makeavailable requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of the permanent building andmaking available required temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till thepermanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV dependson the availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority. All the districts ofRajasthan including Tonk and Sawai Madhopur have already been covered under NavodayaVidyalaya Scheme.(b) In the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, reservation of seats is provided in favour ofchildren belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) in proportion to theirpopulation in the district but not less than the national average. The students belonging to SC/STcategories are also provided exemption from payment of VidyalayaVikas Nidhi.*****
