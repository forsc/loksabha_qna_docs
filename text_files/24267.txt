                                                        MINISTER OF LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI BHUPENDER YADAV)(a):		Government of India has taken several measures and initiatives to address the challenges and threats to migrant workers posed by Covid-19. The details are at Annexure-I.Contd..2/-:: 2 ::(b) to (f):	Ministry of Labour & Employment in technical collaboration with National Informatics Centre (NIC) is developing a module/portal for comprehensive National Database for Unorganized Workers (NDUW) seeded with Aadhaar for all Unorganised workers including Construction Workers, Migrant Workers, Gig and Platform workers, Street Vendors, Domestic Workers, Agriculture Workers, Migrant workers and similar other workers, to address various challenges and issues related to the delivery of benefits of welfare schemes. At present, the process for dry run and security audit is underway.        Rs. 45.39 Crore has already been released to NICSI for required software development and hardware purchases in February, 2021.   The project is expected to commence the registration work by August, 2021 after addressing all critical technical issues. Thereafter, the State Governments are to populate the data on the portal through mobilising the unorganised workers.  The Common Service Centres through its nation-wide network of over 4 lakh centres and selected post offices of the Department of Posts will act as registration centres, where workers can visit and register themselves free of cost.*                                                  *******
