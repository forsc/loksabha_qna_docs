ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  to (d)  There are 17 rivers in Goa, namely Mandovi, Khandepar, Assonora, Bicholim, Chapoli, Chapora, Kalna, Kushawati, Madai, Mapusa, Sal, Salmona, Sinquerim, Talpona, Tiracol, Valvant and Zuari, being monitored by Goa Pollution Control Board under National Water Monitoring Programme.None of the rivers has been nationalised.  However, six rivers/canal in Goa viz. Mandovi Zuari, Chapora, Cumberjua Canal, Mapusa  and Sal have been declared as National Waterways. Declaration of any river of any State as National Waterway does not amount to nationalization of rivers. It only enables the mandated agency, Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI), to undertake various development works with the objective to facilitate growth of inland water transport in the country. The development of National Waterways has the potential to reduce logistics cost in the country besides the other benefits of socio-economic development of the hinterland areas of these National Waterways. Funds amounting to Rs.22.67 crore have been allocated for development of floating jetties & aids to navigation for National Waterways of Goa. *****
