                                                        A N S W E RMINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY, CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION AND TEXTILES(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c): 	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF THE STARRED QUESTION NO. *312 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 10.08.2021 IN THE LOK SABHA.(a):	During ongoing Kharif Marketing Season (KMS) 2020-21, 872.06 LMT paddy (upto03.08.2021) has been procured from about 128.72 lakh farmers spread over 23 States at 74609 numbers of procurement centres. Government of India /Food Corporation of India have received only 8 complaints during KMS 2020-21. The detail of complaints and action taken thereon are at Annexure.(b): 	The complaints mainly relates to bogus purchase from non-genuine farmers, payment less than Minimum Support Price (MSP), delay in payment, quality issues and non availability of infrastructure at Mandi/Procurement Centres. (c): 	The complaints related to paddy procurement are investigated and action taken in accordance with prescribed procedure in this regard. Further, the following initiatives/measures have been taken by the Government in streamlining the Procurement Operations:i) 	Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) of MSP has been implemented across the country. This has brought in responsibility, transparency, real time monitoring and reduces pilferage in the system. DBT eliminates purchase from fictitious bogus farmers, reduces diversion and duplication of payment as payment is made directly to farmer’s bank account which in many States is linked with Aadhaar number of the farmers. ii) 	FCI and most of the State Governments have developed their own online procurement system which ushers in transparency and convenience to the farmers through proper registration and monitoring of actual procurement. The online procurement system has largely eliminated the procurement from middlemen and has resulted in better targeting of the MSP to farmers. (iii) 	The State agencies have to also ensure the use of Expenditure Advance Transfer module (EAT) of Public Financial Module System (PFMS) while making payment, as mandated by the Ministry of Finance, GOI by integrating their online payment system with PFMS to maintain financial integrity.iv) 	Minimum Support Price (MSP) operations are given wide publicity through pamphlets, banners, sign boards, radio, TV and advertisements through print & electronic media. v) 	Farmers are made aware of the quality specifications and purchase system, etc. to facilitate bringing their produce conforming to the specifications. vi) 	Procurement centres are opened by respective State Government Agencies/  Food Corporation of India, taking into account the production, marketable surplus, convenience of farmers and availability of other logistics / infrastructure such as storage and transportation, etc. Large number of temporary purchase centres, in addition to the existing Mandis and depots/godowns are also established at key points for the convenience of farmers.****** AnnexureSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF THE STARRED QUESTION NO. *312 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 10.08.2021 IN THE LOK SABHA.Details of complaints received  and action taken thereon during KMS 2020-21Sr. No	Name of Complainant	Dt of complaint	Complaint against	FCI Region Name	Subject matter of complaint in brief	Action taken/Irregularities notices, if any.1.
