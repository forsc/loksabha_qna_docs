                                                        (a)	There are two steel manufacturing Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) in the country namely Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL). A statement showing the State-wise, plant-wise and year-wise number of fatal accidents, in SAIL and RINL during the last three years is at Annexure. Steel is a deregulated sector. There are a large number of steel factories/plants in the country. As regards the private sector steel plants, the requisite data/information is not maintained by the Ministry of Steel.(b)	SAIL Plants being ISO 9001 certified, have a proper Maintenance Management System. In SAIL plants, various maintenance practices are being followed to ensure good operation of the plants, such as Capital Repair plan for major equipment is prepared every year and is periodically monitored, Standard Maintenance Practices (SMPs) for all major equipment has been drawn for upkeep of equipment, analysis of breakdown to prevent recurrence, regular maintenance such as housekeeping, inspection, oiling and retightening, ensuring awareness and training various areas related to maintenance of equipment etc. Similarly, in RINL, maintenance systems and practices are reviewed on continual basis and improvements are incorporated in the system, keeping abreast with the latest developments. The computerized Oracle based Maintenance Management System (MAMS) is in place for stage-1 (3 million MT) and stage-2 (6.3 Million MT) units. The progress of implementation is being reviewed periodically by Head of Maintenance and Head of Works division. RINL has in place, systematic review and analysis mechanism for major maintenance breakdowns at different levels i.e. Shop-floor, Technical services and cross functional teams. Corrective preventive actions to avoid recurrence are initiated and the effectiveness of the same is reviewed by shop-floor committees, Head of Maintenance and Head of Works division during periodic review meetings on maintenance/production/safety. (c)	Both SAIL and RINL have taken a number of measures to avoid occurrence of accidents. These measures, inter alia, include adherence to maintenance schedule, thrust on systematic approach to safety management, strict adherence to safety procedures, regular inspection, mandatory training and special training on safety awareness, conduct of safety audit, enforcing use of personal protection equipment and proper implementation of emergency plan prepared as per the provisions of the Factories Act, 1948 etc.********
