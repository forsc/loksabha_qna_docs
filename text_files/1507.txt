ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c):	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.******** Statement referred to in reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No.*132 for answer on 01.07.2019(a) to (c):	Overall progress in the country, including that of its tribal population, tribal areas and areas in the North Eastern part of the country, has been an area of focus since independence. Plans, schemes and projects at all stages are subject to extensive assessments for their need, impact etc. Schemes catering to Education, Health, Agriculture, Livelihood, Housing, Drinking water & Sanitation, Employment Generation, Skill Development, Women and Child Development etc. are implemented by Central Government as well as State Governments to address the need of tribal population and tribal dominated areas. Earmarking 10% of schematic outlay of Central Ministries for the North Eastern Region has been mandated by the Union Government to address specific issues relating to that area. Further, 40 Central Ministries have been mandated to earmark funds in the range of 4.3% to 17.5% of their total Scheme allocation every year to cater specifically to the needs of the tribal population / tribal dominated areas.   Bridging gaps related to development parameters between North East region and the rest of the country and between tribal population / tribal dominated areas and rest of the population are hence given priority. Details of Tribal Sub Plan / Tribal Sub-Scheme / Scheduled Tribe Component allocated by Central Ministries / Departments, State Governments and Ministry of Tribal Affairs during 2014-15 to 2018-19 are as below:(Rs. in Crore)TSP / TSS / ST component	2014-15	2015-16	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19Central Ministries / Departments 	16,111	15,628	19,873	25,999	31,803State Component	83,167 	96,369	1,11,435	1,39,290	1,52,494Funds under MoTA	3,850	4,550	4,799	5,293	6,000Total:	103,128	116,547	136,107	170,582	1,90,297*****
