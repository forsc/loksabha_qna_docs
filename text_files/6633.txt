                                                        (a)	Yes Sir, Realizing the importance of rural youth in agricultural development, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research has initiated a program called “Attracting and Retaining Youth in Agriculture” (ARYA) during the XII plan. Attracting and Retaining Youth in Agriculture (ARYA) project is being implemented in 25 States through KVKs, one district from each State. Depending upon the type of enterprise, individual or group-based activities/enterprises are being encouraged. In one district, about 100-200 rural youths are identified for their skill development in entrepreneurial activities and establishment of related micro-enterprise units in the different areas of enterprises in agriculture. This provides additional opportunities to the unemployed rural youth in primary and secondary agriculture and related enterprises.To strengthen it further, during the year 2018-19, the ARYA project was extended to additional 71 KVKs. Under the project, upto 2018-19, 12783 youth in various groups have been oriented for establishing micro-entrepreneurial units.(b)	Yes.
