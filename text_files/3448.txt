ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (f)      The Dynamic Ground Water Resources of the country are being periodically assessed jointly by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and State Governments. As per the 2017 assessment, out of the total 6881 assessment units (Block/ Taluks/ Mandals/ watersheds/ Firkas) in the country, 1186 units in 17 States/UTs have been categorized as ‘Over-exploited’ where the total Current Annual Ground Water Extraction is more than Annual Extractable Ground Water Resource.Categorization of ‘Over Exploited’ Blocks/ Mandals/ Talukas in India (2017) are given at Annexure I.   Ground water levels in various parts of the Country are declining because of continuous withdrawal due to reasons such as increased demand of fresh water for various uses, vagaries of rainfall, increased population, industrialization & urbanization, less amount of recharge due to deficient rainfall etc.Central Ground Water Board is periodically monitoring the ground water levels throughout the Country on a regional scale, through a network of monitoring wells. In order to assess the decline in water level on a long-term basis, Pre-monsoon water level data collected by CGWB during Pre-monsoon 2019 has been compared with the decadal average (2009-2018). Analysis of water level data (Annexure II) indicates that about 61% of the wells monitored have registered decline in ground water levels. Hon’ble Prime Minister has written a letter to all Sarpanchs on 08.06.2019 regarding the importance of water conservation and rain harvesting and exhorted them to adopt all appropriate measures to make water conservation a mass movement. Government of India has launched the Jal Shakti Abhiyan which is a time bound campaign with a mission mode approach intended to improve water availability including ground water conditions in the water stressed blocks.Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management including conservation and artificial recharge to ground water in the Country is primarily States’ responsibility. Water resources projects including water harvesting/conservation projects are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priority. The other important initiatives taken up are available at the following URL: http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf(g) & (h) Financial assistance for construction of water harvesting structures is provided mainly through schemes like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) and Pradhan Mantri Sinchayee Yojana (Per Drop More Crop). Under MGNREGA, water conservation and water harvesting structures to augment and improve ground water like underground dykes, earthen dams, stop dams, check dams with special focus on recharging ground water including drinking water sources are permissible activities. The State wise funds released during last five years are given at Annexure-III.As per information received from Department of Land Resources, they have sanctioned 8214 watershed development projects in 28 States (expect Goa) (during the period 2009-10 to 2014-15) covering an area of about 39.07 million hectare under Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP). IWMP was amalgamated as the Watershed Development Component (WDC) of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) in 2015-16. The activities being undertaken through the watershed development project inter alia include ridge area treatment, drainage line treatment, soil and moisture conservation, rain water harvesting, nursery raising, afforestation, horticulture, pasture development, livelihoods for assetless persons, etc.The State wise details of projects sanctioned, area covered by the projects and funds released as Central share to States under WDC-PMKSY are given at Annexure-IV.*** ANNEXURE- IAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) to (f) of Unstarred Question No. 3148 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 11.07.2019 regarding “Ground water shortage”.Categorization of ‘Over Exploited’ Blocks/ Mandals/ Talukas in India (2017)S.No.	States / Union Territories	Total No. of Assessed Units	Over-Exploited			Nos.	% 	States   1	Andhra Pradesh	670	45	72	Arunachal Pradesh	11	0	03	Assam	28	0	04	Bihar	534	12	25	Chattisgarh	146	0	06	Delhi	34	22	657	Goa	12	0	08	Gujarat	248	25	109	Haryana	128	78	6110	Himachal Pradesh	8	4	5011	Jammu & Kashmir	22	0	012	Jharkhand	260	3	113	Karnataka	176	45	2614	Kerala	152	1	115	Madhya Pradesh	313	22	716	Maharashtra	353	11	317	Manipur	9	0	018	Meghalaya	11	0	019	Mizoram	26	0	020	Nagaland	11	0	021	Odisha	314	0	022	Punjab	138	109	7923	Rajasthan	295	185	6324	Sikkim	4	0	025	Tamil Nadu	1166	462	4026	Telangana	584	70	1227	Tripura	59	0	028	Uttar Pradesh*	830	91	1129	Uttarakhand	18	0	030	West Bengal **	268	0	0 	Total States	6828	1185	17 	Union Territories   1	Andaman & Nicobar	36	0	02	Chandigarh	1	0	03	Dadra & Nagar Haveli	1	0	04	Daman & Diu	2	0	05	Lakshdweep	9	0	06	Puducherry	4	1	25 	Total UTs	53	1	2 	Grand Total	6881	1186	17Note											Blocks- Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Kerala, M.P., Manipur, Mizoram, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal											Taluks -Karnataka, Goa, Gujarat, Maharashtra											Mandals - Andhra Pradesh, Telangana											Districts/Valley- Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland											Islands - Lakshadweep, Andaman & Nicobar Islands											Firka-Tamil Nadu											Region - Puducherry											UT - Chandigarh, Dadar & Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu											Tehsil-NCT Delhi											*Uttar Pradesh: There are total 820 block and 10 Cities **The Ground Water resources assessment as on 2013 habeen considered for the state of West Bengal											 ANNEXURE- IIAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) to (f) of Unstarred Question No. 3148 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 11.07.2019 regarding “Ground water shortage”.S.
