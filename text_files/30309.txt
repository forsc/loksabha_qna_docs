ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL) (a), (c), (d)& (f) To enable every rural household of the country to have provision of tap water supply by 2024, since August 2019, Government of India, in partnership with States, is implementing  Jal  Jeevan  Mission  (JJM). Following the principle of ‘no one is left out’, under Jal Jeevan Mission, provision of tap water supply is made in every rural household, including those in SC/ ST dominated villages of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. Further, priority is given for provision of tap water supply in water-quality affected habitations, desert and drought-prone areas, SC/ ST majority villages, Aspirational & JE - AES affected districts, Saansad  Adarsh  Gramin Yojana villages, etc. At the time of announcement of Jal Jeevan Mission, out of 18.93 Crore rural households, 3.23 Crore (17%) households were reported to have tap water connections. So far, 5.38 Crore (28%) rural households have been provided with tap water connections under JJM. Thus, as of date, out of 19.22 Crore rural households across the country, 8.62 Crore (44.84%) households are reported to have potable tap water supply in their homes. The State/ UT-wise details of the number of households having provision of tap water supply in their homes, is annexed.(b) 	Lack of dependable drinking water sources in water-stressed, drought-prone and desert areas, presence of geo-genic contaminants in ground water, uneven geographical terrain, scattered rural habitations, lack of capacity of the local village communities to manage and operate in-village water supply infrastructure, etc. and delay in release of the matching State share in some States especially after the Covid-19 pandemic, are few problems faced in the implementation of the mission.(e) 	After the announcement of JJM, a conference of Ministers in-charge of rural water supply of States/ UTs was held in New Delhi followed by five regional workshops involving States/ UTs and other stakeholders working in water sector, to discuss the modalities for implementation as well as for firming up the operational guidelines for the mission.Inputs received from various stakeholders including line ministries were examined and those found in consonance with the approval of the Government, have been incorporated while framing the Operational Guidelines for the implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission and the same has been released on 25th December, 2019.*****
