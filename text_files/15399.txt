National Policy on Electronics 2019: The National Policy on Electronics 2019 (NPE 2019) has been notified on 25.02.2019. The vision of NPE 2019 is to position India as a global hub for Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) by encouraging and driving capabilities in the country for developing core components, including chipsets, and creating an enabling environment for the industry to compete globally.2.	100% FDI: As per extant Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy, FDI up-to 100% under the automatic route is permitted for electronics manufacturing, subject to applicable laws/ regulations; security and other conditions.3.	Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS): The scheme was notified on 27th July, 2012 to provide financial incentives to offset disability and attract investments in the electronics manufacturing sector. It has been amended in August, 2015 to extend the period of the scheme, enhance scope of the Scheme by including 15 more product verticals, and attract more investment. The scheme was further amended in January, 2017 to expedite the investments. The scheme provides subsidy for capital expenditure - 20% for investments in Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and 25% in non-SEZs. The incentives are available for 44 categories/ verticals of electronic products and components covering entire electronics manufacturing value chain. The scheme was open to receive applications till 31.12.2018 and is in the implementation mode.4.

Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP) has been notified to promote domestic value addition in mobile handsets and their parts/ components manufacturing. As a result, India has rapidly started attracting investments into this sector and significant manufacturing capacities have been set up in the country. The manufacturing of mobile handsets and their parts/ components has been steadily moving from Semi Knocked Down (SKD) to Completely Knocked Down (SKD) level, thereby progressively increasing the domestic value addition.  7.
