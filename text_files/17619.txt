                                                        THE MINISTEROF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (a) to (c) & (f) To ensure availability of banking outlet (Bank branch/Business Correspondent (BC), within 5 kilometers of all inhabited villages the Government has launched a Geographic Information System (GIS) based app., namely, Jan DhanDarshak app (JDD app) developed by National Informatics Centre (NIC).  Banks have been provided login credentials to upload the GIS location of their branches, Business Correspondents and ATMs on the app. As per JDD app, there are 1.66 lakh branches, 4.35 lakh BCs and 2.07 lakhs ATMs mapped by the banks.  Further, as per data uploaded by the banks on JDD app, out of the 5.53 lakh mapped villages on the app, 5.52 lakh (99.8%) villages are having branch or BC within 5 kilometers distance.As per extant guidelines dated 18.5.2017 on rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has granted general permission to domestic Scheduled Commercial Banks  (excluding Regional Rural Banks), to  open banking outlets  at  any place  in the country, without seeking  prior  approval of  RBI  in  each  case, subject to at least  25 percent  of the total number  of  banking outlets  opened  during a financial  year being in  unbanked  rural centres i.e. centres having population less than 10,000 (Tier 5 and Tier 6 centres). Further, ten Small Finance banks and six Payment Banks have been licensed by RBI for providing banking services across the country including the rural centres. Under Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), all villages were mapped by banks into 1.59 lakh Sub-Service Areas (SSAs) with one SSA catering to 1,000 to 1,500 households. While 0.33 lakh SSAs have been covered with bank branches, 1.26 lakh SSAs, have been covered by deployment of interoperable Business Correspondents (BCs).	In pursuance of RBI guidelines, rolling out of banking outlets in uncovered areas is a continuous process and looked after by State Level Banker’s Committee (SLBC), in consultation with the concerned State Government, member banks and other stakeholders.Banks, inter-alia, consider proposals for opening banking outlets in the light of RBI’s instructions, their business plans and their commercial viability. To further assess the viability for opening a banking outlet, banks carry out survey as required.(d) and (e) As informed by SLBC, Haryana and SLBC Bihar, all the Gram Panchayats and Blocks in these States are covered with banking servicesby bank branches/ Business Correspondents. *****
