ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) Water quality of aquatic resourcescovering surface and ground water is monitored at 2026 locations on rivers under National Water Quality Monitoring Programme (NWMP). A set of micro pollutants (metals and pesticides) are monitored. Standards/criteria for pesticides parameters in rivers and other water bodies are not notified, however,  BIS has specified IS 10500: 2012 which include pesticides parameters. Findings of  pesticides parameters monitored under NWMP for major rivers viz. Beas, Cauvery, Ganga, Ghaggar, Godavari, Mahanadi, Narmada, Sabarmati, Satluj, Tapi and Yamuna during 2020 ranges between BDL to 0.06 microgram/L for Alpha –HCH), BDL to 0.37 microgram/L for Beta HCH, BDL for Gama HCH, o-p DDT, pp DDT, Alpha , Beta Endosulphan, BDL-0.07 microgram/L for Aldrin, BDL for Dieldrin, Chloropyriphos, Methyl Parathion, Malathion, BDL -0.05 microgram/L for Anilophos. Detail table for water quality data of pesticides parameters in major rivers is given at Annexure IThe monitoring is conducted and analyzed for various physico-chemical, micro- biological and micro-pollutants (metals & pesticides) parameters as per Guidelines for Water Quality Monitoring, 2017 issued by Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change , (Annexure-I) and are available on the linkhttps://cpcb.nic.in/wqm/Guidelines_Water_Quality_Monitoring_2017.pdfThe Government has prescribed industry specific effluent discharge norms including for chemical industries, which is revised from time to time. The Environmental standards for pharmaceutical industries was revised and notified on 06.08.2021. These industries are permitted to operate only after having adequate Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) and Air Pollution control devices (APCDs). Non-compliance observed to the discharge norms are appropriately dealt by issuance of show causes notice or closure, within the provision of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution)  Act,1974 or the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution)  Act,1981. 	Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has issued directives for close monitoring of industrial discharges to control pollution including chemical and pharmaceutical unit.(b) & (c)Expert committee has consideredAntibiotic residue standard for pharmaceutical sector and has not accepted for the reasons, including the followings:i.	No other country in the world implemented these standards.ii.	PNEC (Predict No Effect Concentration) values, one of the basis for standards posses challenge for compliance by any static treatment option to meet the dynamic nature of the PNEC values published by a consortium of AMR manufacturer.iii.	Implementation, monitoring and compliance challenges for 121 antibiotics standards.(d) & (e) Common Effluent Treatment Plant is a collective treatment system for treatment of effluents from small and medium scale industries located in industrial areas.  The discharge limits for general and specific parameters are notified by the Government (Annexure-II).Active pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) is not a notified parameter for CETPs.  However, BOD and COD of the wastewater are contributed by the API components. The CETPs having appropriate primary and secondary treatment process with adequate capacity and followed by tertiary treatment as per requirement of influent wastewater quality are capable to meet the prescribed norms of BOD and COD. No study has been conducted to explore any novel technological interventionto neutralize the API residues present in the wastewaters of hospitals and pharmaceutical manufacturing units, however, concentration of APIswas not detected in the outlet of Effluent Treatment Plants of Pharmaceutical industries during the project study of “Comprehensive Industry Document on Pharmaceutical Industry and Development of Emission Standards" by CPCB.***
