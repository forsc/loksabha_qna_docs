                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (SHRI MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a)	to(e):	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 62 FOR 23RD JULY, 2021…..(a)	to (e):	  Yes, it has come to the notice of  the Government of India that some States have  floated global tenders for procurement of COVID-19 vaccines. Such tenders were placed by State Governments in May 2021. Multiple and repeated demands were made by States/UTs to the Government of India that they be allowed to procure vaccines directly and administer them as per their requirements. However, none of the tenders floated by any State Government materialized into procurement of Covid vaccines from any vaccine manufacturers including offshore manufacturers. Later on, many States communicated to the Government of India that they were facing difficulties in managing the funding, and logistics of direct procurement of Covid vaccines. This in turn impacted the pace of the National COVID Vaccination Program. Keeping in view the repeated requests received from States, and the experience gained, the Guidelines for National COVID Vaccination Program were reviewed and “Revised Guidelines for Implementation of National COVID Vaccination Program” were issued on 8th June 2021, to be effective from 21st June 2021. In accordance with these guidelines, Government of India is procuring 75% of the vaccines being produced by the vaccine manufacturers in the country.  These vaccines are provided free of cost to States/UTs on the basis of their pro-rata target population and consumption pattern as well as vaccine wastage.The Government of India is aware of the global demand supply gap due to which many countries are facing difficulties in procuring COVID-19 vaccines for their eligible population. Accordingly, many steps have been taken to augment the domestic manufacturing capacity of COVID-19 vaccines. These include advance payments for vaccine procurement to M/s Serum Institute of India and M/s Bharat Biotech, support to M/s Bharat Biotech and 3 Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) under ‘Mission COVID Suraksha- the Indian COVID-19 Vaccine Development Mission’, technology transfer of Covaxin production, financial assistance to one of the domestic vaccine manufacturer i.e Biological E for ‘At-risk manufacturing’ and streamlining of regulatory norms for approval of vaccines. These steps will facilitate availability of adequate quantity of COVID-19 vaccine.****
