ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b)  : 	Standards for Packaged Mineral Water and Packaged Drinking Water (other than mineral water) , including limits of pesticide residues, are prescribed in subregulations 2.10.7 and 2.10.8 of Food Safety & Standards (Food Products & Food Additives) Regulations, 2011 respectively.   Further, as per sub-regulations 2.3.14 (17) & 2.3.14 (18) of Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restrictions on Sales) Regulations, 2011 “No person shall manufacture, sell or exhibit for sale packaged drinking water and mineral water except under the Bureau of Indian Standards Certification Mark”. All Food Business Operators engaged in any food business are required to follow the standards prescribed under Food Safety and Standards (Food Product Standards and Food Additives) Regulations, 2011. Instances of sale of packaged mineral water/packaged drinking water not meeting the prescribed standards that come to the notice of FSSAI, are taken up with State Governments/UTs, as enforcement of provisions of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and Rules and Regulations made thereunder primarily lies with States/UT Governments. FSSAI has, from time to time, advised Commissioners of Food Safety of States/UTs to carry out regular enforcement/surveillance activities in their area of jurisdiction and to ensure that no bottling unit of packaged drinking water operates their business without FSSAI License and BIS Certification and that the packaged drinking water and mineral water meets the quality standards. Regular surveillance, monitoring and inspection are undertaken by food safety officials of State/UT Governments including lifting of random samples of food items, including packaged drinking water and mineral water, for analysis in the food testing labs. In such cases, where the samples are found to be non-conforming, penal action is initiated under the provisions of the FSS Act, 2006. (c) & (d)   :   No such proposal has been received or is under discussion in BIS. *****
