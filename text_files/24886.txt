                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (SHRI MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a)	to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table  of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 76 FOR 23RD JULY, 2021…..(a)	The Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards and Food Additives) Regulations, 2011 of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), prescribed the limit of trans fat content in Vanaspati, Bakery shortenings, Bakery and industrial margarine, Interesterified vegetable fats/oils, Refined Vegetable Oil, Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, Table Margarine, Mixed Fat Spread and Vegetable Fat Spread to be not more than 5% by weight.Through an amendment in Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards and Food Additives) Regulations, 2011 notified on 29.12.2020, the above mentioned limit of trans fat content has been reduced to not more than 2% by weight in a phased manner by 2022 (not more than 3% by weight, on and from 1st January, 2021 and not more than 2% by weight, on and from 1st January, 2022) The enforcement for the limit of trans fat of 3% by weight and 2% by weight is for the products manufactured on or after 01.04.2021 and 01.01.2022 respectively.Further, the limit of industrial trans-fat in processed food products manufactured on or after 01.01.2022 to be not more than 2% by weight (of the total oils/fats present in the Food products) in which edible oils and fats are used as an ingredient, has been notified on 02.02.2021 in Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restrictions On Sales) Regulations, 2011.(b)	The limit of trans fats was recommended by the Scientific Panel after due consultations with stakeholders such as Consumer Organizations, Industry Associations, Research Institutions etc. The recommendations of the Panel were approved by the Scientific Committee and eventually by the Food Authority.(c)	As reported by World Health Organization (WHO), increased intake of Trans fats  (>1% of total energy intake) is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events and mortality and more than 5,00,000 deaths in 2010 were attributed globally to increased intake of trans fats.  Reducing the limits of trans fats in edible oils and fats and in processed foods wherein oil/fats are used will minimize the negative health impact on human health which may be caused due to increased intake to trans fats.(d)	Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards & Food Additives) Regulations, 2011 prescribe list of permitted additives, and limits thereof that can be added in a given food product.  All Food Business Operators are mandated to ensure adherence to these provisions.  ******
