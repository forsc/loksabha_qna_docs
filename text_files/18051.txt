ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (d)	Four out of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council have bilaterally expressed official affirmations of support for India’s candidature to a permanent seat in an expanded UN Security Council.In the Joint Statement issued on the occasion of the visit of the Indian Prime Minister to China in May 2015 it is stated that "China attaches great importance to India’s status in international affairs as a large developing country, and understands and supports India’s aspiration to play a greater role in the United Nations including in the Security Council.”The process of UNSC Reforms is being presently discussed under the Intergovernmental Negotiation (IGN) framework of the UN General Assembly, where India along with like-minded countries has been pushing for text-based negotiations to commence on an urgent basis.  India is also working alongside other reform-oriented countries through its membership in G-4 (India, Japan, Brazil and Germany) and the L.69 Group (a cross regional group of countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America) for building support among the UN Member States for expansion in both permanent and non permanent categories.Government of India has accorded the highest priority to getting permanent membership for India in an expanded United Nations Security Council. Towards this end, GOI has undertaken various initiatives aimed at building international support for India. The matter is consistently taken up during bilateral and multilateral meetings, and in discussions with other countries at all levels, including at the highest levels.***
