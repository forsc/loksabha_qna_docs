                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF STARRED QUESTION NO.133 BY SHRIMATI JASKAUR MEENA TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 28.07.2021 REGARDING RAILWAY UNDERPASS(a) to (d): The issue relates to construction of Road Under Bridge (RUB) at Km. 175/500 between Bhankari and Dausa Stations.  The villages near Bandikui are served by two Level Crossings (LCs),  LC No. 176 (Km 175/300-400) & LC No. 179 (Km 178/200-300). A Road over Bridge (ROB) also exists at Km 176/500-600. The bank height near Bandikui is very low, which is not suitable for the construction of RUB due to anticipated drainage problems.As per existing policy, Railways provide RUB/Subways to replace LC, if technically feasible, as per Railways requirements. In case of State’s requirement, Railways provide RUB/Subways as a deposit work at 100% cost of State Government, subject to its being technically feasible.  Presently, Railway has no plan to construct a RUB/ Subway at this location.*****
