ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE????????????????????????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a): 	The National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) provides for a maximum coverage of 81.35 Crore beneficiaries in the country to receive the monthly benefit of highly subsidisedfoodgrains through the country’s Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) and as per the provisions of the Act, the States/UTs have identified maximum eligible beneficiaries up to their respective ceiling limits of the NFSA. Accordingly, the Government is allocating foodgrains i.e., Rice, Wheat and Coarse grains to the States/UTs for monthly distribution to the number of eligible beneficiaries/households identified by the States/UTs under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and Priority Household (PHH) categories of the Act at the scale of 35 Kg per AAY family per month and 5 Kg per PHH person per month at highly subsidised Central Issue Prices (CIP) of Rs. 3, 2 and 1 per Kg of Rice, Wheat and Coarse grains respectively through the Fair Price Shops (FPSs) under the TPDS.Further, as per the NFSA, it is the responsibility of the States/UTs to allocate the foodgrains within the State/UT up to all FPSs as per the number of AAY and PHH ration cards attached to the FPSs, lift the foodgrains from the depots of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) / Central Stocks, and ensure door-step-delivery of allocated foodgrains to all FPSs for timely distribution of entitled quota of highly subsidised foodgrains to all NFSA beneficiaries from the FPSs.  (b):   As part of the technology driven TPDS reforms undertaken by the Government in association with all States/UTs, all NFSA ration cards/beneficiaries’ data is completely digitised in all States/UTs, online allocation of foodgrains up to all FPSs is implemented in all States/UTs, transparency portals, online grievance redressal facilities and toll free helplines are setup in all States/UTs, and so far, the electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices for transparent distribution to beneficiaries are installed in about 5.29 Lakh (99%) of total 5.34 Lakh FPSs in the country. Further, States/UTs are also advised that the receipt of monthly allocated foodgrains at the FPSs shall also be acknowledged through ePoS devices with biometric authentication of FPS dealers to ensure timely availability and distribution of foodgrains to all beneficiaries. Besides, some States/UTs are also sending SMS alerts to some registered beneficiaries and FPS dealers about the dispatch of foodgrains to the FPSs to maintain transparency in availability of foodgrains at the FPSs. Additionally, the beneficiaries may also leverage the technology driven One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan for inter-State and intra-State portability of ration cards to lift their quota of foodgrains from any FPS of choice, anywhere in the country by using their same/existing ration card with biometric authentication on an ePoS device.*****
