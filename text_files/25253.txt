The customer can choose any of thedistributors from the list applicable for his/her area to get an LPG refill delivery by justtapping/clicking on the particular distributor.In the pilot phase, this unique facility has been launched in Chandigarh, Coimbatore,Gurgaon, Pune, and Ranchi in June 2021.The facility has been conceived to not only empower the customer by way of enhancedchoices, but to also inspire healthy competition amongst the distributors to provide the bestin-class services to the customers and improve their performance ratings. It is therefore awin-win facility for both the customers and the distributors.(e) Oil Marketing Companies have reported that they have received 5 establishedcomplaints regarding delay in refill supplies of domestic LPG cylinders in the State ofTamilnadu and Maharashtra during the last 3 years and the current year. Action against thedistributors has been taken as per provisions of Marketing Discipline Guidelines/distributorship agreement in all the established cases of irregularities.(f) IOCL have reported that they have currently no plan to rollout Tatkal LPG Seva.--------
