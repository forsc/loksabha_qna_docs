ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) The Forest Survey of India carries out biennial assessment of forest and tree cover of the countryand findings are published in India State of Forest Report (ISFR). As per ISFR- 2017, the total forest and tree cover in the country is 8,02,088 square kilometers (sq.km.) (forest cover 7,08,273 sq.km., tree cover 93,815 sq.km.) which is 24.39% of the geographical area of the country. There is an increase of 8,021 sq.km. (forest cover 6,778 sq.km., tree cover 1,243 sq.km.) of total forest and tree cover compared to that of ISFR-2015.(b) & (c) Since forests are managed by the States/UTs, the responsibility of protection of forests including that from deforestation and denudation lie primarily with the respective State/UT Governments.Therefore, all necessary action for prevention and control need to be taken by the concerned State/UT Governments under the Indian Forest Act, 1927 and various State Acts and Rules.The information on deforestation due to various reasons is not maintained at Government of India level. The Government Policy is to ensure more trees are planted than removed under different developmental proposals approved under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The trees are removed only when it is absolutely necessary. Because of this policy, India’s forest cover is increasing.In the last three years 69,44,608 number of trees were removed and 6.2 Crore trees planted as compensatory afforestation. The details are given in Annexure-I. In such cases, as part of the approval, appropriate compensatory afforestation schemes have been stipulated for taking up over 62769.58 hectare land in the last three years.(d) & (e)   There is no new initiative proposed by the Government. However, the ongoing Centrally Sponsored Schemes of the ministry such as National Afforestation Programme NAP), Green India Mission (GIM) and Development of Wildlife Habitats (DWH) aim at increasing forest and tree cover in the country.The ministry also supports school nursery and urban forestry programmes through people’s participation. The fund under Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), interalia, is also used in plantation activity including compensatory afforestation. Details of fund released by the Ministry for conservation, development and expansion of forests under NAP, GIM and DWH during the last two years and the current year to States/UTs are given in Annexure-II, III, IV respectively. Under Compensatory Afforestation Funds (CAF), the details of State-wise funds released during last two years and part of 2019-20 by the Ad-hoc CAMPA are given in Annexure V. After formation of National Authority under Compensatory Afforestation (CAF) Act, 2016, a sum of Rs. 47436.18 Crore have been deposited in State funds as per the provision of the CAF Act, 2016. State-wise details of fund deposited in State fund are at Annexure VI.Afforestation activities are also taken up under various programmes/funding sources such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana and under concerned State/UT schemes/plans.The multi departmental efforts have yielded good results in conserving environment by addressing the problem of deforestation, besides keeping the pace of development, which is evident from the fact that the forest cover has stabilized and has been constantly increasing over the years. As per the latest Global Forest Resource Assessment published by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, India is one of the top ten countries in the world having maximum forest cover. India stands at the eight position in respect of having the greatest forest gain.************
