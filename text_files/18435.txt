Characterization of the vaccine candidate has been undertaken at ICMR-NIV followed by safety and tolerability studies in small animals like rats, mice and rabbits. Status of clinical trials is as follows:•	Phase I clinical trials alongwith parallel studies in hamsters and rhesus macaques have been completed. The trial has revealed excellent safety of the candidate vaccine. Immunogenicity testing is in progress.•	Phase II clinical trials are ongoing.(ii) A DNA vaccine (ZyCov-D) has been developed by Cadila Healthcare Ltd. Pre- clincial toxicity studies were conducted in small animals: mice, rats, rabbits and guinea pigs. The vaccine has been found to be safe and immunogenic. Cadila has partnered with ICMR for conduct of parallel pre-clinical studies in rhesus macaques. Status of clinical trials is as follows:•	Phase I clinical trials have been completed. The trial has revealed excellent safety of the candidate vaccine. Immunogenicity testing is in progress.•	Phase II clinical trials are ongoing.(iii)  Serum Institute of India (SII) and ICMR have partnered for clinical development of two global vaccine candidates:•	ChAdOx1-S, which is a non- replicating viral vector vaccine developed by University of Oxford/AstraZeneca.

(d) Presently, under Universal Immunization Program (UIP) vaccine distribution is based on Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN) system. eVIN is an internet based digital system to track routine immunization, vaccine stocks, storage temperature in about 25,000 dedicated cold chain storage points across the country as well as movement of vaccine. The vaccine is distributed to health facilities and outreach station sites, so as to reach in all areas. eVIN system is regularly monitored by health authorities at state and district level. eVIN system is being enhanced to address the needs for distribution and tracking of COVID 19 vaccine, when it becomes available. Further, a National Expert Group on COVID 19 vaccine has been constituted to guide the Government on:-•	Prioritization of population groups for vaccination.•	Selection of COVID 19 vaccine candidates.•	Inventory management and delivery mechanism of the vaccine including making of vaccination process.•	Selection of delivery platforms.•	Cold chain and associated infrastructure for roll-out of COVID 19 vaccination etc.
