ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c)	At present there are a total number of 151 Maritime Training Institutes functioning in the country. All these colleges/institutions have fulfilled all the requisite criteria and the necessary infrastructure facilities. Details provided at Annexure-I.(d)	     The training curriculum for the officers and the ratings was revised in 2016 not only to meet the global standards but also to meet the expectations of the foreign employers.  In order to regulate  the training institutes working in the private sector,  a system of ‘Comprehensive Inspection Programme’ (CIP)has been designed  to assess the quality of the institute  on various  parameters such as infrastructure, quality of students intake, quality of faculty, pedagogy, performance in examination, on-board training. To standardize the course material of these institutes, an e-learning module has been prepared by the Directorate General of Shipping and provided free of cost to all Indian seafarers to allow them to upgrade  their knowledge and skills before appearing  for examinations. This has helped in optimal alignment of seafarers with the global best practices followed by recruiters, thereby increasing their employment avenues. (e) & (f)	Yes Sir, the Government has indentified three maritime clusters in the State of Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Goa (one each).Annexure-IList of Approved Maritime Training Institutes State/UT-wise:<pre>Sr. No.	State/UT	Number of Institute01	Andaman & Nicobar	0102	Andhra Pradesh	0403	Bihar	0304	Delhi	0605	Goa	0406	Gujarat	0407	Haryana	0308	Karnataka	0109	Kerala	0510	Maharashtra	4911	Orissa	0312	Pondicherry	0213	Sikkim	0114	Tamil Nadu	3515	Uttar Pradesh	1016	Uttarakhand	0217	West Bengal	18                                             Total	151                                                                </pre>                                *****
