ANSWER




                                                        (a) and (b): Yes, Sir.  Few instances of data breaches and leaks of user data by various companies were reported in the media. Government took notice of reports about leakage of data by Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, and in responses to notices sent to them, Facebook conveyed that there had been unauthorised data leakage by Cambridge Analyitica. However, since the reply given by Cambridge Analyitica was not adequately convincing, CBI has been asked to investigate this matter with regard to possible misuse by Cambridge Analytica. In addition, one incident of breach of personal data of Indian users from a social media company was reported to the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In). As per information available external actors exploited vulnerability in the form of software bugs impacting a feature provided for users on a social media platform. This allowed unauthorised access to users’ account and information.  The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) issued advisories to users regarding best practices to be followed for protection of account information while using Social Media.(c) to (e) : Yes,  Sir. Government is considering bringing data protection legislation in the country to strengthen the protection of personal data. A comprehensive legislation on data privacy is under formulation. The Government constituted a committee of expert on data protection, chaired by Justice (Retd) B.N. Srikrishna, Supreme Court of India to study various issues relating to data protection and come out with Data Protection Bill. The said committee has brought out a draft Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB) on which consultations have been conducted and the bill is intended to be placed in parliament soon. The Bill seeks to bring in place a culture of privacy by design and promoting concepts such as consent framework, purpose limitation, storage limitation, and data minimization among various other privacy-oriented concepts. It also proposes Penalties and compensation for violation of the provisions.  ******
