ANSWER




                                                         MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a)	to (c): The commodities allocated by Government of India through Public Distribution System are foodgrains that include rice, wheat & nutri-cereals in addition to sugar and kerosene oil. ..........2/--2-Govt. of India makes allocation of foodgrains to the States/UTs under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) in terms of National Food Security Act, 2013.  The Act provides for coverage of upto 75% of the rural population and upto 50% of the urban population for receiving highly subsidized foodgrains under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), thus covering about two-thirds of the population or atleast 81.35 crore persons, as per Census 2011 population. Corresponding to the above coverage at All India level, State-wise percentage coverage has been determined by the then Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog). Under the Act eligible households, which comprise of Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households and priority households, are entitled to receive foodgrains @ Rs 1/2/3 per kg for nutri-cereals/wheat/rice respectively. While priority households are entitled to receive 5 kg per person per month, AAY households, which constitute the poorest of the poor, continue to receive 35 Kg of foodgrains per household per month.  The Act is being implemented in all the 36 States/UTs including Andaman & Nicobar Islands.In addition to NFSA, Govt. of India also allocates foodgrains under Other Welfare Schemes (OWS) such as Wheat Based Nutrition Programme (WBNP), Mid Day Meal Scheme (MDM), Scheme for Adolescent Girls (SAG), Annapurna Scheme and Allocation of foodgrains under Welfare Institutions & Hostels Scheme. Foodgrains are allocated under MDM and WBNP Schemes at NFSA rates and under SAG, Annapurna and Welfare Institutions and Hostels Scheme at BPL rates. However, sugar and kerosene are not allocated under OWS.Govt. of India makes allocation of PDS Kerosene on quarterly basis to States/UTs. Further distribution of PDS Kerosene within the States/UTs under PDS network to various categories of ration card holders/consumers is the responsibility of the concerned State/UT. The scale and criteria for distribution of PDS Kerosene is also decided by the State/UT Govt.Under the Sugar subsidy scheme effective from 1.6.2013, Central Govt. was reimbursing sugar subsidy to the States/UTs @ Rs. 18.50 per kg limited their existing allocations covering BPL population (inclusive of poorest of poor person in the country i.e. AAY families) of all States/UTs and entire population in case of North Eastern States/Special category States/Hilly States and Island Territories. The State/UT Govt. were required to procure sugar from the open market through a transparent system for distribution under PDS. The task of distribution of sugar is undertaken by States/UTs.  The Central Govt. has reviewed the scheme in May, 2017 and decided to continue it only for AAY families w.e.f 1.6.2017 with reimbursement of a fixed subsidy of Rs.18.50 per kg @ 1 kg per month per AAY family to participating States/UTs. The State/Union Territory-wise details of the foodgrains (rice & wheat) allocated under National Food Security Act/Targeted Public Distribution System and Other Welfare Schemes during the last three years and the current year is at Annexure-I & II.....3/--3-Most of the States/UTs have lifted their entire quantity of foodgrains allocated to them. Low offtake of foodgrains in some cases may be attributed to shortage of intermediary storage with the States/UTs, late deposition of cost of foodgrains with FCI by the States/UTs, slow pace of lifting by the State agencies/representatives, less number of beneficiaries due to Aadhaar seeding in some states, lifting of less quantity/ non-lifting under tide over scheme, as the same is allocated at prices higher than CIP for normal allocation or some unforeseen circumstances. States/UTs have regularly been advised to construct intermediary storages and ensure timely lifting of foodgrains. Further, Government of India has issued advisories to all State/UTs that no beneficiary/household shall be deleted from the list of eligible beneficiaries/households only on the grounds of not possessing Aadhaar and shall also not be denied subsidized foodgrains or cash transfer of food subsidy under NFSA due to non-availability of Aadhaar or failure of biometric authentication.(d) to (f): There have been complaints about irregularities in the functioning of the Public Distribution System (PDS) including leakage/diversion of Subsidised foodgrains, Subsidised foodgrains not reaching the intended beneficiaries, issuance of ration cards to ineligible persons, etc. in some States/regions in the country. PDS is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and the State/Union Territory (UT) Governments wherein the operational responsibilities for implementation of PDS within the State/UT rest with the State/UT Governments concerned. Therefore, as and when complaints are received by the Government from individuals and organizations as well as through press reports, they are sent to State/UT Governments concerned for inquiry and appropriate action. An offence committed in violation of the provisions of TPDS (Control) Order, 2015 is liable for penal action under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Thus, the Order empowers State/UT Governments to take punitive action in case of contravention of relevant provisions of these Orders.  Also, the institutional mechanism for the monitoring and grievance redressal under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) provides setting up of Vigilance Committees, District Grievance Redressal Officers and independent State Food Commission for making the system more efficient and transparent. A State/UT-wise statement indicating number of such complaints received during the last three years and the current year is at Annexure- III.	Further, with the aim to improve the efficiency of the current system and to address various challenges such as leakages and diversion of foodgrains, elimination of fake and bogus ration cards etc., this Department in collaboration with all States/UTs is implementing a scheme on ‘End-to-End Computerization of PDS Operations’. The scheme comprises digitization of ration cards/beneficiary and other databases, online allocation, computerization of supply-chain management, setting up of transparency portal and grievance redressal mechanisms in all States/UTs. The Scheme also includes automation of Fair Price Shops (FPSs) by installation of electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices at all FPSs. Further, to identify and weed-out duplicate/ineligible beneficiaries, and to enable rightful targeting of food subsidies, all States/UTs have been requested to seed Aadhaar numbers in Ration Card database.***
