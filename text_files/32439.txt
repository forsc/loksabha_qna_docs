(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d): The State Government is primarily responsible for providing necessary relief measures in the wake of natural calamities. For undertaking relief measures, funds are available with the State Government in the form of State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). Under SDRF, the Government of India contributes 90% to Hilly States and 75% to other States. The balance 10% for Hilly and 25% for other States is contributed by the respective State Governments. Additional financial assistance, over and above SDRF, is considered from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) for natural calamities of severe nature and is approved on the basis of Memorandum received from the State Government, in accordance with established procedures.  As per the provisional data (as on 25.11.2021) received from the Ministry of Home Affairs, the State Government of Jharkhand has not reported any damage to crop due to heavy rain in the State. The State Government of Jharkhand has been allocated Rs.605.60 crore (Rs. 454.40 crore as central share & Rs151.20 crore as state share) under SDRF for 2021-22. The entire central share of SDRF has been released to the State of Jharkhand.*****
