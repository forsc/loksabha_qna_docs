Accordingly, their licenses have been extended uniformly for another period of six months i.e. upto 26.05.2022 or till the date of assignment of spectrum for commercial use post auction, whichever is earlier.(b) & (c) 	Presently, foreign companies namely, M/s Ericsson, M/s Nokia, M/s Samsung and M/s Mavenir are engaged with TSPs in 5G trials.

It will provide facilities for experimenting and demonstrating 5G applications/ use cases. DoT has also  rganized ‘5G Hackathon’ to promote 5G products and applications.(f)	5G spectrum reserve price has not been decided so far.
