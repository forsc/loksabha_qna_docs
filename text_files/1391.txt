ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a)	to (d): Under Anganwadi Services, Anganwadi Workers (AWWs)/ Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) are honorary workers who come forward to render their services on payment of monthly honorarium. In view of the very nature of the role of Anganwadi Workers/Helpers, it is not feasible to declare them as regular/permanent employees. Moreover, in a ruling of 07.12.2006 in Civil Appeal No. 4953-4957 of 1998 State of Karnataka & Ors. Vs. Ameeri Bi & Ors. the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India has held that the Anganwadi Workers/Helpers do not hold any civil post. Anganwadi Services is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme and the administration, management and implementation of the Scheme including recruitment of Anganwadi Workers (AWWs)/ Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) is done by the concerned State Government/ UT Administration, (e) 	& (f): Rapid Reporting System (RRS) is an online Management Information System (MIS) based portal wherein monthly information of Anganwadi Centre is captured. In addition, ICDS-CAS Software Application has been rolled-out under POSHAN Abhiyaan enabling each Anganwadi Worker to submit health and nutrition data on National level dashboard. The drill-down dashboard available at National, State, District, Block level contributes towards monitoring and identifying problem area at of all level. As on 25.06.2019, 3.47 lakh Anganwadi Workers are using the ICDS-CAS Application across 20 States/UTs.********
