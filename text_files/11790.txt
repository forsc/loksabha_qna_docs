ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION     (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b) There is shortage of type rated Commanders in the country due to growth in the aviation industry and induction of new type of aircraft in the fleet by the airlines. There is no shortage of pilots, engineers and cabin crew in aviation industry which affects the operation of services leading to delays and cancellation of flights. ;(c) & (d) Sufficient number of Indian co-pilots are available and employed with airlines. These co-pilots do not possess sufficient training and experience as required to become commanders. To cover the shortage of type rated pilots, validation of foreign pilots is done as per rule 45 of Aircraft rules, 1937. These Expat pilots are phased out by the airlines once the co-pilots inducted by them become eligible for Commander after undergoing requisite training for the same, as per their policy. ;Also, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has amended the flying experience requirements for issue of Airlines Transport Pilots Licence (Aeroplane/Helicopter) by amending the Section M & N of Schedule II of Aircraft Rules, 1937 containing the requirements for the issue of ATPL. The amendments in Section M & N will enable more Co-pilots to get ATPL only who may become eligible for Pilot-in command and more number of defence pilots will also become eligible to get ATPL.
