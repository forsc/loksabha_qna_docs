One of the flagship schemes ofGovernment of India is Study in India with the objectives to make India an educationhub for foreign students through a systematic brand-building, marketing, social mediaand digital marketing campaigns. A centralised admission web-portal(https://studyinindia.gov.in) acts as a single window for the admission of foreignstudents.Apart from this, there are 10% supernumerary seats available in Indian Institutesof Technology (IITs) and 15% for National Institutes of Technology (NITs) for foreignstudents. The NITs admit students through the Direct Admission of Students Abroad(DASA) scheme.The University Grants Commission (UGC) encourages the IndianUniversities/Institutes for enrolling more foreign students in their courses for upgradingthe standard of the institutes/universities. The UGC has notified several regulations witha view to sustain and improve the quality of higher education and to undertake academicreforms.Government of India has declared 20 Educational Institutions as Institutions ofEminence (IoE) to provide world class education to the Indian Students with autonomyto admit foreign students up to 30%.Ministry of Human Resource Development has also launched (in October,2018) a Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC),which aims at improving the research ecosystem of India’s higher educationalinstitutions by facilitating academic and research collaborations involving mobility ofstudents/faculty for long term research and teaching activities. More details may beaccessed on https://sparc.iitkgp.ac.in.India has also joined the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) DUO-India fellowshipprogramme as a contributing partner. DUO-India aims to fund every year, 100student-pairs and 50 faculty pairs for exchanges for one semester, starting from 2020onwards aiming to provide mobility between Indian and European institutes.With a view to providing opportunity for foreign students to study in IITs,foreign students are allowed to appear directly in JEE(Advanced).

Further, theGovernment has approved grant of upto 1000 fellowship to students of ASEANcountries to pursue integrated Ph.D. programmes in the IITs, at a total outlay of Rs.300 Cr. for a period of 7 years.
