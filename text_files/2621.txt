ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a): Yes, sir.(b): National Restaurant Association of India has sent a representation dated 4th June, 2019 requesting for dual rates of GST on restaurant service. NRAI has requested to provide GST rate of 5% without input tax credit and 12% with input tax credit for restaurant service on optional basis.(c) and (d): The GST Council is a federal body represented by both Central and State governments, which is the final authority to recommend rate changes under GST. Government fix GST rates based on such recommendation.The 22nd Meeting of the GST Council held on 6th October, 2017, taking note of the concerns of SMEs, a Group of Ministers (GoM) was constituted to examine measures to make the Composition Scheme more attractive and to revisit GST Tax Structure on Restaurants. GoM met twice on 15.10.2017 and 29.10.2017 and had wide ranging consultations with the office bearers of the Organizations and Associations of MSMEs, including National Restaurants Association of India. The tax rate structure with input tax credit benefit was also considered.Recommendations of Group of Ministers (GoM) on Composition and tax structure on restaurants was taken as Agenda item 9 of 23rd GST Council meeting held on 10 November 2017. After noting the recommendations of GoM and the practice of profiteering by restaurants by not passing the benefit of input tax credit as price reduction to the customer, the rate of 5% without input tax credit was fixed by the GST Council. This rate also presented a better headline rate to the pleasure of the customers.The requests for rate changes in GST made by associations such as NRAI are first taken to the Fitment Committee, which advises GST Council on rate changes. At present GST Council has not given any recommendation on the request to provide option of two GST rates @ 5% without input tax credit and @12% with input tax credit for restaurant service.*****
