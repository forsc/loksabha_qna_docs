REGARDING “EMPLOYMENT GENERATION”.(a) to (c): Employment generation coupled with improving employability is the priority of the Government. Government has taken various steps for generating employment in the country like encouraging private sector of economy, fast-tracking various projects involving substantial investment and increasing public expenditure on schemes such as Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) and Deendayal Antodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM).Promoting entrepreneurship is essential for enabling the youth to productively contribute to the economic development of the country.  Accordingly, the Government of India has accorded priority to entrepreneurship through various measures such as Startup India, Mudra Scheme, etc. so as to train and finance entrepreneurs. The Government of India has adopted Skill Development as a National Priority and has launched Skill India Mission. Under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is implementing a flagship scheme known as the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) 2016-20 with an objective to provide skilling to one crore people under Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) across the country for four years i.e. 2016-2020 with an outlay of 12,000 crore.Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY) was launched by the Ministry of Labour and Employment for incentivising employers for promoting employment generation. Under this scheme, Government is paying entire employer’s contribution (12% or as admissible) towards EPF and EPS for all eligible new employees for all sectors for 3 years. The terminal date for registration of beneficiary through the employer under PMRPY was 31.03.2019.Besides these initiatives, flagship programmes of the Government such as Make in India, Digital India,Swachh Bharat Mission, Smart City Mission, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, Housing for All, Infrastructure development and Industrial corridors have the potential to generate productive employment opportunities. Ministries/ Departments/ States run skill development schemes across various sectors to improve the employability of youth and also facilitate placements. Schemes such as the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) wherein Government reimburses 25 percent of the stipend payable to apprentices also enhances employability of the youth to access employment.State/UT-wise estimated worker population ratio for both organised and unorganised sector for above survey periods is given at Annexure.*****
