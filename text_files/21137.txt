                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR HEAVY INDUSTRIES & PUBLIC ENTERPRISES(SHRI ARJUN RAM MEGHWAL)(a) to (c):	Sir, the Department of Heavy Industry (DHI) is administering the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) Scheme since 01st April, 2015 to promote adoption of electric/ hybrid vehicles (xEVs) in India.  At present, Phase-II of FAME India Scheme is being implemented for a period of 3 years w.e.f. 01st April, 2019 with a total budgetary support of Rs. 10,000 crores.  This phase focusses on supporting electrification of public & shared transportation and aims to support, through subsidies, approx. 7000 e-Buses, 5 lakh e-3 Wheelers, 55000 e-4 Wheeler Passenger Cars and 10 lakh e-2 Wheelers.  In addition, creation of charging infrastructure is also supported to address range anxiety among users of electric vehicles. The electric vehicles are capable of being run in rural area (villages) as well as urban areas. Further, following initiatives have also been taken up by the Government of India for promotion of electric vehicles in the country –(i)	GST on electric vehicles has been reduced from 12% to 5%; GST on chargers/ charging stations for electric vehicles has been reduced from 18% to 5%.(ii)	Ministry of Power has allowed sale of electricity as ‘service’ for charging of electric vehicles. This would provide a huge incentive to attract investments into charging infrastructure.(iii)	The Government, vide S.O. 5333(E) dated 18th October, 2018, has also granted exemption to the Battery Operated Transport Vehicles and Transport Vehicles running on Ethanol and Methanol fuels from the requirements of permit.(iv)	In the budget of 2019-20, the Hon’ble Finance Minister announced provision of additional income tax deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh on the interest paid on loans taken to purchase electric vehicles.(v)	In order to promote electric vehicles, the Government has notified for retro-fitment of hybrid electric system or electric kit to vehicles and has specified the type approval procedure of electric hybrid vehicles.(vi)	The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways has notified certain specifications for the grant of licence to age group of 16-18 years to drive gearless E scooters/ Bikes upto 4.0 KW.(vii)	Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has made amendment in the Urban and Regional Development Plans Formulation and Implementation (URDPFI) guidelines to provide for electric vehicle charging stations in private and commercial buildings.(d):	The mileage of electric vehicles mainly depends on the battery capacity.  Further, demand incentive under FAME-India Scheme phase-II is linked to battery capacity of electric vehicles and vehicles fitted with only advanced batteries satisfying certain performance criteria are eligible for the demand incentives under this scheme.(e) & (f):	The FAME-India Scheme envisages support for setting up of adequate public charging infrastructure to instill confidence amongst EV users, through active participation and involvement of various stakeholders including Government agencies, industries, and Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs).          In the first phase of the scheme, Department of Heavy Industry had sanctioned 520 Charging Stations for Rs. 43 Crore (approx.) in cities like Bangalore, Chandigarh, Jaipur and NCR of Delhi.  Further, the Department has sanctioned 2,877 Electric Vehicles (EVs) Charging Stations amounting to Rs. 500 Crore (Approx.) in 68 cities across 25 States/UTs under FAME India scheme phase II.
