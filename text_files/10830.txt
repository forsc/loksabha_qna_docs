                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):     “Public Health & Hospitals” being a State subject, the primary responsibility to provide healthcare to all the citizens, including the poor families, lies with the State Governments. However, under National Health Mission, support is being provided to States for strengthening their healthcare services.To address the healthcare challenges, particularly in rural areas, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in 2005 to supplement the efforts of the State/UT governments to provide accessible, affordable and quality healthcare to all those who access public health facilities. Currently, NRHM is a sub-mission of National Health Mission (NHM).Under NHM, support is provided for host of free services including for maternal health, child health, adolescent health, family planning, universal immunisation programme, and for major diseases such as Tuberculosis, HIV/ AIDS, vector borne diseases such as Malaria, Dengue and Kala Azar, Leprosy etc. Other major initiatives include Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (under which free drugs, free diagnostics, free blood and diet, free transport from home to institution, between facilities in case of a referral and drop back home is provided), Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (which provides newborn and child health screening and early interventions services free of cost for birth defects, diseases, deficiencies and developmental delays to improve the quality of survival), implementation of Free Drugs and Free Diagnostics Service Initiatives, PM National Dialysis Programme and implementation of National Quality Assurance Framework. As per the budget announcement 2017-18, 1.5 lakh Sub Health Centres and Primary Health Centres across the country are to be transformed into Health and Wellness Centres by December, 2022 under Ayushman Bharat (AB-HWCs) for provision of Comprehensive Primary Health Care that includes preventive healthcare and health promotion at the community level with continuum of care approach for all. Services at AB-HWCs are free and universal to all individuals residing in the service area. The AB-HWCs will provide an expanded range of services to include care for non - communicable diseases, palliative and rehabilitative care, Oral, Eye and ENT care, mental health and first level care for emergencies and trauma as well as Health promotion and wellness activities like Yoga apart from services already being provided for Maternal and Child Health including immunization and communicable diseases.The State wise Central Allocation under National Health Mission for the FY 2019-20 is at Annexure I. Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) was launched to provide cashless hospitalization facilities of up to Rs 5.00 Lakh per family per year to around 10.74 crores families (approx. 50 crore individuals) belonging to poor and vulnerable sections of the population. The salient features of the scheme are at Annexure II. The State/UT-wise details of funds released are at Annexure III.The Umbrella Scheme of Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi and Health Minister’s Discretionary Grant (HMDG) provides financial assistance to poor patients belonging to families living below threshold poverty line for treatment of major life threatening diseases such as Cancer, and that of kidney, liver, heart, Rare Diseases at Government hospitals.  Patients taking treatment in private hospitals are not eligible for assistance under the schemes and re-imbursement of expenditure already incurred on treatment is not permissible. While financial assistance upto a maximum of Rs.1,25,000/- is provided under HMDG to defray a part of the treatment cost, the maximum financial assistance provided under the Umbrella Scheme of RAN is Rs.15 lakh in each case.  Assistance under both the schemes is provided as one-time grant only.  Financial assistance under the schemes is released to the hospitals where eligible patients receive treatment, and not to States/UTs.  Funds allocated for the two schemes during the current financial year are as under: S.No.	Name of Scheme	Budget Allocation (Rs. in crore)1	Umbrella Scheme of Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi	200.002	Health Minister’s Discretionary Grant	6.00(c) & (d):      ‘Public Health & Hospitals’ being a State Subject, no data regarding nursing officers in various hospitals in the country is maintained centrally.
