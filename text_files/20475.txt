ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR) (a) to (c): Content telecast on private satellite TV channels is regulated in terms of Programme and Advertising Codes prescribed under Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 and Rules framed there under. 	It had come to the notice of the Ministry in February, 2020 that there was alleged violation of the Programme Code contained in Rule 5 of the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 while reporting on certain incidents on 25.02.2020 by two news channels. After giving a Show Cause Notice in the matter and taking into consideration their response, the Ministry issued order on 06.03.2020 to take the two channels off-air for 48 hours for violation of the Programme Code. Subsequently, on the basis of an unconditional apology by one of the channel, the off air order was curtailed to six hours. Further, keeping proportionate penalty in mind for similar violation, the off-air order for the second channel was curtailed to 14 hours. *********
