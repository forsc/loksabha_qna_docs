ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS(RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a)	to (c) The erstwhile Planning Commission approved/sanctioned project proposals received from State Governments under One Time Additional Central Assistance (OTACA)/ Special Plan Assistance (SPA) till 2014-2015 and then recommended to the Ministry of Finance for the release of funds. Subsequent to the establishment of NITI Aayog, the practice of approval/sanction of such project proposals has been discontinued from 2015-16 following the acceptance of recommendations of 14th Finance Commission for increased devolution to the States by way of enhancing the share of States in the divisible tax pool from 32% to 42% resulting in increased fund transfer to the States. NITI Aayog is the successor in interest to the Planning Commission. It is a think tank to the Government to provide critical directional and strategic input into the development process. Approval of Central/State projects is no longer under the purview of the NITI Aayog.******
