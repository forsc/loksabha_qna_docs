ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)   (a) and (b): During the Financial Year 2018-19, on an average approximately 2703 passengers travelled daily between Bhavnagar and Surat.	(c) to (f): Presently, 04 pairs of trains cater to the traffic between Bhavnagar and Surat.  Requests, including that from the Hon’ble Member of Parliament, have been received for   introduction of a train between Bhavnagar and Surat.  These have been examined, but owing to operational and resource constraints, introduction of additional train between Bhavnagar & Surat, has not been found feasible, at present.  However, introduction of trains is an on-going process on Indian Railways, subject to operational feasibility, resource availability, competing demands, etc.      *****
