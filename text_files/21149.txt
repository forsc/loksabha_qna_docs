(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):    As per the  Land use Statistics for the year 2016-17 (latest available), State-wise / UT-wise area of barren and unculturable land in the country is given at annexure.   (b) & (c):   Yes sir. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has developed location specific bio-engineering soil & water conservation measure, land management techniques, soil reclamation measures for saline, alkali, waterlogged and acid soils, selection of suitable crop including agroforestry interventions to reclaim and develop barren lands. While Indian Institute of Soil and Water Conservation (IISWC) has developed several location specific bio-engineering measures to check soil erosion due to run-off of rain water, Central Arid Zone Research Institute, Jodhpur has developed sand dune stabilization and shelter belt technology to check wind erosion. The Council through Central Soil Salinity Research Institute, Karnal and All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on Salt Affected Soils has developed reclamation technology, sub-surface drainage, bio-drainage, agroforestry interventions and salt tolerant crop varieties to improve the productivity of saline, sodic and waterlogged soils in the country. The ICAR also imparts training, organises Front Line Demonstrations (FLDs), etc. to educate farmers on all these aspects.      	   Further, Department of Land Resources (DoLR) implements Watershed Development Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (WDC-PMKSY) for development of rainfed/degraded lands. DoLR has sanctioned, 8214 watershed development projects covering an area of about 39.07 million hectare  in 28 States (except Goa)  (now 27 States and UTs of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh) during the period 2009-10 to 2014-15 under erstwhile Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP).
