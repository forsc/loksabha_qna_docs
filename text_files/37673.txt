                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL) (a) to (c) A Statement of reply is laid on the Table of the House. Statement referred to in the reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No.411 due for reply on 31/03/2022(a) to (c) Drinking water supply is a State subject. Water Supply/ Water & Sanitation/ Public Health Engineering Departments and/or parastatal organization of respective State Government/ UT Administration, are responsible for making provision of water supply and ensuring quality of water supplied in their respective State/UT.To make provision of potable tap water supply in adequate quantity, of prescribed quality and on regular & long-term basis to every rural household in the country by 2024, since August, 2019, Government of India in partnership with States/ UTs, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) – Har Ghar Jal.Under Jal Jeevan Mission, as per existing guidelines, IS 10500 is to be adopted for ensuring safe drinking water supply and States/ UTs have been advised to carry out water quality testing of drinking water sources on regular basis.To enable States/ UTs to test water samples for water quality, and for sample collection, reporting, monitoring and surveillance of drinking water sources, an online JJM – Water Quality Management Information System (WQMIS) portal has been developed, which is available in public domain on JJM Dashboard and can also be accessed at:https://neer.icmr.org.in/website/main.phpThis portal also provides automated alerts to concerned authorities in States/ UTs, if the water sample tested is contaminated, to initiate remedial actions. On this portal an individual can also register his sample and choose nearby water quality testing laboratory to get the water sample tested.To encourage water quality testing to ensure potable drinking water supply, States/ UTs have been advised to open water quality testing laboratories to general public at a nominal rate for testing of their water samples. States/UTs have also been advised to identify and train 5 persons preferably women in each village from local community viz. ASHA workers, health workers, VWSC members, teachers, etc. to conduct water quality tests using FTKs/ bacteriological vials at village level and report the same on the portal.There is no case reported regarding weakening of bones by States/ UTs due to use of chemical substances viz. alum, lime and chlorine in the process of cleaning of water in conventional water treatment plants.As informed by National Centre for Disease Control, an organization under Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, State/UT–wise, including Gujarat, details of number of cases of water–borne diseases during 2019, 2020 and 2021 is annexed.*****
