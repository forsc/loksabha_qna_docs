ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b) Under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS), in the current financial year 2021-22, the budget provision at Budget Estimate (BE) stage was Rs. 73,000 crore.  The Ministry had requested for additional budget allocation which has been enhanced to Rs. 98,000 crore at the Revised Estimate (RE) stage as per the requirement of funds. The Ministry seeks additional funds under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS from Ministry of Finance as and when required for meeting the demand for work on the ground.  (c)   No, Sir. (d)   Does not arise.(e)  Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) is a demand driven wage employment programme which provide for the enhancement of livelihood security of the households in rural areas of the country by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. It provides livelihood security, i.e. fall back options for livelihood for the rural households, when no better employment opportunity is available.There are two skill development programme for rural youth under DAY-NRLM, namely, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) and Rural Self Employment Training institutes (RSETIs). Both these programmes are aimed at increasing employability of rural youth, either for wage employment or self employment.Project ‘UNNATI’, launched in December 2019 by Government of India, is a skilling project that intends to upgrade the skill base of the Mahatma Gandhi NREGS workers, and thereby improve their livelihoods, so that they can move from the current partial employment to full employment. The Ministry of Rural Development has launched the Rural Mason Training (RMT) program under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) to address the issue of insufficient number of skilled masons for construction of quality PMAY-G houses. The initiative not only avails livelihood opportunities for the rural workforce but also contributes towards the availability of a skilled workforce for the construction of rural infrastructure under different schemes. The MoRD has partnered with the Construction Skill Development Council of India (CSDCI) and National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) in the implementation of the RMT program. *****
