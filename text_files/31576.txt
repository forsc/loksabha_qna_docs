ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE 			            		(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	and (b): i.	As on July, 2021 the total number of sanctioned posts in all Agricultural Universities (AUs) are 33686, out of which 12576 positions are vacant. ii.	As Agriculture including Agricultural Education is a State subject, filling up of the vacant positions in State Agriculture Universities (SAUs) fall under the purview of respective State Governments. iii.	However, time to time accreditation is carried out by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) through National Agricultural Education Accreditation Board, wherein it is stressed upon to fill the vacant positions for award of accreditation. iv.	For the filling up of vacancies related to Central Institute of Fisheries Education, Mumbai, a Deemed University, of ICAR, Government has already taken necessary steps.(c) to (e):	As per New Education Policy 2020, the professional councils, such as Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Veterinary Council of India (VCI), National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE), Council of Architecture (CoA), National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET) etc., will act as Professional Standard Setting Bodies (PSSBs). They will play a key role in the higher education system and will be invited to be members of the General Education Council (GEC). These bodies, after restructuring as PSSBs, will continue to draw the curricula, lay down academic standards and coordinate between teaching, research and extension of their domain/discipline, as members of the GEC. As members of the GEC, they would help in specifying the curriculum framework, within which Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) may prepare their own curricula. Thus, PSSBs would also set the standards or expectations in particular fields of learning and practice while having no regulatory role. All HEIs will decide how their educational programmes respond to these standards, among other considerations, and would also be able to reach out for support from these standard-setting bodies or PSSBs, if needed. In this context ICAR is responsible to oversee, regulate and facilitate agricultural education and research in the country.The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) under Department of Agricultural Research and Education (DARE), Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India is the apex body for co-ordinating, guiding and managing research and education in agriculture including horticulture, fisheries and animal sciences in the entire country.*******
