ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES (SHRI RAMESWAR TELI) (a) to (e):  No Sir, there is no such proposal pending with Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) for setting up a Food Park. M/s Industrial Development Corporation of Odisha (IDCO) had earlier submitted proposal to set up food park in 109.74 Acres of land in BhadrakDistrict, Odisha on 04.10.2016 against the  Expression of Interest (EOI) notice dated 31.07.2016 invited by the Ministry. The said proposal was not considered by the Ministry as para 5.1.6 of the Mega Food Park scheme guidelines dated 21.07.2016 stipulates that no second proposal will be considered for sanction from the same promoter (s) within two years of completion of already sanctioned project and Ministry had already accorded approval to M/s IDCO for Mega Food park at Deras, Odisha, which is still under implementation.  As the proposal was not approved by the Ministry, no provision has been made for allocation of funds for setting up the above said projects in the current financial year.  *****
