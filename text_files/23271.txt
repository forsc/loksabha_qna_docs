ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b) 	Yes, Sir. Digital Skills are crucial in the post Covid era to ensure skilling for the youth and also to address the requirements of Industrial Revolution 4.0. Directorate General of Training (DGT), under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) plays a key role in the implementation of long-term training schemes including training in the latest cutting edge technologies. DGT has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with IBM in June 2020 for Free Digital Learning Platform, “Skills Build Reignite”, to reach more job seekers and provide new resources to business owners in India. The Skills Build Reignite aims to provide job seekers and entrepreneurs, with access to free online coursework and mentoring support designed to help them reinvent their careers and businesses. Multi-faceted digital skill training in the area of Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence is provided to students and trainers across the country in the National Skill Training Institutes.	The National Skill Development Corporation, under MSDE, has created e-Skill India, a multi-lingual portal, providing e-skilling opportunities to the Indian youth. e-Skill India works collaboratively as an e-Learning aggregator portal by establishing strategic digital skilling partnerships with knowledge partners to bring best-in-class digital opportunities for the India youth under one roof. The portal has over 900 e-courses and more than 7.5 lakh enrolments. Majority of e-course on e-Skill India are offered for free. Likewise, the Bharat Skills portal, managed by DGT, is for pursuing long-term training through the digital mode.(c)	To develop the backbone necessary to support the integrated digital health infrastructure of the country, the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) was announced in August 2020. The country-wide digital health eco-system is intended to enable patients to store, access and consent to share their health records with doctors and health facilities of their choice. NDHM is being implemented presently in six Union Territories (Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu, Lakshadweep, Ladakh and Puducherry) on pilot basis.
