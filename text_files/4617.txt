ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a):  Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21-10-2016 to facilitate / stimulate regional air connectivity to currently underserved and unserved airports and making air travel affordable to the masses. Promoting affordability of regional air connectivity is envisioned under RCS - UDAN by supporting airline operators through (i) concessions by Central Government, State Governments and airport operators to reduce the cost of airline operations on regional routes and (ii) financial support (Viability Gap Funding) to meet the gap,if any, between the cost of airline operations and expected revenues on regional routes. RCS- UDAN is a market driven mechanism. Airlines undertake assessment of demand and nature of supply required on particular routes and participate in the transparent bidding process under  RCS- UDAN from time to time.;;(b): Except Goa, Mizoram, Chandigarh, Delhi, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Lakshadweep, 30 States and Union Territories have signed the tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Airports Authority of India for operationalization of RCS - UDAN flights in their respective States.;As per the provisions of RCS-UDAN, Gaya is a served airport and hence it is not covered under RCS-UDAN.
