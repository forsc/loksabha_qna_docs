ANSWER




                                                        Minister of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Jyotiraditya M. Scindia)(a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.Statement in reply to parts (a) to (d) of the Starred (*) Question No. 414 for answer on 31.03.2022 regarding ''Asset Monetization of Airports''(a):  As per National Monetization Pipeline (NMP), 25 Airports Authority of India (AAI) airports namely Bhubaneshwar, Varanasi, Amritsar, Trichy, Indore, Raipur, Calicut, Coimbatore, Nagpur, Patna, Madurai, Surat, Ranchi, Jodhpur, Chennai, Vijayawada, Vadodara, Bhopal, Tirupati, Hubli, Imphal, Agartala, Udaipur, Dehradun and Rajahmundry have been earmarked for asset monetization over the years 2022 to 2025. ;;; ; The Public Private Partnership (PPP) in airport infrastructure projects has brought efficiency in service delivery, expertise, enterprise and professionalism, apart from bringing the needed investments in the sector. Moreover, AAI is to get back its investment in these airports as upfront payment which can be used for development of airport infrastructure by AAI at Tier II and Tier III cities. Also, AAI is not required to incur any CAPEX and OPEX at these airports during the lease period. Once the Concession Period is over, all these airports, with all the upgraded infrastructure, will come back to AAI. (b) & (c):  AAI has identified 6 airports i.e. Bhubaneswar, Varanasi, Amritsar, Raipur, Indore and Trichy for operation, management and development of these airports under PPP.  AAI has also recommended for clubbing/pairing of 7 Smaller Airports with these 6 Airports, so that smaller airports also get developed simultaneously. Bids have not yet been called for the PPP process of these airports. (d):  The estimated income of the Government from monetisation of airports can only be ascertained once the bidding process starts.
