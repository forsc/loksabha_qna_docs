ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH ANDFAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR) (a) & (b)	ASHAs are envisaged to be community health volunteer and are only entitled to task/ activity based incentives. ASHAs receive a fixed monthly incentive of Rs. 2000 per month for undertaking routine and recurring activities.	The data regarding payment to each ASHA worker in the country for their work as frontline workers during the pandemic is not maintained centrally. However, in view of the significant contribution towards the COVID-19 pandemic related work by ASHAs, States were advised to pay an additional incentive of Rs.1000/- per month for those ASHAs engaged in COVID-19 related work using the resources of COVID-19 Health System Preparedness and Emergency Response Package. Provisions are also made for continued full payment of the existing Routine and Recurring Incentive of Rs. 2000 per month to ASHAs to ensure delivery of essential health services during the pandemic along with additional COVID-19 incentives for ASHAs.During the pandemic, States/UTs have also been asked to ensure provision of safety tools like masks, gloves, soaps and sanitizers etc. for ASHAs.Under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package, Insurance Scheme has been introduced for all health workers, including ASHAs. This insurance scheme provides an insurance cover of Rs. 50.00 Lakhs in-case of loss of life on account of COVID-19 related duty.
