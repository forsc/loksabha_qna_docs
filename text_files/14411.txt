ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                           (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) 	No, Sir. The Government of Assam has reported that no project/proposal has been submitted by them for the construction of flats/apartments for the BPL families. (b) 	Does not arise. (c) 	‘Land’ and ‘Colonisation’ are State subjects, therefore, it is the responsibility of State/Union Territory (UT) Governments to frame policies and implement schemes for providing houses to poor people. However, in pursuance to Government’s vision of ‘Housing for All by 2022’, the Government of India through the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has been implementing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) Mission since June 25, 2015 to provide Central Assistance to States/UTs for providing all weather pucca houses to all eligible urban households. The State/UT-wise details of projects approved along with Central Assistance and number of houses sanctioned under PMAY-U Mission are at Annexure. (d): 	The validated demand of housing under PMAY-U Mission is based on the demand survey undertaken by States/UTs for assessing the actual demand of housing. The validated demand for the entire Mission period is around 112.24 lakh houses and so far, 103.62 lakh houses have been sanctioned against the target set of 97.92 lakh houses up to the year 2019-20. The target achieved in terms of houses sanctioned is well ahead of the target set under PMAY-U Mission.                                                *****
