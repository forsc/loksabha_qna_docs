ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):	   Yes.  Every year December 5th is celebrated as World Soil Day (as per UN directives) and Soil health Card day on 19th February (launch date of Soil Health Card Programme) by Department of Agriculture, cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) and Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR). The major objective of World Soil Day is to promote awareness  about  crucial role of soil  in food security, climate change adaptation and mitigation, poverty alleviation, sustainable development. Soil Health Card day is intended to promote awareness among farmers about need for adoption of soil test based integrated nutrient management; to create awareness among public about the policy directives initiated for maintaining the soil health.     	    On 19th February 2020, Soil Health Card Day was organized at   NASC, Pusa, New Delhi; Hissar Agriculture University, Haryana and at ICAR – Regional Center for North East States, Barapani, Meghalaya on the occasion of successful completion of five years of Soil Health Card Scheme. Kisan Goshtis were organized at each of the above under the chairmanship of Hon’ble  Agriculture Minister and Ministers of State respectively. Farmers, State Governments, Fertiliser Companies, Scientists etc.  attended these Ghosties. (d):	    Soil Health Card Scheme was launched since 2014-15 for assisting State Governments to test farm soils and issue soil health cards to all farmers in the country. Soil health card provides information to farmers on nutrient status of their soil along with recommendations on crop specific appropriate dosage of nutrients to be applied for improving soil health and fertility. Soil status is assessed for 12 parameters regularly every 2 years so that nutrient deficiencies are identified and corrective steps taken.     	   During the current financial year (2019-20)  a pilot project ‘Development of Model Villages’ has been taken up where soil samples collection has been taken up at individual farm holding with farmers participation instead of sample collection in grids.  One village in each block has been selected by the States for implementation of the pilot project.  (e):	  The details of the expenditure under the Soil Health Card Scheme, State/UT-wise is given at Annexure. (f):   	  During the second cycle-II (2017-19), 11.75 crore farmers were benefited/distributed soil health cards.
