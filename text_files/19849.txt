ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) to (e): The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme is being implemented by the Government for issue of KCC to farmers. The scheme aims at providing adequate and timely credit support from the banking system under a single window with flexible and simplified procedure to the farmers to meet their short term credit requirements for cultivation of crops, investment credit requirement for agriculture and allied activities and other related needs.Bank-wise details of total agricultural balance outstanding in respect of Scheduled Commercial Banks as on 31.03.2020 are provided in the Annexure to this reply.Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has deregulated the interest rate on advances sanctioned by Scheduled Commercial Banks and these interest rates are determined by banks with the approval of their respective Board of Directors, subject to the regulatory guidelines on interest rate on advances contained in RBI’s Master Direction dated 03.03.2016. Interest rates on loans could vary from time to time and are based on credit profile of the borrowers. Government of India implements an interest subvention scheme under which short term crop loans up to Rs. 3.00 lakh are provided to farmers at a reduced interest rate of 7% p.a.  Besides, additional 3% incentive is given to the farmers for prompt repayment of the loan, thereby reducing the effective rate of interest to 4%. The Government/RBI has taken the following initiatives to meet the financial requirement of farmers:?	The Priority Sector Lending (PSL) directions of RBI mandate all Domestic Scheduled Commercial Banks to earmark 18% of their Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) or Credit Equivalent amount of Off-Balance Sheet Exposure (CEOBE), whichever is higher, as on the corresponding date of the previous year, for lending to Agriculture including loans to farmers. Further, a sub-target of 10% for small and marginal farmers has also been fixed. The target for lending to small and marginal farmers shall be revised upwards from 10% to 12% in phased manner from FY 2021-22 to 2023-24.?	Under the KCC Scheme, a flexible limit of Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 50,000 has been provided to marginal farmers (as Flexi KCC), based on the land holding and crops grown including post harvest warehouse storage related credit needs and other farm expenses, consumption needs, etc., plus small term loan investments without relating it to the value of land.?	The benefits of KCC along with interest subvention have been extended to Animal Husbandry and Fisheries farmers.?	To enhance coverage of small and marginal farmers in the formal credit system, RBI has decided to raise the limit for collateral-free agriculture loans from Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 1.6 lakh.?	The requirement of ''no due’ certificate has also been dispensed with for small loans up to Rs. 50,000 to small and marginal farmers, share-croppers and the like and, instead, only a self-declaration from the borrower is required.?	To bring small, marginal, tenant farmers, oral lessees, etc. into the fold of institutional credit, Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) have been promoted by banks.******
