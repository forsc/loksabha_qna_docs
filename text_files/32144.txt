ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCESH. PANKAJ CHOUDHARY(a to d) : Certain references have been received from industry and other stakeholders for review of rate structure in textiles so as to remedy the anomaly of rate and to correct inverted rate structure. These suggestions include representations seeking 5%/12% rate at various stages of textile chain. GST rates are prescribed only on the recommendation of GST Council, which consists of Union Finance Minister and Ministers as nominated by state governments. In the 45th meeting of GST Council, held on 17th September, 2021, the Council recommended a uniform GST rate of 12% on all fabrics and garments, to be made effective from 1st January, 2022.*****
