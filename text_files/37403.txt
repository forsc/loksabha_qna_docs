ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) to (d): A multi-disciplinary team from Airports Authority of India (AAI), Indian Air Force and Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had visited sites at Turtuk (Nubra valley), Diskit (Nubra Tehsil), Nyoma, Padum/Zanskar, Wakha and Kargil in the year 2021 for examining feasibility of these sites for construction of airstrips. However, none of the sites was found suitable for construction of airstrips as none meets the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) provisions or DGCA guidelines for designing of Runway and Instrument Approach & Landing considering normal air operations. However, an expert team from ICAO in collaboration with the officers of AAI has been assigned the task of carrying out the feasibility study for commercial operations at the existing Kargil airport which is under Ministry of Defence (Indian Air Force). (e): Ministry of Civil Aviation launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21-10-2016 to stimulate regional air connectivity and make air travel affordable for the masses. AAI, the Implementing Agency, has identified and awarded one airport in Ladakh namely Thoise, for up-gradation and operation of RCS flights under UDAN. Further, Airports / airstrips situated in Ladakh inter-alia are defined as priority areas; (f): Till the completion of four rounds of bidding conducted under UDAN, none of the airline bidders has submitted a proposal to operate a heliport route in Ladakh.******
