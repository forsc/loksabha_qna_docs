ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) to (c) As per extant guidelines dated 18.05.2017 on Rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has granted  general  permission  to domestic  Scheduled  Commercial  Banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks) to  open banking outlets  at  any place  in the country, without  seeking  prior  approval of  RBI  in  each  case, subject  to at least  25 percent  of the total  number  of  banking outlets  opened  during a  financial  year being in  unbanked  rural centres i.e. centres having population less than 10,000 (Tier 5 and Tier 6 centres).In pursuance of RBI guidelines, rolling out of banking outlets in uncovered areas is a continuous process looked after by the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), in consultation with the concerned State Government, member banks and other stakeholders. Banks, inter-alia, consider proposals for opening banking outlets in the light of RBI’s instructions, their business plans and their commercial viability. To further assess the viability for opening a banking outlet, banks carry out survey as required.To ensure availability of banking outlet (Bank branch / Business Correspondent), within5 kilometers of all inhabited villages, the Government has launched a Geographic Information System (GIS) based app., namely, Jan Dhan Darshak App (JDD App) developed by National Informatics Centre (NIC). Banks upload the GIS location of their branches, Business Correspondents (BCs) and Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) on the app.As per JDD App data, no Gram Panchayat (GP) of Odisha is uncovered since all have banking outlets (Bank Branch/BC/IPPB Centre) within the radius of 5 kms. However, as informed by SLBC, Odisha, and as per the JDD app data uploaded by the banks, as on 05.08.2021, there are only 13 villages in 11 GPs in Odisha State which are not having a banking touchpoint/outlet.Further, all villages in Dhenkanal and Angul districts are covered by banking touchpoint/outlet within a 5 km distance. Thus, all GPs in these two districts are covered by banking touchpoints/outlets.*****
