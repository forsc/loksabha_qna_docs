                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)  No. The Government  is  not planning  to  make changes in organ donation or transplantation policy.(b) and (c) Public health and hospitals being State subjects come under the purview of State Government. However, National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO) has been set up as an apex level organisation under Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for carrying out functions of National Human Organs and Tissues Removal and Storage Network as specified under Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994 (as amended in 2011). There is no mandate given in the Act to the Central Government to override the powers of the State Appropriate Authority.(d)  The Government  has taken several steps for promoting organ  donation  among  the  citizens  through  various means of communication viz, setting up a website of NOTTO, (www.notto.gov.in)  which contains information on awareness and other activities relating to organ donation and a 24x7 call centre with a toll free helpline number 1800114770 . Besides NOTTO, ‘Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisations (ROTTOs)’ and ‘State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisations (SOTTOs)’also carry out awareness activities. Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities such as celebration of Indian Organ Donation Day, seminars, workshops, debates, poster competitions, walkathons, organ donation pledging campaigns, putting up display boards outside Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and other strategic locations in the transplant/retrieval hospitals etc. are organized in different places in the country to disseminate information and increase awareness on organ donation. Awareness messages are also disseminated through audio visuals, print and social media from time to time by the aforesaid organisations.
