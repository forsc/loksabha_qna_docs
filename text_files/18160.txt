State-wise details of contamination of ground water are given at Annexure.(d)  	Water being State subject, initiatives on water management including taking corrective action related to ground water quality in the country is primarily States’ responsibility. However, the important measures taken by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in this regard are as under:• 	CPCB in association with State Pollution Control Boards/Pollution Control Committees (SPCBs/PCCs) is implementing the provisions of The Water (Prevention & Control) Act, 1974 & The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to prevent and control of aquatic resources from pollution.• 	Establishment of Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) for cluster of Small Scale Industries.• 	With respect to industrial effluents, consent management for compliance of standards is being enforced  by SPCBs/PCCs to improve the water quality of the rivers.Contd...P/2//2//Further, Central Government supplements the efforts of States by providing financial and technical assistance to States/UTs. It is the States that plan, design, approve, implement, operate and maintain water supply schemes.To enable every rural household in the country to have potable water at service level of 55 litre per capita per day (lpcd) through Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC) by 2024, Government of India, in partnership with the States, has launched Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) with an estimated cost of Rs. 3.60 lakh Crores.
