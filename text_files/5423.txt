ANSWER




                                                        (a): 	No State Government/Union Territory Administration has reported any incident of death due to starvation in the country so far. A few reports have of-late appeared in the media alleging starvation deaths in some states, but on enquiry, the allegations of death due to starvation have not been substantiated.(b) & (c): 	The Government of India accords high priority to the issue of hunger and has been providing foodgrains at highly subsidized prices to the targeted population through State Governments/Union Territory Administrations under the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) in accordance with the provisions of National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013 and Other Welfare Schemes (OWS)...........2/--2-	NFSA provides for coverage of upto 75% of the rural population and upto 50% of the urban population for receiving foodgrains under TPDS, thus covering about two-thirds of the population of the country for receiving foodgrains @ Rs 1/2/3 per kg for nutri-cereals/wheat/rice respectively. Identification of beneficiaries under the Act is under two categories- households covered under Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and Priority Households (PHH), within the coverage determined for the State/UT. While Priority Households are entitled to receive 5 kg per person per month, AAY households, which constitute the poorest of the poor, continue to receive 35 Kg of foodgrains per household per month. At present, the Act is being implemented in all the States/UTs covering about 80 crore persons to get highly subsidized foodgrains. During the year 2018-19, the Government allocated a quantity of 612.18 lakh MT of foodgrains to the States/UTs under NFSA, Other Welfare Schemes and allocations due to natural calamities and festivals.Government of India has issued advisories to all States/UTs to identify and cover the weakest sections of the society under PDS and launch special drives to issue ration cards to them. Clear Instructions have been issued to all State/UTs that no person/household shall be deleted from the list of eligible households and denied of subsidized foodgrains or cash transfer under NFSA only on the grounds of not possessing Aadhaar. Instructions are also issued for providing foodgrains even in the event of authentication failure through alternative mechanisms.Further, advisories have also been issued by the Government of India to States/UTs to put in place special dispensation that includes home delivery of the entitled quota of foodgrains and delivery through authorized nominees in respect of beneficiaries who are above 65 years of age or who are differently-abled and have no other adult family member listed in the Ration Card and are not in a position to visit Fair Price Shop themselves.***
