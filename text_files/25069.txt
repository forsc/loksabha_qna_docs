Some of them are as under:• Coverage of Vocational Education has been expanded to cover Government aided schools also in addition to Government Schools.• The provision for Hub and Spoke Model has been made with the aim to utilize the infrastructure available in the Hub Schools or Industrial Training Institutes (ITI) by the students of nearby schools (spoke schools) for vocational training.• Exposure of pre-vocational education at Upper Primary level, internships, bagless days etc have been included under Innovation component of Samagra Shiksha.In addition, a number of initiatives have been taken to implement skilling in schools, some of which are as under:• Directorate General of Training under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MoSDE) has initiated a pilot on Hub and Spoke model of vocational education in eight districts of four States.• CBSE is working in association with NCVET and various SSCs under MoSDE to offer appropriate Grade wise skill education from Class VI onwards.• CBSE has introduced new age skill modules, i.e., Financial literacy, Artificial Intelligence, Design thinking, Coding, Data Science (class 8 only) alongwith Handicrafts for Classes VI to VIII. CBSE has also introduced a skill course ‘Data Science’ for Classes IX to XII.• A module on pre-vocational Education has been developed by Pandit Sunderlal Sharma Central Institute of Vocational Education (PSSCIVE) for National Initiative for School Heads’ and Teachers’ Holistic Advancement (NISHTHA) and it is being utilized for the training of Teachers. 60 online modules have been developed as part of NISHTHA training including those on vocational areas.• A working paper on Vocational Education in Schools has been developed by Pandit Sunderlal Sharma Central Institute of Vocational Education (PSSCIVE) for providing inputs to the National Curriculum Framework on School Education (NCFSE).• NIOS has developed Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in 08 vocational courses which are offered online through SWAYAM Platform.• CBSE has conducted multiple virtual awareness workshops with different Sector Skill Councils (SSCs) and industries to promote skilling in schools.

CBSE has signed MoU with the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) on 15th June, 2021 for a study on skilling in schools and to provide appropriate advice to CBSE on research findings to implement NEP-2020 on skilling in schools. The MoU envisages the following: • Preparation of a report on the status and problems with existing project of Skilling in CBSE schools, in first phase. • Identification of steps and measures to overcome the constraints and strengthen the positive factors identified in first phase to make the skilling programmes in CBSE schools more effective in meeting their goals.
