MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a)& (b): Yes Sir. In view of the large number of vacant seats in various programs and the likely future demand, All India Council for Technical Education(AICTE) will not accept fresh applications for setting up new Engineering institutions till 2022. However, AICTE is giving approval to new engineering colleges only in emerging areas in aspiring districts. Approval is also given to institutes where engineering is added as new programme in emerging areas. In addition, approval is also given if any State Government wishes to start engineering degree/ diploma programme in highly employable vocational disciplines.(c): The details of the number of seats surrendered by Private Colleges/ Government Colleges or cancelled by AICTE in the last three years is as under:Academic Year2019-202020-212021-22Intake reduced by the institute + closure of course/ instituteIn Private Institutions (A)106,322201,91713,937In Government Institutions (B)6,39114,909120,934Total A + B = (C)112,713216,826134,871AICTE cancelled seats (D)73,53113,12911,816Total C + D = (E)186,244229,955146,687(d) In order to provide quality education to engineering students, AICTE has introduced a number of measures to provide a thrust to improve quality of technical education in the country.
