ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND EARTH SCIENCES(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a)	Yes.  CSIR Floriculture Mission has been approved for implementation from financial year 2020-2021 by its constituent laboratories CSIR-National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI), Lucknow; CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bio-Resource Technology (IHBT), Palampur; CSIR-North East Institute of Science and Technology (NEIST), Jorhat; CSIR-Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), Mysuru and CSIR-Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (IIIM), Jammu. Significance of the Mission: India has diverse agro-climatic and edaphic conditions, and rich plant diversity,  however it shares only 0.6% of global floriculture market. At least 1200 million USD worth of floriculture products are being imported by India every year from different countries. Floriculture has the potential to provide employment to a large number of people through nursery raising, floriculture farming, and entrepreneurship development for nursery trade, value addition and export to enhance farmers’ income, achieve import substitution, generate employment and promote entrepreneurship. The CSIR Floriculture Mission has been developed for implementation in different States and Union Territories of India. Through Floriculture Mission of CSIR, agro-technologies, new varieties and value addition technologies available with the CSIR institutions, efforts are being made to take these to farmers and entrepreneurs and help them in increasing their income significantly. (b)	In CSIR laboratories, available land can be utilized for showcasing the model to locals for popularising the floriculture in the country. (c)	In the initial process of implementation of the project, horticulture department of 21 States and Union Territories have been contacted for their cooperation and support in implementation of the project. (d)	CSIR has been developing new floral varieties and several value addition technologies since 1953. Through Floriculture Mission; agro-technologies, new varieties and value addition technologies available with CSIR institutions will be provided to Indian farmers and industry in order to help them to reposition themselves to meet the import requirements. (e)	Yes. The portal can be accessed at https://innovateindia.mygov.in/csir-societal-platform/. The expectations of the society from scientists are ever growing and rightly so given the transformative power of S&T. CSIR is committed to utilize its scientific strength and meet the expectations of the country. While India has made commendable progress thus far, there are still many challenges facing the country which could be solved through S&T interventions. CSIR would like to identify such problems / challenges and find a solution. This portal is the first step in that direction to seek inputs on challenges and problems from different stake holders in society.                                               *****
