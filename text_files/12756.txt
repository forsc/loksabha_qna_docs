ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b)	Mallah, Kewat, Bhoi, Dhimar etc. as mentioned sub-groups of Manjhi community have not been notified as Scheduled Caste in relation to State of Madhya Pradesh.(c)	Anthropological Survey of India never recognized Mallah, Kewat, Bhoi, Dhimar as sub-groups of Manjhi Community in Madhya Pradesh. Moreover, regarding Majhi Community, according to the book “India’s Communities, People of India, National Series, Volume V” 1998, in the page number 2110, published by Anthropological Survey of India, it was stated that “they have no sub-groups but have synonyms like Mallah, Kewat and Nabik”.(d)	The Government of India on 15.6.1999 (further amended on 25.6.2002), has laid down the modalities for determining the claims for inclusion in, exclusion from and other modifications in the Orders specifying list of Scheduled Tribes. According to these modalities, only those proposals which have been recommended and justified by the concerned State Government/ Union Territory Administration and concurred with by the Registrar General of India (RGI) and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes are to be considered for amendment of legislation. All actions on the proposal are taken as per these approved modalities.*****
