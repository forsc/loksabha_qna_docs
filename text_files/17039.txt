As far as various committees concerning conservation of forests are concerned, it is stated that;i.Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and rules made thereunder, provide for statutory committees such as Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) and Regional Empowered Committees (REC), which, inter alia, examine and deliberate on proposals for non-forestry use of forest land and their recommendation to Government of India.ii.	The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 provides for Standing Committee of the National Board for Wildlife (SCNBWL) to examine proposals for regulation of proposed use of any land within Protected Areas (National Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries etc) which is not ancillary to conservation of wildlife.iii.	The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has adopted National Working Plan Code, 2014 for sustainable management of forests and biodiversity in India. The code provides for preparation of working plans for the forests, which are prepared by the Standing Consultative Committees (headed by PCCF of the concerned state and has head of Regional Office of MoEF&CC as one of the members). In addition, there are also committees in the forest fringe areas for Joint Forest Management, with an aim of partnering with Government for conservation of forest and forest resources.There is no specific budget head for incurring expenditure for maintenance of these committees. ***
