                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b)  Total water requirement of the country for different uses for high demand scenario for the years 2025 and 2050, as assessed by National Commission on Integrated Water Resources Development in 1999, constituted by erstwhile Ministry of Water Resources, is given below: S. No.	Uses	Water Demand by 2025(in BCM)	Water Demand by 2050(in BCM)1	Irrigation	611	8072	Domestic	62	1113	Industries	67	814	Power	33	705	Others	70	111	Total	8431180           The average annual water availability in the Country has been assessed as 1999.20 BCM.  However, due to various factor, the entire quantum of available water is not utilizable.  The average annual water availability in the country, river basin-wise, as assessed by Central Water Commission, is given at Annexure-I.(c) & (d) Water being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation and efficient management of water resources are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments. Central Government supplements the efforts of the State Governments through various schemes and programme.             Ministry of Jal Shakti has launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) - a campaign for water conservation and water security. During the campaign, officers, groundwater experts and scientists from the Government of India will work together with State and district officials in India’s most water-stressed districts for water conservation and water resource management.  Contd…P/2//2//            A meeting of the State Ministers of Water Resources and Water Supply chaired by Minister of Jal Shakti was held on 11th June 2019 to review the steps taken by various States on water conservation and the implementation of action plans to deal with the water supply situation, plan for water harvesting and conservation in convergence with other programmes. State Governments were requested to complete water conservation measures so that large-scale rain water harvesting could be possible in the upcoming monsoon season.            Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), Ministry of Jal Shakti, has prepared a conceptual document titled “Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Ground Water – 2013” which provides information about area-specific artificial recharge techniques to augment ground water resources. The Master Plan has been circulated to the State Governments for implementation.          Further, Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has issued directives to all States/UTs to take measures to promote artificial recharge of ground water / rain water harvesting.       An ‘Inter-Ministerial Committee’ under the Chairmanship of Secretary (WR, RD & GR) has been constituted to take forward the subject of ‘Push on water conservation related activities for optimum utilization of monsoon rainfall’.           Department of Land Resources (DoLR), Ministry of Rural Development, has sanctioned 8214 watershed development projects in 28 States during the period 2009-10 to 2014-15 covering an area of about 39.07 million hectare under Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP). IWMP was amalgamated as the Watershed Development Component (WDC) of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) in 2015-16. The activities being undertaken through the watershed development projects inter alia include soil and moisture conservation, rain water harvesting, etc. The State wise details of projects sanctioned, area covered by the projects and funds released as Central share to States under WDC-PMKSY are given at Annexure-II.           Government of India has launched Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) on 25th June, 2015 in select 500 cities across the country for a period of five years i.e. from 2015-16 to 2019-20 with focus on development of basic civic amenities in the Mission cities. Under the water supply component of the Mission, projects related to rain water harvesting, rejuvenation of water bodies specifically for drinking water supply, recharging of ground water, etc., can be taken up by the States/UTs to enhance water supply in the Mission cities.            AMRUT guidelines incentivizes States/UTs for implementing reforms in the Mission cities. One of the key reform is adopting Model Building Bye-laws (MBBL) by the State and one of its milestone is “State to formulate a policy and action plan for having Rain water harvesting structures in all commercial, public buildings and new buildings on plots of 300 sq. meters and above”.            Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs (MOH&UA) has taken measures aimed at water conservation like issuance of guidelines for Urban Regional Development Plan Formulation and Implementation (URDPFI) and Model Building Bye-Laws (MBBL) for the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and Urban Development Authorities (UDAs) to implement rain water harvesting and take other water conservation measures. Till date, 33 States/UTs out of 36 States/UTs have amended their Building Bye Laws (BBLs) or issued guidelines in this regard. ***** Annexure-IAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) & (b) of Unstarred Question No. 5298 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 25.07.2019 regarding “Availability of Water”.Basin-wise Details of Average Annual Water Availability in IndiaS.No.	River Basin	Catchment area (sq.km)	Average Water Resources Potential (BCM)1	Indus	317708	45.532	Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna			(a) Ganga	838803	509.52	(b) Brahmaputra	193252	527.28	(c) Barak & others	86,335	86.673	Godavari	312150	117.744	Krishna	259439	89.045	Cauvery	85167	27.676	Subarnarekha	26804	15.057	Brahmani-Baitarani	53902	35.658	Mahanadi	144905	73.009	Pennar	54905	11.0210	Mahi	39566	14.9611	Sabarmati	31901	12.9612	Narmada	96659.79	58.2113	Tapi	65805.80	26.2414	West Flowing Rivers from Tapi to Tadri	58360	118.3515	West Flowing Rivers from Tadri to Kanyakumari	54231	119.0616	East Flowing Rivers between Mahanadi and Pennar	82073	26.4117	East Flowing Rivers between Pennar & Kanyakumari	101657	26.7418	West Flowing Rivers of Kutch and Saurashtra including Luni	192112	26.9319	Area of Inland Drainage in Rajasthan	144835.90	Negl.20	Minor Rivers draining into Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh	31382	31.17	Total	3271953	1999.20Source: Reassessment of Water Availability in India using Space Inputs, June 2019 Annexure-IIAnnexure referred to in reply to part (c) & (d) of Unstarred Question No. 5298 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 25.07.2019 regarding “Availability of Water”.State-wise details of number of projects sanctioned, area covered by the projects and funds released as Central share under WDC-PMKSY      (Area in million ha, Amount in Rs. crore)Sl.
