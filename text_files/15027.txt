ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????         (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	Yes, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) under its flagship program of National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) has screened large number of indigenous crop varieties including local germplasm and improved crop varieties of pulses (black gram, green gram, pigeonpea, chickpea) and cereals (rice, wheat, etc.) for major abiotic stresses like drought and heat to identify superior cultivars for cultivation on farmers’ fields.  The details of varieties developed, their yield potentials vis-à-vis special traits and suitable areas for cultivation are given in Annexure – 1.(b)	As part of the Technology Demonstration Component (TDC) of the NICRA, awareness programs are taken up in drought and flood impacted districts. A total of 8866 awareness programs were conducted on drought involving 1,71,790 farmers and 2131 programs were taken up on flood awareness involving 43,756 farmers. Further, the ICAR has established a network of 717 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) at the district level in the country mandated technology assessment and demonstration for its application and capacity development.  During 2018-19, 42,361 on farm trials (OFTs) for assessing technologies and 2,74,736 frontline demonstrations (FLDs) on various technologies were conducted.  To update the knowledge and skills, 47,000 trainings were organised benefiting 13.51 lakh farmers and farm women.(c)	Government has introduced yield based Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and weather index based Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS) from Kharif 2016 to provide financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of natural calamities, adverse weather incidence and to stabilize the income of farmers etc.   Under PMFBY, immediate relief is also provided to insured farmers in case of adverse seasonal conditions during the crop season due to which expected yield during the season is likely to be less than 50% of the Threshold Yield in the concerned insurance unit.The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) was launched during the year 2015-16 with the objective of ‘Har Khet Ko Paani’ for providing end-to-end solutions in irrigation supply chain, viz. water sources, distribution network and farm level applications. One of the components under PMKSY is watershed development which is exclusively for providing irrigation support to farmers affected by unexpected drought.*******
