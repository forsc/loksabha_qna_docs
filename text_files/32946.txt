ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) and (b) Water resources projects are planned, funded, executed, and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priorities. Role of Government of India is limited to providing technical support and, in some cases, partial financial assistance under the existing schemes implemented by the Ministry of Jal Shakti.  However, major & medium irrigation and multi-purpose projects located on inter-state rivers, as well as flood control projects, are appraised for techno-economic viability in Central Water Commission (CWC) under this Ministry. After appraisal, the viable projects are put up for acceptance before the Advisory Committee on Irrigation, Flood Control & Multipurpose Projects of Ministry of Jal Shakti (Advisory Committee).  During 2018-19 to 2020-21, total 57 nos. of projects have been accepted by the Advisory Committee, as per details at Annexure-I.(c) This Ministry is providing financial assistance to dams and water resources projects under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY). PMKSY is an umbrella scheme, consisting of two major components, namely, Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP), and Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP) implemented by Ministry of Jal Shakti. HKKP, in turn, consists of four sub-components, namely, Command Area Development and Water Management (CAD&WM), Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI), Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies, and Ground Water (GW) Development component. In addition, PMKSY also consists of two components - (i) Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) component implemented by Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare & (ii) Watershed Development component (WDC) implemented by Department of Land Resources (DoLR). Apart from the above, since August, 2019, Government of India in partnership with States, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) after subsuming the then National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), for successful implementation of drinking water projects in rural areas. Quantum of funds sanctioned toward central assistance (CA) under each of the above categories during last three years, particularly for Gujarat, are tabulated below.
