In the eventuality of notified calamities, State Government is empowered to undertake necessary relief measures from State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), which is readily available with the State. For calamity of severe nature, additional financial assistance, over and above SDRF, is considered from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), in accordance with items and norms of assistance, upon receipt of Memorandum from the State Government. As per the ‘Manual for Drought Management, 2016’, the State can declare Kharif drought by 31st October. So far, Government of Uttar Pradesh has not submitted any Memorandum for drought during Kharif Season 2019, seeking financial assistance from the NDRF.*********
