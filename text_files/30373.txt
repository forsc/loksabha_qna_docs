ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI  R.K.

Talcher Kaniha, having a capacity of 3000 MW (6x500 MW) is in service and there are no plans to shut down the plant.	The operations of more than 54 year old Talcher Thermal Power Station with capacity of 460 MW (4x60 MW and 2x110 MW) have been stopped w.e.f. 31.03.2021 in view of safety, efficiency and environment considerations. Ministry of Labour & Employment, Government of India accorded approval of closure with effect from 20.08.2021 under Industrial Disputes (ID) Act 1947.	Generation is a de-licensed activity and as per Section 7 of the Electricity Act, 2003, “any generating company may establish, operate and maintain a generating station without obtaining a license/permission under this Act, if it complies with the technical standards relating to connectivity with the grid”. Accordingly, sanction/approval of the Government is not required for setting up of thermal power plants.*******
