ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b)   The Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) being implemented with effect from 1st April, 2016 aims to provide “Housing for all” through provision of pucca houses with basic amenities to all houseless households and households living in kutcha and dilapidated houses in rural areas and the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U) has been implemented since 25.06.2015 for providing assistance to States/ Union Territories (UTs) for addressing the housing shortage of the eligible people in urban areas by the year 2022.   	Under PMAY-G, a total of 116.61 lakh houses have been allocated for completion during the last three years, out of which 97.62 lakh houses have been completed by the States/UTs, which is 83.71% of the total targets.  Under PMAY-U, States/UTs have undertaken demand survey for assessing actual demand of housing under the Scheme.  The assessed demand reported by States/UTs is around 112 lakhs.  A total of 111 lakh houses have so far been sanctioned, Out of this, 73.5 lakh are at various stages of construction and 43.2 lakh have been completed/ delivered which is 38.57% of the total targets.  The delay in completion of houses is due to cases of unwillingness of beneficiary, migration, death of beneficiaries without legal heir, delay in allotment of land to landless beneficiaries by the States/UTs in rural areas, Covid-19 pandemic and General/Assembly/Panchayat elections.(c)	States/UTs have been requested to expedite the completion of houses approved under PMAY.  Other steps to expedite the completion of houses include timely allocation of targets to the States/UTs under PMAY-G, provision of adequate funds and promotion of eco-friendly and innovative technologies for house construction, provision of land to landless beneficiaries in rural areas,  regular review of progress at the level of Secretary/Additional Secretary/Deputy DG, Ministry of Rural Development and separate review of States/UTs with high target, poor performing States/UTs and delayed houses in States/UTs.   ******
