                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) and (b): Pension of pensioners of nationalised banks is financed by the respective bank out of its commercially generated revenues. Such pension was introduced as a funded scheme on the basis of consensus arrived at between bank employee unions/associations and the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA), which negotiated on behalf of participating banks. The Boards of the respective nationalised bank accordingly made Employees’ Pension Regulations in exercise of their powers under section 19 of the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970/1980. IBA has recently (on 25.1.2021) recommended that family pension be improved to 30% for all employees without any cap, and the said recommendation is under consideration of the Government.(c): No proposal regarding implementation of One Rank One Pension is currently under consideration of the Government. (d): Does not arise.***
