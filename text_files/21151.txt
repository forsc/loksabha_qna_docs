ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER of AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????             (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) &(b):	 With a view to promote agricultural export a comprehensive Agriculture Export Policy (AEP), 2018 has been unveiled to focus on growth of export of agro products from the country. An inter-ministerial institutional mechanism representing DAC&FW and DoC has been set up to discuss issues critical to promote/increase agri-trade and suggest appropriate policy measures. Agri cells have been opened in 15 countries to examine various trade aspects in their geographical jurisdiction and provide inputs on Market Access Issues, Grievances/Requests from Indian Agri Exporters on Logistics, SPS measures, Market Trends, preferred varieties, quality issues etc..Product specific Export Promotion Forums (EPF) for eight high potential agri products i.e. Grapes, Mango, Banana, Onion, Rice, Nutri-Cereals, Pomegranate, Floriculture& Plant material have been created at the insistence of Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) under the auspices of APEDA which will work on promoting the export of identified products in a focused manner. Further, subsidy is being extended under Operation Greens scheme of MoFPI for transportation of fruits and vegetable through Kisan Rail. Indian Railway are providing the transport subsidy directly to any applicants by way of charging 50% of their freight charges from them for transportation. Besides, DoC also administers Transport and Marketing Assistance (TMA) for Specified Agriculture Products for providing assistance for the international component of freight to mitigate the freight disadvantage for the export of agriculture products and assistance for the marketing of agricultural produces which is likely to result in higher exports of agriculture products in overseas markets.(c) &(d):	The details relating to the export of Rabi and Kharif crops during the last five years are at Annexure-I. The data indicates that there has been increase in export of Rabi and Kharif crops.
