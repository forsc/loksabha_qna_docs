ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): Operations of foreign airlines are governed by bilateral Air Services Agreement (ASA) between India and the respective country (which has designated the airline). Any designated foreign airline can operate to/from a point (airport) in India if it is designated as a point of call in the ASA. Presently, Amritsar is available as a point of call to the designated carriers of Afghanistan, Armenia, Austria, Iran, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Qatar, Russia, the Slovak Republic, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.;Grant of point of call depends upon the principle of reciprocity and balance of benefits. At present, the Government of India follows a policy of promoting more international operations by Indian carriers from non-metro points either directly or through their own hub & spoke operations. Accordingly, to support the Indian carriers, the points other than metros are not being granted as points of call to foreign countries so that the hubs may be created within India and not outside of India. However, Indian carriers are free to operate from non-metro airports as well.;
