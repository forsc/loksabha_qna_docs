NW-1 is already operational for cargo and passenger transportation.  To further augment the navigation capacity on the Haldia-Varanasi stretch of NW-1, Inland Waterways Authority of India is implementing the Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) at an estimated cost of Rs.5369 crore.  Under JMVP, various sub-projects worth Rs.1800 crore (approx.) have commenced on the ground in a time period of three years after statutory clearances.          A Detailed Project Report (DPR) of NW-110 (River Yamuna) has been taken up to assess the techno-economic feasibility of navigation.                                                     *****
