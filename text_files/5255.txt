The scheme provides for payment of a minimum fixed pension of Rs.3,000/- per month to the eligible farmers on attaining the age of 60 years.  Small and Marginal Farmers in the age group of 18 to 40 years can subscribe the Scheme.  It is a voluntary and contribution based pension scheme, with equal contributions by the subscribing farmers as well as the Central Government, to be credited into a pension fund to managed by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC).The salient features of the Scheme have already been circulated to all States/UTs by letter dated 5th July, 2019 of Secretary (Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare) requesting them to take necessary action for sensitizing all the stakeholders, including the State Nodal Officers (SNOs) under the PM-Kisan Scheme, as also to put in place an effective implementation mechanism for maximum enrolment of the beneficiaries under the scheme.******
