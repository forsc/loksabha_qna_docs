The Law Commission, in its 229th Report had also suggested that a Constitutional Bench be set up at Delhi and four Cassation Benches be set up in the Northern region at Delhi, the Southern region at Chennai/Hyderabad, the Eastern region at Kolkata and the Western region at Mumbai. The idea of a separate Bench of Supreme Court outside Delhi has not found favour with the Supreme Court of India.  ****
