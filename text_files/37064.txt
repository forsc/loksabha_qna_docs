                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????	    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b): 	As per the  Land Use Statistics, the details of agricultural land/ cultivable land of  Keonjhar District of Odisha   during the last 15 years (from 2006-07 to 2020-21) are given in the Annexure.(c) to (e): 	There is no significant decline in the agricultural land in the Keonjhar District of Odisha during the last 15 years. However, marginal decline of agricultural land may be due to diversion of land for non-agricultural purposes such as urbanization, roads, industries, housing etc. While there is shift in agricultural land for non agricultural purposes, non-agricultural land is also being brought under agricultural uses.As per Seventh Schedule of Constitution of India, land comes under the purview of State Government. Therefore, the State Governments are to take suitable steps to check diversion of agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes. However, under the National Policy for Farmers – 2007 (NPF-2007), State Governments have been advised to earmark lands with low biological potential such as uncultivable land, land affected by salinity, acidity, etc., for non agricultural developmental activities, including industrial and construction activities. National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy – 2007 (NRRP-2007) has also recommended that as far as possible, projects may be set up on waste land, degraded land or un-irrigated land. Acquisition of irrigated, multi-cropped agricultural land for non-agricultural uses may be kept to the minimum and avoided, to the extent possible.
