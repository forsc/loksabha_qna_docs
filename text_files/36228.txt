ANSWER




                                                                                THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE                     MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                         (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a)&(b): Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is implementing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U) since 25.06.2015 for giving Central Assistance to States/ Union Territories (UTs), including the State of Tamil Nadu, for providing all-weather pucca houses to all eligible urban households. Government of India has not fixed any target for construction of houses in a State/ UT under PMAY-U. States/ UTs, including State of Tamil Nadu, have undertaken demand survey under the scheme for assessing actual demand of housing for eligible beneficiaries. The houses under the scheme are sanctioned based on the project proposals received from State Government as per their assessed and validated demand. Against validated demand in the State of Tamil Nadu, 7.28 lakh houses have been sanctioned under PMAY-U.  Out of total sanctioned houses, 6.29 lakh houses have been grounded for construction and nearly 4.64 lakh houses have been completed. During the last three years and the current year (2018-2022), a total of 4.24lakh houses were sanctioned and 3.86lakh houses were completed in the state of Tamil Nadu under PMAY-U.(c):  During the last three years and the current year (2018-22), Central Assistance of ? 7,044 crore was approved and ? 6,397 crore was released to the State Government of Tamil Nadu under PMAY-U. During the same period ? 7,439 crore was utilised including utilisation received against funds released in preceding years under PMAY-U.(d)&(e): PMAY-U addresses affordable housing requirement in urban areas through four verticals: (i) Beneficiary-led individual house construction or enhancement (BLC) (ii) Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP) (iii) Credit-Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) and (iv) “In-Situ” Slum Redevelopment (ISSR).  After approval from concerned State LevelSanctioning and Monitoring Committee (SLSMC), States/ UTs submit the proposal to this Ministry for approval of Central assistance by Central Sanctioning & Monitoring Committee (CSMC). Completion of projects generally takes 12-18 months under BLC vertical and 24-36 months under AHP/ISSR verticals of the Scheme. In order to achieve the vision of ‘Housing for All’, Ministry monitors progress of the Scheme through periodic review meetings, video-conferences and field visits. Ministry, at various fora such as Review meetings, Workshops/ Conferences, Central Sanctioning & Monitoring Committee (CSMC) meetings etc., and through correspondences, has advised States/ UTs to expedite the construction of sanctioned houses so that all houses are completed within the stipulated period.                                    *****
