                                                        (a) and (b):       There is no provision of State-wise allocation of funds under the scheme of Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS).  However, funds are released to State Governments/State Societies based on the actual requirement of funds under recurring and non-recurring component as admissible under the scheme. Recurring grant in Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS) and in Eklavya Model Day Boarding School (EMDBS) are respectively Rs.1.09 lakhs and Rs.0.85 lakhs per student per annum and construction cost of EMRS is Rs. 20.00 crore per school in plain area and Rs. 24.00 crore in North East, Hilly Area, and areas affected by LWE. Total Budget allocation under the scheme of EMRS during the current year, i.e. 2020-21, is Rs. 1313.23 crore. As per provisions of General Financial Rules 2017, utilization certificate and physical progress report are obtained from the State Governments to ascertain the proper utilization of the funds. (c) and (d):      No Sir. During 2019-20, a separate budget head has been created exclusively for the scheme of EMRS and this year required funds have already been allocated under this scheme. However, funds towards construction of EMRS is to be released to the concerned agencies in a phased manner over a period of time.  Therefore, funds are projected to be allocated under this scheme  in phased manner over the years which will be commensurate with physical targets achieved under the scheme. *****
