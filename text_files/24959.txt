ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)	& (b) As per the India State of Forest Report (ISFR), 2019, the total Recorded Forest Area in the Country is 7,67,419 square kilometre. The State/Union Territory (UT) wise details including Haryana are given in Annexure-I.The Ministry does not collect the records of the total land area earmarked for grazing land across the country. (c), (d) & (e) Protection and management of forests is primarily the responsibility of concerned State/UT. As per the information received from States /UTs, the State/UT wise details of the forest area under encroachment in the country are given in Annexure-II.  The Ministry does not assess encroachment on grazing land across the country. Since States and UTs are responsible for forest protection, whenever any complaint regarding encroachment is received, the same is forwarded to the concerned State or UT for taking appropriate actions as per the extant acts, rules and regulations. The States and UTs also take various measures such as demarcation and digitization of forest boundaries, strengthening infrastructure for forest protection, involving fringe area forest communities such as Joint Forest Management Committees, Eco Development Committees etc. to prevent and control encroachments. The Ministry has written to State Governments/UT Administrations to remove encroachment and ensure that no further encroachment takes place as per the existing Acts/rules.******
