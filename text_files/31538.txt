This scheme also covers casual announcers and comperes working at the stations.To overcome difficulties in applying under the scheme, an IT Portal (url http://iars.prasarbharati.org) was developed, so that those desirous to apply for consideration of their claim for regularization as per the criteria laid down in the Scheme may submit their applications online in a transparent manner. Applications received are scrutinized to determine their eligibility for regularization based on fulfilling condition of continuous engagement of 10 years from year 11.04.1996 to 10.04.2006 and all other eligibility criteria/parameters laid down in the Scheme.(c) All India Radio, Delhi station has not been shut down. It continues to operate multiple radio services which may be accessed in Delhi, across India and anywhere in the world through various modes – FM (in Delhi), Digital Radio DRM MW (Delhi and adjacent regions), DTH Satellite Radio on DD FreeDish (across India), Internet Streaming through NewsOnAir App and newsonair.com website (anywhere in the world).(d) The fee of a Casual Assignee performing the duties of announcement and related work during the transmission has been increased from Rs.1300/- to Rs.1600/- per duty with effect from 01.04.2021.(e) Engagement on Casual basis is for specific assignments on a need basis. The extant guidelines stipulate that the number of duties of such Assignees should not exceed 6 days in a month and 72 days in a year.
