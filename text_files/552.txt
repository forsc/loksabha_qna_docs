ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):	The Government monitor calamity-wise / crop-wise / season-wise crop loss due to sudden change in weather on regular basis.  Based on the information received from the States/UTs, details of the area having crop loss due to adverse weather during 2018-19 is given at Annexure-I. Against the crop loss as reported in Annexure-I, an amount  of Rs.8170.81crore has been approved as National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) assistance to the States of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Rajasthan. 	The Government has been taking various steps to compensate the crop loss suffered by the farmers.  These include: •	The Government has introduced yield based Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and weather index based Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS) from Kharif 2016 to provide financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of natural calamities, adverse weather incidence to stabilize the income of farmers. •	PMFBY provides for comprehensive risk insurance against crop damage from pre-sowing to post harvest of food crops, oilseeds and annual commercial horticultural crops notified by the concerned state government.  This scheme not only safeguards against wide spread yield loss due to non-preventable natural risks but also against farm level yield loss due to localized risks, prevented sowing and post-harvest losses.•	Immediate relief is also provided to insured farmers in case of adverse seasonable conditions during the crop season due to which expected yield during the season is likely to be less than 50% of the threshold yield in the concerned insurance unit.
