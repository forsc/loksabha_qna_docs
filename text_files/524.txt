                                                        THE MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)   The elections to the Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRI) are held under the States’/ Union Territories’ respective Panchayati Raj Acts.

The State/Union Territory-wise details of women Sarpanches/Pradhans is given at Annexure.	The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act provides for reservation of women in Panchayats   by reserving not less than one-third seats for them at each tier of the Panchayat. Twenty States namely, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, Uttarakhand and West Bengal have made provisions for reservation of fifty per cent of total seats for women in Panchayats at all levels in their respective State Panchayati Raj Acts. Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) has also been focusing on the capacity building of elected women representatives of Panchayats through the Ministry’s schemes.(b) No, Sir. (c) In view of (b) above, the question does not arise.******
