                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (g) Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and President of People’s Republic of China Mr. Xi Jinping held their 2nd Informal Summit in Chennai on October 11-12, 2019.  The 2nd Informal Summit enabled the two leaders to hold direct, free and candid exchange of views on issues of over-arching, long-term and strategic significance, without the constraints of protocol and pre-set agenda. The discussions between the two leaders during the 2nd Informal Summit resulted in the following outcomes: (i)	The two leaders have decided to establish a High-Level Economic and Trade Dialogue mechanism with the objective of achieving enhanced trade and commercial relations, as well as to better balance the trade between the two countries and to encourage mutual investments through the development of a manufacturing partnership.(ii)	The two leaders have decided to designate 2020 as Year of India-China Cultural and People to People Exchanges.(iii)   The two leaders have decided that 70 activities will be organized to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of India-China relations in 2020.  (iv)	The two leaders have agreed to establish sister-state relations between Tamil Nadu and Fujian Province of China and also to conduct research on age-old maritime links between China and India. In addition, the two leaders reaffirmed the consensus reached during their first Informal Summit in Wuhan, China in April 2018, that India and China are factors for stability in the current international landscape and that both side will prudently manage their differences and not allow differences on any issue to become disputes.As regards the boundary question, the two leaders also positively appraised the work of the Special Representatives and urged them to continue their efforts to arrive at a mutually-agreed framework for a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable settlement based on Political Parameters and Guiding Principles that were agreed by the two sides in 2005. The two leaders reiterated their understanding that efforts will continue to be made to ensure peace and tranquility in the border areas.During the 2nd Informal Summit, Prime Minister and President Xi Jinping exchanged views on a number of issues, including on terrorism. Both sides recognized that terrorism posed a common threat. In this regard, they acknowledged the importance of continuing to make joint efforts to ensure that the international community strengthens the framework against training, financing and support terrorist groups throughout the world and on a non-discriminatory basis.***
