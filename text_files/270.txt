To cover rural areas all across the country, 1.59 lakh Sub Service Areas (SSAs) have were created, where each SSA comprises of 1,000 to 1,500 households (approx. 4000 to 5000 population). Out of these SSA, 0.33 lakh rural SSAs are covered through bank branches and 1.26 lakh rural SSAs are covered though fixed location BC.Further, an exercise based upon the Geographical Information System (GIS), a mapping exercise was undertaken by National Informatics Centre (NIC) to locate inhabited villages which are not having banking facility within a distance of 5 km. Out of 8622 identified locations, 7363 locations have been covered through deployment of BCs.In addition to above, the requirement of new banking outlets as received from time to time are also discussed in meetings of the concerned District Level Consultative Committee (DLCC)/ State Level Banker’s Committee (SLBC) and based on the recommendations made, new outlets are opened by different banks.(e) The details of new bank branches opened throughout the country during each of the last five years, State/UT-wise including Haryana are as per Annexure.********
