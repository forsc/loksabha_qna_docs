ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF AYURVEDA, YOGA & NATUROPATHY, UNANI, SIDDHA AND HOMOEOPATHY(AYUSH) (SHRI SARBANANDA SONOWAL) (a): No, Ministry of Ayush is not contemplating any AYUSH Policy. However, the National Health Policy -2017, inter alia provides for the mainstreaming of the potential of AYUSH systems of medicine. This envisages better access to AYUSH remedies through co-location in public facilities, introduction of Yoga at much wider scale in schools and work places, as part of promotion of good health. The policy recognizes the importance of standardization and validation of Ayurvedic medicine and establishing a robust and effective quality control mechanism for AYUSH drugs.  It also emphasizes the need of development of infrastructural facilities of teaching institutions, improving quality control drugs, capacity building of institutions and professionals.  In addition, it recognizes the need for building research and public health skills for preventive and promotive healthcare. (b) to (d):  Does not arise in view of (a) above.
