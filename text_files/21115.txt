ANSWER




                                                        MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE & FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????          (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) and (b): As per publication on Land Use Statistics for the year 2016-17 (latest available), the State-wise details of barren & unculturable land including Rajasthan and Bihar is at Annexure. Barren & unculturable land includes all land covered by mountains, deserts etc., which cannot be brought under cultivation except at an exorbitant cost.  (c) to (e): As per Seventh Schedule of Constitution of India, land comes under the purview of State Government and, therefore, it is for the State Governments to take suitable steps to convert barren land into arable land. However, Government of India supplements the efforts of State Government through various programmes.Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Watershed Development Component (WDC) of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana  (PMKSY) for development of rainfed/degraded lands. Department of Land Resources (DoLR) has sanctioned, 8214 watershed development projects covering an area of about 39.07 million hectare  in 28 States (except Goa)  [now 27 States and UTs of J & K and Ladakh) including Rajasthan and Bihar  during the period 2009-10 to 2014-15 under Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP). IWMP was amalgamated as the Watershed Development Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana in 2015-16. The activities undertaken inter alia include ridge area treatment, drainage line treatment, soil and moisture conservation, rain water harvesting, nursery raising, afforestation, horticulture, pasture development, livelihoods for assetless persons, etc.Since 2009 -10, an amount of Rs.19826.217 crore (Rs.2984.596 crore to Rajasthan and Rs.239.677 crore to Bihar) has been released as Central share to States/UTs (as on 28.02.2021). As per information received from the States/UTs, since 2014-15 to 2020-21 (upto Q3, 2020-21), 7.09 lakh water harvesting structures have been created / rejuvenated. An additional area of 15.17 lakh ha has been brought under protective irrigation. The number of farmers benefited is 32.44 lakh during the said period.Apart from this, to reclaim and develop barren lands Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has developed location specific bio-engineering based soil & water conservation measures, land management techniques and soil reclamation protocols for saline, alkali, waterlogged and acidic soils. ICAR also gives focus on the development of the tolerant varieties to better withstand these odds and also the selection of suitable crops including agroforestry interventions to reclaim and develop barren lands. Besides, the Council through Natural Resource Management Institutes and Krishi Vigyan Kendras imparts trainings and organises on farm and field level demonstrations to develop awareness amongst farmers on all these aspects. The National Action Plan for achieving Land Degradation Neutrality Targets have been prepared. Various other schemes like Green India Mission, fund accumulated under Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), Nagar Van Yojana etc. also help in checking degradation and restoration of forest landscape. Government also promote tree outside forests realizing that the country has a huge potential for increasing its Trees Outside Forest (TOF) area primarily through expansion of agroforestry, optimum use of wastelands and vacant lands. The Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP), now amalgamated as the Watershed Development Component of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (WDC-PMKSY) also aims to bringing the wastelands into cultivation.
