ANSWER




                                                        (a)	and (b):  Facial recognition is a way of identifying or confirming an individual’s identity using their face. Facial recognition systems can be used to identify people in photos, videos, or in real-time. Right to Privacy is an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution. Any solutions employing Facial Recognition Technology should address the privacy concerns.(c):  Facial Recognition Technology is distinct from the Face Authentication mechanisms that utilise one-to-one face matching for authentication after obtaining consent of the individual. Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is using one-to-one face matching for providing digital marksheets to students through a consent-based framework. (d): No, Sir.  UIDAI is only developing the Aadhaar based Face Authentication as which is currently in Proof of Concept (PoC) phase. Face authentication may be used as one of the authentication mechanisms apart from biometric and iris-based authentication procedures with the informed consent of the individual.*******
