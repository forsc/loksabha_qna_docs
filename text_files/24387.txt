ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE AND CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS (SHRI MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a) & (b): Yes, Sir. The Government has implemented Nutrient Based Subsidy Policy w.e.f. 1.4.2010 for Phosphatic and Potassic (P&K) Fertilizers.  Under the policy, a fixed amount of subsidy, decided on annual basis, is provided on subsidised P&K fertilizers depending on their nutrient content. Under this policy, MRP is fixed by fertilizer companies as per market dynamics at reasonable level which is monitored by the Government. Thus, the P&K fertilizers are market-linked under the NBS scheme. The P&K fertilizer sector is decontrolled and the private sector players take decision in this sector as per their commercial viability. Thus, as such the question of promotion private capex and encouraging proven private sector players for any such initiative does not arise.(c) :    Sir, As far as Urea is concerned, there are 32 urea manufacturing units across the country with the total installed capacity of 232.94 Lakh MT (LMT) per annum (approx.). Out of these 32 units, 16 units are from private sector which have installed capacity of 115.67 LMT per annum. 	As far as, P&K fertilizer sector is concerned, there are 4 Cooperative and 21 Private sector units/plants engaged in DAP and Complex fertilizer production or import under the NBS Scheme. Further there are 111 private sector units/plants engaged in production of SSP. 	There is no proposal to revamp any existing fertilizer PSU in Maharastra. *****
