Adoor  Prakash, Member of Parliament for answer on 10th August, 2021 regarding Impact of Coastal Erosion on Fisheries(a) to (e): Some stretches of India’s shoreline are subject to varying degree of erosion due to natural causes or anthropogenic activities. The coastal erosion does impact coastal communities residing in the erosion prone areas including fishermen communities.The National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR) an attached office of Ministry of Earth Sciences monitors shoreline changes along Indian Coast. NCCR has carried out a national shoreline change assessment mapping for Indian coast using 28 years of satellite data from 1990 to 2018 along nine coastal States and two Union Territories(UTs)to provide information for coastal management strategy. Based on the report of NCCR, about 32% of the coastline is under varying degree of erosion (low, moderate or high), 27% is of accreting nature and the remaining 41% is in a stable state. The state-wise shoreline changes along the Indian coast is at Annexure–I. The State-wise list of areas affected by coastal erosion including Kerala is at Annexure–II.As per NCCR studies, 41% of coastline of Kerala is subject to varying degree of erosion, 31% is stable and 21% is accreting. Further, the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management under the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change and the Central Water Commission under the Ministry of Jal Shakti also undertake studies on shoreline changes/coastal erosion and its impact.   Planning and execution of anti-sea erosion measures are undertaken by the maritime States and UTs as per their own priority and from their own resources. The role of Union Government is technical, advisory and catalytic in nature. Ministry of Earth Sciences through NCCR and National Institute of Ocean Technology has extended technical support in design of anti-sea erosion measures to Government of Kerala. *****
