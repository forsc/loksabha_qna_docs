Since the inception of the Scheme, the Ministry has formulated a comprehensive training strategy for the functionaries of Anganwadi Services.  Training is imparted to the functionaries on a regular basis.Anganwadi Workers are provided job training for 26 working days.

The e-ILA can be accessed at www.e-ILA.gov.in.The frontline workers are also trained through dedicated handholding sessions followed by practical training on smart phone for using ICDS-CAS Software Application.
