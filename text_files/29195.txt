For remaining 238 vacancies, recommendations from High Court Collegiums are yet to be received.Government appoints only those persons as Judges of High Courts who are recommended by Supreme Court Collegium. As per the Memorandum of Procedure, for the  appointment of Judges of High Court, the Chief Justice of the High Court is required to initiate the proposals in consultation with two senior-most Judges from amongst the eligible candidates from the  Bar and concerned State Judicial Service six months prior to the occurrence of vacancies.Filling up of vacancies is a continuous, integrated and collaborative process between the Executive and the Judiciary. It requires consultation and approval from various constitutional authorities both at the State and Centre level. While every effort is made to fill up the existing vacancies expeditiously, vacancies do keep on arising on account of retirement, resignation or elevation of Judges and increase in Judge Strength.
