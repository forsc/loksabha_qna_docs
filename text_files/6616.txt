                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING:(SHRI PRATAP CHANDRA SARANGI)(a) & (b): 	Yes Sir. 	Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Ministry of Earth Science has recently developed a communication device called GEMINI (GAGAN Enabled Mariner’s Instrument for Navigation and Information) to receive the data and information transmitted from GAGAN satellite system owned and operated by Airport Authority of India (AAI). It is a one-way communication device used for the dissemination of information to help the fishermen out at sea. GEMINI will be of help in forewarning the fishermen about evolving cyclones and directing them to return to nearest coast. Besides, information on Potential Fishing Zone (PFZ) advisories, Ocean State Forecasts, high wave alerts and tsunami warnings can also be provided to fishermen so that they can receive such information irrespective of their location at sea through GEMINI devices.(c) & (d): 	As far as promoting the use of GEMINI device by the Government is concerned, it is stated that the said device has been developed in the interests of Mariner’s and fishermen by INCOIS which, per se is a Government agency. However, as this device has been launched by INCOIS only recently i.e. October, 2019, its acquisition and usage by fishermen may take some time.                                                                *****
