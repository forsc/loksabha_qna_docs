                                                        MINISTER OF COOPERATION ???????? ??????		(SHRI AMIT SHAH)(a) &  (b):	No, Sir.(c) & (d): The Country already has a rich cooperative heritage and a robust cooperative sector.  There are two types of co-operative structures in the country i.e. State Cooperative Societies and Multi-State Cooperative Societies. The Cooperative Societies functioning in one state only are governed by the laws of the respective State Government. The cooperative societies functioning in more than one state are governed by the central law, namely, ‘the Multi-State Co-operative Societies (MSCS) Act, 2002 (39 of 2002)’.  Moreover, certain powers under Sections 84 and 108 of the MSCS Act, 2002 have also been delegated to the State Governments by the Government of India.********
