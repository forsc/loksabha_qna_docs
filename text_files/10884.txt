Afforestation is done both in forest and outside forest areas. Saplings for plantation both in forest areas and outside forest areas are raised from various nurseries established in different locations in the States with the funding sources from various schemes implemented in the States.  No separate proposals for establishing nursery for good quality material is available, however, the funds released under various schemes of the ministry are inclusive of nursery raising to produce quality planting material. States are also advised to raise good quality planting material.(b)	For restoration and conservation of ecology, the Government is implementing various Centrally Sponsored Umbrella schemes namely National Mission for a Green India, Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats, Conservation of Natural Resources & Ecosystems, and National River Conservation Programme.The funds collected under Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), as compensatory levies from states inter-alia, is also used in plantation activity including compensatory afforestation by States/UTs. The schemes primarily supports ecological restoration through afforestation in and outside forest areas, forest landscape restoration, habitat improvement, soil and water conservation measures, protection etc. (c) Expansion of forest and tree cover is an inherent principle of National Forest Policy, 1988, which envisages a national goal to have a minimum of one-third of the total land area of the country under forest and tree cover.  Various afforestation related schemes implemented by MoEF&CC and other ministries aim at increasing and improving forest and tree cover. State Governments also implement various schemes for restoration of degraded forest areas. (d) MoEF&CCprovides funds forconservation, development and promotion of forests in various States under its three major schemes namely,National Afforestation Programme (NAP), Green India Mission (GIM)and Forest Fire Protection &Management Scheme (FFPM). Thedetails of funds provided by the Government under these schemes to various States including Tamil Nadu during the last five years and the current year are given in annexure.*****
