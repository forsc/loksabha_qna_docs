Airports Authority of India (AAI) has completed the bidding process and with the approval of the Union Cabinet, has issued Letter of Award on 15.07.2019 in respect of Ahmedabad, Lucknow and Mangaluru airports and on 01.09.2020 in respect of Jaipur, Thiruvananthapuram and Guwahati airports.(c): The per passenger fee offered by the highest bidder payable to AAI is Rs. 177/- for Ahmedabad, Rs. 174/- for Jaipur, Rs. 171/- for Lucknow, Rs. 168/- for Thiruvananthapuram, Rs. 115/- for Mangaluru and Rs. 150/- for Guwahati airport. ;(d) & (e): Yes Sir, Government of Kerala had requested the Government of India to allow them to form a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to take over and run the Thiruvananthapuram Airport. Government of India considered the request of Government of Kerala and allowed them to participate in the bidding process with the provision of Right of First Refusal (RoFR) with price range parameter of 10%. Accordingly, Government of Kerala designated entity i.e. Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) had participated in the bidding process. However, the bid quoted by KSIDC was below the 10% price range parameter quoted by the highest bidder. Therefore, as per the provisions of bidding documents, AAI has issued Letter of Award to the highest bidder.
