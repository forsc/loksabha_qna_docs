ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) :	 Government fixes minimum support prices (MSPs) of 22 mandated crops for every agricultural season and fair & remunerative price (FRP) for sugarcane on the basis of recommendations of Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP), after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned & other relevant factors. In addition, MSP for Toria and De-Husked coconut is also fixed on the basis of MSPs of Rapeseed/Mustard and Copra respectively.Region specific parameters are kept in view by the CACP while recommending MSP for agricultural crops.  Since cost of production varies in different States on account of differences in levels of irrigation, resource endowment, farm mechanization, land holding size etc., CACP uses all-India weighted average cost of production while making its recommendations and recommends uniform MSP which is applicable to all states and not region or state-specific. Government has introduced yield based Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and weather index based Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS) from Kharif 2016 to provide financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of natural calamities, adverse weather incidence, to stabilize the income of farmers etc.    Contd….2/-- 2 -PMFBY is voluntary for States.   West Bengal Government opted for implementation of both the scheme and implemented the schemes during 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19.    But State Government has withdrawn from the scheme from Kharif 2019 and is implementing its own scheme ‘Bangla Fasal Bima Yojana’. Details of coverage in West Bengal under PMFBY and RWBCIS during 2016-17 and 2017-18 are Annexure.(b) & (c):	No such loss has been reported by the State Horticulture Mission, West Bengal. Under Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), powers have been delegated to State Level Executive Committee (SLEC) of various States for sanctioning of project upto cost of Rs 500.00 lakh including setting up of cold storage. As per available information 510 numbers of cold storage with capacity of 59.35 lakh MT are available in West Bengal as on 31.03.2019.
