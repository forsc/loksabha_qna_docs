(a) and (b):        The Mahila Shakti Kendra (MSK) Scheme was approved in November, 2017 as a centrally sponsored scheme to empower rural women through community participation. The scheme aims to facilitate inter-sectoral convergence of schemes and programs meant for women. The scheme is implemented through State Governments and UT Administrations with a cost sharing ratio of 60:40 between Centre and States except for North East & Special Category States where the funding ratio is 90:10. For Union Territories 100% central funding is provided. States contribute their respective shares of  funds  for  implementation  of  the  scheme  before  seeking  releases  of  subsequent installments from Government of India under the scheme. During the last years, the amount of budget allocated by Government under the scheme is Rs. 267.30 crore for FY 2018-19, Rs.150.00 crore for FY 2019-20 and Rs.100.00 crore for FY 2020-21. (c) to (e):    The MSK Scheme provides for National, State and District Level Task Forces for review, monitoring and coordination at their respective levels. The Ministry of Women and Child Development undertakes video conferences and meetings along with visits to States/ Districts to review implementation of the scheme.
