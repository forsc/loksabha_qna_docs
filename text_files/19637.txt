ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION (SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b) Ministry of home Affairs (MHA) vide their order No. 40-3/2020-DM-I (A) dated 30th September, 2020 has stated that State/UT Governments may take a decision in respect of re-opening of schools and coaching institutions, after 15th October, 2020, in a graded manner, The decision shall be taken in consultation with the respective school/institution management, based on their assessment of the situation. The Department of School Education and Literacy has issued detailed SOP/guidelines regarding health and safety precautions for reopening of schools after issue of Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) guidelines for unlock-5, on 5th October, 2020. Part I of these guidelines refers to the health and safety aspects for reopening schools. These are based on the prevailing instructions of Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Ministry of Education with regard to health and safety protocols, and are to be implemented by adopting/adapting in accordance with the local situation in all states/UTs. Part-II of the Guidelines refers to learning with physical/social   distancing and the academic aspects that are to be taken care of with regard to the delivery of education, such as, curriculum transactions, instructional load, timetables, assessment, etc. after schools reopen. These guidelines can be accessed at:https://www.education.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/SOP_Guidelines_for_reopening_schools_0.pdfThe State-UT wise status of re-opening of schools after closure due to Corona pandemic is at Annexure.(c) & (d) The Ministry of Education through National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) had conducted a survey related to online teaching learning in Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan(KVS), Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti(NVS) and Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) schools. As per the survey, the findings revealed that about 60-70% of the participants (students, teachers, parents and school principals across KVS, NVS and CBSE shared that teaching and learning during COVID-19 period was joyful and satisfactory. About 20-30% stakeholders shared that they had difficult experience and about 10-20% said that it was burdensome for them. The details of the survey and findings are given in Chapter – 3 of the Learning Enhancement guidelines, which may be accessed at the following links:1.  https://www.mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/Learning_Enhancement_0.pdf2.  https://seshagun.gov.in/sites/default/files/update/Learning_Enhancement.pdf3.  https://ncert.nic.in/pdf/announcement/Learning_%20Enhancement_Guidelines.pdf (e)	It is for the concerned State and UT Government to decide about the re-opening of schools after COVID pandemic, based on their assessment of the situation as per MHA guidelines.The following corrective steps have been taken by the Ministry of Education with a view to addressing the issues related to gaps and/or loss of learning among students, during and after the lockdown, NCERT has prepared ‘Alternative Academic Calendar’ and ‘Students’ Learning Enhancement Guidelines’ with a focus on learning outcome. The guidelines suggest models for the following three types of scenarios:- I.	Learning Enhancement during COVID-19 for students without digital devices. II.	Learning Enhancement during COVID-19 for students with limited accessibility to digital devices.III.	Learning Enhancement during COVID-19 for students with digital devices.A multi-pronged approach has been adopted leveraging technology to reach the students. Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing (DIKSHA), Study Webs of Active-learning for Young Aspiring Minds(SWAYAM), SWAYAM PRABHA, MANODARPAN for psychological support,  PRAGYATA Guidelines on Digital Education,  e-textbooks etc. are used by schools, colleges and universities to provide learning facilities. Where the internet facility is not available, SWAYAM PRABHA is used to impart education through TV. Community Radio Stations and a podcast called Shiksha Vani of CBSE is also effectively used in remote areas where online classes are difficult. The Ministry has also issued the guidelines dated 13th July, 2020 for continuing education of children of migrant labourers to prevent loss of learning or academic year. Further, for Rationalisation of Syllabus for Summative Examinations, CBSE has reduced the syllabi only for the purpose of examinations to the extent of thirty percent. This has been done in view of change in the mode of conduct of classroom transaction which is new both for parents and teachers. *****
