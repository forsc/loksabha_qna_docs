The Ministry of Food Processing Industries had started a new Central Sector Umbrella Scheme- PRADHAN MANTRI KISAN SAMPADA YOJANA (PMKSY) with an outlay of Rs 6,000 crore for its implementation during 2016-17 to 2019-20. The scheme has since been extended to FY 2020-21. The PMKSY has seven components schemes viz; (i) Mega Food Parks; (ii) Integrated Cold Chain and Value Addition Infrastructure; (iii) Creation/Expansion of Food Processing & Preservation Capacities; (iv) Infrastructure for Agro-processing Clusters; (v) Creation of Backward and Forward Linkages (vi) Food Safety and Quality Assurance Infrastructure, (vii) Human Resources and Institutions. Another scheme "Operation Greens" (OG) has been included as a vertical of PMKSY since November 2018 for integrated development of value/supply chain of tomato, onion and potato (TOP) crops. The operational guidelines of these schemes are amended periodically to encourage investment in food processing sector, for example, providing enhanced assistance to SC/ ST entrepreneurs and lower eligibility threshold for them, increase in number of clusters for setting up of projects in OG scheme, locational restrictions for Food Processing Units etc. and are placed on Ministry website at https://mofpi.nic.in separately under each of the scheme guidelines. The total fund allocated and released under PMKSY since 2016-17 as on 31.08.2020 is given in the table below: Year	Budget Allocation (in ? crore)*	Fund Released (in ? crore)2016-17	688.56	677.162017-18	633.84	605.582018-19	870.33	591.382019-20	889.43	694.942020-21	1081.41	271.11 *For 2020-21 Allocation is Budget Estimate and for other years, it is Revised Estimate. (c) to (e). PMKSY is a comprehensive package, which will result in creation of modern infrastructure with efficient supply chain management from farm gate to retail outlet.
