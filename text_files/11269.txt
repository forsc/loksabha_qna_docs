ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) & (b):	National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) compiles and publishes information on crime in its publication “Crime in India”. The published reports are available till the year 2018. State/UT-wise details of cases reported against juveniles and juveniles apprehended under Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Special and Local Laws (SLL) Crimes during 2016-2018 are at Annexure-I.(c)	State/UT-wise details of juveniles sent home after advice or admonition, juveniles  sent  to  Special  Home  or  Fit  Institute,  juveniles  dealt  with fine and juveniles acquitted or discharged under IPC and SLL Crimes during 2016-2018 are also at Annexure-I.--2--LS.US.Q.NO. 237 FOR 04.02.2020(d) & (e):	‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibilities to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens including children rest with the respective State Governments. The State Governments are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provisions of laws.Further, the issue of crime by juveniles is mainly dealt through Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2000 which provides for reformative care in case of children/juveniles in conflict with law. The Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, namely, Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) for rehabilitation and reintegration of children in difficult circumstances. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act) has been enacted by repealing the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000  to make  comprehensive  provisions for children alleged and found to be in conflict with law and children in need of care and protection, taking into consideration the standards prescribed in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice, 1985 (the Beijing Rules), the United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty (1990),    the  Hague   Convention  on   Protection  of  Children   and   Co-operation in Respect of Inter country Adoption (1993), and other related international instruments.--3--LS.US.Q.NO. 237 FOR 04.02.2020The revised Act has come into effect from 15.01.2016. The new JJ Act includes special provisions to address heinous offences committed by children above the age of 16 years. Offences have been clearly defined and classified in the Act as petty, serious and heinous. Special provisions have been made to tackle child offenders committing heinous offences in the age group of 16-18 years. Apart from this, the JJ Act focuses on various measures for rehabilitation and reintegration of children in difficult circumstances, including children in conflict with law. The JJ Act and the Central Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules, 2016 thereunder, provide for setting up of a network of services and structures for ensuring the well being and rehabilitation of such children which includes Juvenile Justice Boards, Special Juvenile Police Units, State and   District   Child   Protection  Units,  Homes  of  various  types  and   non-institutional care through adoption, foster-care and sponsorship. These measures, among other things, also intend main-streaming of children in conflict with law. The State Governments/UT Administrations are entrusted with the primary responsibility for implementation of the JJ Act.Under the Integrated Child Protection Schemes (ICPS), there is a provision of counselor in Observation Homes. These counselors provide counseling services to children in conflict with law and children in need of care and protection as well as for their parents and families.******
