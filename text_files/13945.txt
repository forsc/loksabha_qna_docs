ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) & (b):	Due to global recession and reduction in demand for silk goods in major silk importing countries, the Silk goods export earnings have been decreasing since 2008.  Main reason for decreased silk exports is also attributed to increase in prices of raw silk yarn/fabrics making the products unaffordable for major section of buyers in the domestic as well as in the international markets. The demand is shifting towards other cheaper blends of silk with synthetic and polyester fabrics, which look like pure silk fabrics and other low cost fabrics like cotton, polyester, linen.  However, no separate evaluation has been made by Central Silk Board (CSB) in this regard.(c):	The total value of silk exports from India during last three years is given below: Year	Value of silk exports from India (In Rs.crore)2016-17	2093.422017-18	1649.482018-19	2031.89(d):	Government of India through Central Silk Board has taken following steps for the technical upgradation, development and promotion of silk industry in the country:i.	CSB has been implementing a Central Sector Scheme “Silk Samagra” for development of sericulture in the Country, which mainly focuses on improving quality and productivity of domestic silk thereby reducing the country’s dependence on imported silk. Under the scheme, assistance is extended to sericulture stakeholders for the beneficiary oriented components like, raising of Kissan Nursery, Plantation with improved Mulberry varieties, Irrigation, Chawki rearing centers with incubation facility, construction of rearing houses, rearing equipment’s, door to door service agents for disinfection and input supply, support for Improved reeling units like Automatic Reeling units, Multi-end Reeling machines, Improved Twisting machines and support for post yarn facilities for quality Silk and fabric production.ii.	North East Region Textile Promotion Scheme (NERTPS): Under NERTPS, 38 Sericulture projects are being implemented in all North Eastern States in the identified potential districts under three broad categories viz., Integrated Sericulture Development Project (ISDP), Intensive Bivoltine Sericulture Development Project (IBSDP), Eri Spun Silk Mills and Aspirational Districts.  iii.	To produce import substitute Bivoltine silk in the country, R&D has been focused to evolve productive bivoltine hybrids and package of practices for production.  iv.	Strengthening the Research & Development system to improve the levels of cocoon production and productivity to develop improved mulberry/ host plant verities, silkworm hybrids and technology packages. v.	Cold Storage facilities and Bivoltine grainages have been strengthened to produce, store and supply quality Bivoltine silkworm seed.vi.	For production of 3A-4A grade raw Silk from the bivoltine cocoons, Automatic Reeling Machines (ARM)/Units have been established in the country. vii.	Central Silk Board and State Governments mobilize additional funds for sericulture development through convergence by availing the schemes such as MGNREGA, RKVY etc., being implemented by various other Ministries of Govt. of India to create required infrastructure at stakeholder’s level.viii.	The basic customs duty of 10% & 20% is levied on raw silk and silk fabric import respectively. This will make the domestic silk weaving market segment stronger and also makes Indian silk export sector highly competitive.ix.	Thrust provided on product development & diversification with focus on silk blends & popularizing Vanya silk products in the export business. x.	The Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS) implemented by Ministry of Commerce, GOI would definitely make silk sector competitive in the export Market.xi.	Active participation of Indian exporters in the international expos and International Silk expos organized in India (both B2B and B2C) would give boost to the sector. xii.	‘’Indian Silk’’ is being promoted as a brand in the global market through generic promotion & with the ‘’Silk Mark Tag’’ to create a Brand image of Indian Silk. *****
