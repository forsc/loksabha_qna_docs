                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (e): The Hon’ble Supreme Court, in its order dated 02.12.2020, gave detailed direction to States/Union Territories and Union of India for installation of CCTV cameras in all police stations and offices of central investigation agencies. The apex court in its last hearing held on 06.04.2021, directed  for  allocation  of budget to the central  agencies within one month from the date of order and for implementation of complete order within a period of six months from the date of allocation of budgets. The central investigation agencies have been requested on 13th April, 2021 for allocation of budget and installation of CCTV cameras in their offices within the timeframe given by the Hon’ble Court. States/Union Territories are already impleaded in the case for filing status report on installation of CCTV Cameras in Police Stations, directly before the Hon’ble Court.  As police is a State subject  the information regarding number of police stations having CCTVs is not maintained at the level of Central Government.An advisory dated 8.7.2021 has been issued to State/UT Governments for installation of CCTV cameras in all police stations.	Although ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India, financial assistance for modernisation of State police forces is provided under the scheme of ‘Assistance to States for Modernisation of Police’. Under this scheme, States have been given flexibility to formulate State Action Plan (SAPs) as per their strategic priorities and requirements. It may also be noted that in the light of order dated 2.12.2020 of Hon’ble Supreme Court, the State Governments had also been advised to include their requirement of installing CCTV cameras in each and every police station in their proposals for the year 2021-22.*****
