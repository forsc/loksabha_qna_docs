THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI  PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) & (b):  	Yes, sir, agricultural, natural or manufactured goods are registered as Geographical Indications (GI) by the Geographical Indications Registry as per the provisions of the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act, 1999.As on 10.03.2020, 362 Indian products have been registered as GIs. The list of GI products registered State-wise is enclosed as Annexure.(c):	A private entity namely, Global Intellectual Property Centre of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, prepares International Intellectual Property Index (IIPI), The intellectual property rights indicators used in the index are selective and hence not a true reflection of the state of Intellectual Property Rights protection and innovation in India.India is party to the following International treaties concerning Intellectual Property Rights have been ratified by the Government of India referred to in IIPI:- i) 	WIPO Internet Treaties.ii) 		Protocol related to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks.iii) 	Patent Cooperation Treaty.(d): 	Yes, sir, The ‘Scheme for IPR Awareness – Creative India; Innovative India’ has been launched from 1st April 2017 by Cell for IPR Promotion and Management (CIPAM) under the aegis of the DPIIT for taking forward the National Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy 2016. However,. It has no relation to ratification of Treaties referred to in IIPI. This scheme aims at raising IPR awareness amongst students, youth, authors, artists, budding inventors and professionals to inspire them to create, innovate and protect their creations and inventions across India, including Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 cities as well as rural areas..(e): 	India has a well-established legislative, administrative and judicial framework to safeguard Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs), which meets its international obligations while utilizing the flexibilities provided in the international regime to address its developmental concerns. India has a Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) compliant, robust, equitable and dynamic IPR regime. In addition, the Government of India has taken various steps to further strengthen the IPR regime of the country, some of which are as follows:•	The National IPR Policy, 2016 was adopted on 12.05.2016 as a vision document to guide future development of IPRs in the country.•	The Patents Rules, 2003 and the Trademarks Rules, 2002 have been amended whereby the IP processes have been re-engineered to streamline them and make them more user-friendly. •	Manpower in the Intellectual Property offices has been ramped up significantly with fresh recruitments. This augmentation of manpower has already had a salutary effect on the examination and disposal of patent and trademark applications. •	IPR awareness and training programs are held for academic institutions, industry associations and enforcement agencies.  •	Special provisions have been made for expeditious examinations of startups and small entities.       As a result of the steps taken by India to improve its IP regime• 	Period of examination of new Trademarks applications is reduced from 13 months in 2015-16 to less than 30 days presently. India now has among the fastest trademark examination globally. • 	Trademark is registered in less than 7 months, if there are no office objections or opposition filed, as compared to 3-5 years required earlier. • 	11.25 lakh Trademark Registrations in just four and half years (2015 to 2019) as compared to 11 lakh Registrations during 75 Years (1940-2015). • 	Patent Examination increased from 22,631 in 2014-15 to 85,426 by end of F.Y. 2018-19 • 	Time taken in examination of patents from an average of 72 months in 2014-15 to around 36 months at present. • 	Grant of patents has increased from 5,978 in 2014-15 to 15,283 in 2018-19.******
