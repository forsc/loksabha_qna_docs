Ground Water Management and Regulation (GWM&R) scheme is a continuing central sector scheme being implemented in the country by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB). Major activities being taken up under the scheme include aquifer mapping for the entire country and other activities of CGWB such as ground water level and quality monitoring on regular basis, assessment of dynamic ground water resources in collaboration with States/UTs, regulation and control of ground water withdrawal in certain States/UTs, taking up few demonstrative recharge projects in selected water stressed areas, strengthening of scientific infrastructure for technological upgradation etc. (c) A major activity under the scheme is National Aquifer Mapping and Management Programme (NAQUIM) which is being implemented with the objectives to delineate and characterize the aquifers and develop plans for ground water management.  Out of the total geographical area of around 33 lakh sq km of the entire country, an area of around 25 lakh sq km of mappable area has been identified to be covered under NAQUIM programme in phases. So far, an area of around 20.24 lakh sq km has been covered under the programme. The remaining areas are targeted to be covered by March 2023. State-wise area covered under NAQUIM is given at Annexure I. Further, aquifer maps and management plans are being shared with the State agencies for suitable demand side and supply side interventions.  In addition, CGWB has taken up heli-borne survey work for faster generation of aquifer related information and its management in around 1.04 lakh sq km of arid/semi-arid areas of Rajasthan (69,875 sq km), Gujarat (31,436 sq km) and Haryana (2,644 sq km). The work is targeted to be completed by April 2022. In addition to this, other activities under the scheme are being implemented by the CGWB as per their given mandate and as per targets/timelines. The details in this regard are given at Annexure II. (d) The total funds allocated and utilized under the GWM&R scheme during the last three years and the current year are as under: F.Y.

Other activities under the GWM&R schemeCGWB carries out ground water level monitoring in the country, four times a year, on regional scale through a network of observation wells every year. Further, as a part of the groundwater quality monitoring, groundwater samples are collected and analysed by CGWB for assessment of groundwater quality from various locations in the country once every year.The dynamic groundwater resources of the country are assessed periodically by the CGWB in collaboration with States/UTs. CGWB has developed software for faster computations of the assessment of ground water resources through a web-based application. The latest assessment for the year 2020 was done with the same software system. Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has been constituted under section 3 (3) of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for the purpose of regulation and control of ground water development and management in the country. CGWA grants No Objection Certificates (NOCs) for ground water abstraction to industries, infrastructure units and mining projects in feasible areas in 20 States/UTs where regulation is not being done by the respective States/UTs. The latest guidelines for control and regulation of groundwater extraction with pan-India applicability were notified on 24 September 2020. Demonstrative Artificial Recharge works in selected 03 aspirational districts viz. Osmanabad in Maharashtra, YSR Kadapa district in Andhra Pradesh and Jangaon district in Telangana have been completed by the CGWB. A number of check dams, percolation tanks, subsurface barrier, recharge wells and recharge shafts etc were constructed to harvest rainfall. Further, CGWB completed a pilot project for demonstrative artificial recharge work at five locations in the eastern region of Maharashtra covering districts of Wardha and Amravati for construction of Bridge cum Bandhara (BCB) for ground water recharge and storage of water on upstream side for drinking purpose. Further, during 2021-22, CGWB has taken up the groundwater recharge projects in certain water stressed areas of Rajasthan and Haryana which are under implementation. In addition, CGWB procured a number of scientific equipments including laboratory equipments, scientific software, vehicles, air compressors, generators, ancillary equipments, rigs etc for their effective working to fulfill their given mandate. ***
