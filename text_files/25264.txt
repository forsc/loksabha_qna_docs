                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TRIBAL AFFAIRS(SMT. RENUKA SINGH SARUTA)    (a) & (b):  Section 6 (7) of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA in short) provides that the State Government shall constitute a State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) to monitor the process of recognition and vesting of forest rights and to submit to the nodal agency such return and reports as may be called for by that agency. FRA does not mandate for the constitution of monitoring committees at the block and district level.  Sub-Divisional Level Committee and District Level Committees, constituted under Section 6(3) and 6(5) respectively of the FRA have to function for the purpose of recognition of Forest Rights. As per FRA and FR Rules, responsibility for implementing various provisions of the Act lies with State Governments. (c) & (d):   As per information available with the Ministry, all the State Governments have constituted SLMC except Mizoram and Nagaland, where the Act is not applicable.*****
