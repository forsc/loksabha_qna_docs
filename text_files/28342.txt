ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a): As per CPCB publication on “Status of methane emission from municipal solid waste disposal site”, municipal solid waste is a significant contributor of Landfill Gas (LFG), which is an important source of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs), mainly methane and carbon dioxide. Recognizing the large amounts of municipal solid waste in the urban areas of the country, the Government of India launched the Swachh Bharat Mission Urban in 2014. (b): The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy under Waste to Energy Programme has recognized incineration/gasification/pyrolysis as waste to energy conversion technologies for treatment of municipal solid waste and biomethanation process for wet waste.(c) &(d):  The Ministry inter alia is mandated for the conservation and survey of flora, fauna, forests and wildlife, prevention and control of pollution, afforestation and regeneration of degraded areas, and protection of environment. These objectives are well supported by a set of legislative and regulatory measures, aimed at the preservation, conservation and protection of the environment. These enactments have been variously amended from time to time. Further, to monitor implementation of legislative and regulatory measures the Ministry has delegated powers to various agencies including Central Pollution Control Board, Sate Pollution Control Boards, Regional Offices of the Ministry, State Environment Impact Assessment Authority etc. The Ministry implements policies and programmes relating to conservation of the country''s natural resources including its lakes and rivers, its biodiversity, forests and wildlife, and the prevention and abatement of pollution. While implementing these policies and programmes, the Ministry is guided by the principle of sustainable development and enhancement of human well-being. As regards disposal of solid waste, the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, brought out by the Ministry provide the statutory framework for solid waste management in the country.  Central Pollution Control Board has brought out guidelines for effective management of solid waste including disposal of legacy waste. Directions under Section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, for enforcement of provisions of Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 regarding bio mining of legacy waste to all State Pollution Control Boards / Pollution Control Committees.The Ministry has implemented Single-Window Integrated Environmental Management System named PARIVESH (Pro-Active and Responsive facilitation by Interactive, Virtuous and Environmental Single-window Hub) for complete online, expeditious and transparent system for environment, forest, wildlife and Coastal Regulation Zone clearances in the country. ****
