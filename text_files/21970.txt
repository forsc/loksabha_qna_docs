For ESY 2020-21 thePublic Sector OMCs have allocated 325.5 crore litres of ethanol upto 01.03.2021 againstrequirement of 457 Crore litres for ESY 2020-21.Under the EBP Programme, Government has initiated several interventions both on thesupply and demand side. The important initiatives are: reintroduction of administeredprice mechanism for ethanol procurement, enhancement of scope of raw material byallowing ethanol production from multiple feed-stocks like C & B heavy molasses,sugarcane juice, sugar, sugar syrup, damaged food grains, maize and surplus stocks ofrice with Food Corporation of India (FCI), differentiated ex-mill price of ethanol to bepaid to ethanol suppliers based on raw materials used for its production, amendment tothe Industries (Development and Regulation) Act (IDR Act) – 1951 for free movement ofethanol in the country, reduction of GST rate to 5% on ethanol procured under the EBPProgramme, formulation of a long term procurement policy for ethanol, interestsubvention scheme for augmentation and enhancement of ethanol production capacitiesin the country, etc.In addition, Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) have simplified the ethanolprocurement procedure thereby encouraging more vendors to take part in the EoIsreleased by them.
