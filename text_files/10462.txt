                                                    (a) 	whether the Ministry has received any complaints about any Government/ private offices remaining open on public holidays; (b) 	if so, the provision to take action on the above-mentioned incident; (c) 	the medium through which a person can file complaint when a Government/private office remains open on public holidays; and (d) 	the details thereof?






ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND PENSIONS AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a) to (d):   No Sir.  As per Fundamental Rule (FR)11, the whole time of a Government servant is at the disposal of the Government, which pays him and he may be employed in any manner required by proper authority without claim for additional remuneration.Sometimes with a view to meeting the exigencies of work such as when a Government business has to be transacted immediately or a deadline has to be met, the Head of the Office can, in the interest of public service, take a decision to keep the offices open fully or partially, even on public holidays.  The staff who are deployed on official duty on public holidays are, however, compensated by granting them compensatory leave.  Need for laying down procedure for registering complaints in case of any Government/private office remaining open on public holidays has not been felt.*****
