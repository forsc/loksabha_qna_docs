ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) & (b) : 	As on 31.10.2019, the installed generation capacity in the country has been around 3,64,960 Mega Watt (MW), which is sufficient to meet the electricity demand in the country. The details of actual power supply position in terms of energy and peak of the country during the current year i.e. 2019-20 (upto October, 2019) is given at Annexure. It may be seen that the gap between demand and supply of power during the current year 2019-20 (upto October, 2019) both in terms of Energy and Peak is less than 1%. This gap is generally on account of factors, other than of power availability in the country e.g. constraints in sub-transmission and distribution network, financial constraints of State Power Utilities to purchase power etc. Apart from long term Power Purchase Agreements power can be purchased at any time from power exchanges.(c) : 		Generation of electricity is a delicensed activity as per the Electricity Act,2003, except for the concurrence of Central Electricity Authority (CEA) for hydro generating stations with estimated scheme cost exceeding the sum fixed by the Central Government from time to time. As per the information available with CEA, conventional power generation capacity totalling to 59,615.65 MW is at various stages of construction in the country, which includes 42281.15 MW Thermal (Coal), 406.15 MW Thermal (Gas), 12,034.5 MW Hydro and 5,300 MW Nuclear. Govt. of India has set a target of 175,000 MW installed capacity from renewable energy sources by the end of 2021-22 which includes 1,00,000 MW from Solar, 60,000 MW from Wind, 10,000 MW from Biomass and 5000 MW from Small Hydro. Against this target, the renewable capacity of 83,379 MW already stands commissioned as on 31.10.2019.(d) : 		The share of generation from renewable energy sources in the total generation from conventional and renewable sources in the country has been 9.21% and 10.13 % during the year 2018-19 and 2019-20 (upto October,2019) respectively.  (e) : 		The steps taken by the Government to incentivize renewable energy sector and improve the production of green energy in the country inter-alia, include the following:(i)	Announcement of a target of installing 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by the 	year, 2022;(ii)	Permitting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) up to 100 percent under the automatic 	route;(iii)	Waiver of Inter State Transmission System (ISTS) charges and losses for inter-state 	sale of solar and wind power for projects to be commissioned up to December, 2022;(iv)	Notification of standard bidding guidelines to enable distribution licensee to procure 	solar and wind power at competitive rates in cost effective manner;(v)	Declaration of trajectory for Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) up to the year 2022;(vi)	Implementation of Green Energy Corridor project to facilitate grid integration of large scale renewable energy capacity addition; and,(vii)	Launching of New Schemes, such as, PM-KUSUM, solar rooftop phase II, 12000 MW CPSU scheme Phase II.***********
