                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) & (b): Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, prohibits ''physical punishment'' and ''mental harassment'' of students under Section 17(1) and makes it a punishable offence under Section 17(2).  In addition, Department of School Education and Literacy (DoSEL), Ministry of Education has developed Guidelines on School Safety and Security of children studying in Government, Government-aided and Private Schools. The guidelines are advisory in nature and have been circulated to all States/UTs/Autonomous Bodies of DoSEL and stakeholder Ministries. These guidelines take care of psycho-social safety of children and inter-alia stipulate that schools may be declared and monitored as Corporal Punishment Free School and Zero Tolerance to student’s abuse and bullying. Also, schools  are required to take strong action against teaching and non teaching staff in case of any involvement in or negligence of physical or sexual violence, bullying and/or corporal punishment, subjecting the child to physical or psychological harassment. These guidelines also provide that established offense of corporal punishment attracts legal provision under Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice (JJ) Act, 2015.Additionally, under NISHTHA (National Initiative for School Heads’ and Teachers’ Holistic Advancement), a nation-wide integrated teacher training program for teachers under Samagra Shiksha, teachers have been oriented on counselling, provisions of POCSO Act, JJ Act, School Safety guidelines, helpline and emergency numbers, drop-box for complaints, etc.*****
