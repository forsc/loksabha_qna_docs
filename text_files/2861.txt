Data on women and children rehabilitated is not maintained centrally.‘Police’ is a State subject under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and as such prevention of the crime of human trafficking and crime against children is the responsibility of State Governments.

Protective and Rehabilitative Homes have been set up under the Ujjawala Scheme where basic amenities such as food, clothing, medical care, legal aid, vocational training and education to  the  rescued  victims are provided as a rehabilitation  component.    Grant is released to  States  and  UTs  for implementing the Ujjawala Scheme.The Ministry of Women and Child Development is also implementing the Child Protection Services Scheme in partnership with States/Union Territories for providing institutional and non-institutional care through service delivery structures as mandated under the Juvenile Justice (Care and protection of Children) Act, 2015.
