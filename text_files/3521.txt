                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)	to (e):     As per Rural Health Statistics (RHS) Bulletin 2017-18, the state-wise details of number of Sub Centres, Primary Health Centres (PHCs) & Community Health Centres in tribal areas is at Annexure-I.   As per RHS 2017-18, the details of doctors, specialists and other medical personnel along with their vacancies is at Annexure-II to Annexure-VI.“Public Health & Hospitals” being a State subject, the primary responsibility to ensure access of public health facilities to tribal population along with filling of vacant posts of doctors and other medical personnel in these public health facilities is that of respective State Governments. However, under the National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their health care systems including setting-up/upgrading public health facilities and augmenting health human resource on contractual basis for provision of equitable, affordable healthcare to all its citizens particularly the poor and vulnerable population including tribal population based on requirements posed by the States in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs). Under NHM, tribal areas already enjoy relaxed norms for setting up public health facilities including “time to care” norm for setting-up sub health Centres in tribal areas within 30 minutes of walk from habitation and relaxed norm for Mobile Medical Units for tribal areas; extra one MMU if it exceeds 30 patients per day against 60 patients per day in plain areas for bringing healthcare delivery to the doorsteps of the population.Further, all tribal majority districts whose composite health index is below the State average have been identified as High Priority Districts (HPDs) and these districts receive more resources per capita under the NHM as compared to the rest of the districts in the State. These districts receive higher per capita funding, have enhanced monitoring and focussed supportive supervision and are encouraged to adopt innovative approaches to address their peculiar health challenges. The Allocation of funds under Scheduled Tribal Sub-Plan in respect of major health schemes/ programme during 2016-17 to 2018-19 are at Annexure-VII to Annexure-IX.As per Rural Health Statistics the change in health facilities in Tribal areas versus All India is given as below:Facilities	All India	Tribal Areas	2005	2018	2005	2018CHCs	3346	5624	643	1017PHCs	23236	25743	2809	3971SCs	146026	158417	16748	28091Total	172608	189784	20200	33079% increase	9.95	63.75
