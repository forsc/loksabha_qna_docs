                                                        MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a) to (f): A Statement is laid on the table of the House.*************STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) to (f) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 29 FOR REPLY ON 24.06.2019 ASKED BY DR. PRITAM GOPINATHRAO MUNDE AND SHRI ASADUDDIN OWAISI REGARDING NEW EDUCATION POLICY(a) and (b): The Committee for draft National Education Policy under the Chairmanship of Dr. K Kasturirangan has submitted their draft to the Ministry on 31.05.2019. The draft has been uploaded in the Ministry of Human Resource Development website for seeking comments of stakeholders. The National Education Policy will be finalized by the Government only after examining all the suggestions/comments of stakeholders. (c): The National Education Policy will be accompanied by an implementation plan consisting of specific initiatives, investments and outcomes.(d): The 3 Language Formula has been adopted in the National Policy on Education 1968 and reiterated in National Policy on Education 1986. Section 4.5 of the Draft NEP 2019 emphasizes on the power of language and multilingualism and providing education in the local language/mother tongue in early stages. Further, the various sub-sections of Section 4.5 of the draft report outline the importance of learning more languages for enhancing the cognitive abilities of children, bilingual approach for those whose language is different from the primary medium of instruction, exposure to three or more languages in schools and standardising sign language. Further, while reaffirming the importance of implementing the extant Three Language Formula in letter and spirit, the draft report proposes for flexibility within the same regarding the choice of languages.(e): Draft National Education Policy 2019 inter-alia proposes to integrate vocational education into all educational institutions – schools, colleges and universities and to provide access to vocational education to at least 50% of all learners by 2025, which will be facilitated through collaboration between educational institutions and technical institutions and industry. Each educational institution will make a careful choice of a few areas that they would like to offer, based on an analysis of the jobs available in their regions. The focus will be the development of practical skills as well as the associated theoretical knowledge along with a broad-based education.	 It also proposes a strong undergraduate liberal education with integration of various subjects so as to develop 21st century capabilities necessary for the employment landscape of the future - such as critical thinking, communication, problem solving, creativity, cultural literacy, global outlook, teamwork, ethical reasoning, and social responsibility – which will not only help to develop outstanding employees but also outstanding citizens and communities. (f): Currently there are several ongoing initiatives and schemes aimed at improving and reforming the quality of education in backward regions as well as to address social, gender and regional imbalances in educational development. The Draft NEP 2019 also recommends that the initiatives need to be taken to include educationally disadvantaged and Under Represented Groups (URGs) at all stages of education which will include creation of Special Education Zones in educationally disadvantaged regions across the country with targeted funding.                                     *****
