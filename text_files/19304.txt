ANSWER




MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS (SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a) & (b):	The Ministry of Minority Affairs implements Pre-Matric, Post-Matric and Merit-cum-Means based Scholarship Schemes for the educational empowerment of students belonging to the economically weaker section of the six notified minority communities i.e. Buddhist, Christian, Jain, Muslim, Sikh, Zoroastrian (Parsi) in all the States/UTs across the country. The distribution of the number of Scholarships among economically weaker sections of minority communities and States/Union Territories is made on the basis of proportionate population of minorities in the States/Union Territories as per Census 2011.(c) & (d):	Pursuant to submission of report by the Sachar Committee and under the Prime Minister’s New 15 Point Programme (PM’s New 15-PP) for the welfare of minorities,  the Government took various initiatives for the socio-economic and educational empowerment of every section of the society under the six notified minority communities i.e. Buddhist, Christian, Jain, Muslim, Sikh, Zoroastrian (Parsi). These schemes/ initiatives are being implemented by various Ministries/ Departments of the Central Government, including Ministry of Minority Affairs, either exclusively or by earmarking of 15% of overall physical / financial target. Ministry of Minority Affairs, being the nodal Ministry for implementation of the decisions taken by the Government on Sachar Committee report as well as the PM’s New 15-PP, monitors and reviews these schemes/ initiatives. The schemes/ programmes are reviewed in the Ministry of Minority Affairs on quarterly basis with the Nodal Officers of the concerned Ministries/ Departments for effective implementation of schemes. The shortfalls, if any, are pointed out and the concerned Ministries/ Departments are advised to take remedial actions to ensure that the targets are achieved. Details of the schemes/ programmes/ initiatives covered under Sachar Committee report and PM’s New 15-PP as well as the schemes/ programmes/ initiatives of the Ministry of Minority Affairs, are available on the website of Ministry of Minority Affairs at “www.minorityaffairs.gov.in”. The Government during the last six years, i.e. during 2014-15 to 2019-20 has provided 3.85 crore scholarships to students from six centrally notified minority communities. Out of these, girls constitute more than 50% of the beneficiaries. The three scholarship schemes are now being implemented through the National Scholarship Portal. Since 2015, these schemes are being implemented under direct benefit transfer (DBT) mode to improve the efficiency by removing duplicity and stopping possible pilferages.                                                                     *****
