It has jurisdiction over all athletes and sports associations in India. Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was apprised of this for compliance.(b) Yes, Sir. BCCI contested that (i) BCCI not being a National Sports Federation it was not subject to jurisdiction of NADA; (ii) it had framed and adopted BCCI Anti Doping Rules and (iii) claimed to have a robust mechanism to ensure that Indian cricket is clean and free from doping.(c) NADA jurisdiction extends to all athletes and sports organizations in India. BCCI not being a recognized Dope Testing Agency under WADA Code its stand was not found acceptable. WADA was apprised of it and a fresh direction has been issued to BCCI to comply with NADA Rules.***
