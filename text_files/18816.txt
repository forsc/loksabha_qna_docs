                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR THE MINISTER OF PLANNINGAND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICSAND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	There are 112 Aspirational Districts, across 26 States and 1 Union Territory. These were selected through a transparent process on the basis of published data. List of data sets and the weight attached to them for selection of these districts is attached in Annexure - I.  As regard salient feature of the programme, it aims at rapid transformation of these backward districts across sectors which are critical for improving quality of life or economic productivity of citizens. These sectors are Health and Nutrition, School Education, Agriculture and Water Resources, Financial Inclusion and Skill Development and Basic Infrastructure. 49 key performance indicators have been selected across these sectors and a district’s performance is monitored on the basis of progress made on these indicators. The broad strategy of the Aspirational Districts Programme rests on the 3 Cs – Convergence (between Central and State Schemes), Collaboration (between Centre, State, District Administration, Development Partners and Citizens) and Competition (between Districts). Every month, districts are ranked on the basis of progress made and this instill them with a sense of competition which results in rapid improvement. In order that the data quality under this programme improves, there is a provision of third-party validation of important indicators. Another strategy of the programme is nomination of Joint Secretary/Additional Secretary level officials from Government of India as Central Prabhari Officers for each of the district. The role of these Prabhari Officers is to guide the district administration on basis of their long experience.  (b)	The State-wise list of all 112 Aspirational Districts is attached as Annexure – II.(c)	As the main strategy of the programme is based on convergence of existing schemes which have their own funding arrangement, large infusion of additional fund is not envisaged. However, in order to foster competitive spirit, and for addressing the critical gaps, additional allocation on challenge route is also envisaged. Every month, districts are assessed on the basis of monthly progress and the best performing Districts in overall terms and in each of the five sectors are identified. The first and second rankers in overall terms are awarded Rs. 10 crores and Rs. 5 crores respectively. The first ranker from each of the five sectors is awarded Rs. 3 crores each. As of January 2021, a total of approximately Rs. 305.94 crores have been disbursed to Aspirational Districts since the inception of this Programme. List of the districts which have been sanctioned additional allocation on the basis of performance from Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Bihar are placed at Annexure - III.  (d)	The strategy of the Programme is to generate a sense of competition so that district show better progress every month. While the aim of the programme is to ensure progress in indicators so that these districts come at the level of State averages, no year wise specific target has been set by Union Government for these indicators.  (e)	Currently, the government does not have any proposal for expanding the list of Aspirational Districts.(f)	Yes, during the initial shortlisting of Aspirational Districts, the Ministry of Home Affairs had recommended that 35 districts affected by Left Wing Extremism (LWE) be added to the Programme and this recommendation was accepted. List of these 35 Aspirational Districts which are among the 112 districts and have been selected on basis of them being adversely affected by Left Wing Extremism is placed at Annexure - IV.  ***** Annexure – IList of data sets and weights used for selection of Aspirational DistrictsDATABASES	SECTOR	WEIGHTLandless households dependent on Manual labour (Socio Economic Caste Census – Deprivation 7)	Deprivation(25%)	25%Ante natal care (National Health and Family Survey (NHFS) - 4) 	Health & Nutrition(30%)	7.5%Institutional delivery (NHFS-4) 		7.5%Stunting of children below 5 years (NHFS-4) 		7.5%Wasting in children below 5 years (NHFS-4) 		7.5%Elementary dropout rate (Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE) 2015-16)	Education(15%)	7.5%Adverse pupil teacher ratio (U-DISE 2015-16)		7.5%Un-electrified households (Ministry of Power) 	Infra (15%)	7.5%Households without individual toilets (Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation) 		7.5%Un-connected PMGSY village (Ministry of Rural Development)  		7.5%Rural Household without access to water (Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation) 		7.5%Total 		100% Annexure – IIList of 112 Aspirational DistrictsS.
