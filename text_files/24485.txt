                                                         ANSWERMINISTER OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(DR. VIRENDRA KUMAR)(a) to (d): A statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** Statement in reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 26* for answer on 20.07.2021 asked by Shri Jayadev Galla regarding ''''NAP for Drug Demand Reduction''''(a): A total of 93 Outreach and Drop In Centres (ODIC) are financially assisted by the Department. Details are attached as per Annexure-I.(b) & (c): In order to reduce demand of narcotic substances , the government is pursuing a coordinated action between Department of Social Justice & Empowerment for reducing the demand, Narcotics Control Bureau for the purpose of restricting the supply, and Ministry of Health & Family Welfare for treatment of the victims of drug abuse.  In furtherance of the above strategy, the following action has been taken from this Department for drug demand reduction:1.	Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan (NMBA) has been launched on 15th August 2020 in 272 most vulnerable districts. Under this, widespread public participation has been mobilised under the leadership of District Collectors and the district political leadership. This campaign has reached the children, youth and women and larger community regarding the adverse impact of using narcotics and substances.  More than 8,000 youth volunteers, 4000+ yuva mandals, Nehru Yuva Kendras and National Social Service units are actively participating in this campaign. More than 28 lakh women have participated in this along with Anganwadi and Asha workers, ANMs and women SHGs. Through physical and online awareness programmes more than 13 lakh students in about 6000 schools have been reached out to. A social media campaign was also initiated through which more than 13 lakh people have been reached out through more than 60000 posts.  This campaign would be continued in all the districts and it is expected that about 100 districts would bring substantial reduction in the substance use by August 2022.2.	The institutional framework for the fight against narcotics is being strengthened:i.	Inpatient institutional care is being provided through (380) Integrated Rehabilitation Centres for Addicts being run by reputed NGOs and Addiction Treatment Facilities are being established in 125 government hospitals supported by the Ministry and set up by  AIIMS, New Delhi.ii.	Counseling and support services for the substance users trying to get out of the addiction is provided through (93) outreach and drop-in centres.These Centres provide screening, assessment, counseling, referral and linkage to medical treatment and rehabilitation services for the substance dependents.iii.	(60) Community based Peer Led Intervention (CPLI) centres have been set up with focus on children and adolescents at risk.  The mobilisation of the children and youth is done by highly motivated  young adults, who in turn, engage the children and the community for awareness generation and life skill activities.iv.	To further strengthen the institutional structure, it is proposed to start one District De-addiction Centre (DDAC) in (290) districts under the leadership of District Collector.  This institution would bring together all the services – community mobilisation, counseling, in-patient care and advocacy against the drugs in one place.   v.	The total budget for de-addiction activities which was Rs.48.97 crore in 2017-18 has been increased to Rs.260 crore in the year 2021-22.  An amount of Rs.1688.95 crore is proposed to be spent in the next 5 years on this important activity by the government.(d) : It is targeted to bring substantial reduction in the substance use in about 100 districts by 2022.  Further, in order to take this campaign forward, a coordinated action with State/UT Governments is also planned. ***** Annexure-I 	 List of ODIC presently running under NAPDDRSl.
