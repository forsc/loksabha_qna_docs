SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a):	Government provides conducive policy environment, facilitate creation of enabling conditions for the industry and private entrepreneurs to set-up manufacturing units including modern spinning mill.  Government has been assisting entrepreneurs to set-up textile units under various programmes and schemes such as Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme, Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks, PowerTex India, a Comprehensive Scheme for Powerloom Sector, etc. The benefit of these Schemes is available across the States / regions of the country for the entire textile value chain.
