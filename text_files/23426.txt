The list of ICAR research Institutes, Centres and All India Coordinated Research Projects/ Network Projects operational in the country state wise and the funds allocated to them are attached as Annexure-I.  The research programmes are prioritized to develop new high yielding, disease and pest resistant varieties of food crops, pulses, fodder and commercial crops; climate resilient technologies and farming practices besides livestock and fisheries technologies. New research programs on basic, strategic and applied research related to crop improvement, crop production, crop protection, post-harvest operations, value addition, etc. have been taken up. The KVKs undertake assessment and demonstration of technologies/ products developed by institutes and disseminate them among the farmers and line departments through district level front line demonstration and training programmes. ICAR has incurred an expenditure of Rs. 6590.64, 7615.71 and 7653.46 Crores during the year 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 respectively on the said centres and the projects.

Due to the steps taken towards Agriculture sector including those of ICAR, the farm sector has demonstrated a positive growth of over 3.4 per cent at constant prices in 2020-21, thus resulting in 19.9% share of agriculture in gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020-21.  With all these efforts, potential yield of crops per annum increased by 2.3-3.5 per cent, crop productivity increased by 2.0 per cent, production and productivity of fruits and vegetables increased by 2.1-2.2 per cent, inland and marine fish production increased by 9.2-9.4 per cent, livestock productivity increased by 1.0 percent, input use efficiency increased by 2.0-3.0 percent and the adoption of agricultural technologies increased by more than 10 per cent. The Government is taking elaborate efforts consistently to strengthen the research base of the institutes and centers in the country through adequate fund support to address the present and future technology needs of the country.    *******
