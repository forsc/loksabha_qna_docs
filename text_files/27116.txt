ANSWER




                                                        the Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a):  The salient features of Regional Connectivity Scheme(RCS)-UDAN(Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik) are as under:i. UDAN intends to enable air operations on unserved routes connecting regional areas, promote balanced regional growth and make flying affordable for masses.ii. Financial incentives in terms of concessions from Central, State Governments and airport operators are extended to Selected Airline Operators to encourage operations from unserved/underserved airports/heliports/water aerodromes and to keep the air fare affordable.iii. Support to the Selected Airline Operators in the form of Viability Gap Funding (VGF). State Governments concerned provide 20% share towards VGF for RCS flights pertaining to their states. However, the share of VGF for North-Eastern states and the Union Territories is 10%.iv. The airlines are required to commit around 50% of the seats as RCS seats (limited to 40 seats) on UDAN flights.v. For balanced regional growth, route allocations are spread equitably across five regions in the country viz. North, South, East, West and North East (with a cap of 30% in a given region).vi. UDAN is a market driven mechanism. Development of regional air connectivity routes is left to market forces. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit proposals at the time of bidding under UDAN from time to time.;;(b) & (c): Four rounds of bidding under UDAN have taken place since the launch of the scheme in October, 2016.  During the last four years after commencement of the scheme, 780 valid awarded routes have been allotted to Selected Airline Operators and out of which 359 RCS routes connecting 59 unserved and underserved airports (including 5 heliports and 02 water aerodromes) have been operationalized so far.(d) to (f): The State Government of Rajasthan has signed tripartite agreement with Government of India and Airports Authority of India with an objective to facilitate implementation of UDAN in the State. Unserved Airports/Airstrips namely Alwar, Banasthali, Banswara (Tilwara), Bharatpur, Dholpur, Gadra Road, Hamirgarh, Isarda, Jhalawar, Jhunjhunu, Kankoroli, Lalgarh, Malapura, Mathania, Merta Road, Nagaur, Pilani, Salawas, SawaiMadhopur, Shahpur, Sirohi and Suratgarh in the state of Rajasthan figures in the scheme document. Under UDAN airports namely Bikaner, Kishangarh, Uterlai, Kota, Jaisalmer are identified for development in the state of Rajasthan. UDAN flights operations from Bikaner, Kishangarh, Jaisalmer have already commenced. UDAN is a demand-driven scheme, wherein airline operators assess the feasibility of operation on a particular route and bid under the scheme from time to time. The following routes connecting Lalgarh (Sriganganagar) as proposed by State Government of Rajasthan have been offered for bidding in special round of bidding under UDAN 4.1.
