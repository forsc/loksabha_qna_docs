ANSWER




                                                        Minister of AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????   (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	&  (b):	No such proposal is under consideration as of now. Under most schemes of the DAC&FW, assistance is not linked to area of land holding. (c)	& (d):	Three programmes previously implemented on watershed basis viz. Drought Prone Area Programme (DPAP), Desert Development Programme (DDP) and Integrated Wastelands Development Programme (IWDP) were integrated and consolidated into a single modified programme called the Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) with effect from 26.02.2009 which was later amalgamated as one of the component of PMKSY in 2015-16 i.e  Watershed Development Component of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (WDC-PMKSY). Contd…..2/--2-	The activities undertaken inter alia include ridge area treatment, drainage line treatment, soil and moisture conservation, rain water harvesting, nursery raising, afforestation, horticulture, pasture development, livelihoods for assetless persons, etc.	820 watersheds projects are implemented in Rajasthan with the central assistance under WDC-PMKSY, out of which 601 projects have been completed and 219 projects are ongoing as on date. An amount of Rs.2984.596 crore has been released to Rajasthan as Central share. (e) & (f): Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) was approved for continuation upto 31.03.2020, co-terminus with 14th Finance Commission period. Government has given an extension for continuation of scheme up to 31.03.2021 or till the date the recommendations of 15th Finance Commission come into effect, whichever is earlier. As MIDH Scheme is currently up to 31.03.2021, therefore, the proposal for increasing the agriculture input grant will be considered while extending the scheme & issue of revised guidelines beyond 31.03.2021.  *******
