ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE (SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)( a) to ( c)  It is informed that the Tribunals Reforms Bill 2021 was passed by both Houses of Parliament and assented by the President on 13.08.2021. As per the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the said Bill, it is informed that as per data of the last three years it is seen that tribunals in several sectors have not necessarily led to faster justice delivery and they are also at a considerable expense to the exchequer. Therefore, further streamlining of tribunals was considered necessary as it would save considerable expense to the exchequer and at the same time, lead to speedy delivery of justice.
