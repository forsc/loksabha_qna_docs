ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): Upgradation of airports and air services in the country is a continuous process. The Government has taken various steps for development and upgradation of air services in the country which, inter-alia, include:;;(i)  Upgradation and expansion of existing airports;(ii)  Construction of new Greenfield airports;(iii) Development/revival of airports under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik);(iv) Promoting private investments in existing and new airports through the Public Private Partnership (PPP);(v) Enabling improvement in air navigation infrastructure at Indian airports and induction of latest technologies in this regard;(vi) Route rationalisation in coordination with Indian Air Force for efficient airspace management, shorter routes and reduced consumption of aviation fuel;(vii) Reduction in GST rate to 5% for domestic Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) services;(viii) Encouraging paperless handling of passengers at airports using biometrics and digital boarding passes to adhere to health norms and enhance efficiency of passenger flow management;(ix) Encouraging greater use of digital technology at air cargo terminals to enhance efficiency and reduce dwell times; and(x) Encouraging leading aircraft and component manufacturers to enhance their design, manufacturing,maintenance and warehousing footprint in India.;Airport operators including Airports Authority of India (AAI) have embarked upon a Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) plan for development / modernisation / upgradation of airports in the country during next five years. Further, to reduce the check-in time of passengers at the airports, equipment such as Common User Terminal Equipment (CUTE), Common User Self Service (CUSS) Kiosk, Scanners etc. have been provided at major airports as a part of the automation. AAI has constructed a modern, state-of-the art Air Traffic Flow Management Central Command Center at Delhi which has become operational from 22.06.2019. The central command center functions as the nodal point for nationwide Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) monitoring and managing air traffic demand congestion at major airports and airspace across the country. ATFM improves predictability of flight operations and thereby helps airlines to operate flights on time as far as practicable. Besides that, AAI has taken various other initiatives such as implementation of Airport Collaborative Decision Making system, upgradation of Instrument Landing Systems, installation of Advanced Surface Movement and Guidance Control System to improve on time performance by airlines.;As regards more airports in Metro Cities viz. Delhi and Mumbai, Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) has granted ''in principle'' approval for setting up of new airports at Navi Mumbai and Jewar (Noida), which are intended to serve as the second airport for passengers of Mumbai and Delhi respectively. Further, under the Regional Connectivity Scheme, civil operations have commenced from Hindon Airport which is located in Delhi National Capital Region.;;In order to reduce carbon-emission, AAI has commissioned 44.87 MW capacity solar power plants at 51 Airports and has further undertaken installation of 15.76 MW capacity solar power plant at 06 Airports. AAI has also implemented Airports Council International (ACI) - Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) Programme at four (4) airports viz. Kolkata, Bhubaneswar, Varanasi & Trivandrum to assess the carbon emission reduction by usage of clean renewable resources. Route rationalisation in coordination with Indian Air Force for efficient airspace management has also led to shorter flying routes and reduced consumption of aviation fuel.(c): India has already become the 3rd largest domestic aviation market, handling 275 million domestic and 69.48 million international passengers, at the airports, with more than 85 international airlines operating to India connecting over 40 countries, prior to Covid-19.
