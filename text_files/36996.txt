The anticipated cost of this project is `3,792 crore. An expenditure of `1,497 crore has been incurred on the project upto March’21 and an outlay of `1000.50 crore has been provided in the financial year 2021-22.  So far, 105 km length (Khurda Road to Nuagaon (90 km) and Bolangir to Bichhupali (15 km)) of the project has been commissioned.  Work has been taken up in Nuagaon - Buguda and Bichhupali- Purunakatak sections. (b) to (e): This project involves acquisition of 6162 acre land and diversion of 1844 acre forest land, out of which 5667 acre land has been acquired and diversion of 170 acre forest land has been completed. Further, State Govt. has to acquire 495 acre land and diversion of 1674 acre forest land. Completion of any Railway project(s) depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project(s) site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions etc.  All these factors affect the completion time of the project.  As such, firm completion time of the project can not be ascertained at this stage. However, Railway is making all the efforts for early completion of the project.Since 2014, there has been substantial increase in budget allocations and commensurate commissioning of Infrastructure projects & safety works. Average annual Budget allocation for Infrastructure projects & safety works, falling fully/partly in State of Odisha, during 2014-19 has been enhanced to `4,126 crore per year from `838 crore per year (during 2009-14), which is 392% more than average annual allocation during 2009-14 (`838 Cr/Year).  These allocations have been enhanced to `4,568 crore in 2019-20 (445% more than average annual budget allocation of 2009-14) and `5,296 crore in 2020-21 (532% more than the average annual allocation of 2009-14). During 2021-22 highest ever budget outlay of `6471 crore has been provided for these projects, which is 672% more than the average annual budget allocation of 2009-14 (`838 Cr/Year).Since 2014, there has been substantial increase in rate of commissioning of New Line, Gauge Conversion and doubling projects. During 2009-14, 267 km sections (56 km New line, 83 km Gauge conversion and 128 km Doubling), falling fully/partly in the State of Odisha, have been commissioned at an average rate of 53.40 km per year.  These commissioning, during 2014-21 has been increased to 1031 km (251 km New line and 780 km  Doubling), at an average rate of 147.29 km per year, which is 176% more than average annual commissioning achieved during 2009-14.*****
