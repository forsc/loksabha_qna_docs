                                                    (a) 	whether there is a decline in supply of power in the country during the last few months;(b) 	if so, the details thereof along with the actual supply of power during the period from July to December, 2019 vis-a-vis the same period in 2018;(c) 	whether this indicates a slowing of industrial activity which makes up for nearly 20% of the country’s core sector index; and(d) 	if so, the details thereof along with the actual slowing of the power sector and hence the industrial sector?






ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (d) : 	The month-wise details of electrical energy supplied during the current financial year (April, 2019 – December, 2019) vis-a-vis April, 2018 to December, 2018 is given at Annexure. It may be seen that the growth in electrical energy supplied during first four months i.e. April to July, 2019 was in the range of 6.5% to 8.5%. There was a marginal decline during August to November, 2019. However, it has again increased during December, 2019. The growth in electrical energy supplied is expected to be 3.2% during January, 2020 with respect to January, 2019. It is difficult to pinpoint the reasons for lower power demand during August to November, 2019.  However, it could be  due to prolonged rainy season and good rainfall which led to reduction in demand in agriculture sector and reduction in cooling requirement in domestic and commercial sectors. There were no notified power cuts in the industrial sector.  ***********
