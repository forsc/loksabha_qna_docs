ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (c) : The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) vide order dated 19th August, 2019 has fixed the age of retirement in CRPF, BSF, ITBP and SSB as 60 years irrespective  of  rank,   in   pursuance   to   the   order   of Hon’ble  Delhi High Court --2--LS.US.Q.NO. 2303 FOR 03.12.2019dated 04.02.2019 in  WP(C) No.695/2019. The age of retirement in CISF and regular cadre of Paramiliary Component in Assam Rifles, irrespective of rank, was already 60 years prior to the MHA’s Order dated 19th Aug, 2019. Hence it will not have any effect in CISF and Assam Rifles. However, there will be some impact on recruitment of personnel in the years 2020, 2021 & 2022 in respect of CRPF, BSF, ITBP & SSB as the vacancies which would have arisen due to normal retirement would not be arising in the said years.(d) : The details of total number of personnel working under Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and Assam Rifles, force-wise is as under :-Force	Working StrengthCRPF	3,00,002BSF	2,39,084ITBP	83,016CISF	1,42,561SSB	78,225Assam Rifles	60,748Total	9,03,636(e) : The total number of personnel retired from Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and Assam Rifles during the last three years, organisation-wise,  is as under :---3--LS.US.Q.NO. 2303 FOR 03.12.2019Force	Number of personnel retired during last three years {i.e. 2016 to 2018}	2016	2017	2018	TotalCRPF	4606	6060	4569	15235BSF	4149	7208	5143	16500ITBP	298	464	535	1297CISF	1722	1688	1298	4708SSB	455	669	480	1604AR	263	721	840	1824Total	11493168101286541168                The reasons for retirement of CAPF personnel are due to their attaining the age of superannuation, invalidation due to medical reasons, compulsory retirement and voluntary retirement due to personal reasons.*****
