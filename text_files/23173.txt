MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) and (b): The National Education Policy 2020 provides different timelines as well as principles and methodology for its implementation. As per National Education Policy 2020, implementation of the Policy requires multiple initiatives and actions, which will have to be taken by multiple bodies in a synchronized and systematic manner. Therefore, the implementation of this Policy will be led by various bodies including Ministry of Education, CABE, Union and State Governments, education-related Ministries, State Departments of Education, Boards, NTA, the regulatory bodies of school and higher education, NCERT, SCERTs, schools, and HEIs. Accordingly, Ministry of Education has communicated to all States/UT Governments for taking steps for implementation of NEP 2020. Further, Ministry and other implementing agencies under its purview have started taking initiatives towards implementation of NEP 2020. (c) and (d): To facilitate Internationalization of Higher Education in India, a Programme viz. ‘Study in India’ was launched on 18.04.2018.
