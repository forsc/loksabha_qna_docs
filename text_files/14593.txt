ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a) to (f):  A statement is laid on the Table of the HouseSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 284 FOR 13TH MARCH, 2020(a) & (b) Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) is a contributory health scheme of Central Government Employees and Pensioners under which subscribers are provided primary healthcare in the form of OPD treatment and medicines from CGHS Wellness Centres. CGHS Wellness Centres act as the nodal point for referral purposes. After consultation with specialist doctor at Empanelled Hospital, the subscriber reports back to the concerned Wellness Centre for issue of prescribed medicines. Also, in cases where the specialist has prescribed diagnostic tests, the MO/CMO at CGHS Wellness Centre endorses listed investigation/ listed treatment procedure. For unlisted investigations/ unlisted treatment procedures, CMO In-charge submits the prescription to competent authority for consideration in case of pensioners. Serving employees do not have to come back to the Wellness Centre and seek permission for unlisted investigations/ unlisted treatment procedures from their Department as per prevailing guidelines. It is part of checks and balances in the system.In case of Post-operative follow-up cases only one-time referral/permission is required without extension of permission from time to time and treatment / investigations may be undertaken without any endorsement in respect of critically ill CGHS beneficiaries.(c) & (d) Simplification/ rationalisation of procedures is an ongoing process. With a view to facilitate ease of availing consultations from Specialists at empanelled hospitals, Government has permitted elderly CGHS beneficiaries aged 75 years and above to seek consultations from Specialists without any referral and undergo treatment/ investigation without endorsement. Permission is required only for unlisted treatment procedure/ tests in non-emergency conditions.(e) & (f) Yes, Sir. Government has invited suggestions from CGHS beneficiaries and other stakeholders regarding revamping of CGHS. The suggestions/ feedback received have been examined by a duly constituted Committee. The Committee has submitted its report for consideration.*****
