ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR TEXTILES  (SMT. DARSHANA JARDOSH)(a) to (c):	The textile industry is one of the largest sources of employment generation in the country with over 45 million people employed directly. The State-wise data of employment related to Textile sector is not maintained. In order to promote employment in the textile sector, Government is implementing SAMARTH-Scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector with the objective to provide demand driven, placement oriented skilling programmes to supplement the efforts of the industry in creating jobs in textile and related sectors, covering the entire value chain of textiles, excluding Spinning and Weaving. Government is also implementing various other schemes/programmes viz. Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (ATUFS), Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP), Integrated Processing Development Scheme (IPDS), sectoral schemes for traditional sectors like Handlooms, Handicrafts, Jute, Silk, etc. for overall development of Textile Sector which also provide thrust in generating employment opportunities. Government has also launched Technical Textile Mission and has recently approved Production Liked Incentive Scheme (PLI) for Textiles and Pradhan Mantri Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM-MITRA) Scheme which have potential to generate large scale employment.   Third party evaluation has been undertaken for schemes being implemented in Textile Sector from time to time. Based on the recommendations of the evaluation studies, necessary measures have been taken to amend/modify the schemes to resolve the bottlenecks in implementation.***
