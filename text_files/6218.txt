ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; AND MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a) & (b): Prasar Bharati has informed that modernization is a continuous process and schemes in this regard have been formulated and implemented from time to time for Doordarshan and All India Radio. Modernization plan covers a broad spectrum, which, inter alia, includes digitalization; adoption of new technologies at par with International standards; replacement of old/ outlived equipment and up gradation etc.The Central Government has approved an amount of Rs. 1054.52 crore under the Scheme of Prasar Bharati “Broadcasting Infrastructure and Network Development” for the period 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-2020 for strengthening/revamping of infrastructure/programmes of Doordarshan and All India Radio.(c)  As per audit Annual Account, the surplus earned/deficit suffered by Prasar Bharati during  FY 2016-17 to 2018-19 are as under:-                                                             Rs. in Crores2016-17	2572.80     (Surplus)2017-18	295.79     (Deficit)2018-19 (Provisional)	13.97      (Surplus)(d) As the Public Service Broadcaster, the mandate of Prasar Bharati is on the issues of public interest viz. health, education, empowerment, social justice etc., thus the programming of Doordarshan and All India Radio are not comparable with other private channels as both are totally different in their objectives and programming formats.  It is the constant endeavour of Doordarshan and All India Radio to improve the quality of its programmes. As a reflection of competitiveness of DD vis-à-vis private channels, it is to mention that “DD India” channel is among the top 3 English News Channel as per the ratings of Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC). Similarly, “DD Sports” channel is in the top 5 sports channels during the live telecast of sporting events of National importance.Further, in order to improve the quality of programmes, Prasar Bharati is having wide network of 46 Audience Research Unit in All India radio across the country, which regularly provides feedback of the programmes broadcast on each AIR channels to the programme producers to plan, design and modify the programmes according to the needs, tastes and aspiration of the target audience.***********************
