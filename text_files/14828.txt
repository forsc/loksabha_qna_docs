ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (d): Realizing the need to streamline the tuition and other fees being charged byall technical institutions, the Government of India had constituted a National FeeCommittee under the Chairmanship of Shri B.N. Srikrishna, Retired Justice of SupremeCourt of India for prescribing guidelines for charging tuition and other fees for technicalcourses. The Committee recommended the maximum limit on tuition and other fees tobe levied and formula for increasing the fees. National Fee Committee report wascommunicated to all the State Governments for implementation. In line with the NationalFee Committee, State Level Fee Committees have been constituted in all the statesexcept Sikkim.The AICTE approved technical institutes are mandated by the provisions of AICTEApproval Process Handbook (APH), to declare on their website the tuition fee,examination fee etc. and adhere to the fee prescribed by National/ State FeeCommittee. In case of violation of the said norms and guidelines, the erring institution issubjected to the punitive actions which inter-alia include reduction in approved intakeand withdrawal of approval of the institution.*****
