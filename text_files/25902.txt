ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI  R.K. SINGH)(a) & (b) :	The details of State/UT-wise power demand and demand met in the country for the last three years i.e. 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 are given at  Annexure-I.  The present installed generation capacity in the country is around 384 Giga Watt (GW) which is more than sufficient to meet the power demand in the country. The maximum peak power demand experienced so far was around 200.6 GW on 07/07/2021.The States/ UTs meet their respective energy requirement from various sources such as their own generation, share from Inter-State Generating Stations which also includes Central Sector Generating Stations, procuring power on bilateral basis and through Power Exchanges etc. Energy not supplied is mainly on account of constraints in the distribution network and the financial constraints of DISCOMs to procure the power.(c) & (d) :  	As per the Electricity Act, 2003, generation is a de-licensed activity. The power supply by a generating company including private power companies to the buyers is as per the Power purchase Agreements between them.  The procedure adopted for supply of power is also as per the power purchase agreement. In case of any default in supply of power, the buyers can take action suitably against such generating companies including private power companies as per the terms and conditions stated in the power purchase agreements. Electricity Regulatory Commissions have jurisdiction to adjudicate the disputes between licensees and generating companies.***************
