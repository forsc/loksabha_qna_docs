Under the EV approach, bidders were to quote a combined debt and equity value with a split of 85% as debt and minimum 15% as equity consideration for allocation of quoted EV. The strategic disinvestment transaction has been carried out for the entire company as a going concern. Assets other than non-core assets and liabilities other than those excluded from the transaction will remain with the acquirer. Non-core assets of Air India and its subsidiaries (book value of Rs 14,718 crore as on August 31, 2021) are not a part of the disinvestment transaction and will not be taken over by the successful bidder but transferred to Air India Asset Holding Company (AIAHL), 100% owned by GoI. The strategic disinvestment transaction has been carried out through an open, transparent and competitive process.

The Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) are based on guidelines and have been finalized after detailed Inter- Ministerial consultations at several fora, the Inter-Ministerial Group (IMG), the Core Group of Secretaries on Disinvestment (CGD) and Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM).(iv)	In keeping with the best market practices and extant guidelines, the Reserve Price for the transaction was fixed at Rs 12,906 crore on the basis of Business valuation carried out by the Transaction Adviser and Asset Valuation carried out by the Asset Valuer. The Reserve Price was fixed only after receipt of sealed financial bids.(v)	Two financial bids were received following a competitive and transparent disinvestment process. The highest bidder, M/s Talace Pvt Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of M/s Tata Sons Pvt Ltd quoted an EV of Rs 18000 crore with a retention of debt in AI + AIXL of Rs 15,300 crore (85% of EV quoted) and the cash component of Rs 2,700 crore (15% of EV quoted).(vi)	The SPA has been signed on 25 October, 2021. As per the SPA, a set of Conditions Precedent (CPs) have to be satisfied by the successful bidder, Air India and Government of India before closing of the transaction. (vii)	The transaction has been supported by professional advice from experts - Transaction Adviser, Legal Adviser and Asset Valuer, who have been appointed through a transparent, competitive process.(c) and (d): Sixteen B777 aircrafts in Air India are part of the transaction, of which fifteen aircrafts have been inducted during the period 2007 to 2010 and one aircraft in 2018.
