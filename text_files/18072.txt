ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) 	BharatNet project is being implemented in a phased manner to provide broadband connectivity to all the Gram Panchayats (approx. 2,50,000) in the country.  The project envisages providing affordable broadband services in rural and remote areas towards realisation of the vision of ‘Digital India’. (b)	Rs. 42,068 crore has been approved by the Cabinet on 19.07.2017 for BharatNet Project. The funds are allocated/disbursed by USOF for the project as a whole and not State/UT-wise.The  State/UT-wise  and Year-wise  details of the disbursement of funds by Bharat Broadband Network Limited , the executing agency for this project ,  are given in Annexure-I. (c)  	BharatNet project is for providing broadband connectivity to all the Gram Panchayats of the States/UTs. The details of the State/UT-wise achievement, including in Andhra Pradesh, as on 1st September 2020 are given at Annexure-II.(d) 	As on 1st September 2020, a total of 23,133 Gram Panchayats(including Block Headquarters) have been made Service Ready ,and 1.47 lakh km OFC has been laid under BharatNet phase-II.  BharatNet is a challenging project of mega nature and the Gram Panchayats(GPs) are widely dispersed across the country in rural and also remote areas. The implementation of Phase-II is being done under State-led and CPSU-led model. The delay in the implementation of the BharatNet phase-II is mainly on account of:-(i)	About 65,000 GPs in 8 States are under implementation under State-led model. For these States, the project is at various stages of implementation. The delay in the implementation by the States is also adversely affecting the completion of the Project. For other States, not being implemented under State-led model, the implementation strategy is under the process of review. (ii)	Under CPSU-led model, BSNL’s work was also delayed due to its difficult financial condition. (iii)	In March 2020, pursuant to Lockdown and movement restrictions due to COVID-19 in the country, the project progress is affected. However, with the beginning of unlock phase, all efforts are being made to expedite the project implementation.
