ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL)(a) Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) has provided the eGramSwaraj (eGS) (https://egramswaraj.gov.in) – a user friendly web-based portal, which aims to bring in better transparency in the decentralized planning, progress reporting, financial management, work based accounting and details of assets created. The Panchayats upload the Gram Panchayat Development Plans through the planning module of eGS. The online payments to vendors / service providers are done through the eGS-PFMS Interface (eGSPI). So far, 2.54 Lakh Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs) have been uploaded on eGS for the year 2021-22.  Further, 2,32,190Panchayats have onboarded e-Gram SWARAJ - PFMS Interface; 1,99,235 Panchayats have done online payments worth a cumulative of more than Rs. 70,000 crores (includes all the onboarded schemes) through e-Gram SWARAJ- PFMS Interface.Furthermore, for ensuring timely audit of Panchayat accounts i.e. receipts and expenditures of Gram Panchayats, MoPR has rolled out an online application – AuditOnline (https://auditonline.gov.in).  This application not only facilitates auditing of Panchayat accounts but also provides for maintaining of audit records. This application streamlines the process for audit inquiries, draft local audit reports, draft audit-paras etc. and thus ensures proper maintenance of accounts by Panchayats to improve transparency and accountability. So far, for audit period 2020-21; 1.65 lakh audit plans have been created and75,044 audit reports have been generated.(b)	Ministry of Panchayati Raj has prepared a Model Panchayat Citizens Charter/ framework for delivery of the services across the 29 sectors, aligning actions with localised Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the Panchayats to adopt & customize. The aim is to provide services to the people in a time bound manner, redressing their grievances and improving their lives. The ‘MeriPanchayat, MeraAdhikaar- Jan SevaayeinHamaareDwaar’ campaign was rolled out from 01st July to 15th August, 2021. The campaign had emerged as an effective strategy for ensuring the Gram Panchayats have a citizen charter approved by the respective Gram Sabhas in place, cataloguing the different categories of services rendered to the citizen by the Panchayat and the time limit for such service. During the campaign, 2.21 lakh Gram Sabha meetings were held for preparing the Citizen Charter.(c)	For attaining the vision of Digital India, BharatNet project is being implemented by Department of Telecommunications in a Phased manner to create network to connect all the Rural Local Bodies (RLBs) (approx. 2.71 lakh RLBs) by broadband in the country. As on 14.03.2022, a total number of 1.76 lakh RLBs (including Block Head Quarters) have been made Service Ready in the country. The scope of BharatNet on 30.06.2021 has been extended upto all inhabited villages beyond GPs in the country.In Madhya Pradesh, 17,760 out of 23,318 Gram Panchayats have been made Service Ready.***
