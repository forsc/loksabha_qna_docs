                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a)	to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. 135 BY DR. RAM SHANKAR KATHERIA TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 28.07.2021 REGARDING RESERVATION OF SEATS THROUGH BIOMETRIC MACHINES(a) to (d): No, Sir. Reservation of seats in general coaches of train is not being done through Bio-metric machines. However, an initiative was taken before the onset of pandemic COVID-19 by Railway Protection Force at some originating stations to use Biometric Token Machines for the purpose of better queue management as a pilot project for the passengers boarding general coaches of selected long distance trains.  The work on pilot project has halted post restoration of train services with effect from May 2020 as all seats/berths including seats in general coaches are treated as reserved seats and are booked through Passenger Reservation System accessed by public through Reservation Counters and IRCTC Portal. Since unreserved passengers are not being permitted to travel at present, queue formation to get seats in unreserved coaches on first come first serve basis is no longer required.*****
