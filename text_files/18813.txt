It is to be implemented for a period of five years from 2020-21 to 2024-25 with an outlay of Rs. 10,000 crores with target to directly assist two lakh micro food processing units with credit linked subsidy. The scheme adopts One District One Product (ODOP) approach to reap benefit of scale in terms of procurement of inputs, availing common services and marketing of products. ODOP approach provides framework for value chain development and alignment of support infrastructure in the scheme. The States identify food product for a district, keeping in perspective the focus of the scheme on perishables. Any perishable agri-produce, cereal based product or a food product widely produced in a district can be ODOP for the district. The scheme envisages field level studies and state level upgradation plans to take care of promotional aspect of food processing industries in different agro-climatic zones.Under ODOP approach of PMFME scheme, 39 districts spread across 18 states/UTs are selected for Olive, strawberry, grapes & Turmeric. Saffron is not yet selected as ODOP for any district. The district wise ODOP for these products are at Annexure. *****
