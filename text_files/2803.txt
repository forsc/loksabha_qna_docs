Further, for every agricultural year (July-June), the Directorate of Economics & Statistics (DES) under Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare releases four Advance Estimates followed by Final Estimate of production of major agricultural crops of the country. The crop-wise and state-wise details of production of cereals, pulses, onions, sugarcane and other foodgrains in the country during the last three years i.e. 2016-17 to 2018-19 (as per 3rd Advance Estimate of foodgrains and 2nd Advance Estimate of onion) are given at Annexure – I.Contd….2/-- 2 -	The first comprehensive assessment of area under cultivation of major crops (both kharif and rabi) in the country during whole agriculture year (i.e. July to June) is available with Second Advance Estimates normally released around mid-February. Therefore, the production data of major crops for current year i.e. 2019-20 is not available.	State-wise per capita net availability per day of cereals, pulses, and other foodgrains is not maintained by this Ministry. However, the per capita net availability per day of cereals, pulses, and other foodgrains in the country during each of the last three years is as under:Crops	Per capita net availability per day (in grams)	2016	2017	2018 (Provisional)Rice	184.2	183.0	186.2Wheat	199.7	182.7	174.4Cereals	443.7	434.0	429.4Pulses	43.0	54.7	54.5Foodgrains	486.8	488.7	484.3	The per capita net availability per day of onion and sugarcane is not available.(c) & (d):	Depending upon several factors including availability of cultivable land, vagaries of nature, agro-climatic conditions, availability of water in reservoir, inter-crop relative profitability, etc, the area coverage of these crops during last three years has been fluctuating.	The details of area coverage under these crops in the country during the last three years i.e. 2016-17 to 2018-19 (as per 3rd Advance Estimate of foodgrains and 2nd Advance Estimate of onion) are given at Annexure-II.(e):	In order to increase acerage and production of major crops, Government has been implementing various schemes viz.
