ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)& (b) Prosopis juliflora commonly called as mesquite has been widely introduced in many parts of the world including India. It has been planted as fuel and fodder species particularly during fuel wood programmes in 1980s. Prosopis juliflora is source of fuelwood, charcoal, timber, fodder, gums and valued as a species for soil conservation and aesthetic purposes. It has economic and soil restoration advantages, and its status as invasive species is site specific.As per information received from Government of Uttar Pradesh, it was introduced in forests of Agra to reclaim ravenous and Usar land (sodic soil) characterized by refractory soil with deep water table and salinity and promotion of rural economy. At some places, it has formed thickets in waste land and forest areas resulting in marginalization of some of native species. At the same time, it has helped some selected wild life by providing protection and highly nutritive diet in form of its pods.(c)	The Ministry provides financial assistance under various Centrally Sponsored Schemes such as Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitat, Project Tiger, Green India Mission, etc., which, inter alia, have provisions for site specific management and control the spread of invasive species. Local forest species are encouraged for plantation in the forest areas giving importance to trees with multiple uses.*****
