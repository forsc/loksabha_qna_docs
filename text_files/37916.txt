                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SHRIMATI ANNPURNA DEVI)(a)The spread of COVID-19 pandemic has impacted school education across the world. Schools in States and Union Territories were closed as a precautionary measure to protect the students from Novel COVID-19 (Corona) virus. This has interrupted the learning of students from pre-school to Grade 12. Education is in the concurrent list of the Constitution of India and majority of the schools are under the domain of the respective State and UT Governments. During pandemic, Ministry of Education had several consultations with the States and UTs to assess the various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic.With a view to addressing the issues related to gaps and/or loss of learning among students, during and after the lockdown, National Council of Educational Research & Training (NCERT) has prepared ‘Alternative Academic Calendar’ which is a week-wise learning plan for grades 1 to 12. It consists of interesting activities and challenges related to topics/themes in the syllabus. It maps the topics/themes with the learning outcomes & facilitates teachers/parents to assess the progress in students’ learning in a variety of ways. Also links for e-resources have been provided for those learners who have access to the internet. NCERT has also developed bridge course modules for out-of-school children including various activities which are helpful for bridging the learning gaps and the States/UTs have also been requested to prepare and implement School Readiness Module/Bridge Course in classrooms for initial one or two months for each grade. Besides, Ministry of Education has shared a comprehensive COVID Action Plan with States/UTs and other stakeholders for mitigating the loss of learning. A National Mission on Foundational Literacy and Numeracy called “National Initiative for Proficiency in Reading with Understanding and Numeracy (NIPUN Bharat)” has been launched by the Ministry of Education on 05.07.2021 under the aegis of Samagra Shiksha. The National Mission lays down priorities and actionable agendas for States/UTs to achieve the goal of proficiency in foundational literacy and numeracy for every child by grade 3. Vidya Pravesh module has been launched for class 1 students. This is a play based 3 months school preparation program for children entering in Class I.In addition, a comprehensive initiative called PM e-VIDYA has been initiated which unifies all efforts related to digital/online/on-air education to enable multi-mode access to education. The initiative includes the following components: ?	DIKSHA the nation’s digital infrastructure for providing quality e-content for school education in states/UTs: and QR coded Energized Textbooks for all grades (one nation, one digital platform) ?	One earmarked Swayam Prabha TV channel per class from 1 to 12 (one class, one channel)?	Extensive use of Radio, Community radio and CBSE Podcast- Shiksha Vani?	Special e-content for visually and hearing impaired, developed on Digitally Accessible Information System (DAISY) and in sign language on NIOS website/ YouTube SWAYAM is a programme initiated by Government of India and designed to achieve the three cardinal principles of Education Policy viz., access, equity and quality. The objective of this effort is to take the best teaching learning resources to all, including the most disadvantaged and to bridge the digital divide for students.Where the digital facility (mobile device/DTH television) is not available, Ministry of Education has taken many initiatives like Community Radio Stations and a podcast called Shiksha Vani of CBSE, Textbooks, worksheet supplied to residence of learners, Handbook on 21st Century Skills and community/mohalla classes. Innovation Funds under Samagra Shiksha have been used to set up mobile school, virtual studios, virtual class rooms in schools, Continuous Learning Plan (CLP), pre-loaded tablets etc. in various States and UTs in remote/rural areas where online classes are difficult. Further, in order to provide continuous professional development opportunities to the teachers at the elementary and secondary level, Ministry of Education launched the NISHTHA online training programme using DIKSHA platform in October 2020.(b)The Ministry of Education has launched an Integrated Centrally Sponsored Scheme for School Education - Samagra Shiksha with effect from 2018-19. It is an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education. It envisages the ‘school’ as a continuum from pre-school, primary, upper primary, secondary to senior secondary levels and supports States and Union Territories in implementation of the RTE Act, 2009. In addition, to reduce gender gaps at all levels of school education, there is a provision of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBVs) under Samagra Shiksha which are residential schools from class VI to XII for girls belonging to disadvantaged groups such as SC, ST, OBC, Minority and Below Poverty Line (BPL). As on 10.03.2022, a total of 5,018 KGBVs are operational with the enrolment of 6,65,130 girls of which 408 KGBVs are operational in Madhya Pradesh with enrollment of 51,593 girls.The number of beneficiaries in Madhya Pradesh benefitting from the educational upliftment schemes and scholarships since 2014-15 till 2020-21 are: 8,49,667 (Pre-Matric Scholarship scheme- 7,12,023, Post Matric Scholarship scheme - 1,18,928 and Merit-cum-Means Scholarship scheme - 18,716).(c)As per information available on Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE+), the enrolment (in schools) of minority students for the years 2017-18, 2018-19 & 2019-20 is tabulated below:<pre>Year	Enrolment2017-18	441756412018-19	444591402019-20	47465328</pre>As per All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE), the enrolment of Minority Students in Higher Education is tabulated below:<pre>Year	Enrolment2017-18	26452362018-19	28271042019-20	2988610</pre> (d)	As per Census-2011, the State-wise data for literacy and illiteracy is available at: https://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/Religion_PCA.html (e) The Ministry of Education was implementing a Scheme for Providing Education to Madrassas/Minorities (SPEMM) comprising Scheme for Providing Quality Education in Madrasas (SPQEM) and the scheme for Infrastructure Development of Minority Institutes (IDMI). SPEMM has now been transferred to the Ministry of Minority Affairs w.e.f. financial year 2021-22 i.e. from 01.04.2021. SPEMM was a voluntary and demand driven scheme. The objective of SPQEM was to provide financial assistance to encourage traditional institutions like Madarsas and Maktabs to introduce modern education through subjects such as Science, Mathematics, Social Studies, Hindi and English in their curriculum through support for a maximum of three teachers and teaching learning material. The objectives of the IDMI is to facilitate education of minorities by augmenting and strengthening school infrastructure in minority institutions (elementary/secondary/senior secondary schools) in order to expand facilities for formal education to children of minority communities.*****
