                                                        MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a) to (e) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. *** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a), (b), (c), (d) AND  (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *293 REGARDING “MIGRATORY SPECIES OF WILDLIFE” BY SHRI SANJAY SADASHIV RAO MANDLIK AND  SHRI SHRIRANG APPA BARNE DUE FOR REPLY ON 13.03.2020(a) India is a key habitat for a large number of migratory  species. In this regard, although, detailed assessments with respect to all migratory species visiting India have not been conducted by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, literatures published by experts including Scientific Institutions suggest that about 460 species of migratory birds visit India, out of which 175 species undertake long distance migration using the Central Asian Flyway (CAF) area. The birds using CAF include  Egyptian vultures, Plovers, Ducks, Storks, Ibises, Flamingoes, Pochards, Sociable Lapwing, European Roller, Eurasian Golden Oriole, etc.  In addition, the other important species that migrate to India include Snow Leopards, Arabian Sea Humpback Whale, Dugongs, Marine Turtles etc.Generally, birds migrate from the northern hemisphere during the winter season to more warmer regions of tropical/equatorial regions. The winter bird visitors arrive in India by October and stay till March/April. The summer migrants usually start coming to India from mid March and remain in India till August. The reasons for migrations to India include availability of better food, conducive habitats and better breeding sites during the migratory seasons.  (b)  No assessment has been carried out to ascertain the fluctuations in the overall number of migratory  species visiting India over different time periods.(c) to (e) The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change provides financial assistance to the States/Union Territories for protection of wildlife and its habitats including migratory species, under the Centrally Sponsored Schemes – Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitat, Project Elephant and Project Tiger. Financial assistance provided to States/Union Territories under the Scheme during the last three years and current year is at  Annexure-1, Annexure-2 and Annexure-3  respectively.Other important initiatives taken by Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for conservation of migratory species include:i.	Several important habitats of migratory species have been declared as Protected Areas.ii.	Rare and endangered migratory species found in India, like Snow Leopard, Olive Ridley Turtles, Great Indian Bustard, Gangetic Dolphin, Dugong, etc. have been listed in Schedule-I of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, thereby providing them highest degree of protection.iii.	Stringent punishments have been provided in the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 for violation of provisions of the Act.iv.	A National Action Plan for conservation of migratory birds along the Central Asian Flyway has been launched.v.	 Local communities have been involved in conservation of migratory species, like Amur Falcon protection in State of Nagaland, Whale Shark protection in Gujarat, Dugong protection in Tamil Nadu, Olive Ridley Turtles in Odisha, etc. vi.	India is a signatory to the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and India has also signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on conservation of species including Siberian Cranes, marine Turtles, Dugongs and Raptors.	***
