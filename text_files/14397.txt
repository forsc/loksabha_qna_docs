ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) :		At present, there is sufficient installed generation capacity to meet power demand of our country. Hydropower, being a flexible source of power, can help in optimal utilisation of other sources of power, particularly the intermittent renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, by providing critical balancing power to the grid.(b) & (c) :	The major bottlenecks encountered in development of hydro power projects are( i) natural calamities, (ii) difficult terrain & poor accessibility, (iii) geological uncertainties, (iv) issues related to land acquisition, rehabilitation & resettlement issues, (v) local agitations/ resistance, (vi) environment and forest clearance, (vii) inter-state issues, (viii) contractual problems, (ix) financing constraints of developers, (x) lack of long term financing instruments, (xi) court cases etc. Government of India, in March 2019, approved a number of measures to counter these challenges and to promote hydropower in the country. These include:-(i)	Declaring Large Hydro Power (LHPs) (> 25 MW projects) as Renewable   Energy source.(ii)	Hydropower Purchase Obligation (HPO) as a separate entity within Non Solar RPO(iii)	Tariff rationalization measures to bring down tariff in the initial years(iv)	Budgetary Support for Flood Moderation (v)	Budgetary Support for Enabling Infrastructure, i.e. roads/bridges.(d) & (e) :		The operational time period of hydro power projects is extended by atleast 25 years by undertaking Renovation, Modernization, Uprating and Life Extension (RMU&LE) measures. During the last three years and the current year (i.e from 2016-17 till  December 2019),  RMU&LE activities were completed for 10 power stations (3 in Central Sector and 7 in State Sector) of capacity 2132.2 MW. This resulted in an additional benefit of 218.8 MW, apart from extended life of 25 years.   Details, in this regard, are given at Appendix. *************
