                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	No Sir, There had been discussing with all Stakeholders regarding agri reforms in the last many years.Contd….2/-- 2 -(b):	There has been continuous demand for reforming agriculture marketing system in India to facilitate farmers in selling their produce for better price realization as has been suggested from time to time by various committees etc. Government of India has been actively and intensively engaging with the States for about two decades for reforms in agriculture marketing sector to provide accessible markets and barrier free trade facilitates for selling their produce at better price anytime anywhere. During COVID-19 lockdown due to disruption of markets and supply chains, there was utmost need to allow free direct marketing outside the mandis to facilitate the farmers in selling their produce near to farm gate at remunerative prices. Government of India vide letter dated 04.04.2020 had requested States/ UTs to facilitate the process of direct marketing for farmers/ group of farmers, FPOs and cooperatives by limiting the regulation under State APMC Act to within physical premises of the notified markets only, while allowing the direct buying facility by bulk buyers/ processors/ big retailers etc outside mandi premises with minimum or without requirement of any licensing or registration process or as decided by States/ UTs. Realizing the immediate need to further facilitate farmers in selling their produce, 06 States (State of Goa, Tripura, Meghalaya, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand) through Ordinance/ Bill route deregulated marketing of fruits and vegetables (direct marketing for fruits & vegetables) as recommended by “The Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2017”. As COVID-19 situation may have a prolonged effect globally on demand side, hence the urgency to bring Ordinance about these laws.(c):	No Sir. The new Farm Acts have no bearing on the policy and process of procurement on MSP.  The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, is for farming agreement of farmers’ produce between farmers and to sponsors and not about contract of farmers’ land. Chapter II Section 8, of the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 states that “No farming agreement shall be entered into for the purpose of – (a) any transfer, including sale, lease and mortgage of the land or premises of the farmer; or (b) raising any permanent structure or making any modification on the land or premises of the farmer, unless the Sponsor agrees to remove such structure or to restore the land to its original condition, at his cost, on the conclusion of the agreement or expiry of the agreement period, as the case may be”. Moreover, Chapter III, section 15 of the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, “no action for recovery of any amount shall be initiated against the agricultural land of the farmer”. (d) & (e):	Farm Acts viz, “The Farmers'' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020” and “The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement On Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020” are intended to provide an ecosystem where the farmers can enjoy the freedom of choice relating to sale of farmers'' produce which facilitates remunerative prices to farmers through competitive alternative channels for selling their produce. These farm Acts will facilitate direct buying from farmers in trade area by traders, processors, exporters, Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), agriculture co-operative Societies etc., so as to facilitate farmers with better price realization due to reduction in supply chain and marketing cost resulting in enhancing farmers’ income and are alignment  with the Government’s plan to double farmers’ income. Contd….3/-- 3 -(f) & (g):	Some of the farmers’ unions have been agitating against newly enacted Farm Acts. The main demands of agitating farmers’ unions regarding the three farm laws, were for their repeal  viz. “The Farmers'' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020”, “The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement On Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020” & “The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020”.So far, 11 rounds of negotiations have been held between the Government and agitating farmer unions to resolve the issues. Details of the meetings are at Annexure-I.
