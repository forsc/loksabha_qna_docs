The performance is assessed for a License Service Area (LSA) as a whole. Separate information on performance on Quality of Services in District or in a particular area such as rural areas is not available. 	  As reported by TSPs, telecom services in the country including rural areas are by and large satisfactory.	  The Government through various schemes/projects under Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) is providing telecommunication services in uncovered villages in the country in a phased manner. Department of Telecommunications (DoT) on the basis of a survey carried out in 2020, has estimated that about  5,72,551 villages out of 5,97,618 inhabited census villages (as per Census – 2011) of the country have mobile network coverage. Out of 5,72,551 mobile covered villages, 5,58,537 villages have high speed mobile internet through 3G/4G technology.	  In the state of Rajasthan, about 42,323 villages out of 43,264 inhabited census villages have mobile network coverage, while 941 inhabited villages do not have mobile network coverage.(c) 	The Government through various schemes/projects under Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) namely (i) Left Wing Extremism(Phase-I & II) projects; (ii) Aspirational Districts scheme; (iii) Commissioning of Submarine Optical Fibre Cable connectivity from Chennai to Andaman & Nicobar Islands; (iv) Scheme for connecting submarine Optical Fibre Cable from Kochi to Lakshadweep Islands; (v) BharatNet (Phase–I & II) projects; (vi) Comprehensive Telecom Development Plan (CTDP) for mobile connectivity in the North Eastern Region; and (vii) Provision of 4G mobile coverage in uncovered villages and seamless 4G mobile coverage of National Highway-4 (earlier NH-223) in Andaman & Nicobar Islands etc., is providing mobile and internet services in the rural areas of the country, including Rajasthan. DoT has also taken several policy initiatives to facilitate infrastructure growth for delivery of quality services. These include permitting trading/sharing/liberalisation of spectrum, permitting passive & active infrastructure sharing, etc. About 16.49 lakh additional Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) for 2G/3G/4G-LTE services have been added by Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) from March 2014 across the country.(d)	TSPs install mobile towers and BTSs to improve coverage and/or capacity of their networks based on their techno-commercial requirements. Around 4,737 BTSs in Churu Constituency in Rajasthan are already providing mobile network connectivity.**************
