ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E RMINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) to (c): 	The National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) provides for coverage of upto 75% of the rural and 50% of the urban population, at all India level, for receiving highly subsidized foodgrains. Corresponding to this coverage, State/Union Territory-wise percentage coverage was determined by the then Planning Commission (Now NITI Aayog) using the 68th round of National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (2011-12), Tendulkar Poverty estimates (2011-2012) and 2011 Population Census data and uniform methodology across states. Using the uniform approach for all the States/UTs, coverage under NFSA for united Andhra Pradesh was fixed at 60.96% of rural and 41.14% of the urban population, which at Census 2011 comes to 459.92 lakh persons.........2/--2-Same percentage coverage was fixed for the new Andhra Pradesh and Telangana post bifurcation  due to data constraint pertaining to state specific poverty estimates for 2011-12 and consequent difficulties in calculating price adjusted consumption expenditure cut off for both states separately.The issue of percentage coverage for the State of new Andhra Pradesh was taken up with the NITI Aayog. NITI Aayog informed that the Consumption Expenditure Survey data is now decade old and results of subsequent Surveys are not yet available, therefore any exercise to determine coverage ratios for Telangana and New Andhra Pradesh based on old data may not be prudent. Besides, as the national coverage under NFSA is capped at 75% in rural areas and 50% in urban areas, any increase in coverage of one State without corresponding decline in coverage of another State is not permissible under the Act. NITI Aayog has suggested to continue with the existing coverage ratios for both the State of Telangana and new Andhra Pradesh until the results of next Household Consumption Expenditure Survey and Census 2021 are available or any other approach is adopted for coverage of beneficiaries under NFSA. At present, no proposal for revision in coverage for the State of Andhra Pradesh is under consideration of the Government.*****
