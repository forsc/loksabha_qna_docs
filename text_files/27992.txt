                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a): 	Under the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan, a key component and objective of the scheme on Integrated Management of Public Distribution System (IM-PDS), at present only 3 States of Assam, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal are yet to be integrated with the national portability cluster of 33 States/UTs so far. (b): 	No sir. All States/UTs have shown their willingness to implement the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan and have shared their respective National Food Security Act (NFSA) ration cards’ data with the central system setup under the initiative.(c): 	So far, the ONORC plan which empowers all NFSA beneficiaries, particularly migrant beneficiaries, is enabled in 33 States/UTs covering about 69 Crore beneficiaries (almost 86.7% NFSA population) in the country to have an option to lift their entitled foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) by using their same existing ration card. (d) & (e): Department had continuously pursued with 3 concerned States of Assam, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal to enable the ONORC plan at the earliest. However, it is dependent up on their achieving the requisite technical readiness i.e. installation of ePoS devices at FPSs, Aadhaar seeding of ration cards, enablement of biometric/Aadhaar authentication of beneficiaries. Further, regular follow-ups are done through videoconferencing, review meetings, time to time DOs &letters from all levels, providing central technical support from NIC to enable the ONORC plan within the validity period of the IM-PDS scheme i.e. up to 31st March 2022. ****
