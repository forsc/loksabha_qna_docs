ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) to (b) : Floods are natural calamity that the country faces almost every year, in varying degrees of magnitude. The occurrence of floods can be attributed to various factors, including wide variations in rainfall both in time and space with frequent departures from the normal pattern, inadequate carrying capacities of rivers, river bank erosion and silting of river beds, landslides, poor natural drainage in flood prone areas, snowmelt and glacial lake out-bursts. Flood management including erosion control falls within the purview of the States. Flood management and anti-erosion schemes are formulated and implemented by concerned State Governments as per their priority. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and also promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. Central Water Commission compiles flood damage data on the basis of information received from States. Flood damage data at District level is not centrally maintained centrally. Statement showing average annual flood damages during last twenty years in State of Bihar is at Annexure-I.(c) to (e)  The river Masan originates in plain areas from Thorikutti village under Ramnagar Block of West Champaran district and meets Sikrahana river at Telpur village in Laurlya block of West Champaran district. The river has a length of about 45 km. in this reach and crosses Don and Triveni Canals. State Government of Bihar has informed that embankments exists on Masan river on the left and right banks for length of about 6.70 Km & 13.87 Km respectively. Further, construction of embankments depends upon on techno-economic feasibility and availability of land for construction of embankments.****** Annexure-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (A) TO (B) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 409 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 03.02.2022 REGARDING “REVIEW OF DEVASTATION CAUSED BY FLOODS”.Annual Average Flood Damage Data during last 20 years 2000-2019 in the State of BiharName of State	BiharArea affected in mha	1.03Population affected in million	6.85Damage to Crops Value in Rs.
