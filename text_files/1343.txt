                                                        MINISTER OF STATE  IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO) (a)	The World Health Organization (WHO) released the WHO Global Ambient Air Quality Database which consists of mainly annual means for PM10 and/or PM2.5, covering more than 4000 human settlements in 108 countries for the years from 2010 to 2016. WHO doesn’t rank countries on the basis of air pollution data. The WHO Report does not report pollution level on all parameters.(b)	The study conducted by Indian Council of Agricultural Research under All India Coordinated Research Project on ‘Long-Term Fertilizer Experiments’ in different soil types (fixed locations) under dominant cropping systems has revealed that even in plots receiving NPK fertilizers, the deficiency of micro and secondary nutrients surfaced after few years affecting soil health and crop productivity. Highest decline in crop yield was observed in plot receiving only Urea.There is possibility of nitrate contamination in ground water above the permissible limit of 10 mg NO3-N /L due to excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers including urea particularly in light textured soils. (c) to (e)	In order to tackle the problems of plastic pollution in the country, the Government has notified Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016.
