The MRP of 45 kg bag of Urea is Rs.242 per bag (exclusive of charges towards neem-coating and taxes as applicable) and the MRP of 50 kg bag of Urea is Rs.268 per bag (exclusive of charges towards neem coating and taxes as applicable). The difference between the delivered cost of Fertilizers at farm gate and net market realization by the urea units is given as subsidy to the Urea manufacture/importer by the Govt. of India. Accordingly, all farmers are getting Urea at affordable subsidized price.With respect to Phosphatic and Potassic (P&K) Fertilizers, the D/o Fertilizers is providing subsidy on P&K Fertilizers. Further, as far as P&K is concerned, the Government has implemented Nutrient Based Subsidy Policy w.e.f. 1.4.2010 for Phosphatic and Potassic (P&K) Fertilizers.  Under the policy, a fixed amount of subsidy, decided on annual basis, is provided on subsidised P&K fertilizers depending on their nutrient content. Under this policy, MRP is fixed by fertilizer companies as per market dynamics at reasonable level which is monitored by the Government. Accordingly, any farmer including a poor and marginal farmer who is buying these fertilizers is getting benefits of subsidy.Details of the subsidy annexed at Annexure-I.Contd…2/--2-(ii) Seeds The Department is implementing Sub-Mission on Seeds & Planting Materials (SMSP) from the year 2014-15 to promote production and multiplication of quality seeds of agricultural crops, so that the required quantities of seeds could be made available to farmers in the country. To upgrade the quality of farmers’ saved seeds, financial assistance for distribution of foundation/certified seeds at 50% cost of the seeds for cereal crops and 60% for pulses, oilseeds, fodder and green manure crops for production of quality seeds is available /provided for one acre per farmer under the component Seed Village Programme of SMSP. The objective of this scheme is to make available improved /high yielding varieties of seeds to farmers in time and to achieve self sufficiency in respect of seeds at village level itself.The above scheme/ component is demand driven and implemented by the concerned State/implementing agencies for welfare of all the categories of farmers which help in enhancing productivity/production of various crops and also improving profitability of the agriculture sector (farmers’ income) in the country.  Details of the subsidy State-wise is annexed at Annexure-II.(iii)     Mechanization & Technology(A)    A Sub Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) is being implemented w.e.f. 2014-15.
