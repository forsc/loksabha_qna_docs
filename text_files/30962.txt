ANSWER




                                                        (a)       Ministry promotes establishment of model and aspirational skill centres known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) in every district for imparting skill training in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode throughout the country. As on date, 813 PMKKs have been planned and sanctioned across the country; Out of which, 717 PMKKs have been established, 42 PMKKs are under establishment while 54 PMKKs have been surrendered. The delay in setting up of remaining PMKKs was majorly due to COVID-19 induced lockdown and restrictions. Presently, as there is some ease in restrictions, the Training Partners have been advised to initiate/complete the establishment process. (b)       Above reply of Part (a) may be referred.  (c)        As on date, no study has been conducted for evaluating the impact of Covid-19 disruptions on the performance of PMKKs. (d)       54 PMKKs were closed / surrendered during the last year and National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) under the aegis of the Ministry is making efforts for re-allocation of the surrendered/closed PMKKs.
