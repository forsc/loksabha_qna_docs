Oil & gas CPSEs and their Joint Ventures/subsidiaries have started/resumedover 8000 economic activities/projects, progressively since 20.04.2020. These includeprojects and activities in upstream, midstream and downstream sector. These projects ingeneral make available employment opportunities in direct as well as indirect forms duringthe construction and operational phase. The State-wise breakup of major ongoing projects ofoil & gas CPSEs / JVs including offshore projects is given at Annexure.Page 2 of 4(c) The cost of the projects in the State of Maharashtra is Rs 39,496 crore which are undervarious stages of implementation. In the State of Andhra Pradesh, cost of ongoing projects isRs 38,514 crore.(d) Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas has given special impetus to resume Oil andNatural Gas projects across the country. The projects are being monitored and reviewed bysenior officials on a continuous basis including Hon’ble Minister (PNG) & Steel at regularintervals. Ministry is also actively facilitating clearances/support required by Oil & Gascompanies from State Governments/regulatory bodies etc.(e) Oil and Gas sector, with its backward and forward linkages, is a key driver ofeconomic growth and, therefore, these projects will provide boost to the national economy.The amount spent on these projects would create a virtuous cycle of investments and willcertainly play a crucial rule in revival of Indian economy and will also provide employmentopportunities to people of our country.*************
