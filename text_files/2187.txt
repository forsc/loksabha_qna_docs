ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS &  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) and (b): The Election Commission of India has proposed that there should be ceiling on Party’s expenditure in all elections on the lines of the cap of expenditure for the candidates. The proposal is under examination of the Government. (c) and (d): No empirical data are  available to prove that the increase in expenditure on elections over the year is attributable to the conduct of separate elections to Lok Sabha and the State Legislative Assemblies. The Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice in its 79th Report has observed that simultaneous elections would reduce the massive expenditure incurred for conduct of separate elections  every year.
