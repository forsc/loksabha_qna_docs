                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY) (a) to (c):  “Police” and “Public Order” are State subjects as per the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. Therefore, State Police has the primary responsibility of prevention, detection, registration, investigation and prosecution of crimes. Besides, the Central Government has also entrusted 94 cases of terror funding to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for investigation, so far. The whole gamut of terror financing has been criminalised under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, which is the principal legal regime against terrorism including terror financing. The Law Enforcement Agencies of the Centre and the States take action against offences of terror financing as per the extant provisions of law. *****
