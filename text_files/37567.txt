BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a)	& (b):  Public Health and Hospitals is a state subject, however, the Central Government has taken several initiatives for supplementing the efforts of the State for providing quality and affordable healthcare services to the people. The National Health Policy formulated in 2017 envisages to provide universal access to good quality health care services through increasing access, increasing affordability by lowering the cost of healthcare delivery and equity. The policy envisages as its goal the attainment of the highest possible level of health and well being for all at all ages, through a preventive and promotive health care orientation in all developmental policies, and universal access to good quality health care services without anyone having to face financial hardship as a consequence.Under National Health Mission, the Government has taken many steps towards universal health coverage, by supporting the State Government in providing accessible & affordable healthcare to people. It encompasses the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) as its two Sub-Missions. Under the National Health Mission, financial and technical support is provided to States/UTs to provide accessible, affordable and quality healthcare, especially to the poor and vulnerable sections of the population, in both urban and rural areas. The National Health Mission provides support for improvement in health infrastructure, availability of adequate human resources to man health facilities, to improve availability and accessibility to quality health care especially for the underserved and marginalized groups in rural areas. The Government has launched four mission mode projects, namely PM-Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM), Ayushman Bharat Health & Wellness Centres (ABHWCs), Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) and Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM).PM-ABHIM was launched as a mission to develop the capacities of primary, secondary, and tertiary health care systems, strengthen existing national institutions, and create new institutions, to cater to detection and cure of new and emerging diseases. PM-ABHIM is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme with some Central Sector Components, for implementation of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Package for health sector with an outlay of Rs 64,180 crore.  Under Ayushman Bharat Health & Wellness Centres(HWCs), Comprehensive Primary healthcare by strengthening Sub Health Centres (SHCs) and Primary Health Centres (PHCs) are facilitated. The HWCs are to provide preventive, promotive, rehabilitative and curative care for an expanded range of services encompassing Reproductive and child care services, Communicable diseases, Non-communicable diseases and all health issues.
