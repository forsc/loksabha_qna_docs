MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) to (d): Delhi Police has instituted a number of measures to both prevent and expeditiously detect crimes against women, of which the major ones include launch of the ‘Himmat Plus’ app, stationing of women PCR vans in vulnerable areas, exclusive women help desk in Police Stations, dedicated women helpline number, regular liaison with civic   agencies  for  removal  of  dark   patches,  constitution  of  Police -2-LS.US.Q. No. 452 for 25.06.2019Station-level women safety committees and the ‘Sashakti’ programme for imparting self-defence training to women/girls.  2.

In order to improve conviction rate in respect of crimes against women, the steps taken include separation of investigation from law & order  and general duties, resulting in better quality of investigation; creation of legal cells in all Police Districts and Police Head Quarters to monitor the progress of cases pending in courts and for taking urgent corrective measures in respect thereof; regular training of Investigating Officers; and, pursuing heinous cases through specialized units such as Crime Branch, Special Cell, etc., which have highly professional investigating officers.  -3-LS.US.Q.
