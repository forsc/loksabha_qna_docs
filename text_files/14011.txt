ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c):  Yes, Sir. Request for construction of Road over Bridge (ROB) in lieu of Level Crossing (LC) No. 32 at Km 56/4-5 at Narketpally between Chityal and Srirampuram railway stations has been received. However, this LC does not qualify for ROB on cost sharing basis, as traffic density at this LC is less than one Lakh. However, ROB at this location can be constructed on deposit terms provided State Government agrees to bear complete cost of construction and maintenance subject to its feasibility. No proposal in this regard has been received from State Government.The work of ROB in lieu of LC No. 80 at Km 436/11-13 at Mahabubabad Station between Warangal and Dornakal junction has been sanctioned on cost sharing basis with State Government. Construction of ROB is not feasible at location of the existing LC. Therefore, new alignment has been finalized in consultation with State Government at 750 meters away from this LC. General Arrangement Drawing (GAD) is under scrutiny and estimate is under preparation.*****
