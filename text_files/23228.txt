                                                        MINISTER OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI  D.V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a) & (b):	The gap between assessed requirement and the indigenous production of various fertilizers is bridged through imports. In case of urea, the import is done through the designated State Trading Enterprises (STEs) while the import of P&K comes under Open General License (OGL) wherein the companies import the fertilizers based on their commercial judgements. The Country is 100% dependent on import of Potash while in case of urea and other P&K fertilizers, the gap between assessed requirement and the indigenous requirement is met through the imports. The import of various fertilizers during last three years is as given below:Import of fertilizers (Urea, DAP, MOP & NPK) during the Year 2017-18 to 2019-20                                                                              <Qty in LMT>Year	            Urea	DAP	MOP	NPK	                       (As reported by the companies)2017-18	            59.75	42.17	47.36	4.992018-19	            74.81	66.02	42.14	5.462019-20 	    91.23	48.70	36.70	7.46(c) to (e):  There is no such proposal in the Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) under Department of Fertilizers for setting up of indigenous manufacturing units to reduce the dependency of imports for potash and phosphates.However, the Phosphatic and Potassic fertilizers are decontrolled and are under Open General License (OGL). Accordingly, Department does not interfere in the commercial decisions of the companies for setting up of indigenous manufacturing units for producing P&K fertilizers. ********
