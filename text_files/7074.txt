                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR SHIPPING(SHRI MANSUKH MANDAVIYA) (a)& (b)    In addition to the five existing National Waterways (NWs), 106 new NWs were declared under the National Waterways Act, 2016 which was notified on 12.04.2016.   Prior to the declaration of new NWs, under the proposed legislation, inter Ministerial consultations, including with NITI Aayog and Ministry of Finance were held.  The National Waterways Bill, 2015 was also deliberated by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture which presented its recommendations to Parliament in its 223rd Report.   The National Waterways Bill, 2015 was approved by Union Cabinet and passed by Parliament as National Waterways Act, 2016.(c)	National Waterway (NW)-1 (Ganga-Bhagirathi-Hooghly river system from Allahabad to Haldia), NW-2 (River Brahmaputra from Dhubri to Sadiya), NW-3 (West Coast Canal from Kottapuram to Kollam along with Udyogmandal and Champakara Canals) have been developed with fairway navigational aids, jetties and terminals with mechanized equipment handling facilities for loading and unloading of cargo. These NWs are operational and vessels are plying on them.  In addition, NW-10 (River Amba), NW-68 (River Mandovi), NW-73 (River Narmada), NW-83 (Rajpuri Creek), NW-85 (Revadanda Creek-Kundalika River System), NW-91 (Shastri river–Jaigad creek system), NW-97 (Sunderbans Waterways), NW-100 (River Tapi) and NW-111 (River Zuari) are also operational. The Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) is being implemented at an estimated cost of Rs. 5369.18 crore for capacity augmentation of navigation on the Haldia–Varanasi stretch of NW-1 with the technical and financial assistance of the World Bank.  Projects worth Rs. 1800 crore (approx.) have commenced on ground in a time period of three years after statutory clearances. Fairway development works on the Vijayawada–Muktyala stretch of river Krishna (Part of NW-4) has commenced at a cost of Rs. 96 crore. Based on the outcome of techno-economic feasibility and Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) prepared for 106 new NWs, technical interventions have been planned for safe navigation and shipping on technically viable NWs by the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI).   As per the DPRs completed so far for the new NWs, 36 NWs have been found to be technically viable and development activities have been initiated on 10 NWs viz. NW-9, NW-16, NW-27, NW-37, NW-40, NW-58, NW-68, NW-86, NW-97 and NW-111.To develop the NWs, the Government provides funds to the Inland Waterways Authority of India as Grants-in-aid and had permitted IWAI to raise Government of India fully serviced Bonds (Extra Budgetary Resources) of Rs. 1000 crore.   In this regard, the details of Budgetary Estimates, Revised Estimates and Expenditure during the last five years are given below:(Rs. in crore)	<pre>Year	Budget Estimate	      Revised Estimate	Exp.2015-16	323.19 (Grants)	321.91(Grants)	321.912016-17	BE 391.01 (Grants)+EBRs 340.00	RE 362.31 (Grants)+EBRs 340.00	358.41 (Grants)+237.32 (EBRs)2017-18	     270.00 (Grants)+660.00 (EBRs)	426.0914 (Grants)+660.00 (EBRs)	426.0914 (Grants)+335.2686 (EBRs)2018-19	480.00 (Grants)	862.49 (Grants)	862.49 (Grants)+111.94 (EBRs)2019-20	750.36 (Grants)	N.A.	374.47 (up to 30.09.2019)	 </pre>						(d): The present status of interlinking of rivers in the country as reported by the Ministry of Jal Shakti is at Annex.AnnexurePresent status of interlinking of rivers in the countryThe National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August, 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins.   Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component and 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs).  The details of above river linking projects viz., rivers, States concerned, present status are given at Appendix.Under the NPP, four priority links have also been identified for preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPR) under the Peninsular Rivers Component viz; Ken-Betwa link project (KBLP), Damanganga-Pinjal link project, Par-Tapi-Narmada link project and Godavari-Cauvery link project.  Based on the concurrence of the concerned States, DPRs of KBLP, Damanganga-Pinjal link project and Par-Tapi-Narmada link project have been completed and sent to concerned States.Further, draft DPR of Godavari-Cauvery link project consisting of three links viz; Godavari (Inchampalli/ Janampet)-Krishna (Nagarjunasagar), Krishna (Nagarjunasagar)-Pennar (Somasila), Pennar (Somasila)-Cauvery (Grand Anicut) link projects has been completed and circulated to party States in March, 2019.Various statutory clearances except Stage-II forest clearance & clearance from Central Empowered Committee (CEC) of Hon’ble Supreme Court have been accorded for components under KBLP Phase-I. The clearances for the projects proposed under KBLP Phase-II are in advanced stages. The comprehensive DPR of KBLP has been completed and circulated to Governments of Uttar Pradesh (U.P.) and Madhya Pradesh (M.P.).  Draft Memorandum of Agreement for implementation of KBLP has been sent to Governments of M.P. and U.P. for concurrence.     The techno-economic clearance to the Damanganga-Pinjal link project has also been accorded subject to statutory clearances. The DPR of Par-Tapi-Narmada is under technical appraisal in Central Water Commission.  Draft MoU for implementation of Damanganga-Pinjal and Par-Tapi-Narmada link projects has also been sent to Governments of Maharashtra and Gujarat for concurrence.Integration of Himalayan Component with Peninsular Component is also explored.The Government is pursuing the Inter-Linking of Rivers (ILR) program in a consultative manner.   A “Special Committee on Interlinking of Rivers” has been constituted in September, 2014 under the Chairmanship of Hon`ble Minister of WR, RD & GR (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) for the implementation of ILR programme.  Sixteen meetings of the Special Committee for ILR have been held so far (last meeting held on 21.08.2019).  Further, a Task Force for Interlinking of Rivers has been constituted by MoWR, RD & GR (now MoJS) in April, 2015.  Eleven meetings of the Task Force for interlinking of rivers have been held so far and the last meeting was held on 18.10.2019.  Vigorous efforts have been made for generating consensus with development of alternative plans and also setting out road maps for implementation of mature projects.AppendixPresent status of Inter Basin Water Transfer Links, the States involved, name of rivers and status of Feasibility Reports/ Detailed Project Report<pre>Sl.
