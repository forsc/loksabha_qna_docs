ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) No, Sir. Vocational education courses are not losing their relevance, rather the vocational courses are gaining importance in the current education system as these courses enable students to learn vocational skills and gain practical knowledge through on-job-training thereby enhancing their employability.(b) & (c) No, Sir.(d) National Education Policy 2020 has focussed on re-invigorating vocational courses by integrating them into all school & higher education institutions. In this respect, University Grants Commission (UGC) has issued guidelines for the Apprenticeship/internship embedded Under Graduate (UG) program in the general stream in August 2020. The curriculum in each of the semester/year of the skill programs is a suitable mix of general education and skill development components. This includes practical classes in laboratories/ workshops, internships, apprenticeships, and other forms of hands-on training.*****
