Health being a state subject, state governments are expected to take prompt measures for prevention and containment of outbreaks due to seasonal diseases including necessary facilities for diagnosis and medicines for treatment of the patients.                 The incidence of these diseases is monitored through Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme & National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme at national level as per the data reported by states. Depending on seasonality, required technical support, treatment protocols and advisories are also provided to the state by Government of India for effective management of diseases.                The Government of India further provides financial and technical support under the National Health Mission and various other tertiary sector schemes to the States / UTs for strengthening their healthcare delivery system including support for provision of essential drugs free of cost to those who access public health facilities.  (c): As and when any disease outbreak occurs, the same is reported from the respective districts on the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) platform.  The outbreaks reports submitted by States to Central Surveillance Unit of IDSP do not have any rural, semi-urban or urban breakup.  (d):  Under Free Drugs Service Initiative (FDSI) of National Health Mission, financial support is provided to States / UTs for provision of free essential medicines in public health facilities based on the requirements posted by them in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) within their overall resource envelope. All the States/UTs have reported that they have notified free drug policy in their respective States/UTs.The number of essential medicines to be provided free of cost is decided by the States and varies from State to State. However, the Ministry has provided illustrative list of essential medicines that should be provided at Sub Centres, Primary Health Centres, Community Health Centres and District Hospitals. The list is available in public domain at http://nhsrcindia.org/sites/default/files/Facility%20wise%20essential  %20Medicine%2006%20July-16.pdf.
