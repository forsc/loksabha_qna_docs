(b)       PMKVY has two training components, namely, Short-Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). STT is linked to placement, while RPL does not mandate placements as it recognizes the existing skills of candidates. Under STT-PMKVY, in the last three years (2018-21),  1.22 lakh (0.94 lakh female and 0.28 male) candidates have been, as on 10.07.2021, certified in the State of Tamil Nadu; out of which 0.82 lakh (0.63 lakh female and 0.19 male) candidates have been placed. (c)        Under PMKVY, during the last three years (2018-21), the total budgetary allocation was Rs. 5,230.05 crore; out of which, Rs. 5,037.19 crore was disbursed to implementing agencies, i.e., the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) for Central component, and State Skill Development Mission (SSDM) / State Governments for the State component for the implementation of the PMKVY across the country including the State of Tamil Nadu.                Out of total disbursed funds in last three years (2018-21) under PMKVY, Rs. 172.43 crore (Rs. 138 crore under Central Component and Rs. 34.43 crore under State Component) was disbursed for the implementation of the scheme in the State of Tamil Nadu.  (d)       Ministry promotes establishment of model and aspirational skill centre known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) for imparting skill training in every district of the country, including  the district of Perambalur in the State of Tamil Nadu. Ministry through NSDC provides funding support upto 75% of the project investment for establishment of a PMKK in a district.                Also, under STT-PMKVY, training centres (TCs) are empanelled for imparting short duration training across the country, including the district of Perambalur in the State of Tamil Nadu. Under RPL-PMKVY, candidates are oriented in camps, employer premises, PMKKs and large/medium enterprises. (e)               Till now, in the State of Tamil Nadu, 35 PMKKs have been established, including 1 PMKK in the district of Perambalur. Also, under STT-PMKVY, 2,325 TCs have been empanelled in the State of Tamil Nadu, including 27 TCs in the district of Perambalur.
