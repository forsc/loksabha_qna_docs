ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AYUSH (SHRI SARBANANDA SONOWAL)(a) The number of AYUSH hospitals and dispensaries that are functional at present in the country, State-wise is furnished at Annexure-I.(b) Public Health being a State subject, setting up of more AYUSH centres/hospitals in the country including West Bengal comes under the purview of respective State/UT Governments including West Bengal. However, under Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National AYUSH Mission (NAM), there is provision of financial assistance for setting up of 50 /30 /10 beddedintegrated AYUSH hospitals. State/UT Government may avail financial assistance by submitting the proposal through State Annual Action Plan (SAAP) as per NAM guidelines. (c) The total amount of funds sanctioned/released under the National AYUSH Mission during the last three years, State/UT-wise including West Bengal is furnished at Annexure-II. However, no grant-in-aid is released district-wise.(d) to (f) Under NAM, the number of new AYUSH hospitals sanctioned/approved in various parts of the country including Tamil Nadu during last three years and current yearand status of construction work is furnished at Annexure-III. Since implementation of NAM comes under purview of respective States/UTs including Tamil Nadu, therefore Ministry of Ayushhas not fixed the timeline for the completion of construction of sanctioned/approved hospitals.
