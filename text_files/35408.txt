                                                        MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (d) A statement is laid on the Table of the House. ****** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 242 RAISED BY SHRI DHARAMBIR SINGH, HON’BLE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT TO BE ANSWERED ON 21/03/2022 REGARDING KENDRIYA VIDYALAYAS / NAVODAYA VIDYALAYAS IN HARYANA. (a) to (d) Opening of new Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) and Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) is a continuous process. The proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations and committing resources for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities found fulfilling the mandatory pre-requisites for opening of new KVs have to compete with other such proposals under the “Challenge Method” and subject to approval of the competent authority. KVs are not opened on the criteria of district-wise. During the last 3 years i.e. from 2018-19 to 2020-21 and current year, 3 new KVs have been made functional in the State of Haryana. District-wise details are given hereunder:-<pre>Sl. No. 	Name of District	Name of KV	Year of opening1.	Sonipat	G.C.,CRPF Sonipat	2019-20202.	Gurugram	G.C., CRPF Kadarpur	2019-20203.	Yamunanagar	Bilaspur	2021-2022</pre>3 districts in the State of Haryana do not have any KVs namely Kaithal, Nuh and Charkhi-Dadri. The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country.   Opening of new JNVs is a continuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government/UT administration to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of the permanent building and making available required temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed.  However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV depends on the availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority.  All the districts (as on 31st May, 2014) of the States / UTs, which have accepted the scheme, have been covered under this Scheme. Out of 22 districts of Haryana State, 21 districts created / carved out as on 31.05.2014, have been covered under Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme. One district namely Charkhi Dadri has no JNV.*****
