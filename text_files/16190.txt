                                                        MINSTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a):  The import data from China for the period November 2018-February 2019 vis-a-vis imports during corresponding period in 2019-20 are as under:  (Rs. Crore)Apr-18 to Oct-18	Apr-19 to Oct-19	Nov-18	Nov-19	Dec-18	Dec-19	Jan-19	Jan-20	Feb-19	Feb-202,96,000	2,93,000	41,454	36,633	39,092	35,675	44,043	42,955	36,478	35,494Nov-18 to Feb-19- Rs. 1,61,067 croresNov-19 to Feb-20- Rs. 1,50,757 croresThere is a general trend of imports declining from China in the entire Financial Year.(b) and (c):  As reported by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, presently out of total electronics goods imports in the country, approximately 40% are from China and 17% from Hong Kong. These imports are largely in the nature of components that go into manufacturing of sub-assemblies and final products. Due to recent outbreak of Coronavirus in China, there is an impact on supply of such components due to disruption in supply chain. However, the Government has taken various measures to contain the disruption in supply chain which includes: •	Facilitating the industry to lift consignments from China to India after taking adequate health and safety precautions. •	For exploring the sources of import of such components from other countries, the industry associations have been advised to organize buyer-seller meets to explore such avenues. However, in view of spread of Corona virus to other geographies, this has not materialized substantially. •	Clarification has been issued to consider Corona virus outbreak in China or any other country as a case of natural calamity and Force Majeure clause may been invoked wherever considered appropriate.(d):   To mitigate difficulties faced by trade and industry in the contextual situation, Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs has directed all custom stations as well as testing labs to function on 24x7 basis till the end of May, 2020. The field formations have been advised to show greater sensitivity in dealing with cargo from affected areas and waive late fee arising due to delayed receipt of documents in genuine cases.(e):    The Hon’ble Finance Minister has interacted with various stakeholders to discuss the problems being faced by trade and industry in the wake of spread of coronavirus in China. Several issues were raised during the interaction requiring suitable action from different Ministry/Department/Agencies of the Government. Subsequently, these issues were discussed with concerned Ministries/Departments/ Agencies in a meeting convened by Hon’ble Finance Minister on 20.02.2020. Directions given in the meeting are as per Annexure.(f):    However, as regards excise duty, at present there is no such proposal.*****
