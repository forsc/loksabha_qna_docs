ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING (RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a) Government has decided not to operate the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) for two years, that is, during FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22 and decided to place the MPLADS funds FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22 at the disposal of the Ministry of Finance for strengthening its efforts in managing the challenges of COVID-19 which has been declared as a global pandemic and a notified disaster in the country.(b) The Ministry has issued detailed circular on 08.04.2020 containing instructions wherein inter alia Hon’ble Members have been requested to re-prioritize their recommendations in consultation with District Authorities, wherever feasible, and District Authorities have also been advised to ensure that works are completed from among the available funds as no more funds would be released during FY 2020-21 and 2021-22. The Ministry has issued another set of instructions dated 14.05.2020 to the Nodal district authorities for settlement and closure of savings bank accounts of former MPs of Lok Sabha and former Members of Rajya Sabha so that unspent balance in their account can be used by the respective constituencies/ states where funds are required as per MPLADS guidelines. (c) and (d) Government is aware that MPLADS instalments  of 16th  Lok Sabha pertaining to some constituencies are pending for release; due to non-fulfilment of eligibility criteria and non-submission of requisite documents. However, the Ministry has released the instalments of 16th Lok Sabha till the end of FY 2019-20, to those Nodal Districts which fulfilled the eligibility criteria and submitted the requisite documents necessary for release of instalments.  Since, the Government has decided not to operate MPLADS for two years, that is, during FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22 and decided to place the funds for FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22 at the disposal of the Ministry of Finance for strengthening its efforts in managing the challenges of COVID 19, there shall be no release of installments during FY 2020-21 and FY 2021-22 including installments pending upto 31.03.2020.                                                   *****
