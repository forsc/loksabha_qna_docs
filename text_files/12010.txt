                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE; MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MINISTER OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????; ??????? ?? ???????????? ??????; ?? ?????? ??????? ??????(??. ???? ?????)(a) & (b):    A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT AS REFERRED IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (b) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 86 FOR 07.02.2020 REGARDING POLICY TO REGULATE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE(a) & (b):  The Hon’ble Finance Minister in his budget speech for 2018-19 mandated NITI Aayog to establish the National Programme on Artificial Intelligence with a view to guiding the Research and Development in new and emerging technologies. 	NITI Aayog, after extensive consultation with various ministries and leading academicians, institutions, practitioners and industry players, has released India’s National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence in June 2018.The Strategy has outlined India’s proposed efforts in research, development, adoption and skilling in AI. NITI Aayog’s National Strategy on Artificial Intelligence (NSAI) discusses the following: i.	A Task Force led jointly by M/o Electronics and Information Technology and NITI Aayog for the development of a template of the required legal and regulatory framework in the domain of Artificial Intelligence.ii.	NSAI details the following barriers:a)	Lack of broad based expertise in research and application of AI,b)	Absence of enabling data ecosystems – access to intelligent data,c)	High resource cost and low awareness for adoption of AI,d)	Privacy and security, including a lack of formal regulations around anonymization of data, ande)	Absence of collaborative approach to adoption and application of AI.iii.	Data is one of the primary drivers of AI solutions, and thus appropriate handling of data, ensuring privacy and security is of prime importance. Challenges include data usage without consent, risk of identification of individuals through data, data selection bias and the resulting discrimination of AI models, and asymmetry in data aggregation. The NSAI suggests establishing data protection frameworks and sectorial regulatory frameworks, and promotion of adoption of international standards.                                                    ********
