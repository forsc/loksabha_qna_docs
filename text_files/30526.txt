ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE					(SHRI AJAY BHATT)IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE   (a) to (c):  The representation of women in the defence forces is as follows:Army	Navy	Air Force0.59% (including AMC/ADC/MNS)	6%*	1.08%* Figures are in respect of Women Officers only as women are inducted at officer level presently.Post Hon’ble Supreme Court order dated 17th February, 2020, Women Officers are being granted Permanent Commission in 10 Arms/Services of Indian Army subject to their meeting the Qualitative Requirement (QR) alongwith the Short Service Commissioned Men Officers.  Women Officers are also being inducted in Army Aviation Corps as Pilots from June 2021 onwards.The Government has sanctioned for enrolment of 1700 women in Corps of Military Police in a phased manner.  The induction of women has commenced from the year 2020.  First batch of women Military Police personnel have completed their training and reported to units. The Defence Forces have opened entry for women candidates in NDA, allowing girls to appear in NDA entrance exams from July 2022 courses onwards.  For the first batch, written exam has been conducted on 14th November, 2021.  The Indian Air Force (IAF) undertakes various induction publicity measures to encourage youth including women to join IAF.  Modules like direct contact programme, print and electronic media is extensively used to create awareness about IAF and educate students about various mode of entries.Women officers in Indian Navy are appointed onboard warships.  Currently 29 women officers are appointed to ships.  Until 2019, women officers were being commissioned as Pilots and Observers only for shore based aircraft.  However, in order to employ women at par with male officers, women officers have also been streamed as specialist Observers into helicopters commencing 2020.  Provost specialisation has been opened up for women officers since 2020 and the first woman Provost officer has joined the specialisation in March 2021 after successful completion of At-Arms course.The Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) stream has been opened up for women officers.  The first woman officer has joined RPA squadron in March 2021.  One woman officer has been appointed as ADA, Moscow in June 2020.  One woman observer officer has been deputed overseas to Maldives in September 2020, as part of Dornier aircrew for a period of one year.  In addition, women officers are also deputed abroad for shorter durations as part of mobile Training Teams and other foreign cooperation engagements.Unlike officers, all sailors’ Branches/Specialisations are seagoing and serve onboard ships.  Onboard ships, personnel (both officers & sailors) stay in close proximity with open WC/bathing systems.  Therefore, the induction of women is limited to availability of gender exclusive infrastructure.*****
