                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	& (b): Representations from block rubber processing industry has been received requesting to permit import of rubber cup lumps. Import of rubber cup lump is not permitted as only types and forms of rubber having technical standards by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) or any other recognised body can be imported into the country as per Notification No.S.O.1205 (E) dated 12.12.2001. Further, since rubber cup lumps are unprocessed material, there are sanitary and phytosanitary concerns too.(c)	& (d): There is no proposal under consideration to conduct a study on import of rubber cup lump. ****
