ANSWER




(a) & (b): Yes, Sir. The details of Central Assistance sanctioned and released along with number of houses sanctioned, grounded for construction and completed for rehabilitation of slum dwellers during last three years and current year under various schemes viz. Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban (PMAY-U) Mission are at Annexure-I. The State/ Union Territories (UTs) – wise details of homeless population in India, as per Census 2011, are at Annexure-II. (c): The suggestions/ proposals from various States/ UTs regarding a policy for rehabilitation of slums have already been considered by the Union Government and based on the suggestions/ proposals  received one component namely “In-situ” Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) has already been incorporated under PMAY-U Mission. The PMAY-U Mission is being implemented since June, 2015 to provide Central Assistance to States/ UTs/ Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) for providing all weather pucca houses with basic civic infrastructures like water, sanitation, sewerage, road, electricity etc. to all eligible urban households including slum dwellers. The ISSR component under PMAY-U Mission mandates use of land as a resource for providing houses to slum dwellers. Pursuant to the issuance of PMAY-U Mission guidelines, the Union Government has written to all State Governments and Central Government land owning Ministries/ Departments to explore the possibilities of rehabilitation of slums on their lands and seek Central Assistance under PMAY-U Mission. Funds are released to States/ UTs on the basis of their project proposals received under PMAY(U) Mission.                                *****
