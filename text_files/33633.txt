ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a)	Government is aware of outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) in the country. While outbreaks of LSD were observed in 6 (six) States / UTs (Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Haryana, Delhi), outbreaks of FMD have been observed in 24 (twenty four) States /UTs (Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Ladakh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal). (b) The details of the deaths of the livestock due to various animal diseases State/ UT –wise and disease wise in the country for the last five years are placed at Annexure – I(1-8).(c) Animal Husbandry is a State subject and the Department supplements efforts of States / UTs by providing them financial assistance. Department implements a Central Sector Scheme, namely Livestock Health and Disease Control Programme in all States/UTs with the aim of reducing risk to animal health by prophylactic vaccination against animal diseases, capacity building of Veterinary Services, disease surveillance and strengthening veterinary infrastructure. Department provides 100% funds for vaccination against FMD, Brucellosis, Peste des Petits Ruminants and Classical Swine Fever as well as for procurement and customization of Mobile Veterinary Units (MVUs). However, for non-recurring expenditure on operating the MVUs as well as for vaccination against other animal diseases as prioritized by the States / UTs, the funding pattern between Centre and States is 60: 40 (90:10 for North Eastern and Hilly States and 100% for UTs). (d): The details of the funds released by the Government for above said programmes and the amount spent during the last five years are placed at Annexure – II(1-2) (e): ICAR – National Institute of High Security Animal Disease (NIHSAD), Bhopal is a referral laboratory for diagnosis of exotic and emerging animal diseases like Avian Influenza, LSD, African Swine Fever (ASF). Further, ICAR-National Research Centre on Equines and ICAR-International Centre for FMD serve as referral centres for equine diseases and FMD, respectively. In addition, Central and Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratories are also involved in disease diagnosis. However, there is a need for more high security animal disease laboratories in the country in the wake of emerging, re-emerging and exotic, including zoonotic diseases.Further, as Animal Husbandry is a State subject, States / UTs purchase, store and provide medicines to animals to handle animal diseases as per their requirements, disease prevalence and epidemiological situation.  (f): No Sir. No hotspots for animal disease outbreaks have been identified. However, ICAR-National Institute for Veterinary Epidemiology and Disease Informatics (NIVEDI) provides livestock disease forewarning to alert the animal husbandry departments both at national and state level.
