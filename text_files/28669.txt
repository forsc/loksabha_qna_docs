ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a)        Yes, Sir. (b)       The Department of Commerce is implementing Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES), under which assistance is provided for creating infrastructure for exports, including storage facilities required for export of grains. The Agricultural & Processed Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) also provides assistance for creation of export related infrastructure under its export promotion scheme. Ensuring that our agriculture exports meet the requirements of importing countries is a continuous process. APEDA regularly holds outreach and capacity building programmes to educate farmers and other stakeholders on measures required to meet specific requirements of importing countries for various products. Mandatory testing and traceability systems have also been put in place for specific products and specific markets to ensure that requirements of the importing countries are met. Some sanitary and phytosanitary measures in the form of setting very low Maximum Residue Level (MRL) of different chemical substances in agri products have been put in place by European Union (EU). The Government has been taking up this issue with EU in all bilateral discussions and pressing for setting MRLs based on scientific risk assessment and international standards such as CODEX etc. (c)       Does not arise in view of (a) and (b) above.  ********
