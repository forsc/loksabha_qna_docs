MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b) 	Grant or not to grant visas to Indian nationals or for that matter any foreign national in respect of a particular country is a sovereign right of that country, which is generally exercised by the country’s Embassy, High Commission or Consulate. As such, the foreign Embassy, High Commission and Consulate concerned Mission cannot be compelled to share information on visa applications received by them from our nationals. In addition, many countries have strict privacy laws on such matters.(c) to (e)	In view of the scope for intervention being very limited, there is no need felt for appointment of staff for such a purpose. The officials of Ministry of External Affairs on account of this fact, can again play very limited role on such matters except in certain cases, where there is a bilateral visa facilitation agreement with certain countries, and if brought to the attention of the Ministry about any breach of the agreement. The same is brought to the attention of the country concerned, and follow-up action taken.
