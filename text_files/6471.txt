MSDE through National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) provides capital expenditure upto 75% of the project investment as well as operational support to each PMKK. As on date, a total of Rs. 14.18 crores have been disbursed towards the establishment of PMKK centres in Maharashtra. As on date, 50 PMKKs have been allocated in 36 districts of Maharashtra.
