As per this analysis, in 2018 there were 127,000 child pneumonia deaths in the country. In November 2019, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has launched SAANS (Social Awareness and Actions to Neutralize Pneumonia Successfully) Initiative to accelerate action to reduce deaths due to Childhood Pneumonia under Reproductive, Maternal, and Newborn, Child, Adolescent health and Nutrition (RMNCHA+N) program of National Health Mission. (b):   The death in under 5 children due to Pneumonia reported by States/UTs in Health Management Information System (HMIS) for last three years is at Annexure 1.   (c):       As per the Sample Registration System 2017, Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) is 33 per 1000 live birth which translate into 8 lakh infant deaths in a year and out of this estimated 1.2 lakh deaths are due to pneumonia which are mostly preventable or treatable. (d) & (e):      Public Health and Hospitals being a State subject, all the administrative and personnel matters, including recruitment of specialists doctors at Public Health Facilities lies with the State Governments. Also, shortage of doctors in Public Health Facilities varies from State to State depending upon their policies and context. However, as per Bulletin on Rural Health Statistics in India 2019, States/UTs wise shortage of specialist doctors is at Annexure 2.Under National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their healthcare systems with support for recruitment of doctors including specialist on contractual basis, based on the requirements posed by States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) within their overall resource envelope.          Under NHM, States/UTs are encouraged to adopt flexible norms for engaging doctors for Public Health Facilities. Financial support is also provided to States/UTs for providing performance-based incentives, hard area allowance, providing accommodation and transport facilities in rural and remote areas etc for engaging doctors in Public Health Facilities. (f):    Under National Health Mission, there is special provision to hire specialist doctors on contract basis. Beside this the Government of India is implementing following interventions under National Health Mission to address Childhood Pneumonia:•	SAANS (Social Awareness and Actions to Neutralize Pneumonia Successfully) Initiative to accelerate action to reduce deaths due to Childhood Pneumonia. The SAANS initiative encompasses a three tiered strategy: i) National Childhood Pneumonia Management Guideline on treatment and management of Childhood Pneumonia; ii) Skill building and training of service providers for identification and standardized management of Pneumonia; and iii) a 3600 communication SAANS Campaign to ensure greater awareness on childhood Pneumonia among families and parents in order to trigger behaviour change and improve care seeking. •	Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) focuses on Measles, Haemophilus Influenzae (B) and Pneumococcal Vaccine for prevention of pneumonia. •	Early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding for first six months and appropriate Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices are promoted under Mothers’ Absolute Affection (MAA) initiative.  •	Facility based-Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness (F-IMNCI) training to build capacity of Medical Officer and Nurses in Primary Health Centres, First Referral Unit, Community Health Centres, and District Hospital on Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) Management.S.No	States 	2016-17	2017-18	2018-191	A & N Islands	4	10	02	Andhra Pradesh	163	576	4373	Arunachal Pradesh	6	10	124	Assam	448	1050	7935	Bihar	470	836	5446	Chandigarh	11	45	517	Chhattisgarh	565	669	6468	Dadra & Nagar Haveli	11	26	179	Daman & Diu	 	0	210	Delhi	296	817	79211	Goa	6	11	712	Gujarat	520	1337	116613	Haryana	184	138	45614	Himachal Pradesh	56	52	6815	Jammu & Kashmir	38	45	11416	Jharkhand	100	225	23617	Karnataka	372	691	62518	Kerala	5	157	11119	Lakshadweep	1	0	2
