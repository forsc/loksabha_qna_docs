ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a): Yes, Sir. Several airports of Airports Authority of India (AAI) are non-operational at present. The State-wise details are at Annexure-I.;(b): Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)-Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN) in 2016 for promotion of Regional Connectivity by way of revival of un-served and under-served airports/airstrips, helipads of the State Governments, AAI, Civil Enclaves and CPSUs through a Budgetary support of Rs.4500 crores. The revival of airstrips/airports is ''''demand driven'''', depending upon firm commitment from airline operators as well as from the State Government for providing various concessions. Asansol, Balurghat & Malda airports of West Bengal have been included under the scheme. However, no bid has been received from any airline operator for operation of flights from these airports.;(c): Upgradation of infrastructure of airports is a continuous process and is undertaken by Airports Authority of India (AAI) and concerned private operators from time to time depending on the availability of land, commercial viability, socio-economic considerations, traffic demand / willingness of airlines to operate to/from such airports. AAI has undertaken construction work for Air traffic control tower, airside capacity enhancement and resurfacing of secondary runway at Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport, Kolkata in West Bengal.;As far as improvement of air connectivity is concerned, flight operations in domestic sector have been deregulated and the airlines are free to operate anywhere in the country subject to Route Dispersal Guidelines (RDG) issued by the Government. It is upto the airline operator to provide air services to a specific place depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability.
