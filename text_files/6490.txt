                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	To cater to all insurance needs of farmers a Unified Package Insurance Scheme (UPIS) has been introduced from Kharif 2016 as a pilot scheme in 45 districts.  The scheme is voluntary for the State Governments to implement the pilot in the selected districts. The pilot scheme has been designed to take care of all the insurance needs of farmers associated with their life, properties and agricultural activities such as crops, loss of life, accidental death & disability, student safety, household, agriculture implements and tractor.  Out of total of 7 covers under UPIS, Crop Insurance is compulsory and the farmer has to take atleast two from the remaining six sections.  But most of the States had made coverage of two sections voluntary instead of compulsory, therefore, the coverage under other sections of the package except crop insurance has been negligible.Further, With a view to provide social security net for the landholding Small and Marginal Farmers as they have minimal or no savings to provide for old age and to support them in the even of consequent loss of livelihood, the Government has introduced a new Central Sector Scheme for providing old age pension to these farmers, namely, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojana (PM-KMY). Under this scheme,, a minimum fixed pension of Rs. 3,000/- is provided to the eligible landholding small and marginal farmers, subject to certain exclusion clauses, on attaining the age of 60 years.  It is voluntary and contributory pension scheme, with entry age of 18-40 years.(c) to (e) : Do not arise.******
