Several states conduct periodic assessments to track child-wise improvement in the learning levels and also the achievement of learning outcomes.

For continuous capacity development, programs of teachers such as NISHTHA integrated teacher training has been initiated (Elementary, Secondary and FLN) on DIKSHA.

To understand the user behavior and also improve on the content dissemination, several states analyze the average time spent on the content and also the rating & feedback comments by the user. To ensure time bound reach and effectiveness of the courses, states circulate data dashboards with on-ground coordinators at district & block levels to reach the last mile.*****
