ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	& (b)  Forest Survey of India (FSI), Dehradun, an organization under the Ministry carries out assessment of forest cover of the country biennially and the findings are published in India State of Forest Report (ISFR).  As per the latest report i.e. ISFR- 2017, the total forest and tree cover in the country is 8,02,088 square kilometre (forest cover 7,08,273 square kilometre, tree cover 93,815 square kilometre) which is 24.39% of the geographical area of the country.  There is an increase of 8,021 square kilometre (forest cover 6,778 square kilometre, tree cover 1,243 square kilometre) of total forest and tree cover in the country including urban areas compared to that of ISFR-2015.           One of the features of smart cities is preserving and developing open spaces- parks, playgrounds and recreational spaces in order to enhance the quality of life of citizens, reduce the urban heat effects and generally promote eco-balance. Urban forestry is also an important tool for storm water management as trees absorb and store rainwater through the canopy, and slow down and filter runoff with their roots. Other benefits include noise control, traffic control, and glare and reflection control. The State/UTs Governments are responsible for carrying out the afforestation activities/ tree plantation drive in the concerned State/UTs. The ISFR published by FSI provides State/districts wise forest cover of the country and changes thereon with respect to the previous assessment. However, FSI does not assess forest cover of urban areas and smart cities. As per ISFR-2017, the forest cover of districts included as overlapping with the major metropolitan cities are given below:-                                                                                                                                                                      (Area in Square kilometre)Metro Cities District	Geographical area	Forest Cover as per ISFR 2015	Forest Cover as per ISFR 2017 (percentage of geographical area)	Increase in Forest CoverDelhi (State)(All Districts)	1,483	188.77	192.41 (12.97)	+3.64 Kolkata(District)	185	0	1 (0.54)	+1 Chennai(District)	144	13	14 (8.00)	+1Mumbai(City)	157	2	3(1.91)	+1   As per ISFR-2017, there is an increase of forest cover in the above major metropolitan cities compared to that of ISFR-2015.(c) & (d)     The increase in pollution in the cities is mainly due to increase in the number of vehicles, emissions due to industrial smoke, bio mass burning, open waste burning and operation of fuel based power plants and diesel generation sets. The corrective measures taken by Government to tackle pollution in cities are as follows:-(i)	The Central Government has launched National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) under the Central Sector “Control of Pollution” Scheme as a long-term, time-bound, national level strategy to tackle the air pollution problem across the country in a comprehensive manner with targets to achieve 20 % to 30 % reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations by 2024 keeping 2017 as the base year for the comparison of concentration.  A total of 102 non-attainment cities have been identified based on ambient air quality data for the period 2011 – 2015 and WHO report 2014/2018.  The city specific Action Plans have been approved for ground implementation for all 102 non-attainment cities.
