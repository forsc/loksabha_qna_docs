                                                    (a) 	whether the Government has any proposal to provide houses to the beneficiaries which have been built by the house construction agencies instead of providing funds to the beneficiaries under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (PMAY) as funds are being misused and the purpose of the said scheme is being defeated;(b) 	if so, the details thereof; and(c) 	if not, the reasons therefor?






ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI FAGGAN SINGH KULASTE)(a) to (c):  No Sir. Presently, there is no such proposal under consideration for Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) and Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Urban (PMAY-U).  To prevent misuse of funds under PMAY-G, the assistance is provided to the beneficiaries directly into their bank account/ post office account through Aadhaar Based Payment System/Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) in construction linked installments. At every fixed stage of construction of the house, the geo-referenced and time-stamped photograph of the house along with beneficiary is captured. Similarly, PMAY-U has an inbuilt provision like Aadhaar seeding and validation of beneficiaries, transfer of assistance through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)/ Expenditure-Advance-Transfer (EAT) module of Public Financial Management System (PFMS),  geo-tagging of houses, etc., integrated into robust PMAY-U MIS System for ensuring transparency, efficiency and accountability.*********
