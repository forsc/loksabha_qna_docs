ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF JAL SHAKTI(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (b) The Government had launched Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) [SBM(G)] with effect from 2nd October, 2014 with the aim to attain Open Defecation Free (ODF) status in the rural areas of the country by 2nd October, 2019 by providing access to toilet facilities to all rural households in the country. As per the data reported by the States on the Online Integrated Management Information System of SBM(G), sanitation coverage in the rural areas of the country which was 38.7% on 2.10.2014 has increased to 100% and all the 5,99,963 villages of the country have already declared themselves as ODF.(c) 	The SBM(G) promotes the twin-pit toilet system with a steep slope rural pan. This toilet requires only about 1.5-2 litres of water to flush the fecal material, meaning that adequate water is available.  Further, the incentive for IHHL under SBM(G) was increased from Rs.10,000 to Rs.12,000 for ensuring water storage facility in the toilet for hand-washing and cleaning. As per National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS) conducted in 2018-19, 96.5 of the households having access to toilet use them regularly. Also as per Swachchata Status Report 2016 of National Sample Survey Office, 93.9% households having access to water for use in toilets out of the households having toilets. Additionally, the Government of India has also launched   Jal   Jeevan   Mission  (JJM)   recently   which   aims   at   providing Functional Household Tap Connection to every rural household.(d) Under SBM(G), construction of twin-pit toilet is promoted, which   is   a   safe   and   eco-friendly   onsite   sanitation technology.   Under   this   technology,   human   faeces   are   automatically converted into organic manure in less than one year. The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation had also issued a technical handbook suggesting specifications for a safely built toilet which inter-alia provides size of toilet pits, distance of the toilet from a water sources etc. to prevent ground and surface water pollution.****
