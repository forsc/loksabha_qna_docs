Rapid antibody tests can be used for detecting the presence of antibodies in recovered individuals. These are not used for patient diagnosis. (b) to (d) ICMR has informed that it has been interacting with National and International manufacturers who have expressed their interest in supplying diagnostics to India. The kit manufacturers are required to submit their product for validation at the designated centres of ICMR. Only the approved kits are provided marketing permission by Drugs Controller General of India. However, US-FDA approved kits are exempted from validation. Price of procurement is based on a competitive tendering process. ICMR’s validation process is based on standardized protocols developed under consultation of experts and are in line with global standards.
