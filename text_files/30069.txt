THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI SOM PARKASH) (a) & (b): 	While presenting Budget 2020-21, Hon''ble Finance Minister announced plans to set up an Investment Clearance Cell (ICC) that will provide "end to end" facilitation and support to investors, including pre-investment advisory, provide information related to land banks and facilitate clearances at Centre and State level. The cell was proposed to operate through an online digital portal.Subsequently, as per the mandate, DPIIT along with Invest India initiated the process of developing the portal as a National Single Window System (NSWS). Envisioned as a one-stop for taking all the regulatory approvals and services in the country, NSWS [www.nsws.gov.in] was soft-launched on 22nd September, 2021 by Hon''ble Commerce & Industry Minister. This national portal integrates the existing clearance systems of various Ministries/ Departments of Government of India and State Governments without disruption to their existing IT portals. Currently, approvals of 19 Ministries/ Departments and 10 States Single Window Systems have been on-boarded on the NSWS Portal. List of the onboarded Ministries/ Departments and States may be seen at Annexure.  (c):	The Know Your Approvals (KYA) Module is an information wizard which guides investors to identify an indicative list of requisite pre-operations approvals/ licenses applicable. This is facilitated by answering a series of questions which gets populated basis the information provided by the investor in the previous question. Post submission of the KYA questionnaire, the investors are able to view an indicative list of licenses pertaining to the Central/ State Governments that are applicable to them. The investors are also guided on these questions and their applicability/ purpose by an Information Toolbox. This is to enhance the ease of user experience and eliminate information asymmetry on this module.The KYA service is live on NSWS with 544 approvals across concerned 32 Central Ministries/ Departments and 2715 approvals across 14 States. Total 3259 approvals are listed.******
