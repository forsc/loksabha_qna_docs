ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c): Yes, Sir. To create employment opportunities and dispersal of IT/ITES industry in small cities and towns, Government had launched India BPO Promotion Scheme (IBPS) (excluding  North Eastern States and metro locations), to incentivize setting up of 48,300 seats BPO/ITES operations by providing financial support up to Rs. 1 lakh per seat in the form of viability gap funding for capital and operational expenditure along with special incentives like encouraging employment to women and physically disabled persons, promoting local entrepreneurs etc. The duration of the scheme was up to 31.03.2019. The disbursement of financial support under this scheme is on reimbursement basis directly linked with the objective i.e. employment generation by the units. After generating minimum employment as per the target under the scheme, BPO/ITeS units claim reimbursement of capital and operational expenditure. In FY 2018-19, Rs. 6.53 crore has been disbursed under IBPS. Till now, direct employment generation under IBPS is over 32,000. Till 31.03.2019 the direct employment generated under IBPS was 25,357 of which approx 15,000 is generated in FY 2018-19. The State/UT wise details of employment generated till 31.03.2019 is at Annexure.   ******* AnnexureState/UT wise details of employment generated under IBPS till 31.03.2019State/UT	Employment ReportedAndhra Pradesh	6520Bihar	1506Chandigarh U.T.	36Chhattisgarh	136Gujarat	3Haryana	113Himachal Pradesh	16Jammu and Kashmir	509Jharkhand	641Karnataka	535Kerala	43Madhya Pradesh	1085Maharashtra	1836Odisha	1550Puducherry U.T.	156Punjab	2558Rajasthan	413Tamil Nadu	6259Telangana	177Uttar Pradesh	935Uttarakhand	248West Bengal	82Total	25,357	******
