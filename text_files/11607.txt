                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a)	to (c):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 474 BY SHRI JUAL ORAM TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 05.02.2020 REGARDING DELAYED RAILWAY PROJECTS(a) to (c):  Railway has taken up the work on Talcher-Bimlagarh new line, Khurda Road-Bolangir new line and Angul-Sukinda new line projects. The present status of these projects is as under:-Talcher-Bimlagarh (150 km) New Line: Railway has taken up the work of Talcher-Bimlagarh (150 km) New Line project. The anticipated cost of the project is `1928 crore. An expenditure of `609 crore has already been incurred upto March 2019. An outlay of `150 crore has been provided in the Budget 2019-20. So far, 20 km length of the project has been completed and commissioned.  Land acquisition and forestry clearance have been taken up in balance section and work has been taken up in available land.Khurda Road-Bolangir (289 km) New Line:Railway has taken up the work of Khurda Road-Bolangir New Line (289 km), costing `3798.80 crore. Expenditure incurred upto March, 2019 is     `1327.09 crore and an outlay of `350 crore has also been provided in the Budget 2019-20. This Project is of 289 km length and divided into two parts. 1st part is from km 0 to km 112 and 2nd part is from km 112 to km 289. 1st part (km 0 to km 112) is fully funded by Railway, while, 2nd part (from km 112 to km 289) is on cost sharing, in which, the land is to be provided free of cost by Government of Odisha along with sharing 50% cost of construction. State Government of Odisha has to deposit approx. `110 crore towards their share in the project.So far, 92 km length of the project has been completed and commissioned. Land acquisition and forestry clearance have been taken up in balance section and work has been taken up in available land.Angul-Sukinda Road (104.24 km) New Line: Railway has taken up the work of Angul-Sukinda Road. The anticipated cost of the project is `1202.70 crore. An expenditure of `767.15 crore has already been incurred upto March 2019. An outlay of `250 crore has been provided in the Budget 2019-20. This project has been taken up through Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) funded by Angul-Sukinda Rail Limited (ASRL). The completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions, cooperation and zeal of the State Government for early completion of project, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions of working agencies/contractors etc.  All these factors affect the completion time of the project, which is finely worked out at the completion stage.To ensure that project is completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, Divisional level, Zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues obstructing the progress of projects. Besides, to ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts, which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects. For important projects, capacity enhancement projects, last mile connectivity etc, institutional financing has been arranged which has increased Railways’ capacity for committed fund provision for capacity enhancement projects.*****
