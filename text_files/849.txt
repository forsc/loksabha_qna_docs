The infrastructure created by BharatNet is a national asset and non-discriminatory access to Service Providers is to be provided under the project.The Phase-I was completed in December 2017 under which more than 1 lakh Gram Panchayats (GPs) were connected.On 19.07.2017, the Union Cabinet approved a modified strategy for implementing BharatNet under which, the remaining 1,50,000 (approx.) Gram Panchayats (GPs) in the country are to be provided broadband connectivity in Phase-II of the project. The salient features of the BharatNet Phase-II, which is under implementation, are as follows: i.	The implementation is to be done through State Model, Private Sector Model and CPSU Model.ii.	Optimal mix of media (OFC, Radio and satellite) to be used to connect GPs.iii.

(b)	Status of GPs connected with optical Fiber, State/UT-wise, under BharatNet project is as per Annexure-I.(c)	All out efforts are being made to expeditiously implement the project.

(ii)	Only one media that is underground OFC to cover GPs, and Right of Way (RoW) issues.
