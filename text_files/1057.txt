ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) : 		Yes, Sir. The 19th Electric Power Survey (EPS) report covers electricity demand projection for the years 2016-17 to 2026-27 as well as perspective electricity demand projection for the years 2031-32 and 2036-37 for each State/UTs including Bihar. The electrical energy requirement at power station busbar for Bihar state by 2026-27, 2031-32 and 2036-37 is estimated to be 54363 Million Units (MU), 68374 MU and 82978 MU respectively. (b) & (c) : 	As on 31.05.2019, the installed generation capacity in the country is about 357 Giga Watt (GW) which is sufficient to meet the peak power demand of the country. The maximum peak demand occurred during the current year 2019-20 (upto May, 2019) was around 183 GW. (d) : 		Electricity is a concurrent subject. Providing electricity to all the consumers including Naxal affected areas of Bihar is the primary responsibility of concerned State Governments/Power Distribution Companies (DISCOMs). Government of India supplement the efforts of the States through its schemes including Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana- Saubhagya, Ujjwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY). These schemes help them to strengthen distribution network/grid connectivity and achieve 24x7 Power for All to consumers. Government of India also assists the States/UTs by allocating power from Central Generating Stations (CGSs). At present Bihar has been allocated 3709 MW from CGSs. State can also purchase power through market including power exchanges to meet any gap in demand and supply.******************
