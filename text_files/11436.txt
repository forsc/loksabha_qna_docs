ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a):  	   Based on the experience of past crop insurance schemes and with a view to include more risks under crop insurance, making it more affordable to the farmers etc., Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) has been introduced for implementation from Kharif 2016 season.  Due to the improved features of the scheme coverage under the scheme has been increased to 30% of Gross Cropped in the country from 23% in erstwhile crop insurance schemes in 2015-16.  The coverage of non-loanee farmers, for whom the coverage is voluntary, has increased from 5% under erstwhile schemes in 2015-16 to 42% during Kharif 2019, which shows the acceptability and progress of the scheme on voluntary basis.    State-wise details of farmer applicants, area insured and claims, since inception of the scheme are given in Annexure.Contd…2/--2-(b) to (d): 	As per scheme provisions, farmers are indemnified to the extent/percentage of crop losses against the defined Threshold Yield multiplied by sum insured as decided by the State Government.   Claim amount for wide spread calamites are calculated based on the yield data arrived from requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) conducted by the concerned State Government.  Claims per hectare are worked out as per following formula: Threshold Yield (TY) – Actual Yield (AY)                            --------------------------------------------------------X  Sum InsuredThreshold Yield (TY)Where Threshold Yield for a crop in a notified insurance unit is the average yield of best 5 years out of past seven years multiplied by applicable indemnity level for that crop.However, losses due to localized risks of hailstorm, landslide, inundation, cloud burst & natural fire and post-harvest losses are calculated on individual insured farm basis.  Further, there  is also a provision to pay claims towards prevented sowing/failed germination and adhoc claims in case of mid season adversity.  Therefore, insurance companies have a little role in calculation of claims/quantification of claim amount under the scheme.  However, Government undertakes close monitoring of the scheme and resolve the yield data related issues for calculation of claims between State Government and insurance companies through Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) at Central level. To provide better risk coverage to farmers and consequent claims, if any, sum insured under the scheme has been equated to Scale of Finance of the crop as determined by the District Level Technical Committee (DLTC).  On an average about 10% increase is made by the DLTC yearly in the Scale of Finance.
