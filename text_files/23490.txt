Central Employment Guarantee Council and State Employment Guarantee Councils periodically monitor implementation of the programme.  National Level Monitors, Common Review Missions and Officers of the Ministry visit States/UTs at regular interval to review implementation of the programme. After the field visits, the findings/shortcomings and recommendations are shared with the States/UTs for appropriate action at their end. Auditing Standards have been issued and States/UTs have been advised to establish independent Social Audit Units, conduct Social Audit as per Audit of Scheme Rules, training of Village resource persons for conducting Social Audit etc. Internal Audit Teams of the Department also conduct regular audit. Steps have been taken to strengthen transparency and accountability which include geo-tagging of assets, Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), National electronic Fund Management System (NeFMS), Aadhar Based Payment System (ABPS), Software for Estimate Calculation using Rural rates for Employment (SECURE) and appointment of Ombudsperson in every district of States/UTs. State specific reviews of States/UTs are also undertaken from time to time.*****
