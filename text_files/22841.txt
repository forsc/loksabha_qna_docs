The Coverage of the scheme has extended in 2018-19 to 1300 MCAs in 308 districts of the country which includes 870 Minority Concentration Blocks, 321 Minority Concentration Towers and 109 Minority Concentration District Hqrs. The priority sectors under PMJVK are education, health, skill development and women centric projects.
