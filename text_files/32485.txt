Social media posts are updated on a daily basis with interactive content.In addition to  routine social media updates, the Board has been organising various focus events in collaboration with various influencers and media houses for promoting the value and worthiness of Indian spices. Also, the Government, through the Spices Board, is actively conducting Virtual Buyers Sellers Meeting(VBSM) in various countries and by making use of the digital/ online medium for promoting spices and spice products, series of webinars, entrepreneurship development training programs, etc,  involving various stakeholders have been organized.c)	Spices Board’s scheme titled ‘Integrated Scheme for Export Promotion & Quality Improvement in Spices and Research & Development of Cardamom’, for implementation during the period from 2021-22 to 2025-26 has been approved.
