                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	 Crop insurance is a financial tool to insure losses to crops of farmers against natural calamities like flood, drought, pests & diseases and deviation in weather parameters on payment of admissible premium to the  concerned insurance company.   The claims, if any,  are paid to only those farmers who insured their crops and paid premium for the notified crop in the notified area by the State Govt.   At present, there are two schemes namely, yield based Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and weather index based Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS).  Admissible claims under PMFBY are worked out on the basis of yield data submitted by the concerned State Government and under RWBCIS, on the basis of weather data from weather stations designated in the notification by the concerned State Government. In addition, assistance is also provided to farmers affected due to natural calamities under National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).(b):	 No Sir.  Details of claims paid to farmers under PMFBY & RWBCIS during last three years are given in following table :contd..2/--2-                                                                                                                  (Rs. in crore)Year	Farmers Enrolled (in lakhs)	Estimated Claims	Approved Claims	Claims Paid	No. of farmers benefitted (in lakhs)2016-17	579	16351	16261	16257	1462017-18	521	21828	21521	21270	175Kharif 2018	348	14319	10247	9046	80* Provisional for Kharif 2018 season only.  Some claims of Kharif 2018 and the claims of Rabi 2018-19 are not reported.(c) & (d):	 No such proposal is under consideration of the Government at present.  However, Government has revised the Operational Guidelines of PMFBY from Rabi 2018-19 season, methodology for calculation of Threshold Yield (TY) has been rationalised where average yield data of best 5 out of 7 years for calculation of claim amount has been prescribed.  The insurance unit for calculation of admissible claims has also been reduced to village/village panchayat level to provide claims proportionate to their crop yield damage. ********
