The SRAP also recommends States/UTs to eliminate the requirement of renewal and allow for auto-renewal in case of drug licenses.During the last five years,  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) have taken various measures for streamlining regulatory system and ease of doing business in the country such as notification of Medical Devices Rules, 2017, New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019, online submission and processing of various applications under SUGAM portal, for evaluation of applications of Clinical Trials, New Drugs and Investigational New Drugs (IND) including r-DNA derived products and vaccines, new medical devices, etc., notification of Cosmetics Rules, 2020, increasing the validity of World Health Organizations’ (WHO) Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (COPP) under the WHO Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Certification Scheme from 2 years to 3 years, waiver of No Objection Certificate (NOC) for export purpose for the export consignments to any country, delegation of power to all States’/UTs’ Drug Controllers for issuance of NOC with respect to unapproved /banned drugs for export purpose only, etc.M/o Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), vide Notification S.O. 1223(E) dated 27th March, 2020 and vide Notification S.O. 3636(E). dated 15th October, 2020 has decided that all proposals for projects or activities in respect of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) received up to 30th March, 2021, shall be appraised, as Category ‘B2’ projects.
