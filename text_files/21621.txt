ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c):  The implementation and enforcement of provisions   under Food Safety and  Standards (FSS)  Act, 2006 and Rules and Regulations made there under primarily rests with the State/UT Governments. To ensure compliance with these provisions, State/UT Governments undertake regular surveillance, monitoring and inspection activities.Samples of food items are drawn by State Food Safety Officers and sent to the laboratories recognised by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) for analysis. In cases where samples are found to be non-conforming to the provisions of the Act and the Rules and Regulations made there under, recourse is taken to penal provisions under the FSS Act.  As per the information available from State/UT Governments, the details of samples analysed, found non-conforming ( including  adulteration) and action taken against the concerned Food Business Operators during the last three years are  at Annexure I, II and III.(d):  FSSAI constantly monitors the enforcement of the Act with the State /UT food safety authorities   during the periodic meetings of the Central Advisory Committee in which the Commissioners of Food Safety of all States/UTs are represented and also through video conferencing and interaction during visit of senior officials of FSSAI to States/UTs etc.  (e) & (f) At present, under Section 59 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 for manufacture, storage, sale, distribution or import of unsafe food for human consumption which results in death, a penalty of imprisonment for a term not less than seven years but which may be extended to imprisonment for life and also with fine of not less than ten lakh rupees is prescribed. A proposal had been received from FSSAI to amend the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The Ministry had invited public comments through a Public Notice on amendment proposal.
