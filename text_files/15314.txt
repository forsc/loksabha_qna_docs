                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a)and (b):  As Judiciary is an independent organ of the State under the Constitution of India, working days/hours and duration of vacations in the Supreme Court and in the High Courts are regulated by Rules framed by the respective Court.  The working days as well as working hours of the District/Subordinate Courts are regulated by the respective High Court.  Disposal of cases pending in courts is within the domain of judiciary.  The Government has adopted a co-ordinated approach to assist judiciary for phased liquidation of arrears and pendency in judicial systems, which, inter-alia, includes better infrastructure for courts including computerization, increase in strength of judicial officers/judges, policy and legislative measures in the areas prone to excessive litigation and emphasis on human resource development. Central Government has no role in the appointment of Subordinate Judiciary as filling up of vacancies in the District and Subordinate Courts falls within the domain of the High Courts and the State Governments concerned.
