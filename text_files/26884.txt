ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) : Indian Railways are having adequate number of open wagons and rakes for transportation of coal. Indian Railways (IR) loaded average 24,586 coal wagons per day in June 2021.  As on 30.06.2021, IR had 1.6 lakh open wagons which is considered adequate for present level of coal loading.  Besides, IR has system of regular enhancement of wagon fleet for coal loading.(b) : Completion of a Railway project(s) depends on various factors like expeditious land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions etc, and all these factors affect the completion time and cost of the project(s), which is finally worked out at the completion stage.  Nevertheless, every effort is being made to execute the project(s) expeditiously.Various steps being taken by the Government for effective and speedy implementation of rail projects include (i) prioritisation of projects (ii) substantial increase in allocation of funds on priority projects (iii) delegation of powers at field level (iv) close monitoring of progress of project at various levels, and (v) regular follow up with State Governments and concerned authorities for expeditious land acquisition, forestry and Wildlife clearances and for resolving other issues pertaining to projects.(c) & (d) : Ministry of Railways has taken up implementation of several coal connectivity projects including those under Participative Policy of Ministry of Railways, which are being executed by Joint Venture Companies formed by respective coal companies for evacuation of coal from important coalfields. Fourteen coal projects have been identified in consultation with Ministry of Coal for coal evacuation.  Monitoring of these projects is being done at the level of Secretary(Coal) along with Chairman & Chief Executive Officer,  Railway Board.  Besides this, Indian Railways has prepared “Visions-2024” document under which projects have been prioritized and categorized into “Super-critical” and “Critical” categories.  This also includes coal projects which are in different stages of execution. Besides, Ministry of Railways is also implementing Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) (1875 kms) from Ludhiana in Punjab to Dankuni in West Bengal, which will mainly cater to Coal and mineral traffic from Eastern India.  DFC has been designed for running of heavier trains of 25 tonne axle load. Maximum moving dimensions on DFC will be more liberal and comparable to world standards in order to permit heavier and longer trains.  With all the above measures, the coal carrying capacity of Indian Railways will get ramped up rapidly, and Indian Railways would be able to offer higher transport output with faster transit time.*****
