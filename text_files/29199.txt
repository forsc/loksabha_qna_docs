ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) is periodically monitoring the ground water levels throughout the country including Rajasthan on a regional scale, through a network of monitoring wells. During November 2020, the depth to water level in the country ranged from less than 2.0 to more than 40 metres below ground level (m bgl).  About 68% of the wells monitored in the country have registered the water level upto 5 m bgl. State-wise details for November 2020 are given in Annexure - I.CGWB generates ground water quality data of the country, including Rajasthan, on a regional scale as part of its ground water quality monitoring program and various scientific studies. These studies indicate the occurrence of contaminants such as flouride, arsenic, nitrate, iron and heavy metals beyond permissible limits (as per BIS) for human consumption in isolated pockets in various States / UTs. The State-wise details are given in Annexure – II.(b) Government of India, in partnership with States, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) – Har Ghar Jal to make provision of potable tap water supply, in adequate quantity, of prescribed quality, and on regular and long-term basis, to every rural household by 2024 with an estimated outlay of Rs.3.60 lakh crore. Contd…P/2//2//As reported by States/UTs, as on 25.11.2021, out of 17.01 lakh rural habitations in the country, 13.38 lakh rural habitations (78.70%) have provision of potable drinking water with more than 40 litre per capita per day (lpcd) and 3.15 lakh rural habitations (18.55%) with less than 40 lpcd with sources at a reasonable distance. Further, 0.47 lakh (2.75%) rural habitations are reported to have water quality issues in drinking water sources.The State-wise status of tap water supply (in terms of households), as reported by the States/ UTs, including that in Rajasthan can be seen at URL : https://ejalshakti.gov.in/jjmreport/JJMIndia.aspx.(c) The State/ UT-wise and year-wise details of fund drawn by States/ UTs under Jal Jeevan Mission are given at Annexure-III.(d)  As per available information no such groundwater survey has been carried out in rural areas as on date.(e) Water being a State subject, initiatives on purification and limiting the contamination of groundwater is primarily States’ responsibility. Under JJM, while allocating funds to States/UTs, 10% weightage is given to the population residing in habitations affected by chemical contaminants.  While planning for potable water supply to households through tap connections, priority is to be given to quality-affected habitations. Since planning, implementation and commissioning of piped water supply scheme based on a safe water source takes time, purely as an interim measure, States/UTs have been advised to install community water purification plants (CWPPs) especially in arsenic and fluoride affected habitations to provide potable water to every household at the rate of 8 to 10 liters per capita per day to meet their drinking and cooking requirements under JJM.In addition, the quality of groundwater can be improved to some extent if concerted efforts are made to improve the groundwater resources through appropriate groundwater recharge/rainwater harvesting. Central Government has taken a number of initiatives in this direction which can be seen at URL:http://jalshakti-dowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Feb2021.pdf.(f) To take care of operation & maintenance related issues, Department of Drinking Water & Sanitation has collaborated with Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology to develop ‘smart measurement and monitoring water supply through sensor based IoT system’. ***** ANNEXURE- IAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) of Unstarred Question No. 850 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 02.12.2021 regarding “Setting up of Taps with Groundwater Survey”.State-wise Depth to water Level and Distribution of Percentage of Wells for the Period of November, 2020S.
