                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a) :  Yes, Sir. India’s agricultural exports have increased from USD 39.19 billion in 2018-19 to USD 41.87 billion in 2020-21.(b):   Details of India’s export of rice, during the years 2015 -16 to 2020-21, are at Annexure.(c) : Biggest importing countries for Basmati rice are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Yemen and UAE; whereas the biggest importing countries for non-basmati rice are Benin, Nepal, Bangladesh, Senegal and Togo.(d):  As per WTO rules, there are no limits prescribed for agricultural exports.(e) & (f) :  Does not arise in view of (d) above.(g): Promotion of exports of agricultural products is an ongoing process. To promote agricultural exports, the Government has taken several steps at State/ District levels. State specific Action Plans, State Level Monitoring Committees (SLMCs), Nodal Agencies for agricultural exports and Cluster Level Committees have been formed in a number of States. Country and product-specific action plans have also been formulated to promote exports. 							A Farmer Connect Portal has been set up by APEDA for providing a platform for farmers, Farmer-Producer Organizations (FPOs) and cooperatives to interact with exporters. Buyer-seller Meets (BSMs) have been organized in the clusters to provide export-market linkages. Regular interactions, through videoconferences, have been held with the Indian Missions abroad, to assess and exploit export opportunities. Country specific BSMs, through Indian Missions, have also been organized.The Government has also introduced a Central Sector Scheme –‘Transport and Marketing Assistance for Specified Agriculture Products’ – for providing assistance for the international component of freight, to mitigate the freight disadvantage for the export of agriculture products. The Department of Commerce provides assistance through several other schemes, to promote exports, including exports of agricultural products viz. Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES), Market Access Initiatives (MAI) Scheme, Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) etc. In addition, assistance to the exporters of agricultural products is also available under the Export Promotion Schemes of Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), Tobacco Board, Tea Board, Coffee Board, Rubber Board and Spices Board.*****  ANNEXUREAnnexure referred in Part (b) of Lok Sabha  Unstarred Question No. 35INDIA''S EXPORT OF RICEQty. in Lakh MT; Value in USD Million 	 	2015-16	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21HS CODE	DESCRIPTION	Qty	Value	Qty	Value	Qty	Value	Qty	Value	Qty	Value	Qty	Value10061010	RICE IN HUSK OF SEED QLTY	0.14	28.36	0.15	28.65	0.17	25.48	0.18	33.93	0.28	33.35	0.28	43.7710061090	OTHR RICE IN HUSK	0.99	24.66	1.54	37.05	1.76	43.54	2.38	61.51	2.39	59.51	6.01	140.2210062000	HUSKED (BROWN) RICE	0.19	11.04	0.10	5.88	0.08	5.10	0.10	6.50	0.14	4.38	0.46	19.8810063010	RICE PARBOILED	34.42	1283.37	38.99	1456.52	43.26	1813.03	37.62	1510.95	31.29	1215.15	61.75	2365.1910063020	BASMATI RICE	40.46	3477.98	39.85	3208.60	40.57	4169.56	44.15	4712.44	44.55	4372.00	46.30	4018.4110063090	RICE EXCPTG PARBOILED (EXCL BASMATI RICE)	17.56	711.63	17.67	736.96	30.92	1370.26	23.98	1055.68	13.76	636.37	42.34	1646.0610064000	BROKEN RICE	11.34	309.59	9.26	260.14	12.00	379.19	12.22	369.58	2.70	82.48	20.65	595.69 	TOTAL	105.10	5846.62	107.56	5733.79	128.75	7806.15	120.63	7750.61	95.11	6403.24	177.79	8829.21Source: DGCI&S******
