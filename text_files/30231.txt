ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a) : Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) was closed in March 2014.  Solid Waste Management (SWM) is being implemented in the urban areas of the country under the Swachh Bharat  Mission-Urban (SBM-U)  since 2nd October  2014.       Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U) 2.0 has been launched on 1st October, 2021 with a vision of achieving 100 per cent ‘Garbage Free’, status for all cities. The following specific objectives are targeted to be achieved under SBM-U 2.0 :(i). Ensuring cleanliness and hygiene in public places to make all cities clean and garbage free, with 100% scientific processing of MSW.(ii). Reducing air pollution arising out of SWM activities, through effective management of C&D waste, and mechanical sweeping.(iii). Phased reduction in use of single-use plastic.(iv). Remediation of all legacy dumpsites.The state-wise status of the progress of SWM in the country is at Annexure.(b) : E-governance initiatives implemented successfully in Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) under SBM-U are as under:(i). More than 66,000 public toilet blocks across 3,296 cities are mapped on Google maps covering more than 70% of India’s urban population, thereby improving ease of access. (ii). More than 1.8 crore citizens have downloaded Swachhata app (the citizens’ grievance redressal platform for all sanitation and waste management related complaints), 2.40 crore complaints have been registered of which 2.24 crore complaints have been resolved with more than 90% resolution rate.(iii). Under SBM-U 2.0, a new integrated MIS Portal, “SWACHHATAM” (https://admin.sbmurban.org) has been designed to make the Mission paperless with a 360-degree connectivity approach, providing access to every city and every State. Providing single window citizen-centric services under Local Self Government is the responsibility of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) as per the provisions of Schedule 7 of the Constitution.  However, the National Urban Digital Mission (NUDM) envisages to provide an enabling digital infrastructure, which can be readily used by ULBs.                               *****
