                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE (IC) OF THE MINISTRY OF AYURVEDA,YOGA & NATUROPATHY, UNANI, SIDDHA AND HOMOEOPATHY(SHRI SHRIPAD YESSO NAIK)(a):  As reported by State/UT Governments, 17.74 Crores of patients reported to the AYUSH health care facilities during 2017-18 compared to 15.94 Crores and 17.27 Crores of patients who availed AYUSH treatment during 2015-16 and 2016-17 respectively. The efforts of Central Government for promotion of AYUSH through various programmes and schemes yielded in more number of people availing treatment from AYUSH health care facilities. However, taking treatment from Allopathy or AYUSH is the choice of the people.(b):    Government of India is implementing Centrally Sponsored Scheme National AYUSH Mission (NAM) through States/UTs which envisages:(i) Better access to AYUSH services by supporting States/UTs for opening integrated AYUSH hospitals, up-gradation of AYUSH hospitals and dispensaries, supply of AYUSH medicines.     (ii) Strengthening of AYUSH educational institutions by strengthening States/UTs to improve infrastructure of education institutions. (iii) Facilitate the enforcement of quality control of Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani & Homoeopathy (ASU&H) drugs by establishment of AYUSH pharmacies and drugs testing laboratories.    (iv) Sustainable availability of ASU & H raw-materials by encouraging cultivation of medicinal plants. (c):    Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH), Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine (CCRUM) and Central Council for Research in Siddha (CCRS),  autonomous organization under Ministry of AYUSH  have set up laboratories for advance research in Ayurveda, Homoeopathy Unani and Siddha respectively. The details are furnished at Annexure.(d):    This Ministry has taken various initiatives under the Information Education and Communication (IEC) Scheme for propagation and promotion of AYUSH systems for treatment of common ailments through media and other publicity activities like organizing Arogya fairs, conferences, seminars on AYUSH System. Further, Ministry is also supporting different activities under NAM like AYUSH gram, Public Health outreach activities, information education and communication (IEC) activities, organization of Yoga, conducting peripheral OPD and Medical camps, behavioural change communication, training of village health workers towards identification and use of local medicinal herbs. Grant-in-aid of Rs. 2125.63 Crores has been released to States/UTs for different activities of NAM since inception of NAM in 2014 to till date. (e):    Yes, the demand for yoga professionals is increasing owing to the awareness created by Ministry of AYUSH through its various activities for promotion of Yoga. 	In this regard, the Government has set up a Yoga Certification Board (YCB) to standardize and strengthen Yoga training by providing certification to individuals and accreditation to Institutions. This is a significant step in streamlining Yoga training in India.(f) & (g):     As health is a state subject, opening of yoga centres comes under the purview of respective State/UT Governments. However, under Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National AYUSH Mission (NAM), there is a provision of financial assistance for establishment of Yoga Wellness Centre in urban as well as rural areas. State/UT Governments may avail eligible financial assistance by projecting the same through State Annual Action Plan (SAAP) as per NAM guideline. Further, Ministry of AYUSH strives to promote these systems and to popularise Yoga for the benefit of the people. For this purpose, an Information Education and Communication (IEC) Scheme, has been devised by the Ministry, activities under which include steps to reach out to people and to create awareness about Yoga. IEC activities include programs on TV, Radio, Print-media etc. 	As a part of observation of International Day of Yoga (IDY) on 21st June, this Ministry has reached out to about 2.5 lakh Gram Pradhan with suggested plan of action for Yoga promotion in villages. Common Service Centers (CSCs) of the Ministry of Electronics & IT have also been roped in for promotion of Yoga in rural areas. 	As part of the effort to take Yoga closer to the people, the Government has recently launched a mobile App called “Yogalocator”, which will help an individual to locate the Yoga events and trainings that happen near her or him, so that plans can be made to join one such event or training programme.Further, under the AYUSHMAN Bharat Scheme, Yoga has been made an integral part of the 1.5 lakh Primary Health Care Centres to provide access to the common people to the practice of Yoga.
