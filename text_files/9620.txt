                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b): As per available information, the World Bank in collaboration with leading Public Health agencies/Organizations including Harvard School of Public Health have published reports to alert the international and national health community about the burden and impact of various illnesses.  A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study, 2016 was also published in Lancet Neurology online in March, 2019.  The study estimated the prevalence, incidence, deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 15 neurological disorder categories in 195 countries from 1990 to 2016.  As per the study report, neurological disorders were the leading cause of DALYs in 2016 globally. The four largest contributors of neurological DALYs were: Stroke (42.2%), Migraine (16.3%), Alzheimer’s and other dementias (10.4%) and Meningitis (7.9%).  The study also observed that with the population growing and ageing, the prevalence of major disabling neurological disorders will steeply increase.      (c):   Hypertension and Diabetes contribute to substantial morbidity to neurological disorders. The Government is implementing the National Program for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardio Vascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) with focus on screening and early diagnosis of common Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs) including hypertension and diabetes, their management and referral. Screening for common NCDs including hypertension and diabetes is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres.  The Indian Hypertensive Control Initiative (IHCI) of the Government of India, in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) has been rolled out in selected districts for quality hypertension treatment.  With the expansion of the District Mental Health Programme to 655 districts, the coverage for epilepsy care and control has been achieved significantly.  The Government is also implementing the National Programme for Healthcare of the Elderly to address the issue of neurological disorders among the ageing population.
