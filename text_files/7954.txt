                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) to  (c) 	Sir, to examine the effect of Electromagnetic Field (EMF) emissions from Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) and mobile phones an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) was constituted on 24.08.2010. The IMC in its report has indicated that most of the laboratory studies were unable to find a direct link between exposure to radio frequency radiation and health, and the scientific studies as yet have not been able to confirm a cause and effect relationship between radio frequency radiation and health.	Also, a committee, constituted by Hon’ble High Court, Allahabad including members from IITs of Kharagpur, Kanpur, Delhi, Roorkee, Bombay and from other scientific institutions of the country including Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) Delhi, in their report submitted in 2014, has, inter-alia, noted – “ ...On the basis of scientific evidences, studies and reports available, it has been found that there is no conclusive evidence about the stated dangers of EMF radiation from mobile BTS tower...” The Committee has noted that “there are no conclusive evidence to establish any causal link between the effect of EMF radiation from BTS with biological effects described in cell models, animals or humans, and any possible resulting health effects.” 	Further, a joint initiative has been launched by Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) under Department of Science & Technology (DST) and Department of Telecommunications (DoT), wherein nineteen research proposals, have already been initiated to study possible impact of EMF exposure from mobile towers and handsets on life. i.e. Humans, Living Organisms, Flora & Fauna and Environment.
