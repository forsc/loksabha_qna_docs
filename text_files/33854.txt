ANSWER




                                                        (a)	and (b): Yes, Sir. Government is aware that global shortages and other supply constraints have severely impacted the domestic electronics productions/manufacturing industry. The shortage of semiconductor / microchips in particular has impacted many industries with auto and consumer electronics industries among the most affected sectors. Industry estimates indicate a production loss of a minimum 5-7% on account of this shortage. The shortage first emerged after the COVID-19 pandemic, due to lockdowns, restrictions and disruptions in global supply chains. The supply side problem has transformed into a demand side problem as our economy has started recovering strongly which has increased the consumption of electronic goods across various segments. Some key reasons behind the global chip shortage are supply chain disruptions, geographic concentration of electronic manufacturing, rise in demand for digital and electronic goods, and digital adoption across the world. Government has conducted several engagements on this topic with OEMs, ODMs, Tier 1 companies as well as distributors to address this problem and pursue this opportunity as companies seeking to diversify the value chain from current geographies.(c):    Government of India’s goal is to make India a significant design and manufacturing hub as part of its AtmaNirbhar Bharat economic policies. In this regard, we are broadening and deepening our electronic manufacturing ecosystem. The steps taken by Government for the expansion of electronics manufacturing in the country are at Annexure-I. Maharashtra has emerged as one of the important destinations for electronics manufacturing and has seen substantial growth in the electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) Sector. The State is sharing about 18% of total electronics manufacturing production in the country. This growth is largely aided by the steps taken by the government to boost electronics manufacturing. Under Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC) scheme, two (2) Common Facility Centres (CFCs) are approved in State of Maharashtra and are targeted to serve the requirement of Common Testing Facilities for electronics manufacturers in and around Pune and Aurangabad region in the State. The details of these EMCs/CFCs are enclosed at Annexure-II.In addition, 80 companies have established their operations in the State and are taking benefits from Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS), Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) and Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme of Government of India. List of such companies approved under MSIPS, SPECS and PLI is enclosed at Annexures-III, IV & V. To boost the electronics manufacturing production and generate employment, the State has amended its Electronics Policy, 2016 to extend the benefits upto 2023 and has linked it with the new SPECS and PLI Schemes of the Govt. of India.********Annexure-I Steps taken by Government for the expansion of electronics manufacturing in the country:1.	National Policy on Electronics 2019: The National Policy on Electronics 2019 (NPE 2019) has been notified on 25.02.2019. The vision of NPE 2019 is to position India as a global hub for Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) by encouraging and driving capabilities in the country for developing core components, including chipsets, and creating an enabling environment for the industry to compete globally.2.	100% FDI: As per extant Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy, FDI up-to 100% under the automatic route is permitted for electronics manufacturing (except from countries sharing land border with India), subject to applicable laws / regulations; security and other conditions.3.	Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC) Scheme: Electronics Manufacturing Clusters Scheme was notified on 22nd October, 2012 to provide support for creation of world-class infrastructure along with common facilities and amenities for attracting investment. Under the Scheme, 19 Greenfield EMCs and 3 Common Facility Centres (CFCs) measuring an area of 3,464 acres with total project cost of INR 3,762 crore including Government Grant-in-Aid of INR 1,538 crore have been approved.4.	Electronics Development Fund (EDF): Electronics Development Fund (EDF) has been set up as a “Fund of Funds” to participate in professionally managed “Daughter Funds” which in turn will provide risk capital to startups and companies developing new technologies in the area of electronics and Information Technology (IT). This fund is expected to foster R&D and innovation in these technology sectors.5.	Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP) has been notified to promote domestic value addition in mobile phones and their sub-assemblies / parts manufacturing. As a result, India has rapidly started attracting investments into this sector and significant manufacturing capacities have been set up in the country. The manufacturing of mobile phones has been steadily moving from Semi Knocked Down (SKD) to Completely Knocked Down (CKD) level, thereby progressively increasing the domestic value addition. 6.	Tariff Structure has been rationalized to promote domestic manufacturing of electronic goods, including, inter-alia, Cellular mobile phones, Televisions, Electronic components, Set Top Boxes for TV, LED products and Medical electronics equipment.7.	Exemption from Basic Customs Duty on capital goods: Notified capital goods for manufacture of specified electronic goods are permitted for import at “NIL” Basic Customs Duty.8.	Simplified import of used plant and machinery: The import of used plant and machinery having a residual life of at least 5 years for use by the electronics manufacturing industry has been simplified through the amendment of Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016, vide Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Notification dated 11.06.2018.9.	Relaxing the ageing restriction: The Department of Revenue vide Notification No.60/2018-Customs dated 11.09.2018 has amended the Notification No.158/95-Customs dated 14.11.1995, relaxing the ageing restriction from 3 years to 7 years for specified electronic goods manufactured in India and re-imported into India for repairs or reconditioning.10.	Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order 2017: To encourage ‘Make in India’ and to promote manufacturing and production of goods and services in India with a view to enhancing income and employment, the Government has issued Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order 2017 vide the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) Order dated 15.06.2017 and subsequent revisions vide Orders dated 28.05.2018, 29.05.2019, 04.06.2020 and 16.09.2020. In furtherance of the aforesaid Order, MeitY has notified mechanism for calculating local content for 13 Electronic Products viz., (i) Desktop PCs, (ii) Thin Clients, (iii) Computer Monitors, (iv) Laptop PCs, (v) Tablet PCs, (vi) Dot Matrix Printers, (vii) Contact and Contactless Smart Cards, (viii) LED Products, (ix) Biometric Access Control / Authentication Devices, (x) Biometric Finger Print Sensors, (xi) Biometric Iris Sensors, (xii) Servers, and (xiii) Cellular Mobile Phones, for procurement to be made from local suppliers.11.	Compulsory Registration Order (CRO): MeitY has notified “Electronics and Information Technology Goods (Requirement of Compulsory Registration) Order, 2012” for mandatory compliance to ensure safety of Indian citizens by curbing import of substandard and unsafe electronic goods into India. 63 Product Categories have been notified under the CRO and the order is applicable on 63 product categories.12.	Establishment of Gallium Nitride (GaN) Ecosystem Enabling Centre and Incubator: The project for “Establishment of Gallium Nitride (GaN) Ecosystem Enabling Centre and Incubator for High Power and High Frequency Electronics” has been approved. The project is being implemented by Society for Innovation and Development (SID), Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE), IISc Bengaluru.Annexure-IIApproved CFCs under EMC for State of MaharashtraS.No. 	State 	Location 	Area (Acres) 	Implementing Agency 	Financial Outlay (INR crore)					Project Cost 	Grant-in-aid 1	Maharashtra	Shendra Industrial Area, Aurangabad District	1.98	Deogiri Electronics Cluster Private Limited (DECPL)	28.57	20.582	Maharashtra	Pimpri Industrial Area, Pune	0.61	MCCIA Electronic Cluster Foundation (MECF)	67	50Annexure-IIIApproved Applications under MSIPS for State of MaharashtraS.
