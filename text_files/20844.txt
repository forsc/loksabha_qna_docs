MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a)  & (b) : As per Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE), 2018-19 (Provisional), the details of schools with playground State/UT-wise including Bihar are at Annexure. (c) & (d): Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme –Samagra Shiksha for School Education. Samagra Shiksha supports States and UTs for strengthening of existing government schools, and for creation and augmentation of infrastructure facilities based on the gap determined by Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) and proposals received from respective State/UT.  Further, to address the issue of shortage of playgrounds in schools, this Ministry has issued an advisory to the State Governments that the schools that do not have playgrounds, may make adequate arrangements in an adjoining playground, municipal park etc., for children to play outdoor games and other physical activities.The Schedule to Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 lays down the norms and standards for a school building. A school building has to be an all-weather building comprising, inter alia, playground facility.There is an inbuilt system for creating sports facilities for students in Kendriya Vidyalayas. As and when a building for Kendriya Vidyalaya is constructed, a provision is kept for developing sports infrastructure/playgrounds as per the local need and the land availability. Also, in Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, sports facilities such as running track, playfield, Basketball field, Kho-Kho etc are provided. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) grants affiliation to the school on fulfillment of mandatory conditions as laid down in Affiliation Bye-laws 2018. As per rule of Affiliation Bye-Laws, school shall have adequate ground to create outdoor facilities for at least 200 meter Athletics Track, Kabbadi, Kho-Kho, Volleyball, basketball etc. In all cases where the affiliation has been granted on relaxed land norms, the outdoor facilities shall be proportional to available land. UGC also provided Financial Assistance to eligible colleges under the scheme “Development of Sports Infrastructure & Equipment” for promotion of sports.The Ministry of Rural Development has issued a notification in March, 2017 which makes a provision for construction of play fields and compound walls for Government run schools in the villages under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005. Further, the Ministry of Youth Affair & Sports is implementing the Khelo India Scheme which inter-alia includes a vertical ‘Play Field Development’ which provides for putting in place a strong institutionalized mechanism for preserving, protecting, developing and promoting playfields.*****
