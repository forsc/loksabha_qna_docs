Prasar Bharati has informed that it has not taken any such decision to stop the production of programmes by different regional stations of All India Radio (AIR) in Kerala. There is also no proposal to convert any regional station in Kerala into a relay station of Thiruvananthapuram. Prasar Bharati is currently maintaining status quo with respect to the operation of 200 KW Medium Wave Transmitter in Alappuzha which is currently relaying AIR, Thiruvananthapuram.  A 5 KW FM transmitter has been installed at Alappuzha in 2019 which is also relaying the same service. (c) & (d): Keeping pace with modern technology, Prasar Bharati has introduced new modes of transmission across India.  Various AIR regional services now have a satellite footprint through “DD FreeDish” DTH Satellite Radio. Several local and regional radio services of AIR, including AIR channels originating from all stations in Kerala also have a global footprint through Prasar Bharati’s App “NewsOnAIR” available on “Android” and “IOS” and on newsonair.com website.  Adoption of new-age Digital Radio transmitters is subject to final outcome of the testing and evaluation of latest digital radio standard to be adopted by India.There are 35 Medium Wave and 3 Short Wave solid state transmitters which are additionally capable of operating in Digital Mode based on the DRM standard. There are 93 analog Medium Wave and 9 analog Short Wave transmitters based on outdated technology.  The list of such transmitters is at Annexure-I and Annexure-II.*****
