ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) and (b): Proposals for construction of Road Over Bridges/Road Under Bridges (ROBs/RUBs) in lieu of level crossings are normally received from State Government.  After completing various formalities regarding the consents for sharing of cost and closure of level crossings from State Government, the  proposals  are  further  processed  for  their  inclusion  in Railway Works Programme. During the last three years i.e. 2016-17, 2017-18 & 2018-19, 61 valid proposals have been received in Uttar Pradesh.  All proposals were cleared during this period and no such valid proposals are pending for clearance.(c) and (d): Construction of ROB in lieu of Level Crossing (LC) No. 154 between Fatehgarh and Farrukhabad and ROB in lieu of LC No. 182 between Kaimganj and Rudain stations has been sanctioned. Railway has requested State Government to expedite the consent for sharing of cost and closure of LC. Further action will be taken after receipt of consent from State Government.LC No. 9C between Farrukhabad-Neemkarori on Farrukhabad-Manpuri section does not qualify for construction of ROB on cost sharing basis, as traffic density at this LC is less than one Lakh.*****
