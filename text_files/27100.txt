ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES (SHRI NARAYAN RANE)(a) & (b):		The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector consists of private players and investments in this sector are made by the entrepreneurs themselves.  The Ministry of MSME does not establish micro, small and medium enterprises in the country. Promotion and development of enterprises is a State subject. However, the Central Government supplements the efforts of the State/UT Governments through various schemes, programmes and policy initiatives for promotion, development and enhancing the competitiveness of MSMEs in the country. MSMEs can avail the benefits of schemes being implemented by the Government such as Prime Minister''s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), Rural Employment Generation Programme (REGP), Micro Units Development & Refinance Agency (MUDRA), Credit Linked Capital Subsidy for Technology Upgradation Scheme (CLCS-TUS), Scheme for Khadi, Village and Coir Industries, International Cooperation Scheme, Procurement and Marketing Support Scheme, Scheme for Credit Guarantee Fund for Micro and Small Enterprises, etc.
