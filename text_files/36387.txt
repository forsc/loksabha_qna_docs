At the time of construction of station, Minimum Essential Amenities (MEA) are provided as per norms based on the category of station.

At present development of railway sations is also undertaken under Adarsh Station Scheme based on identified need of providing better enhanced passenger amenities at stations.  Various passenger amenities such as improvement to façade of the station building, retiring room, waiting room (with bathing facilities), separate waiting room for ladies, computer based public address system, landscaping of circulating area, signages, Pay & Use toilets, water coolers, ramps at entry to station for Divyangjan and Senior Citizens etc. are provided depending upon the respective category of the station identified and developed under this scheme. Modern facilities like lifts, escalators etc. are also set up depending upon the priority of the station concerned.             However, with a view to meet the expectations of the rail users, Indian Railways is making all out efforts to provide improved amenties/facilities at railway stations  and works in this regard are undertaken depending upon volume of the passenger traffic and inter-se priority  subject to availability of funds.*****
