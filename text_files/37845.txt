                                                                     THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE  MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                          (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a)	 to (c) Land and Colonization are State Subjects. Therefore, Schemes on housing are implemented by States/ UTs. However, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs under the vision of ‘Housing for All’, is supplementing the efforts of States/ UTs by providing central assistance under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana- Urban (PMAY-U) for construction of houses for all eligible families/ beneficiaries. Eligible beneficiaries can avail the benefit of PMAY-U through four verticals, i.e., Beneficiary-led Construction or enhancement (BLC); Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP); ‘In-Situ’ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) and Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS).  Under PMAY-U, State/UT wise details of houses sanctioned during last three and current year (2018-2022) along with status of houses grounded for construction and completed is annexed as Annexure. In Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg in Maharashtra, 4,955 houses have so far been sanctioned of which 3,209 are grounded for construction and 2,950 have been completed. (d) 	States/ UTs formulate project proposals as per their assessed demand of houses under the Scheme in aphased manner based on their resources and get them approved by State Level Sanctioning & Monitoring Committee (SLSMC). After approval from the concerned SLSMC, States/ UTs submit the proposals to this Ministry for approval of Central Assistance by the Central Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee. Completion of projects generally takes 12-36 months under different verticals of Scheme. States/ UTs are required to adhere to the timeline as mentioned in Detailed Project Reports for completion of project. Accordingly, progress of the Scheme varies from State to State. In order to achieve the vision of ‘Housing for All’, all States/UTs have been advised to expedite the construction of sanctioned houses so that all houses are completed within the stipulated period.(e) & (f) As per Scheme guidelines, the minimum size of houses constructed under the Mission under each component should conform to the standards provided in the National Building Code (NBC). However, if the available area of land does not permit building of such minimum size of houses as per NBC and, if beneficiary consent is available for reduced size of house, a suitable decision on area maybe taken by States/UTs with the approval of State Level Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee (SLSMC).The Mission supports construction of houses upto 30 square meter carpet area with basic civic infrastructure. States/UTs have flexibility in terms of determining the size of house and other facilities at the State/UT level in consultation with the Ministry. Under Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme vertical, permissible carpet areas are as under:Particulars	Economically Weaker   Low Income   Middle Income     Middle Income Group                 Section (EWS)	      Group(LIG)   Group (MIG-I)    (MIG-II)  Scheme  	   17.06.2015 to 31.03.2022	        01.01.2017 to 31.03.2021durationCarpet Area	Upto 30 sqm.
