                                                    (a) 	whether the Government has formulated/likely to formulate any scheme to tackle the imminent situation which is likely to affect consumers’ demand and cause vast impact on market due to 44 per cent less rainfall than average in June and poor monsoon which has led to destruction of crops reliant on rainfall and caused possibility of drought; and (b) 	if so, the details thereof, State-wise?






ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	As per second India Meteorological Department (IMD) Long Range Forecast, released on 31.05.2019, rainfall over the country as a whole for the 2019 South-West Monsoon Season (June to September) is likely to be NORMAL (96% to 104% of the Long Period Average). The actual rainfall received from 01.06.2019 to 11.07.2019 is 230 mm which is (-) 12% than normal figure of 261.8 mm. The area coverage in the ensuing Kharif Season on 11.07.2019 is 413.34 lakh ha and is in progress. No State Government has submitted any Memorandum seeking financial assistance from NDRF for drought during Kharif 2019 season. In case of imminent situation, which if arises due to irregular rainfall, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)- Central Research Institute of Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), Hyderabad has prepared Crop Contingency Plans for 648 districts in the country for adoption by States to sustain the agriculture production. Though the Monsoon has been delayed, the sowing of Kharif crops has since picked up and at this stage, no shortfall in production is anticipated. Less rainfall in the pre-Monsoon period does not necessarily translate into a drought scenario, however the Government is closely monitoring the situation and is well prepared for any eventuality. ******
