                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b):	The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) launched by the Government of India identified the approach to be adopted to meet the challenges of impact of climate change through institutionalization of 8 national missions which inter-alia includes a ''National Water Mission''. As per the information received from the Central Water Commission, eight research studies on the impact of climate change on water resources are being taken up by the National Water Mission, Ministry of Jal Shakti (MoJS). Details of these studies are at Annexure I.The Department of Science and Technology (DST) has supported research projects to Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG); NationalInstitute of Hydrology (NIH);G.B. Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment; Kashmir University and Indian Institute of Technology  Madras to carry out studies on the impact of climate change on water resources. The MoJShas been implementing various programs and schemes on the conservation of water resources in the country.The Jal Shakti Abhiyan with a mission mode approachis intended to improve water availability, including groundwater conditions in the water-stressed blocks of 256 districts in India.  The National Hydrology Project is being implemented to improve the extent, quality and accessibility of water resources information and to strengthen the capacity of water resources management institutions in India. This ensuresthe availability of reliable, real-time and continuous data for informed decision-making. For this purpose, modern technologies like LiDARMapping, Real Time Data Acquisition System through telemetry, Supervisory Control and Data AcquisitionSystem (SCADA) for water resources management and advanced information technology based information system is being used.(c):	The Central Ground Water Board, MoJS is periodically monitoring the groundwater levels across the country, through a network of monitoring wells.  The groundwater level for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 is given in the Annexure- II, III and IV.(d):	The Government of India is implementing a National Network Project, ‘National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture’(NICRA), which is aimed at assessing the impact of climate change and to enhance the resilience of Indian agriculture to climate change and climate vulnerability through strategic research and technology demonstration. The research on adaptation and mitigation covers crops, livestock, fisheries and natural resource management. The Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI)has carried out focused studies on climate change impacts on marine flora and fauna, besides implementation of adaptation options in a time-bound manner. The effects of climate change in aquatic ecosystems can be direct, through rise in sea surface temperature (SST), changes in rainfall, and associated changes in the phenology of the organisms, or indirect ie., through ocean acidification, through shifts in ocean currents and rise in sea level.  The rate of change in SST in the Indian Seas revealed that the impact is more in the west coast than the east coast. The Northern Indian Ocean has been identified as one of the 17 climate change hotspots among world oceans. These areas will warm faster than 90% of the world oceans. Studies on the effects of climatic parameters on phenology of various marine fishes indicate that SST, chlorophyll-a, current speed, wind and rainfall do have influence on the diet, spawning, maturity, mean length, fecundity, distribution and catch of various species of marine fishes. The distributional shifts of several marine species will have implications on the fish catch.  The distributional boundaries of oil sardine and Indian mackerel have extended, and could be attributed to the habitat modifications induced by climatic parameter variations. The Indian mackerel was found to descent into deeper water strata under the influence of induced habitat modification. The distribution of Zoanthids and the dynamic changes exhibited by the Zoanthids in relation to various environmental parameters was identified with quantitative information. Significant changes in chlorophyll-a has also been identified by scientific analysis, which also has implications for ecosystem productivity. During the monsoon period, increasing trend of chlorophyll-a was also observed.  In long-term,the climate change is likely to impact the marine environment and its capacity to sustain fish stocks and exacerbate stress on the marine fish stocks.*****
