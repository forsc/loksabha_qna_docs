ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a):		 Yes, Sir.  The scheme Rajiv Gandhi Shramik Kalyan Yojana (RGSKY) provides unemployment allowance to the Insured Persons (IPs) in case he/she becomes unemployed involuntarily due to:-Contd..2/-::  2  ::i)	retrenchment as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.ii)	closure of the factory/ establishment as defined in the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.iii)	permanent invalidity of not less than 40% arising out of non-employment injury. The Scheme Atal Beemit Vyakti Kalyan Yojana (ABVKY) is a welfare measure for the employees covered under Section 2(9) of the Employees’ State Insurance (ESI) Act, 1948 in the form of cash compensation up to 90 days once in lifetime of the worker in the contingency of Insured person’s unemployment.(b) to (e):	  Yes, Sir. The schemes are applicable only to the Insured Persons (IPs) working in factories covered under the ESI Act, 1948 in the notified areas.   Further, the Act is applicable on the factories/establishments employing 10 or more workers.  Hence at present these two schemes i.e. RGSKY and ABVKY are not available to the workers working in factories and establishments not covered under ESI Act and employing less than 10 employees/workers. However, provisions have been made in the Code on Social Security 2020 for voluntary coverage of the establishments employing less than the 10 number of employees.  The Code on Social Security, 2020 has not come into force so far.********
