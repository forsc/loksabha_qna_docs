                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b): To achieve the objective of “Housing for All” by 2022, the Government is implementing Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) w.e.f. 1st April, 2016 in rural areas and Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana Urban (PMAY-U) since 25th June, 2015 in urban areas of the country.  (c): In the State of Odisha, under PMAY-G, as on 28.02.2020, a total of 15,36,469 houses have been sanctioned out of which 11,01,907 have been completed.  Under PMAY-U a total of 1,50,384 houses have been sanctioned out of which 59,616 houses have been completed. (d) & (e): Under PMAY-U, no such specific instance of irregularities in allotment of houses has been reported by the State Government of Odisha so far. However, under PMAY-G, as on 28.02.2020, a total of 43 complaints from the State of Odisha relating to irregularities in implementation, including irregularities in allotment of houses have been received in Ministry of Rural Development since its inception. As the State Govt./UT Administration implement PMAY-G, these complaints have been sent to the State for taking necessary action as per the provisions  of the scheme guidelines. The Framework for Implementation (FFI) of PMAY-G, provides for setting up a grievance redressal mechanism   at different levels of administration viz., Gram Panchayat, Block, District and the State. An official of the State Government is to be designated at each level to ensure disposal of grievances to the satisfaction of the complainant. The official who is designated at each level is responsible for disposing off the grievance / complaint within a period of 15 days from the date of receipt of the grievance / complaint. The detail of the designated grievance redressal official (including name, telephone number and address) at each level for addressing the grievance and the procedure to file the grievance is to be clearly displayed in each Panchayat. There is also a procedure of lodging of complaints on the Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) portal (pgportal.gov.in). The complaints received in the Ministry of Rural Development through CPGRAMS or otherwise on programme implementation are forwarded to the respective State Governments/ Union Territory (Union Territory) Administrations for redressal of the grievance. ********
