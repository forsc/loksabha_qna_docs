The Government had constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee in April, 2016 to examine issues relating to “Doubling of Farmers Income” and recommend strategies to achieve the same. The Committee has submitted its Report to the Government in September, 2018. An Empowered Body has also been set up to monitor and review the progress against the recommendations. (c):	The Committee on Doubling Farmers’ Income (DFI) recognizes agriculture as a value led enterprise and has identified seven major sources of growth, viz., improvement in crop productivity; improvement in livestock productivity; resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; increase in the cropping intensity; diversification towards high value crops; improvement in real prices received by farmers; and shift from farm to non-farm occupations. Several initiatives have already been rolled out on the recommendations of DFI Committee. All programmes of Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare are aligned to achieving these recommendations.(d) & (e):	Yes Sir. Agro forestry including bamboo are part of the Integrated Farming System advocated by the Government for additional income to the farmers, source of food, fodder and other products as well as risk management. Government is assisting States through Sub-Mission on Agro-forestry (SMAF), National Bamboo Mission (NBM) and National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP).*******
