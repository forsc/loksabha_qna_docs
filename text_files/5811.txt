ANSWER




(a)  At present Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has notified 40 Land Customs Stations (LCS)/Dry port in the North-Eastern States. These LCS caters to international trade through land route and/or inland waterways. The list of LCS along with details of route is enclosed as Annexure. Contract for the development work for Integrated Check Post (ICP) Dawki was awarded in September, 2016 by Land Ports Authority of India, a statutory body under the administrative control of Ministry of Home Affairs, with a time period of 24 months to execute and complete it by October, 2018. The contract has been terminated on 17.01.2019 on account of very slow progress of the work. The contractor has filed a Writ Petition in Meghalaya High Court against termination of the contract and the matter is sub-judice.(b)   Land Ports Authority of India has proposed to develop  two land ports in North-Eastern States namely Sutarkandi in Karimganj district in Assam and Kawrpuichhuah in Lunglei district in Mizoram, both bordering Bangladesh.
