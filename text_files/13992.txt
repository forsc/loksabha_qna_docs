ANSWER




ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a & b) As per the recent report of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) – 4 conducted by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in 2015-16, 35.7% children under 5 years of age are underweight and 38.4% are stunted indicating a reduction from the previous NFHS – 3 conducted in 2005-06, which reported 42.5% children under 5 years of age as underweight and 48% stunted.  The above data shows that there is a reduction in the level of malnutrition among children in the country.	Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the National Food Security Act, 2013 have converted the provision of Supplementary Nutrition (SN) to the beneficiaries of Anganwadi Services into a legal entitlement. The impact of Supplementary Nutrition provided to the beneficiaries of Anganwadi Services especially the children is evident from reduction in the levels of malnutrition among the children as mentioned above. However, as per the ICDS (Supplementary Nutrition) Rules, 2017, supplementary nutrition is provided to those beneficiaries who visit the Anganwadi Centres as the scheme is self-selecting.  (c)	Supplementary Nutrition, now mandated under the NFSA, 2013, has been one of the six services provided under the Anganwadi Services (ICDS) Scheme since 1975.  Besides making supplementary nutrition a legal entitlement, NFSA also provides payment of Food Security Allowance in case of non-supply of supplementary nutrition to the beneficiary.  It also makes provision for supply of food grains at NFSA rates for preparation of supplementary nutrition under the Anganwadi Services scheme.  The challenges being faced in the implementation of the scheme, i.e., providing supplementary nutrition to the beneficiaries are related to timely release of funds by the States/UTs as their share, timely payment of honorarium to the functionaries, leakages, supply chain management issues, monitoring and supervision, etc.  These issues are addressed with improved monitoring mechanism through Rapid Reporting System and ICT-Real Time Monitoring under the newly approved National Nutrition Mission in addition to the in-built five-tier monitoring system under the scheme.Further, the Ministry is also implementing Scheme for Adolescent Girls and Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana under the Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services Schemeas direct targeted interventions to address the problem of malnutrition in a lifecycle approach. All these schemes address one or other aspects related to nutrition and have the potential to improve nutritional outcomes in the country.********
