                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a)  Government has established Field Units (Project Implementation Unit or PIU) which monitor the tolling operation at all toll plazas under its jurisdiction.      Periodical inspections by nodal officers from PIU, HQ, Regional Offices etc. are conducted to ensure proper functioning of infrastructure, true and transparent collection of user fee etc as per Contract Agreement. Irregularities, if any, are notified either during periodical inspection or through public. Same are investigated as per due process and suitable action is taken as per Contract Agreement.(b) & (c) Yes, Sir. NHAI monitors the process of collection and amount so collected by toll contractors. Public Funded fee plazas are auctioned on market discovered rate through tendering and the toll contractor is required to deposit the bidded amount to NHAI which is transferred to Consolidated Fund of India. In case of default by any such contractor, the recovery of outstanding amount is made from the Performance Security of the Contractor.       In case of Concessionaire fee plazas, the toll is collected by the Concessionaire as per their Concession Agreement and in accordance with NH Fee Rules.      With implementation of FASTag as the mode of collection of user fee, daily transaction of electronic toll collection is captured by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), which is also the clearing house for National Electronic Toll Collection.     Besides, each toll collecting agency is also required to submit toll collection and traffic detail to PIU in prescribed format each month as per Contract Agreement.(d)      Does not arise.*****
