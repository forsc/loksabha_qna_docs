ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) & (b):	The word ‘anti-national’ has not been defined in Statutes. However, there are criminal legislations and various judicial pronouncements to sternly deal with unlawful and subversive activities which are detrimental to the unity and integrity of the country. In this regard, it is relevant to mention that the Constitution (Forty–Second Amendment) Act, 1976 inserted in the Constitution Article 31D (during Emergency) which defined “anti-national activity” and this Article 31D was, subsequently, omitted by the Constitution (Forty-third Amendment) Act, 1977.  (c):	‘Public Order’ and ‘Police’ are State subjects as per the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. The responsibility of maintaining law and order, including investigation, registration and prosecution of crimes, protection of life and property, etc. rests primarily with the respective State Government. Data about number of people arrested for indulging in anti-national activities is not maintained centrally.******
