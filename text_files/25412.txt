                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) and (b): 	Food Corporation of India (FCI) has not delayed procurement of Custom Milled Rice in the State of Punjab. The details are as under: ..........2/--2-(i) 	On the request of State Government of Punjab, every Kharif Marketing Season (KMS) from 2017-18 to 2019-20 initial milling period was fixed upto 30th June.  However, during KMS 2020-21, based on the request of State Government of Punjab, procurement estimate of   rice was fixed at 113 Lakh Metric Tonnes (LMT) and milling period was fixed upto 30th April, 2021. Whereas, during KMS 2020-21,  the total custom-milled rice (CMR) due is 135.89 LMT, due to unprecedented procurement of 203.96 LMT paddy as compared to average  160-165 LMT of paddy during past few KMS.  Later, on the request of State Government, the last date of milling was extended upto 31st July, 2021.(ii) 	As on 20.07.2021, FCI has procured 128.53 LMT CMR against total due CMR of 135.89 LMT as compared to procurement of 107.79 LMT CMR against total due rice of 108.90 LMT during previous year. Thus, it is evident that the pace of acceptance of CMR during KMS 2020-21 has been faster as compared to previous year. There is no report of deterioration in quality of rice during existing KMS.(c) and (d): 	The following efforts have been made for speedy procurement of custom milled rice by FCI. (i)   	Hiring of godowns wherever available.(ii) 	Deploying staff on holidays for acceptance of custom milled rice.(iii) 	Linking rice millers for delivery of custom milled rice wherever storage space is available.(iv) 	Evacuation of stocks by enhancing movement to other States.***
