Out of this overall target, Rs. 1,28,000 crore has been fixed for Public Sector Banks (PSBs). All PSBs have been requested to make all out efforts to achieve the annual target. The national level targets under the PMMY scheme have been consistently met since inception of the scheme.(c) to (e) As on 24.01.2020, as reported by banks on the Mudra portal, 41,498 and 92,218 loans have been extended by banks under PMMY in Sikar and Jaipur districts of Rajasthan during the current FY. Details of loan applications received by various banks are not maintained centrally. Loans under the scheme are extended by banks as per commercial parameters and are based, inter-alia, on viability of project and on assessment of repayment capacity of the borrower and in compliance with their Board-approved policy and extant Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines in this regard. Reasons for rejection of loan applications may include, inter-alia, non-viability of the project, inconsistencies found in pre-sanction stage, unsatisfactory credit history of the borrower etc. Any complaints received in respect of implementation of PMMY including turning down of loan applications are redressed in coordination with the respective MLIs.*****
