ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	 The Directorate of Plant Protection, Quarantine and Storage (DPPQ&S) receives complaints regarding manufacturing and selling of spurious pesticides (including weedicides) from the farmers/consumers and other stakeholders of various States. The details of such complaints received during the last three years is at Annexure-I.   No complaints of supply of spurious fertilizers have been received by the Government.Contd..2/--2-(b) & (c):	 The number of samples of various pesticides (including weedicides) tested and found to be misbranded by the Central Insecticide and State Insecticide Inspectors during the last three years and the current year along with the action taken is at Annexure II. The year wise details of number of samples of fertilizers analysed and declared non-standard during the last three years and the current year along with the action taken is at Annexure III.  (d) & (e):	 To check the sale of misbranded pesticides and to monitor the quality of pesticides, the Central Government has enacted the Insecticides Act, 1968. As per the Insecticides Act, 1968, the monitoring of quality of pesticides is a shared responsibility between the Central and State Governments. Central Government and State Governments have notified 138 and 10905 Insecticides Inspectors respectively to check sale of misbranded pesticides. Insecticide samples are drawn on regular basis and analyzed in 69 State Pesticides Testing Laboratories (SPTLs) and at the two Regional Pesticides Testing Laboratories at Chandigarh and Kanpur. Action is initiated under the provisions of the Insecticides Act, 1968 against those samples which are found misbranded. The Insecticides Act 1968 does not have provision for determination of pesticides prices.The Government of India has declared the fertilizer as essential commodity under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and has promulgated the Fertilizer (Control) Order 1985, to regulate the trade, price, quality and distribution of fertilizers. Under Clause 19 of FCO, no person shall sale, offer for sale, manufacture, import or distribute any fertilizers which are not of prescribed standard. Any violation of the provision of Fertilizer (Control) Order 1985, invokes both administrative and penal action under the Essential Commodities Act. Further, there are 86 fertilizer testing laboratories in the country. Samples of fertilizers are periodically drawn and tested in these laboratories to check their quality. The Government of India has fixed the MRP of Urea under FCO and it is not permissible to sell the same beyond the statutory price. The Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) fertilizers are not under statutory price, but the Government of India is granting subsidy and ensure the reasonability of the prices.
