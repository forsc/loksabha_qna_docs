                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a)  to (c) Under National Perspective Plan (NPP) prepared in the year 1980 for inter-basin water transfer from water surplus basins to water deficit basins, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component and 14 under Himalayan Component). Out of these identified links, 3 link projects are in the State of Odisha, the details of Interlinking of rivers projects for the State of Odisha, with their present status and benefits, are at Annexure. No link project related to the State of Odisha is yet ready for implementation. The Ken- Betwa Link Project is the first link under NPP that is under implementation after a tripartite agreement was signed between the States of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh and the Central Government on 22 March, 2021. Subsequently, Government of India approved the implementation of Ken-Betwa Link Project with an estimated cost of Rs. 44,605 crore (at year 2020-21 price levels), including central support of Rs. 39,317 crore [ 90 (Centre): 10 (State) ], through a special purpose vehicle.  (d)   After carrying out technical studies, the National Water Development Agency has identified surplus and deficit river basins for proposal of link canals for transfer of water. Under the Himalayan Component, the tributaries of Ganga such as Kosi, Sarda (at Poornagiri), Ghaghra (at Chisapani), Gandak (at proposed Gandak Dam), and Ganga at Chunar and tributaries of Brahmaputra such as Manas, Sankosh, Aie, Raidak, Torsa and Jaldhaka are surplus. In Peninsular component, the river basins of Mahanadi, Godavari, Par, Damanganga, Pamba, Achankovil, Netravati, Bedti, Ken at Daudhan, Parbati (upto Patanpur) and Kalisindh (Sub-basin of Chambal) (upto Kundaliya) have been identified as surplus river basins.  Krishna, Pennar, Cauvery, Vaigai and Vaippar under Peninsular Component and Yamuna at Okhla and Ganga at Narora under Himalayan Component have been identified as deficit river basins. However, interlinking of rivers proposals depend exclusively on consensus among party States for implementation.  **** ANNEXURE ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) TO (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2543 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 17.03.2022 REGARDING “INTER-LINKING OF RIVERS IN ODISHA”.
