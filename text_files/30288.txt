ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a)	Under Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) [SBM (G)], in Karnataka, 46,28,972 individual household latrines (IHHLs) have been constructed from 02.10.2014 to 06.12.2021, as reported by the State on the online Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) of SBM(G).  (b)	State/UT-wise details of IHHLs constructed under SBM(G) in the country from 02.10.2014 to 06.12.2021 are given at Annexure-1. (c) & (d)   Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation had conducted National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS) in 2019-20 through an independent verification agency.  State-wise details of usage of toilets as per NARSS 2019-20 are given at Annexure-2.  Sanitation is mainly a behavioral issue. It involves change of mindset of people to stop open defecation and to adopt safe sanitation practices and use toilets. Under SBM(G), Government has been focusing on sustaining the behaviour change through Information Education and Communication (IEC) and Inter Personal Communication (IPC) activities. Under SBM(G), funds are released to the States in a consolidated manner for all the components including IEC. Up to 5% of the programme funds can be used on IEC.  (e) 	As reported by the States/UTs on the IMIS of SBM(G), out of the toilets constructed during the last 4 years and the current year, 79.68% are twin pits, 6.10% are septic tanks, and 10.41% are single pits.(f) 	Under SBM (G), for disposal of human excreta, use of twin leach pit toilet technology which is a safe and eco-friendly onsite sanitation technology, is encouraged for most parts of the country.  Under this technology, human faeces automatically become manure in 1-2 years and no manual scavenging is required.(g) 	Having achieved the outcomes of ODF, Phase-II of SBM(G) is now being implemented with the goal to make all the villages ODF Plus by 2024-25, i.e. to sustain the ODF status and to cover the villages with Solid and Liquid Waste Management (SLWM).  Under the programme, no specific year-wise targets have been fixed for the States. Each year, State Governments submit their Annual Implementation Plans (AIPs) to the Government of India, containing the details of activities planned to be undertaken during the year.  The AIPs are approved by the National Scheme Sanctioning Committee (NSSC) of SBM (G).*****
