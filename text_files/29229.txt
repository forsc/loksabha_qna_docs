ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) & (b) Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) is periodically monitoring the ground water levels throughout the country including Chhattisgarh on a regional scale, through a network of monitoring wells. In order to assess the long term fluctuation in ground water level, the water level data collected by CGWB during November 2020 has been compared with the decadal mean of November (2010-2019). Analysis of water level data indicates that about 30% of the wells monitored have registered decline in ground water levels in the range of 0 – 2 m whereas, around 45% of the wells have also reported rise of groundwater levels in the same range. The State-wise details including Chhattisgarh are given in Annexure. No specific information about linkage of depleting groundwater levels with shortage of drinking water is available.  However, Government of India, in partnership with State Governments, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) since August, 2019 to provide potable tap water supply of prescribed quality to every rural household in the country by 2024.(c) Presently no specific new scheme for groundwater recharge is under consideration with this Department. Contd…P/2//2//(d) Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management including groundwater recharge is primarily States’ responsibility.  However, important measures taken by the Central Government for conservation, management of ground water and effective implementation of rain water harvesting in the country are available at the following URL:http://jalshakti-dowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Feb2021.pdf. Government of India (GoI) generally supports artificial groundwater recharge/water harvesting works in the country through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana - Watershed Development component (PMKSY-WDC), ‘Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI) and Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies schemes’, components of PMKSY (launched in 2015-16). GoI is implementing Atal Bhujal Yojana (Atal Jal), a Rs.6,000 crore central sector scheme, for sustainable management of ground water resources with community participation. Atal Jal is being implemented in 81 water stressed districts and 8,774 gram panchayats of seven States viz. Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.  ***  ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) & (b) of Unstarred Question No.†913 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 02.12.2021 regarding “Shortage of Drinking Water”.State-wise Decadal Water Level Fluctuation with Mean [November (2010 to 2019] and November 2020S.
