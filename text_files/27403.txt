                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH ANDFAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a)	Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), an autonomous body under the Department of Health Research (DHR), is a medical research organization in the country which spearheads planning, formulation, coordination, implementation and promotion of biomedical and health research. Through its 27 research institutes across India as well as through extramural funding to promote research in institutes other than ICMR, medical colleges, Universities and non-governmental organizations, ICMR undertakes research in the area of various communicable as well as non-communicable diseases such as malaria, Japanese encephalitis, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, Kala-azar, Filariasis, Leprosy, Poliomyelitis, cancer, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and stroke. Also, it caters to the research questions pertaining to current public health concerns including nutrition, reproduction and maternal and child health, occupational and environmental health and health systems research. Major areas of research undertaken by ICMR Institutes in the last three years can be accessed at ICMR’s website at the link https://main.icmr.nic.in/sites/default/files/upload_documents /ICMR_Achievement_last_3yrs.pdfDetails of the funds allocated on intramural and extramural research by ICMR in last three years are attached as Annexure-I.Details of revenue generated in last three years are attached as Annexure II.(b)   A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been executed between ICMR & FICCI for commercialization of ICMR technologies. (c)  ICMR-FICCI Health Technology Accelerated Commercialization (HTAC) program was conceived to facilitate the growth of the ICMR research as a technology provider to nation. The outcome of this program is as under:(i): Capacity Building and Value creation through tech transfer &commercialisation workshops. (ii): Technology Assessment & Commercialization whereby 20 technologies have been identified for commercialization.(iii): Participation in Global Research and Development Summit and Exposition-2019 to display the technologies at the exposition held at this summit.(iv):  Business Development statusTechnologies titled ‘AV Magnivisualiser’;Fly ash-based mosquito larvicidal formulations and A novel Salmonella Typhi protein as subunit vaccine is under process of commercialisation.(d):     The working of ICMR has been reviewed by a Review Committee constituted by Government of India under the Chairmanship of Professor (Dr.) M. K. Bhan, Former Secretary, Department of Biotechnology, Government of India.It, inter alia recommended strengthening the DHR and ICMR linkages; administrative reorganization of the existing institutes by merger of ICMR institutes and centres doing similar work or those having fewer than 10 scientists, or those having low productivity of less than one publication per scientist per year; enhancing Human Resource Capacities; foster Multi-Sector Collaboration; undertaking flagship research programmes in mission mode aligned to national priorities; etc.7 small institutes of ICMR have since been merged into existing institutes. The mandates of the smaller institutes have been included in that of the parent institutes thus broadening their research expertise and complementing each other’s capacities. Also, a number of fellowships have been initiated to nurture clinical scientists.Presently, in ICMR, there are 211 posts vacant in Health Research Scientists Cadre, 228 posts in Administrative Cadre including Hindi Cadre posts and 1151 posts in Technical Cadre.(e) A number of organizational, governance, scientific and policy level changes have been made towards augmenting capacity strengthening, infrastructure and mission mode target oriented research, as follows:•	Merger of small Institutes/Centres of ICMR has improved the work efficiency as well as helped in re-appropriating the administrative and financial resources.•	Implementation of DASHBOARD Darpan Portal for analytical review of projects for wider publicity and public awareness. Similarly, Electronic Project Proposal Management System (e-ppms) has been implemented for submission, processing, review of scientific research proposals & release of grants.•	Treasury Single Account (TSA) system was implemented in 2018-19 as part of pilot run by O/o CGA, Ministry of Finance under which entire grant of ICMR is released in RBI as Assignment rather than actual release. TSA has been resumed since April, 2021.Time bound mission mode projects with national public health priorities in focus have been identified and initiated.
