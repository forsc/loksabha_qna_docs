ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE)FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS & SPORTS{ SHRI KIREN RIJIJU }(a) Sports’ being a State subject the primary responsibility of promotion and participation in Sports rests with concerned State/Union Territory Government. Central Government supplements efforts of the State/Union Territories. One sports infrastructure project namely construction of Multipurpose Indoor Hall at Nawada was sanctioned in Bihar during 2018-19. However, due to non-fulfilment of electronic payment system compliances by the Bihar State Sports Authority, the funds could not be transferred.(b) The total amount released to the States of the country including Bihar and Jharkhand under Khelo India Scheme during last three years and current financial year is at Annexure – I. No funds have been released for construction of stadium or youth hostels during last three years and in the current financial year.(c) Sports has been a growing field and therefore it is natural for the demand to exceed budgetary allocation.(d) and (e) The Central Government has been assisting the State of Bihar and Jharkhand by providing SAI Training Centers at Patna, Kishanganj and Gidhaur in Bihar and Hazaribagh and Ranchi in Jharkhand along with a National Center of Excellence (NCOE) at Regional Center at Kolkata. Central Government provides assistance for training, participation, competitions and exposure abroad in different Sports discipline as finalized in Annual Calendar for Training & Competition (ACTC) in consultation with National Sports Federations (NSFs). Necessary arrangement such as lodging / boarding / supplementary nutrition / sports kits etc. are made for athletes during training.(f) State wise budget allocation is not made under Khelo India scheme. Funds released by the Government for sports infrastructure and sports activities in all States/ Union Territories, including in Bihar under Khelo India Scheme during the last three years and in the current financial year is at Annexure – I.**********
