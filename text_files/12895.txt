                                                        (a)  to (d) : A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. Statement in reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 154* for reply on 02-03-2020 regarding “AGRICULTURE RELATED TRAINING TO YOUTH” by Hon’ble Member Shri JANARDAN SINGH SIGRIWALThe Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare on 20th March 2018 with a view to creating an efficient and effective training, assessment and certification process for skill development in varied job roles in agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, fisheries etc. The MoU also seeks to encourage employment of skilled and certified workforce and recognition of prior learning of the workforce already engaged in the sector besides encouraging youth to undergo skill training in various vocations in agriculture for livelihood opportunities. Agriculture Skill Council of India (ASCI) under the Ministry has developed 173 Qualification Packs for various job roles for Agriculture. The skill training courses are conducted through National Training Institutes, State Level Training Institutes (SAMETIs), Krishi Vigyan Kendras and State Agricultural Universities. The major areas of skill trainings include mushroom production, bee-keeping, micro-irrigation, maintenance and repair of farm equipment, horticulture, organic grower, vermi-compost production, animal husbandry, dairying, poultry, fishery etc.The Ministry through Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), Jan Shikshan Sansthan and other non-PMKVY Programmes like Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, State Skill Missions has been imparting skill training in horticulture, bee-keeping and animal husbandry etc. As per data provided by the Agriculture Sector Skill Council (ASCI), the number of persons trained in horticulture, bee-keeping and animal husbandry are as follows:- i	Horticulture	38,371ii	Bee-keeping	4,044iii	Animal Husbandry  (Dairy and Poultry)	48,525Besides Short Term Trainings (STT), the Government has been facilitating Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) which is providing vocational identity to the agriculture farmers and labourers. RPL with bridge training is a great enabler for upskilling/ reskilling of farmers and also provides other benefits viz; access to credit, access to market, reduction in losses, digital skills through apps for accessing advisory and market information, financial literacy enabling them to calculate and price their produce and benefit through safe and judicious use of Agrochemicals.
