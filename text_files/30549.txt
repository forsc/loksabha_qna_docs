ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER FOR HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE AND CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS(DR. MANSUKH  MANDAVIYA)(a):	Yes, Sir.(b):	The details of the urea units where natural gas is being used / proposed to be used in place of Naptha are enclosed as Annexure.(c):	The use of Natural Gas in place of Naphtha reduces the cost of production. MRP of urea is statutorily controlled/ fixed by the Government, therefore, there is no impact of change in feedstock on MRP of urea. According to Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilizers Ltd (MCFL) and Madras Fertilizers Ltd (MFL), the recently converted plants, natural gas is received through pipeline and directly used in the manufacturing process as both feed and fuel, eliminating the potential risk posed due to storage of large inventory of Naptha. The feedstock conversion has resulted in reduction Steam Carbon ratio from 3.3 to 3.0 leading overall reduction in carbon in the environment. Replacing high sulphur content feedstock with eco-friendly feedstock ensures cleaner environment. There is an overall reduction in energy level used for the production of Ammonia and Urea.*****                                                                                AnnexureS.
