In villages, since women generally are responsible for fetching water for the whole family, tap water supply in homes will bring down their drudgery, ensuring dignity and time for other productive activities.With the provision of 50% women members in the Village Water & Sanitation Committee (VWSC) or Pani Samiti, which is responsible for planning, implementation, management, operation and maintenance of water supply schemes in villages, and training of 5 persons, preferably women in each village to test the quality of drinking water, will also empower women in rural areas.(b) 	Doesn’t arise.(c) 	At the time of announcement of Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) on 15th August, 2019, out of 18.93 Crore rural households, only 3.23 Crore households (17%) were reported to have tap water connections. Since then, 3.85 Crore rural households have been provided tap water connections. Thus, as on date, out of 19.19 Crore rural households across the country, 7.08 Crore (37 %) households have tap water supply. State-wise details of central fund allocated to States/ UTs in 2019-20 and 2020-21, and physical achievements in terms of tap water connections provided to households so far, is annexed.	****
