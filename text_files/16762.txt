ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTER OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	The Government has identified 112 districts which had shown relatively less progress in key socio-economic indicators pertaining to health, education, agriculture, skill development, financial inclusion and basic infrastructure. These districts have been taken up for rapid development and have been termed as the Aspirational Districts. State wise list of 112 Aspirational districts including districts in States of Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra is placed at Annexure-I. (b)	Under the Aspirational District programme, no large infusion of additional funds has been envisaged. Instead, the programme uses the strategy of brining convergence among the existing schemes of Central and the State Governments, robust monitoring of key performance indicators and competition among district teams for better performance on basis of ranking them on the progress achieved. At the same time, in order to incentivize better performing districts, a provision of granting additional allocation has been added.  Under this initiative, districts which have secured the overall best and second-best performance in a month are given one-time additional allocation of Rs. 10 cr. and Rs. 5 cr. respectively. In addition, districts performing best in individual sectors like heath, educations etc. are given one-time additional allocation of Rs. 3 cr. each.  Number of projects that has been approved for such districts which have shown good performance since inception of this provision is placed at Annexure-II. (c)	& (d) After becoming entitled for additional allocation as mentioned in (b) above, a district identifies innovative projects and submits the same to an Empowered Committee in Government of India for their sanction. Once such projects are sanctioned, fund is released to the districts subject to the budgetary availability. List of projects sanctioned in districts of Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, amount sanctioned and released so far is shown in table in Annex-II referred above. These projects are to be executed as per the extant financial rules of the State Governments and are currently at various stages of implementation. (e) At present there is no proposal to take any additional district as Aspirational District.     Annexure-I List of 112 Aspirational DistrictsSl.
