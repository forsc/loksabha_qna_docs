                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND     ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (d)  Indian Railways had discontinued all regular passenger carrying trains w.e.f  23.03.2020  to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic and train services are being operated in a phased manner. Further, Indian Railways do not run train services on state-wise basis as railway network straddles across state boundaries. At present, over South Western Railway, Season tickets are permitted in all ordinary and Mail/Express trains having unreserved coaches. Season tickets are also permitted in unreserved coaches from Mangaluru junction and Mangaluru Central stations under Southern Railway Jurisdictions. Further, issue of season tickets over different sections of Indian Railways is an ongoing and continuous process based on the availability of unreserved accommodation, Covid protocol of the state Governments etc.*****
