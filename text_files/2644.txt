ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) & (b):	The Ministry has taken steps for drafting four Labour Codes on Wages; Industrial Relations; Social Security; and Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions respectively, by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the relevant provisions of the existing Central Labour Laws. These initiatives will reduce the complexity in compliance due to multiplicity of labour laws and facilitate setting up of enterprises and thus creating the environment for development of business and industry in the country and generating employment opportunities without diluting basic aspects of safety, security and health of workers.Contd..2/-:: 2 ::(c):		No specific study has been done to study the relation between safety in mines and manpower. However, as per the Mines Act, 1952 and Rules and Regulations framed thereunder, Government has made provisions for necessary manpower required to make proper safety arrangements as per the statute in the mines under Coal Mines Regulations, 2017, Metalliferous Mines Regulations, 1961 and Oil Mines Regulations, 2017. Compliance of the above provisions in mines by the mine owners/ management is checked during regular inspections carried out in mines by officers of Directorate General of Mines Safety.(d) & (e):	As on date, 129 posts of Group A in Directorate General of Mines Safety are vacant, which were 110, 122 and 135 in the year 2016, 2017 and 2018 respectively.		Out of the above mentioned vacant posts, in respect of 67 posts, after completing all due formalities proposals have been submitted to UPSC and the same is in process. Steps have also been initiated for filling up of all the remaining posts.******
