ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS (SHRI DEVUSINH CHAUHAN)(a)	Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) gave recommendations dated 1.8.2018 on Auction of Spectrum in 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz, 3300-3400 MHz, 3400-3600 MHz Bands, for a total of 8301.25 MHz of spectrum.(b)	The Reserve Prices (RP) recommended by the TRAI are annexed. TRAI has used various methodologies for valuation of spectrum, which can be broadly classified as variations of (i) Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), (ii) Cost Savings or avoidance, (iii) Multivariate Regression Analysis and (iv) Market Comparisons. The Authority has used average of various alternative valuations methods and benchmarked the average value with recent auction discovered price of the spectrum.(c)	M/s Bharti Airtel had raised the issue of high reserve prices in case of 900 MHz band. (d)	The Hon’ble Supreme Court judgement on Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) has allowed TSPs to make payment in ten yearly instalments commencing from 01.04.2021. The spectrum auctions are conducted in a fair and transparent manner by the Government. The selection of auctioneer is also through a transparent Request for Proposal (RFP) process. Mandatory Standardisation Testing and Quality Certification (STQC) for auction software is also taken prior to the auction.
