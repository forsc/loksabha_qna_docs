STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (b) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *329 TO BE ANSWERED ON 18.03.2021 REGARDING “NATIONAL TALENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME” ASKED BY MS. RAMYA HARIDAS, HON’BLE MEMBER OF LOK SABHA(a) to (b) No Sir, there is no scheme called National Talent Development Programme in operation. However, under Talent Search and Development vertical of Khelo India Scheme, 2969 sporting talents across 24 sports disciplines (including Para sports) are being given financial assistance for nurturing of talents.For identification and selection of athletes under Khelo India Scheme, this Ministry has put in place a two-tier structure consisting of Talent Scouting Committee (TSC) and Talent Identification and Development Committee (TIDC) for selection of players.The players are selected/identified from various streams like Khelo India Games, National Championships conducted by the concerned National Sports Federations, School Games Federation of India, etc. Further, the players shortlisted by the TSC from various competitions of same/varied age groups are called for an assessment camp wherein the TIDC finally selects the talented players, who are then subjected to age verification test. The players who clear the age verification test are finally selected to the Khelo India Scheme with the approval of the High Powered Committee (HPC).In individual events, usually position holders are inducted into the scheme whereas in team events short-listing is done initially and then the selection takes place during the assessment camp.The approved norms for residential training of Khelo India Athletes provide for financial assistance of up to Rs. 6,28,400/- per annum based on actual expenditure incurred, which includes an out of pocket allowance of Rs. 1,20,000/- per annum (Rs. 10,000/- per month) to the selected athletes from the month of his/her joining the Scheme.Funds are allocated by the Union Government Scheme-wise, not State/Union Territory-wise. However, this Ministry has spent Rs. 303.34 crore on development of athletes identified under the Khelo India Scheme, including those from Kerala, since 2016-17 till date.*****
