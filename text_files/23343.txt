ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	to (d):		As per Operational Guidelines of the scheme, banks remit the premium to insurance companies within stipulated cut-off date and submit the details of individual farmer on National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP) within 15 days after the cut-off date for enrollment of farmers.  Thereafter, premium and data submitted by the banks is reconciled and in case of mismatch, corrective action is taken by the Government/concerned insurance companies/Banks.     However, sometimes due to some reasons, banks fail to upload the requisite details on NCIP and subsequent claims, if any, of such farmers get disputed.  In such cases, concerned State Government/insurance company is required to submit the issue to the Government of India for acceptance of such data on NCIP.  After examination and on the merits of each case, Government allows the re-opening of NCIP to facilitate uploading of individual farmers data.   Government has recently decided to re-open the NCIP from 22nd March to 26th March, 2021 for Rabi 2020-21 season for all PMFBY implementing States to facilitate the banks to upload the requisite data of remaining insured farmers.  Such decisions have also been taken by the Government on case to case basis in past seasons for benefit of the farmers.The Government monitors the scheme implementation regularly through weekly video conferences with stakeholders including insurance companies, banks and State Governments.  Government has also issued instructions from time to time to the financial institutions to remit the premium and upload the famers’ data correctly and timely on NCIP.  Stakeholders are also being reminded from time to time to ensure adherence to the seasonality discipline and other requirements indicated in the Operational Guidelines of the scheme so that such incidents can be reduced and admissible claims of farmers can be paid well in time. *******
