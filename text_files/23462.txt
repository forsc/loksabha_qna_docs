                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) to (b) Rural Roads is a State subject and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is a one-time special intervention to provide rural connectivity, by way of a single all-weather road, to the eligible unconnected habitations of designated population size  in the core network for uplifting the socio-economic condition of the entire rural population. As per the programme guidelines, while in plain areas, unconnected rural habitations with population of 500 and above (as per 2001 census) have been targeted for providing all-weather road connectivity, in North-Eastern and Himalayan States, Tribal (Schedule-V) areas and Selected Tribal and Backwards Districts (as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs and Planning Commission),  unconnected habitations with a population of 250 persons and above (as per Census 2001) are eligible for all-weather road connectivity under the scheme. In the critical Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected blocks (as identified by MHA), additional relaxation has been given to connect eligible habitations with population 100 persons and above (as per Census 2001). As is evident from above, North Eastern and Himalayan areas, as also the Tribal (Schedule V) areas and selected Tribal and Backward districts, where sizeable Tribal population resides have already been given relaxation under the programme so as to improve accessibility in these areas and benefit tribal population.Against 1,78,184 eligible habitations of 250+ and 500+ population size identified for coverage under the scheme, 16,086 habitations have been provided connectivity by the States out of their own resources and 4,689 habitations have either been dropped or have not been found feasible due to various reasons. Out of the balance 1,57,409 habitations sanctioned for providing connectivity under the PMGSY, 1,54,676 have already been connected by all-weather roads and the balance 2,733 habitations are targeted for connectivity by March, 2022.  Under 100-249 population category habitations in LWE areas, out of 6,286 habitations sanctioned for providing all-weather road connectivity, 5,565 habitations have been provided all-weather road connectivity and balance 721 habitations are targeted for all-weather road connectivity by March, 2022.At present four interventions/verticals viz. PMGSY-I for providing connectivity to eligible habitations; PMGSY-II- to upgrade 50,000 Kms  of the existing rural road network to improve its overall efficiency as a provider of transportation services for people, goods and services;  Road Connectivity Project for Left Wing Extremism Affected Areas (RCPLWEA) for construction/upgradation of strategically important roads; and   PMGSY-III for consolidation of 1,25,000 Km Through Routes and Major Rural Links connecting habitations,  inter-alia, to Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs), Higher Secondary Schools and Hospitals, are under progress.  A total of 6,54,784 km road length has been constructed under the various interventions/verticals of the scheme across the country and tribal areas of the country have also benefitted with the accessibility provided under PMGSY.*****
