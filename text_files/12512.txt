                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (c): A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN THE REPLY TO PART (a) TO (c) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *137 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 11.02.2020(a) to (c): The erstwhile Planning Commission (now NITI Aayog) defined and estimated poverty line using monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) data from the Large Sample Survey on Household Consumer Expenditure carried out by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). The latest available poverty line was estimated in 2011-12.  Thereafter, no BPL estimation has been done in a centralized manner.While the estimation of poverty using poverty line had been done by the erstwhile Planning Commission, the Ministry of Rural Development had been conducting Below Poverty Line (BPL) Census to identify the poor households in the rural areas, who could be the potential beneficiaries under various programmes of the Government of India. The first BPL Census was conducted in 1992 for the Eighth Five Year Plan. Subsequently, BPL census was conducted in 1997, for the Ninth Five Year Plan and in 2002 for the Tenth Five Year Plan period. In 2011, in place of BPL Survey, a Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011 (SECC 2011) was conducted in association with the States/UTs under technical and financial support from the Government of India. After 2002 BPL Survey, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of poverty, SECC-2011 was conducted by the Government. SECC-2011 provides data of households on various aspects of their socio-economic status viz., housing, land-holding/landlessness, educational status, status of women, the differently abled, occupation, possession of assets, scheduled caste/ scheduled tribe (SC/ST) households, income, etc. The purpose of SECC, 2011 was to identify rural poor households, not on the basis of any pre-defined poverty line, but on the basis of three criteria based categories: (i) automatically excluded households, (ii) automatically included households and (iii) deprived households. The State/Union Territory–wise numbers of rural households in the said three categories are given at Annexure-1. The district-wise information of Bihar on numbers of rural households in the said three categories is given at Annexure- 2. Beneficiary selection under various programmes of Government of India has been made using the “automatically included households” and “deprived households” data of SECC-2011 as the basis.
