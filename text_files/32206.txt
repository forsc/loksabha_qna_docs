ANSWER




                                                        (a)       The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the disruption in labour market. The skill ecosystem was also impacted due to COVID-19 induced lockdown. In order to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and to restore the skilling activities, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) has taken various initiatives under the skill eco system. Some of them are given below: (i)         Introduction of On-line skill training: On-line skill training has been introduced in both short term and long-term skilling ecosystem. On-line short-term training is being imparted through eSkill India portal and long-term training through Bharat Skill portal. (ii)       ''Customized Crash Course Programme for COVID Warriors'': Ministry is implementing special programme, ''Customized Crash Course Programme for COVID Warriors'' with the aim to train about one lakh COVID warriors in six healthcare-related job roles.The objectives of Customized crash course are to meet the upsurge in demand of skilled healthcare workers, reduce the burden of healthcare professionals and provide timely healthcare services in the country.  Under this special programme, 58,623 candidates have been trained / oriented as on 03.12.2021.(iii)       Special programme for training of reverse migrants under PMKVY: MSDE has formulated a special programme under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) for the training of Shramiks (migrant labourers). This component has covered 116 districts of 6 States, namely; Assam, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh selected under Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan (GKRA) of Ministry of Rural Development.  Under this special programme, the identification of reverse Shramiks (migrant labourers) was conducted and skill development training was imparted based on their demand/aspirations for job roles as received from District Administration during the pandemic lock down. As on 21.11.2021, 1.24 lakh migrants have been trained / oriented under this programme.(iv)       COVID Allowance to training centres:  Common Norms Committee (CNC) for Skill Development Schemes has decided that 1.5% of the average training cost per trainee for 3 months, or 1.5% of the hourly base cost rate (as applicable as per category of trade undergoing the training) may be allowed as COVID Allowance.(b)       Above reply (a) may be referred to.(c)        Ministry has launched the third phase of PMKVY (PMKVY 3.0) on 15th January 2021, which was implemented through the pandemic period. The scheme is demand-driven and training is being imparted based on the demand received from District Skill Committees (DSCs). This facilitates employment opportunities within the district of domicile, thereby decreasing the need for employment related migration. The facilities of On-line skill training has been provided through eSkill India Portal and Bharat Skill Portal. Also, in long-term skilling, network of 10,952 rural Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) helps youth in attaining required skill for becoming employable. (d)       Above reply (c) may be referred to.
