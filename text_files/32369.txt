ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) to (c): Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) is a demand driven wage employment programme which provide for the enhancement of livelihood security of the households in rural areas of the country by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. It provides livelihood security i.e., fall back option for livelihood for the rural households when no better employment opportunity is available.    The details of households demanded employment, households offered employment and households who have turned up at the worksites and thus availed employment under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS in the financial years 2020-21 and 2021-22 (as on 15.12.2021) is given below: Financial Year	                               2020-21	        2021-22                                                              (as on 15.12.2021)Households demanded employment (in crore)	8.55	         7.27Households offered employment (in crore)	8.54	         7.24Households availed employment (in crore)	7.55	         6.35While the work demanded closely matches the work offered, the difference of work availed with the former is on account of lack of utilisation of such offering by workers. This could be on account of better employment opportunities elsewhere, illness or any other relevant factor.States have to pay unemployment allowances as per the provisions of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. No unemployment allowance has been paid as of now during the current financial year.*******
