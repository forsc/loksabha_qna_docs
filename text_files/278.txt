Commercial borrowings continued to be the largest component of external debt at 37.4 per cent, followed by NRI deposits (24.1 per cent) and short term trade credit (19.9 per cent). Sovereign Debt accounts for around 20 per cent of total external debt. (b)	According to World Bank’s annual publication titled ‘International Debt Statistics 2019’, India’s position among developing debtor countries in 2017 was third, in respect of absolute external debt stock, after China and Brazil. However, in respect of the ratio of External debt stock to Gross National Income (GNI), India’s position in 2017 was fourth lowest at 19.8%.(c)	On the basis of the mid-year population estimates of Central Statistics Office, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, the per capita external debt of the country, as on 31st December, 2018, is estimated at Rs. 27689.(d)	The table showing the total amount paid to the foreign lenders, as principal amount and interest during each of the last three years, country/ institution-wise, is placed at Annexure I.(e)	The prudent external debt management policy of the Government of India has helped in containing rise in external debt and maintaining a comfortable external debt position. The policy continues to focus on monitoring long and short-term debt, raising sovereign loans on concessional terms with longer maturities, regulating external commercial borrowings and rationalizing interest rates on Non-Resident Indian deposits.
