The Ministry of Tourism has recognized the immense potential of Rural Tourism and has been actively working on promotion and development of this niche area of tourism.  The Ministry of Tourism has accordingly formulated a Draft National Strategy and Roadmap for Development of Rural Tourism in India - An initiative towards Atmanirbhar Bharat.  Driven by the spirit of “Vocal for Local”, rural tourism can contribute significantly to the mission of Aatmanirbhar Bharat. In order to develop rural tourism in the country, the strategy focuses on the following key pillars:(i).	    Model policies and best practices for rural tourism (ii).	Digital technologies and platforms for rural tourism (iii).	Developing clusters for rural tourism (iv).	Marketing support for rural tourism (v).	Capacity building of stakeholders (vi).	Governance and Institutional FrameworkIn order to make the document more comprehensive, Ministry of Tourism has invited  feedback/ comments/ suggestions on the draft National Strategy and Roadmap from identified Central Ministries, all the State Governments/UT Administrations and industry stakeholders.  Further, recognizing the potential of rural tourism in the country including Karnataka, the Ministry of Tourism has identified Rural Circuit as one of the thematic circuits under Swadesh Darhsan Scheme for development aimed at leveraging tourism as a force multiplier for revitalizing the rural economy and for giving both domestic and international tourist glimpse of the rural aspects of the country. The projects for development of tourism related infrastructure, including rural tourism, projects/ proposals are identified for development under the circuit in consultation with the State Governments/UT Administrations and are sanctioned subject to availability of funds, submission of suitable detailed project reports, adherence to scheme guidelines and utilization of funds released earlier. Based on the above criteria, the Ministry has sanctioned following projects for development of Rural Circuit under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme:(Rs. in Crore)<pre>S.

To ensure an optimum level of development, twenty one components have been suggested as desirable for the Cluster development. Tourism Promotion is one of twenty one components.MoRD have further informed that 70 percent of total investment is mobilised under the convergence with various Central as well as State schemes. The SPMRM provides an additional funding support of up to 30% of project cost (maximum upto Rs. 15 crore for tribal cluster and Rs. 30 crore for non-tribal cluster) as Critical Gap Fund (CGF) to enable development of Rurban Clusters. The funding under the mission is shared in ratio of 60:40 for the States and 90:10 for 8 North Eastern State, 3 Himalayan States. For Union Territories, 100 per cent funding is provided by the Government of India.It has also been informed by MoRD that the States/UTs have proposed the activities related to tourism promotion under Integrated Cluster Action Plan.
