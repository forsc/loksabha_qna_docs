The references of overpricing/overcharging in violation of the notified ceiling prices in case of scheduled formulations and more than 10% increase in the MRP of Non-Scheduled formulations received by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) under the Department of Pharmaceuticals are examined and proceedings to recover the amount overcharged with applicable interest are initiated against the companies concerned as per provisions of the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 (DPCO, 2013).(b):	NPPA has initiated 2116 number of overcharging cases. At present, 881 numbers of overcharging cases involving a total amount of Rs. 8,184.19 crore under DPCO, 1979, 1987, 1995 and 2013 are pending. Of this, an amount of Rs. 6,550.37 crore is under litigation in various Courts in respect of 324 cases. Action for recovery of the overcharged amount is a continuous on-going process, undertaken as per the provisions of DPCOs. An amount of Rs. 978.82 crore has been recovered till December, 2020. In cases where the concerned company does not deposit the amount of demand, the matter is referred to the respective Collector/ District Magistrate for recovery of the overcharged amount as arrears of land revenue under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. The cases referred to Collectors/ District Magistrates are also followed up on regular basis. In cases where the demands raised for overcharging have been challenged in courts, NPPA actively pursue them in respective courts.(c):	NPPA, with the help of Price Monitoring & Resource Units (PMRUs) and State Drug Controllers (SDCs) regularly monitors and enforces the price fixed as per the provisions of the DPCO, 2013. Samples are also purchased from the open market throughout the country on random basis through SDCs to ensure the price compliance. Further, NPPA takes prompt action on the basis of complaints received regarding overcharging through various channels. It also monitors the prices of non scheduled formulations for increase, if any, in the prices beyond 10% during preceding twelve months.(d):	The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Policy (NPPP), 2012 provides the policy framework for price regulation of medicine.
