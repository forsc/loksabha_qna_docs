ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                              (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)	Yes, Sir. The Report on Indian Urban Infrastructure and Services (2011) of the High Powered Expert Committee (HPEC) set up by this Ministry, has projected that India’s urban population would be close to 600 million by 2031 and an estimated amount of Rs 39.20 lakh crore would be required for investment in urban infrastructure, at 2009-10 prices, during the 20-year period from 2012-13 to 2031-32.(b)& (c):	Urban development being a State subject, creation of urban infrastructure is the responsibility of the State Governments. However, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs incentivizes States to take up reform measures to strengthen their own resource base as well as encourages them to adopt innovative mechanisms to mobilize funds for development of infrastructure, through increased use of public private partnerships, rationalization of user charges, issue of municipal bonds, value capture financing etc.	Further, the Ministry is implementing various missions / schemes such as the Smart City Mission, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U) and Urban Transport to augment the investment in urban infrastructure.                                              *****
