The details of above river linking projects viz., rivers, States concerned are given at Annexure.The implementation of NPP would give benefits of 25 million ha of irrigation from surface waters, 10 million ha by increased use of ground waters, raising the ultimate irrigation potential from 140 million ha to 175 million ha and generation of 34 million KW of power, apart from the incidental benefits of flood control, drought mitigation, navigation, water supply, fisheries, salinity and pollution control etc.(d)  Under the NPP, four priority links have also been identified for preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) under the Peninsular Rivers Component viz; Ken-Betwa link project (KBLP), Damanganga-Pinjal link project, Par-Tapi-Narmada link project and Godavari-Cauvery link project.Contd…P/2//2//Various statutory clearances except Stage-II forest clearance & clearance from Central Empowered Committee (CEC) of Hon’ble Supreme Court have been accorded for components under KBLP Phase-I. The clearances for the projects proposed under KBLP Phase-II are in advanced stages. The comprehensive DPR of the KBLP has been completed and circulated to Governments of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Madhya Pradesh (MP). Draft Memorandum of Agreement for implementation of KBLP has been sent to Governments of MP and UP for concurrence. The project is envisaged to benefit the drought prone areas of Bundelkhand region and adjoining areas in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh States.The techno-economic clearance to the Damanganga-Pinjal link project has also been accorded subject to statutory clearances. The DPR of Par-Tapi-Narmada is in advanced stage of appraisal by Central Water Commission.
