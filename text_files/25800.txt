                                                        (a):  The Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000 together with the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860 provide legal framework for dealing with online obscene and vulgar material. Also, the IT Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012  provide for a framework for prosecution of those involved in publishing or transmitting child sexual abuse material (CSAM).Further, the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 notified on 25th February mandates that  social media platforms and all other intermediaries shall inform their  users not to host, display, upload, modify, publish, transmit, store, update or share any information that is obscene, pornographic, paedophilic, invasive of another’s privacy including bodily privacy, or otherwise unlawful in any manner. Further, if any unlawful information is hosted, stored or published, the intermediary shall remove or disable access to that information, as early as possible, on receipt of a court order or on being notified by an Appropriate Government or its agency. The Rules also provide for the victims of such pornographic material to directly raise their grievance/complaint to the intermediary platforms thereby creating accountability of the intermediary.(b)	and (c):   “Police” and “Public Order” are State subjects. Complaints reported on such matter are dealt by the respective Law Enforcement Authorities of States/Union Territories. As per the data reported and maintained by National Crime Records Bureau, Ministry of Home Affairs (NCRB, MHA), a total of 88, 232 and 305 cases of cyber crime against children were registered in the year 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
