Under the Act, benefits of providing foodgrains at highly subsidized rates are provided to only two categories of households viz the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) Households that are the poorest of the poor 2.5 crore households and Priority Households (PHH). Therefore, after the implementation of the Act, there is no further distinction of categories as Above Poverty Line (APL) and Below Poverty Line (BPL) as was existent in the erstwhile Targeted Public Distribution System.Food Subsidy is given by the Department of Food and Public Distribution to Food Corporation of India [FCI] for Centralized Procurement [CP] and to States directly in cases of Decentralised Procurement [DCP] on the basis of quantity of foodgrains procured and distributed under NFSA and other welfare schemes. A statement showing subsidy released to FCI and DCP States during Financial Years 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 [upto 2nd February, 2021] is annexed. (b) to (d): 	The foodgrains are issued to beneficiaries under NFSA at a highly subsidized price of  Re 1/-, Rs.2/- and Rs. 3/- for one Kilogram each of Coarsegrains,  Wheat and Rice respectively uniformly both to AAY and PHH categories and at present, there is no proposal to further increase subsidy on foodgrains. AAY Households are entitled to 35 kg of foodgrains per family per month and Priority Households are entitled to 5 kg per person per month.***** AnnexureANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF THE STARRED QUESTION NO. *109 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 09.02.2021 IN THE LOK SABHA.Statement showing subsidy released to FCI and DCP States during Financial Years 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 [Up to 2nd February, 2021].
