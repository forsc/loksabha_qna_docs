The role of Government of India is limited to being catalytic, and partial financial assistance under the existing schemes, as per the guidelines.A scheme titled Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies is being implemented by this Ministry, under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana - Har Khet Ko Pani (PMKSY-HKKP). From Xllth Plan onwards, 2,219 water bodies, with estimated cost for repair, renovation & restoration of Rs.1,910 crore, have been included from various States for central assistance under this scheme. Central assistance of Rs.469.68 crore has been released for these water bodies, and out of the above, 1,465 water bodies have been reported to be repaired, renovated and restored.Further, National Water Policy (2012), inter-alia, recommends for conservation of rivers, river corridors, water bodies and infrastructure should be undertaken in a scientifically planned manner through community participation.Further, from time to time this Ministry has been sensitising the State Governments regarding the importance of water bodies for socio economic development and sustainable water security to the local population. Under the Jal Shakti Abhiyan, being conducted with the state governments and public participation, mapping, cleaning and rejuvenation of water bodies is a special area of emphasis. Need for taking necessary steps for keeping all the water bodies encroachment-free, such as inclusion of water bodies in land records and making them integral part of town planning process, strict action for the encroachers, etc. is also being emphasised to the State Governments by this Ministry, from time to time.*****
