ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a):	 The value of total export from Union Territory of Ladakh was US$ 894 during 2020-21. The product-wise break up of value of export from Ladakh is as follows:                                                                                                     (Value in US$)S No:	Item/Product	Export1	Other fabrics	6982	Shawls, Scarves, etc of Silk, others	1553	Others	41Total Export	894     Source: DGCI&S, Kolkata(b):	Some of the measures taken for the promotion of quality and productivity of the agriculture and horticulture products are as follows:(i.)	Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), a Centrally Sponsored Scheme is implemented since 2014-15, for holistic growth of the horticulture sector covering fruits, vegetables, root and tuber crops, mushrooms, spices, flowers, aromatic plants, coconut, cashew and cocoa.  All States and UTs are covered under MIDH. The scheme also envisages creation of infrastructure for post harvest management (including modernization of Cold Storages and Cold Chain) and marketing for better price realization of produce. (ii.)	Government has been promoting organic farming in the country through a dedicated Scheme, namely Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), since 2015-16 to cater to the needs of domestic and export markets respectively. The Scheme stress on end to end support to organic farmers, i.e., from production to certification to marketing. Post harvest management support including processing, packing, marketing is an integral part of the scheme to encourage organic farmers.(iii.)

The Scheme is demand driven and consists of a number of sub-schemes with the main objective of minimizing post-harvest losses and to increase the extent of processing for enhancing value addition in the sector, creation of off farm employment and higher realization for farmers. (iv.)	As part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Initiative, the Government is also implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme-Prime Minister’s Formalisation of Micro Food Processing Enterprises Scheme (PM FME), to upgrade and support 2 lakh micro-food processing units through credit linked subsidy based on the One District One Product (ODOP) approach. (v.)
