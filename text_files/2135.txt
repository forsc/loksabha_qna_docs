ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTERY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	117 districts were selected as aspirational districts. This includes 35 districts selected by the Ministry of Home Affairs on the basis of these districts been affected by Left Wing Extremism (L.W.E). For the selection of the rest of the 82 districts, they have been identified on the basis of a composite index. List of these data bases and their weightage in the composite index is attached in annexure I. After selection the districts, all the States were requested that in case the State wants any replacement in the district on the basis of objective criteria, Government of India would be open to such suggestions. Accordingly, six states, namely, Sikkim, Odisha, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Gujarat suggested changes in the list which was accepted.  Government of West Bengal where 5 districts were selected is yet to join this programme and therefore currently the Aspirational Districts Programme is being implemented in 112 districts.  In Maharashtra, under this programme 4 districts have been selected – Washim, Osmanabad, Nandurbar and Gadchiroli.   List of State wise 112 Aspirational Districts is attached as Annexure-II.  (b)	For the selection of Aspirational Districts no additional survey was conducted but data bases as referred to in annexure-I above were used. This included data obtained from Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC) 2011 and National Family Health Survey (NFHS) IV. (c)	For monitoring of development of Aspirational districts, 49 specific performance indicators in the sectors of health, nutrition, school education, agriculture and water resource, financial inclusion and skill development and basic infrastructure were identified. Niti Aayog has created a web portal – championsofchange.gov.in on which districts are filing data pertaining to these indicators on real time basis. These data values can be accessed at district, State and central level, facilitating monitoring at these levels. Based on the incremental progress, districts are ranked which has given rise to a healthy competition among districts. (d)	Aspirational District Programme was launched on Jan 5, 2018. The improvement in 49 indicators, reflected on the web portal mentioned above allows the district teams to assess the impact of their programme. In addition, a team of third party evaluator is also undertaking household based sample survey and gives feedback to district administration. (e)	As stated in (d) above. (f)	The web-portal is functional. In addition, third party evaluators have already conducted two rounds of surveys so far.
