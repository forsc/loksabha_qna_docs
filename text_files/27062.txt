The Government is implementing the e-Courts Mission Mode Project for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) enablement of District and Subordinate Courts across the country in association with the eCommittee of the Supreme Court of India.

With the computerization of 18,735 District and Subordinate Courts and ICT enablement under the eCourts Project Phase-II, several services have been provided to litigants, lawyers and Judiciary which facilitate expeditious delivery of judicial services. eCourts services such as details of case registration, cause list, case status, daily orders & final judgments are available to litigants and advocates through eCourts web portal, Judicial Service Centres eCourts Mobile App, email service, SMS push & SMS pull services and touch screen based Information Kiosks. National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) for District & Subordinate Courts, created as an online platform under the Project, provides information relating to judicial proceedings/decisions of computerized District and Subordinate courts of the country. Currently, all stakeholders including Judicial Officers can access case status information in respect of over 18.77 crore pending and disposed cases and more than 14.61 crore orders / judgments pertaining to these computerized courts on the NJDG.
