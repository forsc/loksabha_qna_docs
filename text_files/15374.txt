ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	to (e)    A Dispute Settlement Panel of WTO in its report issued to members on 31 October 2019 has ruled India’s export related schemes (including SEZ scheme) to be export contingent and in the nature of prohibited subsidies under the Agreement  on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and thus inconsistent with WTO norms. The Panel has given time-frame of 180 days for withdrawal of SEZ scheme. However, India has appealed the Panel Report on 19 November, 2019 and due to non-functioning of Appellate Body, the appeal has been kept in suspension. Till the appeal is disposed of, India is under no obligation to implement the recommendations of Panel. (f and g) Since 2015, ten disputes have been filed against India and the WTO dispute settlement panel has ruled in two cases only and both have gone against India.  As a Complainant, India has filed three cases since 2015 out of which only one dispute has been decided by the panel and ruling is in India’s favour. *************
