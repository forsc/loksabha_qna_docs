ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d):	Reform in labour laws is a continuous process, therefore, Central Government strives on regular basis to update the legislative system as per the need of the hour. The Ministry has taken steps to simplify, amalgamate and rationalize the relevant provisions of the existing Central Labour Laws into 4 Labour Codes. Out of the 4 Labour Codes, the Code on Wages, 2019, was notified on 8th August, 2019 in the Gazette of India.  The rest 3 Codes i.e.  the Occupational Safety Health & Working Conditions Code, 2019, the Industrial Relations Code, 2019 and the Code on Social Security, 2019 had been introduced Contd..2/-:: 2 ::in the Lok Sabha in 2019 and referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour for examination. After receipt of the reports of the Standing Committee, the requisite steps have been taken for reintroduction of all these Codes. Simplification of provisions related to licence, registration and filing return and other such regulations will reduce the cost of compliance of establishments substantially which would incentivize the economic activity in the country, thus catalyzing the creation of employment opportunities in the country. The 4 Labour Codes also envisage to further strengthen the protection available to workers, including migrant workers, in terms of statutory minimum wage, industrial dispute mechanism, social security protection and healthcare of workers.  Also, the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code provides for maintenance of data base or record for inter-state migrant workers, besides extending portability of benefits and other protections.******
