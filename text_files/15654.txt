                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE; MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MINISTER OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????, ??????? ?? ???????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ??????? ????????. ???? ?????(a) & (b):  Yes Sir. Ministry of Science & Technology (S&T) has taken an initiative to launch a National Program on “Scientific Utilization through Research Augmentation-Prime Products  from Indigenous Cows: SUTRA-PIC India Program”  as a collaborative program of  Department of Science & Technology (DST), Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and Ministry of AYUSH. This coordinated program aims to work towards convergence of expertise, resources and funds to meet the common objective – Scientific research on prime products of indigenous cows and its application in health, food, agriculture, nutrition etc. It provides a platform to take research towards its logical conclusion with scientific validation and certification of utility products. In this endeavor, project proposals have been invited through open call by Department of Science & Technology (DST) from scientists/ academicians of Research Institutions, Academies, S&T capable voluntary organizations (NGO’s) active in India with proven record of accomplishment in executing S&T based R&D projects covering following thematic areas:1.
