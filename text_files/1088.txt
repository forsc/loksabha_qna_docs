                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE  MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                         (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)&(b) Yes, Sir. As per Census 2011, there are 125 towns in the State of Andhra Pradesh. The town-wise data of all slums in Andhra Pradesh is at Annexure-I.(c) 	As per Census 2011, total number of households living in slums and population are 24,31,474 and 1,01,86,934, respectively.	(d)	Land and Colonisation are State subjects and therefore, it is primarily the responsibility of State/Union Territory (UT) Governments to frame policies and implement schemes for improving the living conditions of slum dwellers. However, Government of India through its programmatic intervention viz. Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) {PMAY (U)}, has been assisting the States/ UTs in providing housing and basic civic amenities to the urban poor including slum dwellers of the urban areas in the country. Through ‘In-Situ’ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) component of PMAY (U), Government of India supplements the efforts of the State Governments to provide basic amenities and all-weather pucca houses to eligible slum dwellers. Details of houses sanctioned including those for slum households along with central assistance sanctioned and released to Andhra Pradesh under PMAY (U) are at Annexure-II.Under Swachh Bharat Mission – Urban (SBM-U), the sanitation facilities are provided to all citizens, including the slum dwellers, through construction of Individual Household Latrines (IHHL) and Community Toilets in case of households not having the space.Under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), the Ministry is providing basic amenities such as water supply, sewerage, septage management, storm water drainage, non-motorised urban transport and green spaces/park in 33 selected cities of Andhra Pradesh wherein projects amounting to Rs2890.17 crore have been approved with a Central Assistance of Rs.1056.62 crore.                                   ******
