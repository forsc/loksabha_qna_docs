                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a):      The Kisan Samman Fund have been provided to 53,48,465 farmers families in Bihar till 06/02/2020 after the receipt of verified data from State Government and their validation through Aadhar/PFMS.(b):     Till, 06/02/2020, payments have been made to 1,57,942 beneficiaries in Supaul district of Bihar.(c) & (d):	The data of beneficiaries   uploaded by the State / UT Governments undergoes a multi-level verification and validation by various concerned agencies, including the banks, which includes rejection of data for errors at various levels and re-uploading of error-free data by the State / UT Governments. Thereafter only the amount is successfully transferred into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. This entire process is replicated for transfer of every installment.              To further facilitate registration of farmers, an exclusive ‘Farmers Corner’ has been provided in the PM-KISAN Web-portal through which the farmers can do their self-registration. Farmers can also edit their names in PM-Kisan database as per their Aadhaar Card through the Farmers Corner. Farmers can also know the status of their payment through the Farmers Corner. The village-wise names of the beneficiaries are also available in the Farmers Corner. Common Service Centres (CSCs) have also been authorized to assist the farmers in performing the above tasks. On the advice of the Union Government, the States have organized Publicity/Awareness Camps to ensure expeditious Aadhaar authentication of the data of the beneficiaries along with new registrations and correction of already registered data.*******
