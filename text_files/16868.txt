                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) :		Government of India had launched Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana – “Saubhagya” in October, 2017 with the aim to achieve universal household electrification by providing last mile connectivity and electricity connections to all households in rural and all poor households in urban areas across the country. All the States had declared on Saubhagya portal that all the willing un-electrified households had been electrified as on 31.03.2019, except 18,734 households in LWE affected areas of Chhattisgarh. Since the launch of Saubhagya scheme, 2.63 crore households were electrified across the country up to 31.03.2019. The State-wise details are given at Annexure-I. Subsequently, seven States reported 19.09 lakh un-electrified households which were un-willing earlier, but later willing to get electricity connection, identified before 31.03.2019. States have been asked to electrify these households under Saubhagya.  Out of these, 15.65 lakh households have been electrified up to 31.08.2020.  The State-wise details are given at Annexure-II. (b) to (d) :	All the States/UTs have signed a document on ‘24x7 Power of All’ with the Government of India for providing 24x7 power supply to all households, industrial and commercial consumers from April, 2019 and adequate supply of power to agricultural consumers as per State policy.  Government of India supplements the efforts of the States to provide access to electricity through its various schemes including Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana - Saubhagya and Ujjwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY).
