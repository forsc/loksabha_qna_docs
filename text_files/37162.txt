(??. ???????? ????)(a)	Yes sir, International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy & New Materials (ARCI), Hyderabad and Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad and Resil Chemicals Pvt Ltd, Bangalore has developed copper based nanoparticle coatings on fabric which can be used as self-disinfection masks which give 99.9% protection from the infection.  (b)	Copper-based nanoparticles have been prepared by a Flame Spray Pyrolysis (FSP) processing facility established at ARCI and stable nanoparticle suspension is prepared by optimizing the solid loading and pH.  A uniform layer of this nano-coating on the cotton fabric with good adhesion was achieved using a suitable binder.  The efficacy of the coated fabric against SARS CoV2 was evaluated by CCMB and also tested for other virus and bacteria. (c)	Few thousands of masks have been produced by the industry partner, Resil Chemicals Ltd for pilot scale demonstration and they are being tested for certification. (d)	The mask cannot be compared with other masks as the technology of other masks available in the market is not well known. *****
