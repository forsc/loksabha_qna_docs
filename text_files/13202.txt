ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES & PUBLIC ENTERPRISES(SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a)  The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), Ministry of Finance is the nodal Department for disinvestment and privatization of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs). As per the information furnished by DIPAM, Government has given ‘in-principle’ approval for strategic disinvestment of 34 CPSEs, including subsidiaries, Units and Joint Ventures with sale of majority stake of Government of India and transfer of management control. Out of which, 6 CPSEs are having Registered Office/Corporate Office in the State of Uttar Pradesh. Details of which are given in Annex. (b) & (c): DIPAM has further informed that NITI Aayog has been mandated to identify CPSEs for strategic disinvestment.  For this purpose, NITI Aayog has classified CPSEs into ‘priority’ and ‘non-priority’ sectors, based on criteria of (i) National Security; (ii) Sovereign function at arm’s length; and (iii) Market Imperfections and Public Purpose. CPSEs in ‘non-priority’ sectors are recommended for strategic disinvestment. DIPAM has also stated that it is expected that on privatization, the strategic buyer will bring in funds/technology/new management etc. for the optimum development of business potential of the CPSE. The growth of CPSE, post disinvestment, would be able to generate higher economic activity in the region which will create new job opportunities and growth of the ancillary industries and contribute to the economic growth of the country.****
