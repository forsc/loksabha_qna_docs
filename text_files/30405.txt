                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a)  to (c)  Cleaning and rejuvenation of rivers is a continuous process. It is the responsibility of the States/Union Territories (UTs), Local Bodies and Industrial Units to ensure required treatment of sewage and industrial effluents to the prescribed norms before discharging into rivers and other water bodies, coastal waters or land to prevent and control of pollution therein. As per the report of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of March, 2021, 72368 million litres per day (mld) is generated from urban areas in the country, against which a treatment capacity of 31841 mld is available. State/UT wise details are at Annexure-I.For conservation and rejuvenation of rivers, this Ministry has been supplementing efforts of the States/UTs by providing financial and technical assistance for abatement of pollution in identified stretches of rivers in the country through the Central Sector Scheme of Namami Gange for Ganga and its tributaries, and the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) for other rivers. Setting up of STPs is one of the important components of these programmes. 		NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches on 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States/UT in the country with the project sanctioned cost of Rs.5961.75 crore, and inter-alia, a sewage treatment capacity of 2677 million litres per day (mld) has been created. Under the Namami Gange programme, a total of 353 projects, including 157 projects for sewage treatment of 4952 mld capacity and sewer network of 5212 kms, have been sanctioned at a cost of Rs.30458 crore. State/UT-wise details of funds allocated and utilised for cleaning of rivers during the last five years and the current year under NRCP and Namami Gange programmes are given at Annexure-II. Contd…P/2//2//		In addition, sewerage infrastructure is created under programs like Atal Mission for Rejuvenation & Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and Smart Cities Mission of Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs.		Rejuvenation of river Yamuna river is included under the Central Sector Scheme of Namami Gange. There are 34 operational STPs with a capacity of 2624 mld in Delhi. 10 sewage treatment infrastructure projects at an estimated cost of Rs. 2296 crore have been sanctioned under Namami Gange programme for creation/upgradation of the 1362 mld of sewage treatment capacity in Delhi.As per the Provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution), Act 1974, industrial units are required to install effluent treatment plants (ETPs) and treat their effluents to comply with stipulated environmental standards before discharging into river and water bodies. Accordingly, CPCB, State Pollution Control Boards/Pollution Control Committees monitor industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under provisions of these Acts.Besides, in compliance of the orders of National Green Tribunal (NGT) in Original Application No.673/2018 regarding rejuvenation of polluted river stretches in the country, States/UTs are required to implement approved action plans for restoration of the polluted stretches in their jurisdiction as identified by CPCB and published in their report of 2018, within the stipulated timelines. As per the orders of NGT, regular review on implementation of action plans is undertaken in the States/UTs and also at Central level. ***** ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION DIARY NO. 1994 TO BE ANSWERED ON 09.12.2021 ON ‘SEWAGE WATER TREATMENT’State-wise Sewage Generation and Treatment Capacity of Urban Centers-IndiaStates / UTs	Sewage Generation (in mld)	Installed Capacity (in mld)	Number of STPs InstalledAndaman & Nicobar Islands	23	0	-Andhra Pradesh	2882	833	66ArunachalPradesh	62	0	-Assam	809	0	-Bihar	2276	10	1Chandigarh	188	293	7Chhattisgarh	1203	73	3Dadra   & Nagar Haveli	67	24	3Goa	176	66	11Gujarat	5013	3378	70Haryana	1816	1880	153Himachal Pradesh	116	136	78Jammu & Kashmir	665	218	24Jharkhand	1510	22	2Karnataka	4458	2712	140Kerala	4256	120	7Lakshadweep	13	0	-Madhya Pradesh	3646	1839	126Maharashtra	9107	6890	154Manipur	168	0	-Meghalaya	112	0	-Mizoram	103	10	1Nagaland	135	0	-NCT of Delhi	3330	2896	38Orissa	1282	378	14Pondicherry	161	56	3Punjab	1889	1781	119Rajasthan	3185	1086	114Sikkim	52	20	6Tamil Nadu	6421	1492	63Telangana	2660	901	37Tripura	237	8	1Uttar Pradesh	8263	3374	107Uttarakhand	627	448	71West Bengal	5457	897	50Total	72368	31841	1469  ANNEXURE-IIANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION DIARY NO. 1994 TO BE ANSWERED ON 09.12.2021 ON ‘SEWAGE WATER TREATMENT’(a) Details of State-wise and year-wise funds released during last five years& current year under NRCP (excluding river Ganga &its tributaries).
