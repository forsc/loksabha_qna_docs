UPSC and the respective cadre controlling authorities of these services are seized of the matter. In fact, UPSC had constituted a High Level Standing Committee to examine the modalities of implementing the Parliamentary Resolution on Official Languages dated 18.01.1968. The Committee had, in its Report submitted in the year 2012, which was accepted by UPSC, underlined certain constraints such as practical/operational difficulties in getting the precise Hindi translation of question papers; especially in technical papers (Engineering, Medical Science etc.); growth of Hindi and other languages in the higher educational system, which are existing as of today.*****
