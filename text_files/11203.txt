ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (c): Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) are set up with the object ofproviding good quality modern education to the talented children predominantly fromrural areas. At least 75% seats of the districts are filled by the candidates selectedfrom rural areas. Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one JNV ineach district of the country. All the districts of the country (as on 31.5.2014) includingthe district of Jalore (except the districts of Tamil Nadu) have been covered underthe Navodaya Vidyalaya scheme.Opening of new JNVs is a continuous process which depends on thewillingness of the concerned State Government to make available requisite suitableland free of cost for construction of the permanent building and making availablerequired temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till the permanentbuilding is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV dependson availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority.(d) No such proposal is under consideration at present.(e) Does not arise.*****
