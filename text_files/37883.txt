Besides, National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), Sector Skill Councils (SSCs), State Governments, State Skill Development Missionsand District Skill Committees also undertake awareness campaigns through Public Information Bureau (PIB), and Print and Electronic media including social media under the aegis of Skill India Mission. All these initiatives aim to make skills aspirational for youth.(b)	Central Government in partnership with State Governments promotes skilling and entrepreneurship to develop the required training and skilling programs for youth. At States level, States are encouraged to create State Skill Development Missions (SSDM) along the lines of National Skill Development Mission and duly supported by DistrictsCommittees at the functional tier.All implementation agencies are empowered to leverage wide network of media including the PIB, All India Radio, Doordarshanetc as well as other media. (c)	The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisages curriculum integration of essential subjects and skills in all schools and higher education institutions in a phased manner to provide necessary vocational skills for variety of occupations along with awareness about the benefits of vocational education.The Department of School Education and Literacy (Ministry of Education) is implementing the scheme of Vocationalisation of School Education under the umbrella of ‘Samagra Shiksha - an integrated scheme for school education’, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme. The scheme aims at integrating Vocational Education with general academic education in all Secondary/Senior Secondary schools; enhancing the Employability and Entrepreneurial abilities of the students, providing exposure to work environment; and generating awareness amongst students about various career options so as to enable them to make a choice in accordance with their aptitude, competence and aspirations. The scheme covers Government and Government aided schools. Under the Scheme, 14,435 schools have been approved across the country forintegrating vocational education in general education from class 9th to 12th. Further, MSDE in co-ordination with Ministry of Education (MoE) has launched the Skill Hubs Initiative (SHI) as a pilot on 01.01.2022 under central component of PMKVY 3.0 which focuses on introduction of skill training programme in the education ecosystem as envisioned in the National Education Policy, 2020 (NEP, 2020).

NSDC has partnered with the Finnish National Agency for Education (EDUFI), Finland to promote and facilitate the exchange of knowledge of new innovations and connect the providers within the vocational education and training sector between the two countries.	The Government of India and the Government of Japan have signed a Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) in January, 2021 on a basic framework for partnership for proper operation of the system pertaining to “Specified Skilled Worker”. Under this MoC, skilled Indian workers from fourteen sectors viz; (1) Nursing care (Caregiving), (2) Building cleaning management, (3) Machine parts & tooling industries, (4) Industrial machinery industry, (5) Electric, electronics and information industries, (6) Construction industry, (7) Shipbuilding and ship machinery industry, (8) Automobile repair and maintenance, (9) Aviation industry, (10) Accommodation industry, (11) Agriculture, (12) Fishery & aquaculture, (13) Manufacture of food and beverages, and (14) Foodservice industry have been identified for enhanced job opportunities for skilled Indian workers in Japan.Further, MSDE and the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan (Government of Japan) have also signed an MoC inviting candidates from India to Japan under the Technical Intern Training Program (TITP).It aims to transform India’s skill ecosystem by sending and accepting technical interns from India to Japan, thereby enabling Indian industries to imbibe the best practices of Japanese industries.
