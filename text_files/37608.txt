ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a):	  The number of cases disposed in the lower courts of the country during the Covid lockdown through digital/virtual mode, State/UT-wise including Odisha is at Annexure.(b):	  No, Sir. Though no evaluation exercise has been made in this regard, however, Video-Conferencing emerged as the mainstay of the Courts during the Covid lockdown period as physical hearings when normal court proceedings in the congregational mode were not possible. Since Covid lockdown started, the District courts heard 1,11,40,223 cases while the High Court heard 60,21,688 cases (totalling 1.71 crore) till 31.01.2022 using video conferencing. The Supreme Court held 2,18,891 hearings till 14.03.2022 since the beginning of lockdown period. To bring about uniformity and standardization in the conduct of Video Conferencing (VC), an overarching order was passed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India on 6th April 2020 which gave legal sanctity and validity to the court hearings done through VC. Further, VC rules were framed by a 5-judge committee which was circulated to all the High Courts for adoption after local contextualization. A total of 23 High Courts have implemented Video Conferencing rules. One video conference equipment each has been provided to all Court Complexes including taluk level courts and additionally funds have been sanctioned for additional VC equipment for 14,443 court rooms. Funds for setting up 2506 VC Cabins have been made available. Additional 1500 VC Licenses have been acquired. VC facilities are already enabled between 3240 court complexes and corresponding 1272 jails. A sum of Rs. 7.60 crore has been released for procurement of 1732 Document Visualizers. Virtual hearing of the cases by the Courts has helped the entire legal ecosystem including the litigants and lawyers as it helps them to appear before the court from any location of their choice thus leading to considerable saving of time and money.****** AnnexureSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (A) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 4956 FOR ANSWER ON 01.04.2022 REGARDING VIRTUAL HEARING OF CASES.
