                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)a)	As per the Rural Health Statistics-2019, as on 31.03.2019, a total of 30,045 Primary Health Centres (PHCs) have been functional in the country. State-wise details are given in Annexure-1. b)	& c):  Public health being a State subject, the primary responsibility to ensure availability of doctors, trained staff and medical equipment in public health facilities lies with the State Governments. However, under the National Health Mission (NHM), Central Government provides financial and technical support to States / UTs to strengthen their healthcare systems including for procurement of equipment and insourcing / engagement of doctors and health workers on contractual basis, based on the requirements posed by the States / UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs). As per Rural Health Statistics-2019, there is around 6% of shortfall of doctors in the PHCs in the Country, besides some shortfall of trained health workers. The details of shortfall of doctors and health assistants in PHCs is given in Annexure-II.Central Government also provides support to States / UTs for hard-area allowance to doctors for serving in rural and remote areas and for their residential quarters so that the health professionals find it attractive to serve in public health facilities in such areas. Some states have introduced mandatory rural posting for medical graduates from government institutions to improve the availability of doctors. Further, in order to encourage doctors to work in remote and difficult areas, the Medical Council of India, with the approval of Central Government, has amended the Post Graduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000 to provide: (i) 50% reservation in Post Graduate Diploma Courses for Medical Officers in the Government service, who have served for at least three years in remote and difficult areas; and (ii) Incentive at the rate of 10% the marks obtained for each year in service in remote or difficult areas as upto the maximum of 30% of the marks obtained in the entrance test for admissions in Post Graduate Medical Courses. d)	& (e):  Under NHM, funds are allocated to the States/ UTs pool-wise and not individual activity-wise. State-wise details of State Programme Implementation Plans approvals for PHCs covered under NHM for the year 2020-21 are given in Annexure-III.
