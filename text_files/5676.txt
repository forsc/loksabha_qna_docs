ANSWER




                                                        (a):   Yes, Sir. Government is aware that Artificial Intelligence is emerging technology having critical impact on various sectors. The technologies relating to Artificial Intelligence (AI) such as machine learning, big data analytics, image/speech recognition etc. are evolving at a fast pace and are finding increasing applications. In order to take stock of the implications of Artificial Intelligence on Information Technology and to coordinate work in the domain of Artificial Intelligence, a brainstorming session on Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Creating Ecosystem and Policy Framework was held under the Chairmanship of Hon’ble Minister Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad on 18th January 2017 with the participation of experts from Academia, Industry and Government. As an outcome of the brainstorming session four committees of experts from Academia, Industry and Government were constituted to look into the following areas:I.	Platforms and Data for AIII.	Leveraging AI for identifying National Missions in Key sectorsIII.	Skilling and re-skillingIV.	Cyber Security, safety, legal and ethical issues.The committees identified five sectors that are envisioned to benefit the most from AI in solving societal needs: a) Healthcare, b) Agriculture, c) Education, d) Smart Cities and Infrastructure, and e) Smart Mobility and Transportation. The recommendations of the committees have gone onto formulation of  ‘National Programme on Artificial Intelligence’.(b), (c) and (d): As per NASSCOM (National Association of Software and Services Companies), the critical requirement for optimizing the anticipated impact of the 4th  Industrial Revolution / Digital 4.0 is dependent on the availability of the requisite talent with the relevant knowledge, skills and applications with respect to the Digital/Next-Gen Technologies.  It is a fact  that in India, just as in the  global scenario, IT professionals  need  relevant up-skilling in these ‘Digital Technologies’ like Artificial Intelligence & Big Data Analytics, Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Cyber Security, Social & Mobile, Robotics and Process Automation, Augmented/Virtual Reality, 3D-Printing/Additive Manufacturing), Blockchain  etc.  NASSCOM research has articulated an up-skilling requirement of 30%-50% of its existing work force of 4 Million.Keeping the above in view, an online FutureSkills platform for B2B skilling was created by NASSCOM (http://future-skills.nasscom.in/) which was launched by the Hon''ble Prime Minister on 19.02.2018. MeitY has also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with NASSCOM to collaborate and strengthen their cooperation in the field of skill development particularly with respect to the re-skilling/ up-skilling imperatives in areas of new and emerging technologies, with Government acting as an enabler/facilitator.*******
