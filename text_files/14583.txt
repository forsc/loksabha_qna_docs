(b) &(c) Under the provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006, the Government has re-categorized the On-shore and Off-shore oil and gas exploration projects or activities from Category ‘A’ to Category ‘B2’ vide notification number S.O. 236 (E) dated the 16th January, 2020. The project proponent is required to apply to the State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) and the State Coastal Zone Management Authority for clearances. The State Environmental Assessment Committee (SEAC) examines and appraises such projects with respect to environmental impact and proposed mitigation measures and thereafter makes appropriate recommendation to the SEIAA. Likewise, the concerned Coastal Zone Management Authorities also appraise the project in respect of specific provisions under the Coastal Regulation Zone notification. Such projects are also required to obtain consent under Air and Water Acts from the respective State Pollution Control Boards.  (d)The project proponent is required to submit six monthly environmental statements and compliance to the conditions stipulated in the clearances issued by the SEIAA. The regional office of MoEFCC and the concerned agencies in the State Governments are responsible for monitoring and compliance of the stipulated conditions in the clearance. A provision for appeal against the Environmental Clearance granted, lies with the National Green Tribunal, if preferred within a period of thirty days as prescribed under Section 16 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.***
