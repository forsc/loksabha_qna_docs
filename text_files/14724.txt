ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)to (c) Compensatory Afforestation is one of the most important conditionsstipulated by the Central Government while approving proposals for de-reservation or non forest use of forestland under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 (FCA, 1980). It not only compensates loss in the forest cover and forest land but also ensures that forest land is sought only for unavoidable site specific activities.As a special provision for Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs), Compensatory Afforestation is allowed over degraded forest land double the extent of forest area approved for non-forestry purposes.In view of “land” being a State subject, and in view of National Forest Policy (NFP 1988) goal of having a minimum of one third of land area of the country to be brought under forest or tree cover, state PSUs and private user agencies are normally required to provide for equivalent non forest land for Compensatory Afforestation.However as a matter of pragmatism, revenue lands/zudpi jungle/chhote/bade jharka jungle/jungle-jhari land/civil-soyam/orange lands and all other such categories of forest lands not under management and/or administrative control of the State/UT Forest Department, on which the provisions of FC Act, 1980 are applicable, shall be considered for the purpose of Compensatory Afforestation. Such forest lands on which Compensatory Afforestation is proposed shall be provided double in extent to the area proposed for diversion.***
