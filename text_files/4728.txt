HARSH VARDHAN)(a) to (c):  A statement is laid on the Table of the HouseSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 388* FOR 19TH JULY, 2019(a) Under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY), an AIIMS in Kalyani, West Bengal has been approved at a cost of Rs. 1754 crore and is under construction. Upgradation of following four (4) Medical Colleges have been undertaken under PMSSY scheme: i.	Kolkata Medical College, Kolkata (Phase-I),ii.	BS Medical College, Bankura, Govt. Medical College, Malda and North Bengal Medical College, Darjeeling (Phase-III).		There is no proposal to set up another AIIMS in West Bengal.  82 new Medical Colleges are to be established under Centrally Sponsored Scheme for “Establishment of new medical colleges attached with existing district/referral hospitals” in two phases. Out of these, 10 are in West Bengal namely Birbhum (Rampur Hut), Cooch Behar, Diamond Harbor, Purulia and Raiganj (North Dinajpur) under Phase- I & Barasat, Uluberia, Arambagh, Jhargram and Tamluk under Phase-II. (b) MoU was signed with Government of West Bengal to implement Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PMJAY) in state of West Bengal. The scheme was successfully run till 10th Jan 2019, when it was rolled back by the State Government. Union Minster of Health and Family Welfare had sent letters to Chief Ministers of four states, including West Bengal, for implementation of AB PM-JAY in their respective states.Further, as per the budget announcement 2017-18, 1.5 lakh Health Sub Centres and Primary Health Centres are to be transformed into Health and Wellness Centres across the country by December, 2022 under Ayushman Bharat–Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs) for provision of comprehensive primary care that includes preventive healthcare and health promotion at the community level with continuum of care approach.          The roll out plan of AB - HWCs is given as below:• FY 2018-19 = 15,000• FY 2019-20 = 25,000 (Cumulative 40,000)• FY 2020-21 = 30,000 (Cumulative 70,000)• FY 2021-2022 = 40,000 (Cumulative 1,10,000)• Till 31st December 2022 = 40,000 (Cumulative 1,50,000)            The timeline for operationalization of 1.5 lakh HWCs all over the country is 31st December, 2022. On the basis of the proposals received from all States/ UTs (except, UT of Delhi), so far, approvals for 52,744 Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs) have been accorded.             Against the above initiative, the status of the AB-HWCs in West Bengal is as follows:  • 2393 HWCs (UPHC - 75, PHC- 908& SC- 1410) are approved till 16th July, 2019 • Further, as on 16th July, 2019, 399 HWCs (PHC- 256 & SC- 143) are    operational.(c) Public health and hospitals being a State subject, the primary responsibility to ensure effective and sufficient health facilities, lies with the State Governments.However, Under National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their healthcare systems including infrastructure upgradation of public health facilities, based on the requirements posed by them in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) within their overall resource envelope.During the National Programme Coordination Committee (NPCC) meetings held every year, the proposals of the States/UTs are discussed and finalized in consultation with the State/UTs within their available resource envelope. Based upon recommendation of NPCC, approvals are awarded in the form of Record of Proceedings (RoP) & conveyed to respective States/UTs Governments.    RoPs of West Bengal under NHM   is available at https://nhm.gov.in/index4.php?lang=1&level=0&linkid=62&lid=75.
