                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) and (b): Yes Sir. Infrastructure is a pre-requisite to achieve broad based and inclusive growth on a sustained basis. Investment in infrastructure is necessary for sustaining the high growth rate of India. Provisioning of Infrastructure facilitates more industrialization and enhances the productivity, efficiency and cost-competitiveness of the country, leading to more growth. Recognizing the importance of infrastructure to economic growth, Government has set up a Task Force to draw up the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) for the period upto Financial Year (FY) 2025. The Terms of Reference of the Task Force on NIP were to identify technically feasible and financially/ economically viable infrastructure projects that can be initiated in the period FY2019-20 to FY 2024-25; To estimate annual infrastructure investments/capital costs; To guide the ministries in identifying appropriate sources of financing; and to suggest measures to monitor the projects so that cost and time overruns can be minimized.The summary of the Report of the Task Force on National Infrastructure Pipeline was released by the Finance Minister on 31.12.2019, with projected infrastructure investment in India of over Rs. 102 lakh crore during the period FY 2020 to FY 2025. (c) Does not arise.*****
