ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a)	Since October, 2016, Government has given ‘in-principle’ approval for strategic disinvestment of 34 CPSEs including their Subsidiaries, Units and Joint Ventures, which implies sale of majority stake and transfer of management control. The process for strategic disinvestment has been completed in case of 5 CPSEs. The process is at different stages in other cases.(b)	Budgetary target for disinvestment receipt has been set at Rs. 2.10 lakh crore for the financial year 2020-21.(c)	List of CPSEs, Subsidiaries, Units and Joint Ventures for which Government has given ‘in-principle’ approval for strategic disinvestment is given at Annexure-1.  (d) Completion of the disinvestment process depends on the prevailing market conditions and investor’s interest. (e) The Government follows a policy of disinvestment through minority stake sale and Strategic disinvestment. Strategic Disinvestment implies substantial sale of Government shareholding of a CPSE along with transfer of management control. The  policy of strategic disinvestment is followed in respect of the CPSEs which are not in ‘priority sector’  For this purpose, NITI Aayog has been mandated to identify such CPSEs based on the criteria of (i) National Security; (ii) Sovereign functions at arm’s length, and (iii) Market Imperfections and Public Purpose. Strategic disinvestment of CPSEs is being guided by the basic economic principle that Government should discontinue in sectors, where competitive markets have come of age and economic potential of such entities may be better discovered in the hands of strategic investor due to various factors such as infusion of capital, technological upgradation and efficient management practices; and would thus add to the GDP of the country.In certain other CPSEs, policy of minority stake sale without transfer of management control through various SEBI approved methods, is being followed in order to unlock the value, promote public ownership and higher degree of accountability. The various modes of disinvestment commonly used for minority stake sale includes Initial Public Offer (IPO), Offer for Sale (OFS), Buyback of shares and Exchange Traded Funds (ETF).  *** Annexure-1Annexure to reply to Lok Sabha unstarred question no. 3577 for reply on 16.03.2020a)	Transactions Completed S.No.	Name of CPSE1.
