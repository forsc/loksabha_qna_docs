ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)  to (c):    Since the global financial crisis of 2008-09, the world has seen considerable challenges to economic growth and trade. With regard to the current situation, as per World Trade Organization (WTO) press release dated 01.10.2019, World Merchandise Trade volume was forecast to grow at 1.2% in 2019. This is substantially below the 2.6% trade growth that was projected earlier by WTO in April 2019. In this turbulent global scenario, India’s exports have faced a challenging period in recent years. However, through concerted efforts like improved logistics, facilitation through increased digitization to reduce human interface and increased transparency of Government schemes aimed at incentivization and facilitation of exporters, quick resolution of implementation issues of GST, capacity building through skilling etc., the Government was able to arrest the challenges and our merchandise exports grew on a secular basis over the last three financial years, to reach a new peak of USD 330.1 Billion in 2018-19.     Details of export performance during the last three years are as follows:- Years	Export ( US$ Billion)	% Change	Export ( US$ Billion) (excluding Petroleum Products and Gems & Jewellery)	% Change2016-17	275.85	-	200.89	-2017-18	303.53	10.03	224.51	11.772018-19	330.07	8.75	243.27	8.35     Source: DGCI&S. The above table reveals that India’s merchandise export has increased from 275.85 US$ billion in 2016-17 to 303.53 US$ billion in 2017-18 and to 330.07 US$ billion in 2018-19, registering a positive growth of 10.03% and 8.75% as compared to the previous years. Excluding Petroleum Products and Gems & Jewellery, India’s merchandise export has increased from 200.89 US$ billion in 2016-17 to 224.51 US$ billion in 2017-18 and to 243.27 US$ billion in 2018-19, registering a positive growth of 11.77% and 8.75% as compared to the previous years.  Details of major Commodity Groups in terms of their export performance for the financial year 2018-19 is enclosed.******** India’Export Performance% ChangeSl.
