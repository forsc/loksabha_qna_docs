                                                        MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (c) A statement is laid on the Table of the House. ******STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 342 RAISED BY SHRI R.K. SINGH PATEL AND SHRI DHARMENDRA KASHYAP, HON’BLE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT TO BE ANSWERED ON 28/03/2022 REGARDING KENDRIYA VIDYALAYAS IN UTTAR PRADESH. (a) Opening of new Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) is a continuous process. KVs are opened primarily to cater to the educational needs of the wards of transferable Central Government Employees including Defence & Para-Military personnel, Central Autonomous Bodies, Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and Central Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) by providing a common programme of education throughout the country. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations and committing resources for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities found fulfilling the mandatory pre-requisites for opening of new KVs have to compete with other such proposals under the “Challenge Method” and subject to approval of the competent authority. At present, 122 KVs are functioning in the State of Uttar Pradesh.  Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) has informed that 06 proposals for establishment of new KVs have been received from the State Government of Uttar Pradesh out of which 02 proposals for establishment of new KVs at Payagpur (Jaunpur) and Maharajganj (Maharajganj) have found fulfilling the mandatory pre-requisites as per norms of KVS. These proposals have been considered by the “Challenge Method” Committee. There are some discrepancies / deficiencies in remaining 04 proposals namely Chandpur (Ayodhya), Achhunera Dehat (Agra), Bijnor (Bijnor) and Mauranipur (Jhansi) which have been brought to the notice of concerned district administrations by KVS for necessary rectification.   (b) There are 09 functional KVs in the districts in Bundelkhand Region (including Chitrakoot district) of Uttar Pradesh. There is no KV in Jalaun district. KVS has further informed that KV Banda could not be made functional as the sponsoring authority i.e. State Government of Uttar Pradesh has not transferred the requisite extent of land in favour of KVS and temporary accommodation as per norms of KVS.  (c) Construction of permanent buildings for KVs is a continuous process, which depends upon identification of suitable land, completion of lease formalities in favour of KVS by the sponsoring authorities, submission of drawings / estimates by construction agency, availability of funds and requisite approvals etc. As such, no definite time frame can be given in this regard.******
