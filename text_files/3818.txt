ANSWER




                                                             The MINISTER OF FINANCE      (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) to (d): Based on the recommendation of the Sub Group of Chief Ministers and in consultation with various Ministries/ Departments and other Stakeholders, GoI has rationalized the existing 66 Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSSs) into 28 schemes and revised the funding pattern for CSSs which was communicated by NITI Aayog vide it’s O.M. dated 17.08.2016. The  existing 66 Centrally Sponsored Schemes have been rationalized into 28 schemes, broadly divided into two categories, namely, (i) Core of the Core Schemes (6), (ii) Core Schemes (22). The funding pattern of the restructured Centrally Sponsored Schemes is  (i) Core of the Core schemes (6 in nos): No change in the erstwhile funding pattern, (ii) Core schemes (22 in nos): For the 8 North Eastern States and Himalayan States of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir, 90% of expenditure is borne by Centre, and remaining 10% by States. For the rest of the States - sharing ratio between Centre and State is 60:40.               It may also be stated that following the implementation of the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the devolution to States has been increased from 32% to 42%, thereby increasing the resource availability with the States vis-a-vis the Centre. Further, the level of flexi fund available in each CSS has been raised from 10% to 25% after revising the funding pattern of CSS. This was done to enable the States to satisfy the local needs and undertake innovations. The trend in outlays in the Expenditure Budget of GoI for 28 CSSs for the last five  years shown below reflects an increase of around 63% in 2019-20 BE (Final) compared to actual of 2015-16.                                                                                                                   (Rs. in Crore)Scheme Category	Actual 2015-16	Actual 2016-17	Actual2017-18	RE 2018-19	BE (Final)2019-20CSS	2,03,740	2,41,296	2,85,448	3,04,849	3,31,610(e): Under the Central Share of State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) for 2019-20, 1st installment of Rs.340.875 cr. and 2nd installment of Rs.211.125 cr. has been released to Government of Odisha in advance. On account payment of Rs.788.875 cr., has been released from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) during the current year 2019-20 to Government of Odisha in the wake of cyclone ‘FANI’. **************
