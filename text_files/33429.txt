ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)As per the India State of Forest Report(ISFR) 2021, there is an increase of 24 sq. km. of dense forest in Himachal Pradesh with respect to ISFR 2019 assessment. However, in the other three western Himalayan States/Union Territories, namely Uttarakhand, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, there is adecrease in dense forests of 29 sq. km, 97 sq. km and 10 sq. km respectively. Heavy rainfall can lead to soil erosion, run off and associated impacts.Such impacts are lesser where there is adequate vegetation cover. While all efforts are undertaken to minimize such risks, all such situations cannot be attributed to climate change. The science of attribution of these changes particularly to climate change is far more complex and an evolving subject. (b) The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has established the G.B. Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment as a focal agency to advance scientific knowledge and to evolve integrated management strategies for conservation of biodiversity and natural resources in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR). Besides, the Himalayan Forest Research Institute, a constituent organization under the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education, is also addressing forestry research and education in the Himalayan Region. The Ministry has also launched the National Mission on Himalayan Studies in 2015-16 as a Central Sector Scheme to support the sustenance and enhancement of the ecological, natural, cultural, and socio-economic capital assets and values of the IHR. Government is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) through National Missions that address climate change mitigation and adaptation across a range of sectors. Two missions namely, (i) National Mission for Sustaining Himalayan Ecosystem (NMSHE); and (ii) National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change (NMSKCC) under the Department of Science & Technology (DST) address the concerns of sustainable development in the Indian Himalayan Region. Further, thirty-three States /Union Territories have prepared their State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCC) in line with the NAPCC considering the State specific issues relating to climate change.*****
