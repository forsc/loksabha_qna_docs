                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS (SHRI DEVUSINH CHAUHAN)(a) & (b)	Yes Sir. DoT follows the standards and best practices recommended by relevant International agencies/ organisations such as World Health Organization (WHO), International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), International Advisory Committee (IAC) on EMF, International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and various Study Groups under ITU for monitoring global developments in this regard. Based on above, Department of Telecommunications has issued advisory guidelines, dated 01.08.2013, to State Governments for issue of clearance for installation of mobile towers. These guidelines to State Governments are applicable to all areas including residential areas and do not place any restriction on installation of mobile towers in densely populated areas.In addition, Government has taken following initiatives:i.	The EMF emission norms in India are 10 times more stringent than that as prescribed by ICNIRP.                                                                 ii.	Government has put in place a well-structured process and mechanism for monitoring any violation, so that Telecom Service Providers strictly adhere to the prescribed norms including submission of self-certificate before commercial start of Base Transceiver Station (BTS) site. The field units of Department of Telecommunications also regularly carry out the EMF audit upto 10% BTS Sites annually on random basis. iii.	Government has also doubled the penalty for violation of the prescribed EMF norms from Rs.5 lakhs to Rs.10 lakhs per BTS per incidence with effect from 20.11.2013 and further to 20 Lakhs per site on 29-03-2019.iv.	Government has launched a web portal namely ‘Tarang Sanchar’ for sharing Information on Mobile Towers and EMF Emission Compliances, with a view to generate confidence and conviction with regard to safety and harmlessness from mobile towers, clearing any myths and misconceptions. The portal can be accessed at www.tarangsanchar.gov.in.Additionally, general public can also request for EMF emission measurement at any location by paying requisite fee.                   (c) 	An Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC), setup in 2010 to examine the effect of Electro Magnetic Field (EMF) emission from Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) and mobile phones, after examining various national and international studies on the environmental and health related concerns due to EMF, had, inter-alia, indicated that most of the laboratory studies were unable to find a direct link between exposure to radio frequency radiation and health; and the scientific studies as yet have not been able to confirm a cause and effect relationship between radio frequency radiation and health.Also, a committee, constituted by Hon’ble High Court Allahabad including Members from IITs of Kharagpur, Kanpur, Delhi, Roorkee, Bombay and from other scientific institutions of the country including Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) Delhi, in their report submitted in 2014, has, inter-alia, noted – “ ... On the basis of scientific evidences, studies and reports available, it has been found that there is no conclusive evidence about the stated dangers of EMF radiation from mobile BTS tower...” The Committee has noted that “there are no conclusive evidence to establish any causal link between the effect of EMF radiation from BTS with biological effects described in cell models, animals or humans, and any possible resulting health effects.” Further, a joint initiative has been launched by Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) under Department of Science & Technology (DST) and Department of Telecommunications (DoT), wherein nineteen research proposals, have already been initiated to study possible impact of EMF exposure from mobile towers and handsets on life i.e. Humans, Living Organisms, Flora & Fauna and Environment.At present, the studies are non-conclusive.(d) 	Yes, there have been some instances where people are not allowing setting up of mobile towers in their areas due to apprehension about EMF radiation.(e) 	As per information available with DoT, about 83 Public Grievances have been reported during last three calendar years against installation of mobile tower. In addition to that,13 court cases are pending in Rajasthan against installation of mobile tower.********
