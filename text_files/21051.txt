                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TOURISM (INDEPENDENT CHARGE)(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a):	Sir,  the signs of improvement are visible in the domestic tourism segment in States/UTs like Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa and Andaman & Nicobar Islands etc.  The vaccination process has also created a positive perception about travelling and the numbers are expected to help the industry attain revival and recovery. (b):	The following steps have been taken to overcome the crisis caused by Covid-19 pandemic in the tourism sector: i.	Detailed operational guidelines for Covid safety and hygiene for hotels, restaurants, B&Bs/ Home stays and Tourism Service Providers have been formulated and issued on 08.06.2020 to facilitate smooth resumption of business.ii.	Validity of approval or certifications of hotels and other accommodation units whose project approval/re-approval and classification/re-classification have expired/were likely to expire, has been extended upto 30th April, 2021.iii.	The Ministry has developed an initiative called SAATHI (System for Assessment, Awareness & Training for Hospitality Industry), for effective implementation of Guidelines/SOPs issued with reference to COVID 19 and beyond for safe operations of Hotels, Restaurants, B&Bs and other units.iv.	Operational Recommendations for safe resumption of business with easing of lockdown restrictions have been issued for various segments of the travel and hospitality industry and circulated amongst all stakeholders.v.	Recognition of Travel Agents, Tour Operators, Tourist Transport Operators by the Ministry of Tourism has been extended automatically by six months. Those who have submitted applications for recognition by the Ministry have been given provisional recognition for six months, pending completion of required procedures.vi.	In addition to the above steps taken by Ministry of Tourism, other agencies/Ministries of Government of India have declared stimulus packages like loan moratorium, waived off PF contribution, deferment of TCS up to October 2020, collateral free automatic loan under Atmanirbhar Bharat package etc. to revive the economy and industry including units of the hospitality industry. (c) & (d):	India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) Limited does not get any annual grant from the Government of India under any scheme, for its expenses. It is a Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE) under the Ministry of Tourism, Government of India responsible to generate its business and meet its obligations, from its resources. ITDC may be contracted by any party (Government, private, etc.) to implement any project, etc., requiring expertise in tourism. Due to the ongoing Disinvestment Policy of the Government of India and the negative impact of the ongoing Novel Corona Virus COVID 19 pandemic worldwide including India, ITDC is unlikely to make further capital expenditure on its existing hotels, etc.********
