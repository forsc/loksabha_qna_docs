ANSWER




                                                        (a): Schemes / Programmes being implemented by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs for the welfare of the Scheduled Tribes in the hilly area and across the country are at Annexure.(b) to (d): Government has adopted a multi-pronged strategy for overall development of tribal people living across the country, which includes support for education, health, sanitation, water supply, skill development, livelihood etc. Major part of infrastructure development and provision of basic amenities in tribal areas/regions in the country is carried out through various schemes/programmes of concerned Central Ministries and the State Governments concerned, while the Ministry of Tribal Affairs provides additive to these initiatives by way of plugging critical gaps. Most of the schemes / activities are demand driven. Submission of proposals by the State Governments seeking grants under the ongoing schemes / programmes is a regular phenomenon. Proposals received from the State Governments are placed before the Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) in the Ministry for appraisal and approval of annual plan of the State in accordance with the guidelines / norms stipulated under the schemes/ programmes. In some schemes like  Pre Matric Scholarshipand Post Matric Scholarship to ST students funds shared at the ratio of 75:25 between the Centre and State Governments/UT Administrations and 90:10 for NE and Specially Category States (Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttrakhand) from 2014-15 onwards. Under the Scheme of Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS), 20% extra funds are provided for construction of EMRS in hilly area by the Ministry. Funds are released by the Ministry scheme-wise to the State Governments/UT Administrations and not District-wise or State-wise. ****** AnnexureAnnexure referred in reply to part (a) of  Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.253 for 24.06.2019 raised by DR.
