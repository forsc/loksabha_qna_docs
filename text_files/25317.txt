                                                        (a)	Skill India Mission aims to empower the Indian youth through skill development training. In order to impart skill development training, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) promotes establishment of model training centres in every district of the country known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK). The Ministry through National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) provides capital expenditure through a secured loan up to a maximum of Rs 70 lakhs per PMKK. As on 01.07.2021, 812 PMKKs have been allocated across the country; out of which, 721 have been established. State-wise number of PMKKs allocated and established is given at Annexure. In addition, 2,694 Training Centres (TCs) are operational across the country under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY). These TCs were established without funding support from the Ministry.(b)       In order to improve the availability of skilled professional across the country, competency based skill development training aligning with National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) is being imparted through various schemes and programmes of MSDE. NSQF-aligned job roles are developed by industry-led Sector Skill Councils (SSCs) covering various sectors.(c)        PMKK is envisaged to evolve into a hub at district level for delivery of skill development training catering to its block level demand. As on 01.07.2021, total of Rs 243 Cr. has been disbursed as loans to training partners for setting up PMKKs across the country, out of which, Rs 9.6 Cr. have been disbursed for setting up PMKKs in the state of Gujarat. 34 PMKKs have been allocated in the state of Gujarat; out of which, 28 have been established.
