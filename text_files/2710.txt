                                                        MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM & NATURAL GAS(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (f): Under Production Sharing contract regime, seven Blocks were awarded in state of Tamil Nadu in various rounds of New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP), out of which only two blocks are operational and the rest have been relinquished / proposed for relinquishment. Under Discovered Small Field Bid rounds, two contracts were awarded through International Competitive Bidding. Further, three Blocks were awarded under Open Acreage Licensing Policy. As per contract signed with the operators, three exploratory wells are to be drilled in these three blocks as per the committed work programme. However the operators can drill more appraisal and development wells on finding discovery. The operators have submitted for approval of Terms of Reference (ToR) for Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) for drilling and testing of wells.Before carrying out any drilling activity, Environmental Clearance (EC) is mandatory. The Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) is pre-condition for obtaining EC. EIA report identifies environmental aspects and impacts arising out of the proposed drilling project and proposes mitigation measures. In addition, Consent to Operate is also obtained from State Pollution Control Board. During public hearing for EC, consultation is held with stakeholders, including local public. Directions of National Green Tribunal (NGT), if any, are complied with. However, no consultations are held with NGT. The Contractors are required to obtain Petroleum Exploration License (PEL) / Petroleum Mining Lease (PML) from appropriate Government before commencing any exploration / drilling or production activities. In addition, contractors are under statutory obligation to follow provisions of relevant central and local laws including environmental laws, forest clearance, wildlife clearance, land acquisition as well as to comply with rules / regulations pertaining to exploration / drilling activities.Representation has been received for cancellation of award of hydrocarbon exploration and production contracts in Tamil Nadu. The representations are dealt with in consultation with authorities concerned and as per the provisions of contract, as well as applicable rules, regulations, laws, guidelines etc.****
