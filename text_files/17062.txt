ANSWER




                                                        (a): Yes, Sir. In pursuance to Government’s vision of “Housing for All by 2022”, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has been implementing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U), Housing for All Mission for providing all weather pucca houses with basic civic infrastructure to all eligible beneficiaries in urban areas. Similarly, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Gramin (PMAY-G) Mission has been framed for eligible beneficiaries in rural areas, which is being implemented through the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD). During current financial year (2020-21) and in the current situation of COVID-19 pandemic, the details of houses sanctioned along with Central Assistance approved and released, so far under PMAY-U Mission including in Assam and Haryana are at Annexure. MoRD has reported that the target set for construction of houses under PMAY-G is 2.95 crore, of which 1.0 crore was set for Phase-I (2016-17 to 2018-19) and 1.95 crore in Phase-II (2019-20 to 2020-21). So far, 4,43,973 houses have been sanctioned in the State of Assam under PMAY-G, of which 3,18,332 have been completed. Further, in the State of Haryana 20,920 houses have been sanctioned, of which 20,400 have been completed so far. (b): In order to make PMAY-U Mission more inclusive, some amendments have been made in the Scheme Guidelines from time to time, based on the requirement to promote the all-encompassing vision of the Mission viz.  definition of beneficiary family, inclusion of Notified Planning/ Development Area under the Scheme, launch of Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) for Middle Income Group (MIG) and its extension from time to time, change in size of carpet area, inclusion of State Bank of India (SBI) as third Central Nodal Agency (CNA) for CLSS etc. Additionally, MoRD has informed that the Cabinet while approving the implementation of the Phase II of PMAY-G (2019-20 to 2021-22) made certain changes in the implementation aspects of the Scheme. In pursuance to the above, an Expert Committee was constituted by MoRD. The Committee has submitted its report for revision of guidelines based on its recommendations.                                        *****
