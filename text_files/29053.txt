ANSWER




(a) to (d): The Ministry of Women and Child Development implements various schemes for empowerment and development of women across the country including the State of Telangana. The schemes launched by the Ministry for the empowerment and development of women during the last seven years are as follows : (i) Mahila Shakti Kendra Scheme is being implemented from 2017, as a centrally sponsored scheme to empower rural women through community participation. The scheme aims to facilitate inter-sectoral convergence of schemes and programs meant for women. It is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme and is implemented through States/ UTs. The MSK scheme is being implemented in the State of Telangana. During the previous years, the amount of funds allocated by Government under the scheme are Rs. 267.30 crore for FY 2018-19, Rs.150.00 crore for FY 2019-20 and Rs.100.00 crore for FY 2020-21. The State/ UT-wise details of fund disbursed/ released under the MSK Scheme during the last three years and the current financial year is at Annexure. (ii) Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) is a Centrally Sponsored Conditional Cash Transfer Scheme being implemented across the country with effect from 01.01.2017. The maternity benefit under PMMVY is available to all Pregnant Women & Lactating Mothers (PW&LM), excluding PW&LM who are in regular employment with the Central Government or the State Governments or Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) or those who are in receipt of similar benefits under any law for the time being in force, for first living child of family. Under the scheme Rs.5,000/- are provided to the eligible beneficiary in three installments during pregnancy and lactation in response to the individuals fulfilling the conditions as per the scheme guidelines. The eligible beneficiaries can also receive the cash incentive as per approved norms under Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) after institutional delivery. Funds are released on the basis of indicative number of beneficiaries and utilization of previous years funds and thus, no State-wise allocations are made under PMMVY. The State Government of Telangana is not implementing PMMVY Scheme as they are implementing their own Maternity Benefit Programme.  (iii)  Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) Scheme was launched on 22nd January, 2015 with an aim to address declining Child Sex Ratio (CSR) and related issues of empowerment of girls and women over a life cycle continuum. The objectives of the scheme are to prevent gender biased sex selective elimination, to ensure survival and protection of the girl child and to ensure education and participation of the girl child. The key elements of the scheme include nation-wide media and advocacy campaign and multi-sectoral interventions in selected districts.  BBBP scheme is being implemented by State of Telangana.  (iv) Women Helpline Scheme (WHL) is being implemented since 1st April, 2015 to provide 24 hours emergency and non-emergency response to women affected by violence through referral and information about women related government schemes/ programmes over a tollfree telephonic short code 181. WHL also supports women in distress with rescue van and counselling services. Women Helpline is operational in 34 States/UTs, including in the state of Telangana. (v) One Stop Centres (OSCs) facilitate access to an integrated range of services including police, medical, legal, psychological support and temporary shelter to women affected by violence. The Scheme is funded through the Nirbhaya Fund and funds are directly released to the Districts. Under the scheme, One Stop Centres are being set up in all districts of the country. So far, 704 OSCs have been operationalized across 35 States/ UTs, including in the State of Telangana. These OSCs have provided assistance to over 4.5 lakh women till now. (vi) Mahila Police Volunteers (MPV) Scheme is being implemented under Ministry of Women and Child Development in collaboration with Ministry of Home Affairs. MPVs act as a link between police and the community and facilitate women in distress. MPVs serve as a public-police interface in order to fight crime against women and report incidents of violence against women such as domestic violence, child marriage, dowry harassment and violence faced by women in public spaces.  The scheme provides for atleast one MPV for every panchayat/ ward. This scheme is not being implemented in the State of Telangana.  The allocation of funds under the above-mentioned schemes are not done state-wise. However, details of the funds released and utilised under above-said schemes by the Government, States/ UTs wise, including Telangana, are at Annexure. The Ministry has also supported construction of Home for Widows named as ''Krishna Kutir'' at Vrindavan, District Mathura, Uttar Pradesh to accommodate upto one thousand widows. The Home was inaugurated on 31.08.2018.  The Ministry has so far released Rs. 2.57 crores for this project. Further, the Central Government works for empowerment and development of women through the schemes and programs of its various Ministries and Departments as well. The details of funds released and utilised under such schemes are not maintained by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.*****   Annexure referred to in reply to Lok Sabha Un-starred Question No. 961 for answer on 3rd December, 2021 asked by Shri Arvind Dharmapuri regarding ‘Schemes for Empowerment of Women’Mahila Shakti Kendra Scheme(Rs. in Lakhs)SI.No.	States/UTs	Release of funds 		2018-19	2019-20	2020-21	2021-22(upto 31.11.2021)1	Andaman & Nicobar	0	20.58	41.04	02	Andhra Pradesh 	277.20	21.13	0	03	Arunachal Pradesh	151.35	334.38	0	04	Assam	0	88.30	473.79	05	Bihar	25.83	48.62	0	06	Chandigarh	33.44	14.03	26.58	07	Chhattisgarh	7.28	35.41	7.95	08	Dadra & Nagar Haveli	0	10.48	51.67	0	Daman & Diu	6.15	19.90		9	Delhi (UT)	0	0	0	010	Goa	0	11.42	0	011	Gujarat	214.64	98.14	0	012	Haryana	6.91	94.57	13.39	013	Himachal Pradesh	137.45	52.94	36.29	014	Jammu and Kashmir	241.71	34.44	0	35.4715	Jharkhand	0	29.71	0	016	Karnataka	169.83	122.43	244.13	017	Kerala	74.26	34.32	0	018	Ladakh	0	0	40.34	019	Lakshadweep	0	4.83	18.9	020	Madhya Pradesh	479.02	31.46	0	021	Maharashtra	144.63	22.88	0	022	Manipur	33.21	4.29	0	023	Meghalaya	158.85	25.74	0	024	Mizoram	166.77	140.11	86.01	025	Nagaland	221.57	103.80	271.76	026	Odisha	737.95	37.18	0	027	Puducherry	9.18	14.30	0	028	Punjab	87.50	7.30	7.56	029	Rajasthan	278.24	40.65	9.38	030	Sikkim	99.85	4.29	0	031	Tamil Nadu	227.86	105.81	11.67	33.1732	Telangana	288.62	11.26	10.51	033	Tripura	125.50	0	0	034	Uttar Pradesh	362.13	17.16	11.67	035	Uttarakhand	226.14	295.66	0	036	West Bengal	453.62	31.46	0	0Grant Total	5446.69	1968.98	1362.64	68.64 Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana  (PMMVY)Sl.
