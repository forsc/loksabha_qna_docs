                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY & DAIRYING (DR. SANJEEV KUMAR BALYAN)(a)	Avian Influenza among poultry/wild birds have been confirmed from 14 States / UTs namely Kerala, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Delhi and Jammu & Kashmir. The State/UT-wise details are at Annexure-I. (b)	The measures taken by Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying measures taken by the Government to control the spread of flu as well as initiatives to increase awareness include – i.	Advisories issued to States/UTs for increased surveillance and bio-security in poultry farms before onset of winter due to arrival of migratory birds during winterii.	Revision of extant Action Plan for Prevention, Control and Containment of Avian Influenza iii.	Guidelines issued to States /UTs for control and containment of bird flu as per the Action Plan which include increasing surveillance around water bodies, live bird markets, zoos, poultry farms, etc., proper disposal of carcass, strengthening of bio-security in and around poultry farms, restricting movement of poultry from infected zones and taking preparatory measures, viz. maintaining sufficient stock of PPE kits and accessories, disinfectants and other logistics required for control operationsiv.	Setting up central control room to monitor daily progress of preventive and control measures taken by States / UTsv.	Deploying Central teams to visit affected States for monitoring and conducting epidemiological investigationvi.	In coordination with National Disaster Management Authority, meetings held with State/ UT Animal Husbandry and Health Departments to assess status of preparedness and providing required supportvii.	Requesting States/UTs to ensure effective communication and coordination with Health and Forest authorities for close vigilance of the disease status to avoid any chance of jumping of the disease into humansviii.	States directed to identify their BSL-II labs for speeding up screening of infection in the state and ensure timely introduction of control mechanismsix.	Provision of funds made for carrying out surveillance, awareness generation, procurement of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), control and containment operations, compensating poultry farmers whose birds are culled or eggs and poultry feed destroyed by the State/UTx.	Sensitization and awareness generation of poultry farmers and general public on Bird Flu through various social media platforms including Facebook /twitter etc.(c)	Yes, Sir. As per information received from the States/UTs affected by the present Avian Influenza outbreak, 95,181 poultry birds have died and 3,36,120 poultry birds have been culled so far. (d)	Yes Sir. TheDepartment, under Assistance to States for Control of Animal Disease (ASCAD) component of Livestock Health & Disease Control (LH&DC) scheme supplements efforts of States/UTs Government for prevention, control and containment of animal diseases, including bird flu, by providing financial assistance (on a 50: 50 sharing basis based on extant rates) to the States /UTs. Compensation is paid to poultry farmers whose poultry birds, eggs and poultry feed are culled / destroyed as per Action Plan.(e)	The Department has issued advisories /guidelines to States /UTs for increasing awareness not only for preparedness, control and containment of Avian Influenza but also for allaying fearof its spread, if well-cooked poultry eggs and meat are consumed.(f)	As per records available, outbreaks of Avian Influenza have been reported in Kerala, Karnataka, Odisha, Telangana, Manipur, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Tripura, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, Haryana, Delhi and Daman Administration during 2015 to 2020. A total of 2,00,368 birds (poultry/wild birds) have been reported to have died due to bird flu and a total of 11,32,865 poultry have been reported to have been culled during that period in the country.(g)	The Department has released Rs.160.11 crores in 2020-21 to States / UTs under Assistance to States for Control of Animal Diseases (ASCAD), a component under Livestock Health & Disease Control (LH&DC), which includes Rs.10.41 crore to Rajasthan. The details of funds released States/UTs-wise are annexed as Annexure-II.(h)	No Sir. As per World Organization of Animal Health (OIE), vaccination is not considered the solution to the control of Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) if eradication is the desired result. Without the application of monitoring systems, strict biosecurity and depopulation in the face of infection, there is possibility that these viruses could become endemic in vaccinated poultry populations. Long-term circulation of the virus in a vaccinated population may result in both antigenic and genetic changes in the virus and this has been reported to have occurred in several countries. With the long term use of vaccination either the disease has become endemic and therefore widespread, or the infection in affected animals is too difficult to detect. Accordingly, Government of India does not permit use of any vaccine against Avian Influenza in the country.
