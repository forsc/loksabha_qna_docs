The defaults arising during the said suspension will remain non est for the purpose of initiation of CIRP under the Code. (c): Application for pre-packaged insolvency resolution process in respect of 1(one) company has been admitted by the Adjudicating Authority and is ongoing. No resolution plans have been approved under this framework, so far.(d): According to data available with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), 33 (thirty-three) companies having registered office in State of Uttar Pradesh been admitted into CIRP during January 2020 to November 2021.(e) and (f): Insolvency resolution process under the IBC is market driven and the outcome depends on market forces. Further, the time taken for resolution depends on several factors, including the nature of business, business cycles, market sentiments and marketing effort. Government is taking all steps to strengthen the NCLT, in order to reduce the delays in disposal of cases. Five new Benches of NCLT have been announced during year 2018 and 2019 at Jaipur, Cuttack, Kochi, Indore and Amaravati. Vacant posts of Members in NCLT are being filled up regularly. Government has appointed 19 new Members in NCLT recently. For capacity building of Members, regular colloquiums are being held. e-Court Project is also being implemented by National Informatics Centre (NIC) for all the benches of NCLT. Further, to monitor delayed insolvency resolution processes, IBBI has introduced a Form to be filed by the resolution professionals on monthly basis.*****
