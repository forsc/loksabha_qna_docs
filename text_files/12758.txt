As per the budget announcement 2017-18, 1.5 lakh Health Sub Centres and Primary Health Centres are being transformed into Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) for provision of comprehensive primary care that includes preventive and health promotion at the community level with continuum of care approach across the country for all population including tribals.The Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs) aim to provide an expanded range of services to include care for non - communicable diseases, palliative and rehabilitative care, Oral, Eye and ENT care, mental health and first level care for emergencies and trauma as well as Health promotion and wellness activities like Yoga apart from services already being provided for Maternal and Child Health including immunization and communicable diseases.Ministry of Women and Child Development is also implementing a number of schemes such as Anganwadi Services under which six services i.e. Supplementary Nutrition, Pre-school Education, Health & Nutrition Education, Immunization, Health Check-up and Referral Services are provided at the AWCs; Pradhan Mantri MatruVandanaYojana (PMMVY) under which cash incentives are given to the pregnant women for first child birth; Scheme for Adolescent Girls under which nutritional support is provided to the  11-14 years out of school Adolescent Girls, etc., for improving the health conditions of women and children including those in the tribal areas.Ministry of Tribal Affairs has introduced a scheme of Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRSs) to impart quality education exclusively to ST children with an objective to provide quality middle and high-level education to Scheduled Tribes (ST) students in remote areas in order to enable them to avail of reservation in high and professional educational courses and get jobs in Government, Public and Private sectors.Construction of separate hostels for girls and boys is an integral part of the scheme of EMRS.
