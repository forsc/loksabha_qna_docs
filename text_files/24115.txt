ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) & (b): Government of India is committed to empower Higher Educational Institution to help them become world class teaching and research institutions. In this context, Institutions of Eminence (IoE) scheme was launched in the year 2017 under which 10 Public and 10 Private institutions were to be declared as IoEs, out of which 12 institutions (8 public and 4 private) have been declared as IoEs so far. The objective of the scheme is to enable them to achieve rankings within top 500 in any of the world renowned ranking frameworks. Government Institutions will get financial assistance of 1000 crores over a period of five years in addition to the grant already being received. In the recently released QS Ranking 2022, there are 35 Indian institutions this year compared to 29 last year. Further, 6 Indian institutions featured in top 300 compared to 4 last year. Ministry has also launched Study in India Programme in 2018 with the aim of attracting foreign students to Indian higher educational institutions (HEIs). Though students from all over the world can apply under this flagship programme, the focus is on 45 target countries across South-East Asia, Middle East and Africa. 7500 plus foreign students have taken admission under Study in India Programme till date. The Ministry has also launched (in 2018) a Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC), which aims at improving the research ecosystem of India’s higher educational institutions, under which foreign students and faculty members are given adequate incentives for their participation in the joint research project, etc.(b)(c) (c) The data of foreign students enrolled in Indian Universities is not centrally maintained.*****
