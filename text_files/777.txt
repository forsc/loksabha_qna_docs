ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a): The all India raw coal production has increased from 565.77 Million Tonnes (MT) in 2013-14 to 730.35 MT (Provisional) in 2018-19. This  is absolute increase of 164.58 MT in coal production in this period as compared to the increase of 73.01 MT between 2008-09 and 2013-14. As on 19.06.2019, the vendible coal stock with Coal India Limited (CIL) was 39.36 MT.    (b).  The opening of coal mines is a continuous activity which is undertaken regularly to meet the increasing demand of coal in the economy. CIL and its subsidiaries have planned upcoming greenfield projects as under:Sl.

Further, directions have been issued to the Nominated Authority for allocation of 26 more coal mines. (c) to (e):  There is a gap between demand and domestic supply of coal as there is limited availability of indigenous coking coal and there are power plant that are designed on imported coal which continue to import coal for power generation.  For 2019-20, Ministry of Power has projected annual domestic coal requirement of 530 MT from CIL, 54 MT from Singareni Collieries Company Limited and 50 MT from Captive mines. Due to enhanced domestic coal supply to power plants, coal import by power plants has reduced from 80.71 MT in 2015-16 to 61.66 MT in 2018-19. ***
