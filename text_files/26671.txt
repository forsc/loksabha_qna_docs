                                                                                                     ANSWER                       MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT                                   (SHRI FAGGAN SINGH KULASTE) (a) to (f)	Department of Land Resources has sanctioned, 8214 watershed development projects in 576 districts (including 72 districts of Uttar Pradesh) covering an area of about 39.07 million hectare  in 28 States (except Goa)  [now 27 States and UTs of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh) during the period 2009-10 to 2014-15 under erstwhile Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP). Subsequently IWMP was amalgamated as a Watershed Development Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (WDC-PMKSY) in 2015-16. A total number of 1832 projects (345 uninitiated and 1487 in preparatory stage) were transferred to various States in 2018 to implement them from their own budget. Therefore, DoLR has been implementing 6382 projects.  The activities being undertaken through the watershed development projects inter alia include ridge area treatment, drainage line treatment, soil and moisture conservation, rain water harvesting, nursery raising, afforestation, horticulture, pasture development, livelihoods for assetless persons, etc.Administrative and technical constraints are occasionally observed in the implementation of watershed development projects and these are appropriately addressed on continuing basis.  The strategies adopted to overcome the challenges are (i) optimal utilization of available resources, (ii) convergence and (iii) prioritization, as well as (i) accountability and (ii) real-time monitoring.State/ UT-wise details of number of watershed projects that have been sanctioned, funded by Department of Land Resources and Central share released during the last three years and the current year (upto 30.06.2021) are given in Annexure I. Under WDC-PMKSY, as per information received from the States/UTs, since 2014-15 to 2021-22 (upto Q1, 2021-22), about 7.53 lakh water harvesting structures have been created / rejuvenated. An additional area of about 16.07 lakh ha has been brought under protective irrigation. The number of farmers benefited is about 34.64 lakh during the said period. State/ UT-wise details are given in Annexure II.                                                *****
