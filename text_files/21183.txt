                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) to (c):  Under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), the coverage of beneficiaries for receiving subsidized foodgrains through Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) has been de-linked from the erstwhile poverty estimates and has been linked to the population estimates under two categories namely Antyodaya Ann Yojana (AAY) and Priority Households (PHH) only. As such no BPL cards are issued under NFSA. ………..2/--2-Further, under technology driven TPDS reforms and end-to-end computerization of TPDS operations including digitization of ration cards/beneficiaries data, Aadhaar seeding of ration cards are enabling the States/UTs to curb the menace of fake/bogus ration cards. (d) & (e): 	The NFSA provides coverage of up to 75% rural population and up to 50% urban population for receiving highly subsidized foodgrains through TPDS. Accordingly, all States/UTs, are issuing AAY and PHH ration cards to eligible persons/ households under NFSA up to the extent of respective ceiling limit of population under NFSA, including Madhya Pradesh having a ceiling limit of up to 5.46 Crore persons and at presently about 4.7 Crore beneficiaries (persons) have been covered in the State including 11.6 Lakh beneficiaries in Bhopal. Further, the addition and deletion of ration cards under NFSA is an ongoing process, all States/UTs (including Madhya Pradesh) are regularly issuing new ration cards to the genuinely eligible persons/ households under NFSA. Further, this Department had advised all States/UTs, including Madhya Pradesh to identify all eligible and poor persons/households including vulnerable sections of the society for inclusion under NFSA up to the given ceiling limit of coverage of persons under the Act. ****
