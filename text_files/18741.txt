                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)......2/--2-(a):	It is the duty of the Government, primarily through the Food Corporation of India (FCI) functioning under the Food Corporation of India Act, 1964, to undertake purchase, storage, movement, transportation, distribution and sale of foodgrains.  These functions necessitate setting up of storage facilities in different parts of the country particularly in the Procuring and Consuming States.		Storage plan of FCI is to meet the storage requirement for holding operational and buffer stocks and also to meet the requirements of  Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) / National Food Security Act (NFSA) and Schemes undertaken by the Government of India which requires distribution of foodgrains.	Adequate scientific storage is pre-requisite to fulfill the policy objectives assigned to the Food Corporation of India.	FCI has twofold strategy to meet its storage capacity objectives.  Firstly by construction of its own godowns at the most strategic locations well connected with rail/road network and operationally viable for which the budgetary plan funds are provided by the Govt. of India in its Five Year Plan.  Secondly, if the circumstances so warrant, FCI also hires covered capacities from various agencies for temporary storage of wheat/paddy in the procuring/consuming State to meet the storage crunch due to increased procurement from agencies like State Government / Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) / State Warehousing Corporations (SWCs).(b):	The details of foodgrains stored in the country during the last three years, State-wise including Uttrakhand are at Annexure-I	Foodgrains stored in the districts of Bundelkhand region during the last three years as given below:-(Fig. in MT)District	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20Chhatapur	9916	9916	11313Newari	13940	19279	20568Tikamgarh	14342	17534	17839Banda	38310.486	37048.65	21752.50Chitrakoot	2419.251	1741.348	0Mahoba	25115.121	16957.72	15951.42Hamirpur	7648.066	17975.19	14072.15Jhansi	32006.736	7375.68	35622.29Jalaun	33809.552	39716.83	40622.31Lalitpur	68905.668	4720.96	26805.48Total	246412.88	172265.37	204546.15........3/--3-(c)&(d):	Yes, Sir. The Government has collaborated with private sector to meet the requirement of storage space for foodgrain under following schemes :-1-	Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) Scheme2-	CAP Hiring Scheme 20193-	Construction of SILOS 1-	Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) SchemeGovernment of India has formulated a scheme called Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) Scheme for construction of covered storage capacity.  Under this Scheme, storage capacity is created by private parties, CWC, SWCs and other State Agencies for guaranteed hiring by FCI. Under this scheme, a  capacity of 144.05 lakh MT has already been completed as on 31.12.2020.2-	CAP Hiring Scheme 2019Government of India approved a Scheme for construction of Cover & Plinth (CAP) as temporary storage facilities on the lines of PEG Scheme in major procuring regions viz. Punjab, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh & Uttar Pradesh for guarantee hiring by FCI for three years to accommodate the Wheat stocks in 2019. Under this scheme a capacity of 16.13 LMT has been constructed.3- Construction of SILOS   Steel Silo storage with bulk handling facility is highly efficient, mechanized and modernized way of storing foodgrains in bulk.        Accordingly, in order to upgrade and modernize the storage facilities, Government of India has chalked out an Action Plan for construction of steel silos on Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode in the country. As on 31.12.2020,  a capacity of 8.25 LMT has already been completed.  In addition, a capacity of 5.5 LMT has been created under circuit base model in 2007.(e) & (f):	The Government expenditure incurred on storage is likely to be reduced due to collaboration with private sector as the competitive rates are received through e-tendering which is transparent and based on market economics.  On an average the storage charges being paid under PEG (Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee) is Rs.5.70 per quintal per month whereas Government fixed rates being payable to CWCs/SWCs is Rs.10.78 per quintal per month (for the year 2018-19).(g):	Measures taken by FCI to check wastage of foodgrains during storage is at Annexure-II.(h):	The Detail of Rent paid by FCI during the last three years are as below –(Rs. in crore)2017-18	2018-19	2019-202,345.42	2,413.78	2,825.74State wise detail is at Annexure–III.***Annexure-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (b) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.184 FOR ANSWER ON 02.02.2021 IN THE LOK SABHA.State-wise details of foodgrains (Rice + Wheat) stored in the country during the last three years:Region	Total Central pool stock 01.04.2018	Total Central pool stock 01.04.2019	Total Central pool stock 01.04.2020?????
