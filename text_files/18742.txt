ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)     The salient features of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) are detailed at Annexure-I. Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is a demand driven wage employment scheme. Hence no State/UT-wise allocation of funds is made.  Fund release to the States/UTs including Maharastra, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Tamilnadu is a continuous process. Central Government is committed to making funds available keeping in view the demand for work. States/UTs-wise details of central funds released and total expenditure, including for the States of Maharastra, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Tamilnadu, during the last three years and the current FY 2020-21 (as on 28.01.2021) under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is given at Annexure-II. (b)      As per information uploaded by the States/UTs including Tamil Nadu in the State/UT-wise number of persons demanded Employment, number of persons registered and number of persons provided employment during the last three years and the current FY 2020-21 (as on 28.01.2021) under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is given at Annexure-III. Mahatma Gandhi NREGA proved to be a major support to the returning migrant workers during COVID-19 Pandemic mitigating the adverse of effects thereof. During the financial year, more than 1.57 crore new job cards have been issued. A rural household, adult members of which agree to unskilled manual work, is entitled for hundred days of wage employment. During FY 2020-21 (as on 31.12.2020), more than 292.62 crore person-days have been generated, which is approximately 47% more than the employment generated during the same period in FY 2019-20. The agreed-to labour budget of 366 crore (as on 31.12.2020) for the current financial year is the highest ever allocation under the programme.  The Central Government, with active support of the State Governments, has so far been able to meet the demands of works with adequate funding. During current financial year, as on 28.01.2021, the Ministry has released Rs. 89231.53 crore to the States & UTs for implementation of Scheme and a total of 314.75 crore Persondays have been generated so far against revised approved Labour Budget 336.04 crore Persondays.  (c)      The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS), is a demand driven wage employment programme. A rural household, adult members of which agree to unskilled manual work, is entitled for hundred days of wage employment. Total number of person worked during the current FY 2020-21 (so far) is 10.28 crore which is 30% more than that of the FY 2019-20. Hence no State/UT-wise allocation of funds is made. Fund release to the States/UTs is a continuous process. Central Government is committed to making funds available keeping in view the demand for work. There was a budget allocation of Rs.61,500 crore at BE for Mahatma Gandhi NREGA and Ministry of Finance has now allocated Rs. 1,11,500 crore at RE during 2020-21.  (d) & (e)    In addition to the prescribed benefits under the Mahatma Gandhi NREGS, the Ministry has also mandated the provision of additional 50 days of wage employment to every ST household in a forest area, provided that these households have no other private property except for the land rights provided under the Forest Rights Act, 2006. Further, as per Para 5 of Schedule I of the Act provides that “Works creating individual assets shall be prioritized on land or homestead owned by households belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled tribes. The participation of SC/ STs Population under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA during the last three years and current FY 2020-21 (as on 28.01.2021) are as under:Indicator	                              2017-18	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21*STs person-days % as of total person-days	17.49	17.42	18.41	17.82SCs personday % as of total persondays	        21.56	20.77	19.97	19.84*as on 28.01.2021 It has been decided to make special budgetary provision for SC&ST workers'' wage payment with effect from FY 2021-22. No specific case of violation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS Guidelines related to backward classes people has come to the notice. As the responsibility of implementation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is vested with the State Governments/UTs. Whenever any complaint relating to Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is received in the Ministry, the same is forwarded to the concerned State Governments/UTs for taking appropriate and expeditious action as per the provision of Mahatma Gandhi NREGA. *****
