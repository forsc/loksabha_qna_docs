The CDSCO has not received any report of shortage of stocks at present with the manufacturers.(d):      Central Government has issued notification vide S.O. 2450(E) dated 27.07.2020 which is valid for 6 months providing that if a Registration Certificate holder makes an application for a fresh import registration certificate before the expiry of the existing certificate, the existing registration certificate shall be valid until orders are passed on the application & shall be deemed to be valid for all purposes. With a view to attain self-reliance and reduce import dependence in APIs/ Bulk drugs, the government has rolled out two schemes viz. (i) “Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for promotion of domestic manufacturing of critical Key Starting Materials (KSMs)/ Drug Intermediates (DIs) and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) In India” and (ii) "Promotion of Bulk Drug Parks". The scheme guidelines were issued on 27th July, 2020.xxxxx
