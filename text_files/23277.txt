                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TOURISM (INDEPENDENT CHARGE)(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) to (d):	The Ministry of Tourism has recognized Adventure Tourism, as a “Niche” tourism product in order to promote India as a 365 days’ destination and attract tourists with specific interest.   The Ministry has issued guidelines for the approval of Adventure Tour Operators, open to all bona-fide Adventure Tour Operators. A Task Force on Adventure Tourism has been set up to act as a forum for resolving issues related to development and promotion of Adventure Tourism in the country.   	The Ministry of Tourism has formulated ‘Indian Adventure Tourism Guidelines’ (Version 2.0) on Safety and Quality Norms on Adventure Tourism as Basic Minimum Standards for Adventure Tourism Activities covering 31 verticals involving land, air and water in respect of adventure tourism activities. These Guidelines have been forwarded to the State Governments and Union Territory Administrations for compliance. The Central Financial Assistance is being extended to various State Governments / Union Territory Administrations for development of Tourism Infrastructure in destinations including Adventure Tourism destinations.  Central Government has opened 340 Mountain Peaks  located in the 4 states viz. Uttarakhand (106 Peaks), Sikkim (10 Peaks), Jammu & Kashmir (133 Peaks), & Himachal Pradesh (91 Peaks) for mountaineering/trekking expeditions.  Ministry of Tourism promotes India as a holistic destination under the Incredible India brand-line. As part of its on-going activities, the Ministry releases print, electronic, online and outdoor media campaigns in the international and domestic markets, to promote various tourism destinations and products of the country. Promotions are also undertaken through the website and Social Media accounts of the Ministry. In addition, the Indiatourism Offices in India and overseas disseminate information and undertake various promotional activities with the objective of showcasing the varied tourist destinations and products of the country. Identification & development of tourist places/centres etc. is primarily the responsibility of the concerned State Government / Union Territory Administration. Ministry of Tourism had launched the Swadesh Darshan Scheme in 2014-15 for integrated development of theme based tourist circuits in the country. Under the scheme 15 thematic circuits have been identified for development. The projects under the scheme are identified for development in consultation with the State Government/UT and are sanctioned subject to availability of funds, submission of suitable Detailed Project Reports, adherence to scheme guidelines and utilization of funds released earlier.      Since its launch in January 2015 the Ministry as on date has sanctioned 76 projects worth projects for Rs.5667.39 Crores to 30 States and UTs covering the thematic circuits under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme.          A list of projects with Adventure Tourism components sanctioned under Swadesh Darshan Schemes since 2014-15 is Annexed.*******
