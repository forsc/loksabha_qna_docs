ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; AND MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING(SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR):(a) & (b): The Department of Audit and Accounts under the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) carried out a check of records maintained by National Film Archive of India (NFAI), Pune in 2017 and noted that out of about 1,32,000 film reels/cans available in NFAI, bar code stickers were pasted only on 100377 film reels/cans. Here it is clarified that bar code stickers were pasted only on those reels/cans, which were clear from all technical aspects. Remaining reels/cans have been identified for removal of technical deficiencies. So no reel/cans have been lost or destroyed.(c) & (d): After review of functioning of three erstwhile media units under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, viz. Directorate of Advertising and Visual Publicity (DAVP), Directorate of Field Publicity (DFP) and Song & Drama Division (Sⅅ), it has been decided on 08.12.2017 to merge them into a single entity, i.e. Bureau of Outreach and Communication (BOC) in order to achieve synergy and coordinated approach among these units for effective communication. Two Expert Committees under the Chairmanship of Shri Bimal Julka, Information Commissioner (former Secretary of Ministry of Information and Broadcasting) have been constituted on 14.11.2018 to review the functioning of Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute (SRFTI), Kolkata, Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Pune and Children’s Film Society of India (CFSI), Mumbai and  on 29.01.2019 to form broad-based opinion on the matter of Rationalization/Closure/Merger of Film Media Units under the aegis of Ministry of Information & Broadcasting namely National Film Development Corporation (NFDC), Children’s Film Society of India (CFSI), Films Division (FD), National Film Archive of India (NFAI) and Directorate of Film Festivals (DFF). Copies of the OM’s dated 14.11.2018 and 29.01.2019 are at Annexure-I and Annexure-II.***
