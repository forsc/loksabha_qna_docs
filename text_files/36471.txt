FSSAI has extended financial support to States/UTs under a Central Sector Scheme for strengthening of food testing infrastructure.FSSAI has regularly urged States/UTs to carry out targeted enforcement and surveillance drive to check adulteration in food products.FSSAI has developed State Food Safety Index to measure the performance of States on five significant parameters of Food Safety: namely; Human Resource and Institutional Data, Compliance, Food Testing Infrastructure & Surveillance, Training and Capacity Building and Consumer Empowerment and to inculcate competitive spirit to improve the food safety ecosystem in the State/UT. Regular interaction is held with States/UTs through quarterly meetings of Central Advisory Committee to review the performance of the States/UTs.Based on information made available by the States/UTs, details of total samples of food analysed, found non- conforming, and action taken during 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 is as below:Year	No. of Samples Analysed	No. of Samples found non-conforming	Action taken - Civil Cases 	Action taken - Criminal Cases			 No. of Cases launched	No. of Cases decided 	No. of Convictions	 No. of Cases Launched	No. of Cases decided 	No. of Convictions2019-20	118775	29589	27412	18192	17345	4681	828	7802020-21	107829	28347	24195	15878	14817	3869	520	506……………………
