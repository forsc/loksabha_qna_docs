ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a):  Yes, Sir. Government has received representations regarding increasing service of Air India and other airlines in the country and particularly from Gaya airport.;(b): Air India flight AI-433 has been temporarily discontinued from 4th July, 2019 to 4th August 2019 and from 17th August, 2019 to 15th September, 2019 due to Haj  operations, 2019.;(c):  With repeal of Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation was totally deregulated. Airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type, free to select whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate. In this regard, Government has laid down Route Dispersal Guidelines (RDG) with a view to achieve better transport services taking into account the need for air transport services of different regions of the Country. It is, however, up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability. As such, the airlines are free to operate anywhere in the Country subject to compliance of RDG issues by Government.However, Government has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) to facilitate/stimulate regional air connectivity by making it affordable. RCS-UDAN is a market driven mechanism.  Development of regional air connectivity routes is left to the market forces and the airlines who undertake assessment of demand and match it to the supply required on particular routes based on their assessments.
