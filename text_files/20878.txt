ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a): Yes Sir. (b): As per National Education Policy 2020, implementation of the Policy requires multiple initiatives and actions, which will have to be taken by multiple bodies in a synchronized and systematic manner. Therefore, the implementation of this Policy will be led by various bodies including Ministry of Education, CABE, Union and State Governments, education-related Ministries, State Departments of Education, Boards, NTA, the regulatory bodies of school and higher education, NCERT, SCERTs, schools, and HEIs. NEP mentions about various timelines for important themes/subsets. The policy provides different timelines as well as principles and methodology for its implementation. Accordingly, this Ministry has communicated to all States/UT Governments for taking steps for implementation of NEP 2020 in letter and spirit. Moreover, Ministry and other implementing agencies under its purview have started taking initiatives towards implementation of NEP 2020.(c): NEP 2020 states that school and higher education system shall have exposure to vocational education. It is envisaged in the Policy that vocational education will be integrated in the educational offerings of all secondary schools in a phased manner over the next decade. Towards this, secondary schools will also collaborate with ITIs, polytechnics, local industry, etc. All students will participate in a 10-day bagless period sometime during Grades 6-8 where they intern with local vocational experts. Similar internship opportunities to learn vocational subjects may be made available to students throughout Grades 6-12, including holiday periods. As part of a holistic education, students at all HEIs will be provided with opportunities for internships with local industry, businesses, artists, crafts persons, etc., as well as research internships with faculty and researchers at their own or other HEIs/research institutions, so that students may actively engage with the practical side of their learning and, as a by-product, further improve their employability.*******
