ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS[SHRI KIREN RIJIJU](a) to (c) As provided under the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) Constitution, the Commonwealth Games sports programme consists of ‘compulsory’ and ‘optional’ sports. Shooting is not a compulsory sport under the CGF Constitution and was also not included in the original bid for the games that was accepted by the CGF in December 2017.As an affiliated member of the CGF, Indian Olympic Association (IOA) oversees the matters relating to participation of Indian athletes / teams participating in the Commonwealth Games. However, the Government has also constantly taken up the issue of inclusion of the ‘Shooting’ in the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games with the CGF, Organizing Committee of Birmingham Commonwealth Games2022 as also with the concerned authority in UK Government. A comprehensive review of the sports programme was carried out by the Birmingham 2022 Organizing Committee and its host partners considering the financial considerations; the availability of suitable venues; the potential for additional revenue streams from ticket sales and/or sponsorship; as well as alignment with the Commonwealth Games Federation Constitution and with the objectives of Games Partners. However, consensus was not reached for inclusion / holding of Shooting events in Birmingham.This matter has again been deliberated at length with the President of CGF during her India visit in November 2019 to find out some solution. Subsequently, IOA has alternatively proposed CGF for holding of ‘Shooting’ and ‘Archery’ events in India in advance of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games with the legitimacy of medals of these events as part of the final tally for the XXII edition of the Commonwealth Games. The Government has given its in-principle approval to the IOA’s proposal. CGF in its media release dated 28.02.2020 has stated that Commonwealth Archery and Shooting Championships will be held in Chandigarh in January 2022 and one week following the closing ceremony of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games, the CGF shall issue a medal table that will include results from the Chandigarh 2022 Commonwealth Archery and Shooting Championships, as a further and final legitimate ranking of competing nations and territories from the respective competitions.(d) No Sir.(e) Does not arise.****
