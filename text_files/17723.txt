                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c): 	With a view to provide financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of unforeseen event and to stabilize the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in agriculture, Government has introduced Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) in the country from Kharif 2016 season.  27 States/Union Territories (UTs) have implemented the scheme in one of more seasons.  As per provisions of the scheme actuarial/bidded premium rates are charged by the insurance company.  However, farmers have to pay maximum 2% for Kharif crops, 1.5% for Rabi Crop and 5% for annual commercial/horticultural crops and the balance of actuarial/bidded premium is shared by the Central and State Government on 50 : 50 basis. However, this sharing has been changed to 90 : 10 for North Eastern States from Kharif 2020 season.  Banks are collecting farmers share of premium for enrolment under PMFBY and fixed charges of 4% of farmers premium are paid as service charges to them by insurance companiesSome States like Bihar, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Jharkhand have opted out of the scheme and started their own assistance schemes in place of insurance scheme.   Government is regularly monitoring the implementation of PMFBY through one to one/weekly meetings with States and insurance companies and weekly video conference with all stakeholders.  Keeping in view the experience of implementation of PMFBY in 4 years and after detailed discussions with stakeholders, Government has recently approved the revamping of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS) and made several changes in it for implementation from Kharif 2020 season. Changes/improvements made in the provisions/parameters of these schemes are given in Annexure.
