ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE					(SHRI SHRIPAD NAIK)IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE   (a) & (b):  Army Recruitment Office (ARO) Jodhpur is under Zonal Recruitment Office (ZRO), Jaipur only.  Nagaur District has been transferred from ARO, Jaipur to ARO Jodhpur.  Recruitment Office, Jaipur had been screening the candidates from Nagaur, Jaipur, Sikar and Tonk Districts.  However, due to heavy footfall from these districts and administrative reasons, Nagaur District has been transferred to ARO, Jodhpur with effect from 2019.(c) to (e):  Recruiting Organizations conduct recruitment rallies for Indian Army with an endeavor to cover each District of the country at least once in a year.  The location of rally does not have any material effect on number of persons recruited from a particular location since all eligible candidates can apply online on the Recruiting Directorate Website (www.joinindianarmy.nic.in) .  Large number of candidates from Nagaur district, participated in the recruitment rally conducted by ARO Jodhpur at Udaipur in February, 2021.  Hence, there is no impact on recruitment from Nagaur district.	Recruitment rally has been planned at Nagaur in the month of October, 2021.*****
