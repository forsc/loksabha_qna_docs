ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	The Ministry along with the States/UTs has been making concerted efforts for improving the timely payment of wages. The Ministry has issued Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) on timely payment process for direct payment into the account of beneficiaries. States/ UTs have been advised to generate pay orders in time. This has resulted in considerable improvement in the status of timely generation of pay order leading to improvement in actual time taken to credit wages in the workers account. During the current Financial Year 2019-20 (as on 27.11.2019), around 97% pay orders have been generated within 15 days from the date of closure of the Muster Roll.(b):	No, Sir.(c) & (d):	The Ministry is not aware about any such study conducted by Mahatma Gandhi NREGS Sangharsh Morcha. The fund release for implementation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGA to States/UTs is a continuous process and Central Government is making funds available keeping in view the demand.
