ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c): Yes, Sir. Ministry of Tribal Affairs in collaboration with United Nations Development Programme has taken up ''1000 Springs Initiative'' as a localized innovative solution by harnessing the potential of perennial springs to meet the water needs of the remote tribal communities . It is envisaged to upscale 1000 Spring Initiative  to other tribal regions. 408 springs across 77 habitations/villages in 8 districts (Ganjam, Gajapati, Jajpur, Kalahandi, Kandhmal, Keonjhar, Mayurbhanj, Rayagada) of Odisha have been mapped to create an online Spring Atlas thespringsportal.org. Further, a project has been sanctioned to Government of Odisha under the scheme ''Support to Tribal Research Institute'' for mapping the springs in the districts of Odisha aims to benefit all tribal communities residing therein, particularly the PVTGs as mentioned below:  S.No.	Name of TSP Districts with LGD Code	Number of TSP Block	No. of Villages1	Mayurbhanj (LGD: 365)	26	53832	Sundargarh (LGD: 373)	17	36233	Koraput (LGD: 363)	14	29734	Malkangiri (LGD: 364)	7	15095	Rayagada (LGD: 370)	11	2202Total	5	75	15690  This GIS online inventory is helpful in locating springs, analyzing their health status, quality of water, discharge capacity and other physical, chemical and biological properties and filling the crucial information gap to develop a national map of springs and build capacities of communities and other stakeholders in protection, preservation and management of the springs for sustainability of the resource, Community led Spring-based water infrastructure has been demonstrated through convergence with MGNREGA to provide safe and adequate water for drinking, domestic and livelihood. (d) & (e) Extesion of the measure to State of Andhra Pradehs and Jharkhand will be considered on receipt of any such proposal from the respective State Government under the scheme of ''Support to TRIs''. *****
