STATEMENTSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY OF PARTS (a) TO (d) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 268 FOR ANSWER ON 16.12.2021 REGARDING “PANAJI SMART CITY PROJECT”.(a)  to (d): Government of India launched the Smart Cities Mission (SCM) on 25 June 2015. 100 Smart cities have been selected through 4 rounds of competition from January 2016 to June 2018.  Panaji was selected for development as a Smart City in the Fast-Track Round in May 2016. As on 12 November 2021, Rs. 196 crore has been released for Panaji Smart City, out of which the city has already utilized Rs. 115.83 crore.  Status of Smart City projects of Panaji is given below:(Amount in Rs. crore)DPR Stage	Tender Stage	Work Order Stage	Work Completed	Total Projects	Total AmountNo. of Projects	Amount	No. of Projects	Amount	No. of Projects	Amount	No. of Projects	Amount		7	100.66	12	313.11	8	339.41	10	16.15	37	769.33(Source: Geo-Spatial Management Information System,  as on 12 November, 2021)The objective of SCM is to promote cities that provide core infrastructure and give a decent quality of life to its citizens, a clean and sustainable environment through application of ‘Smart’ solutions. Implementation of SCM at the city level is done by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) created for the purpose. Smart City Proposal (SCP) of each city has been prepared through extensive citizen engagement. Since needs and aspirations of citizens in different cities are different, the priorities and projects contained in such SCPs vary from city to city. Panaji Smart City is not only implementing projects related to beautification/walkability but also those related to Urban Transport, Safety & Security, Energy, Sewerage & Septage, Information Technology, Digitalization and Smart Solutions etc. Projects such as Beautification of the Beach front Promenade at Miramar, Upgradation of Pedestrian Walkways in Panaji City Phase-I -Heritage route from Old Patto Bridge to Church Square, Development of Pedestrian Spine and Revitalization of Patto Area, Development of walkway along Central Library side of the Creek, Development of Altinho Steps near Portuguese & Church Square, Beautification and Upgradation of Azad Maidan Square and Extension of Mandovi River Promenade on either sides to create a continuous Pedestrian Spine from Miramar Beach to ESG Building are being developed keeping in view promotion of tourism in the State. Projects such as Upgradation of Patto Sewage Treatment Plant, 24X7 Water Supply with SCADA for Panaji City, Flood Mitigation Measures and Construction of Flood Water Pumping Station at Mala, Upgradation of Solid Waste Management Infrastructure, Rejuvenation of St. Inez Nallah, Procurement of equipments for operation and maintenance of sewerage network and waste management will impact health of citizens positively. Goa Intelligent City Management System, being developed as the brain and nervous system for the city, has features such as City Surveillance, Environmental Monitoring, Intelligent Traffic Management and City Wifi etc. that would, inter alia, help in improving health conditions and managing tourism operations in the City.                                               ***
