ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (a) to (c) As per extant guidelines dated 18.5.2017 on rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has granted general permission to Domestic Scheduled Commercial banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks), to open banking outlets at any place in the country, without seeking prior approval of RBI in each case, subject to at least 25% of the total number of banking outlets [a fixed-point service delivery unit, manned either by bank’s staff or its Business Correspondent (BC)] opened during a financial year in unbanked rural centres i.e. centres having population less than 10,000 (Tier 5 and Tier 6 centres). Further, to ensure availability of banking outlet (Bank branch/Business Correspondent), within 5 kilometers of all inhabited villages, the Government has launched a Geographic Information System (GIS) based app., namely, Jan DhanDarshak App (JDD App) developed by National Informatics Centre (NIC). Banks upload the GIS location of their branches, Business Correspondents (BCs) and Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) on the app. As per data uploaded by the banks on JDD App as on 31.7.2021, out of the 5.538 lakh mapped villages on the app, 5.535 lakh (99.95%) villages are having a banking outlet (branch or BC) within 5 kilometers distance.In addition to above, the requirement of new banking outlets, as received from time to time, is discussed in meetings of the concerned District Level Consultative Committee (DLCC)/ State Level Banker’s Committee (SLBC) and based on the recommendations made, new outlets are opened by different banks.District-wise details of branches of Public Sector Banks in Assam including Karimganj as on 31.3.2021 is Annexed. As informed by SLBC Assam, presently, the location is well served by Punjab National Bank branch at Anipur which is within 3 KM from Kazirbazar. Further, the centre is also served by one Customer Service Point (CSP) of State Bank of India. As informed by SLBC Bihar, 13 Bank Branches (06 Branches of commercial Banks & 07 Branches of Regional Rural Bank) and 38 Customer Service Points (CSPs) are operational in Karpi Block of Arwal district in Bihar.Representations from public representatives, as and when received, are forwarded to concerned State Level Banker’s Committees (SLBCs). In pursuance of RBI guidelines, rolling out of banking outlets in uncovered areas is a continuous process and looked after by State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC) in consultation with the concerned State Government, member banks and other stakeholders. Banks consider proposals for opening banking outlets in the light of RBI’s instructions, their business plans and their commercial viability. To further assess the viability for opening a banking outlet, banks carry out survey as required.*****
