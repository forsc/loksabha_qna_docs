Water being a State subject, water management is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments. Supplementing the efforts of the State Governments, and also for nation-wide reforms in the management of water resources, following steps have been taken by the Central Government:i.	The National Water Policy (2012) has been formulated and circulated to the States/UTs, which recommends that water needs to be managed as a common pool community resources held by the State, under public trust doctrine to achieve food security, support livelihood and ensure equitable and sustainable development for all. ii.	Central Government has launched the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojna (PMKSY) by amalgamating ongoing schemes of different Ministries with the vision of extending the coverage of irrigation and improving water use efficiency in a focused manner with end to end solution on source creation, distribution, management, field application and extension activities.iii.	Central Government has prioritized 99 ongoing major/medium irrigation projects for   mission-mode completion for the creation of irrigation potential of 76 lakh hectares.  Command area development works in the balance cultivable command area of about 43 lakh hectares have also been taken up in these projects.Contd…P/2//2//iv.	Central Government has formulated a National 	Perspective Plan (NPP) which envisages transfer of water from water surplus basins to water deficit basins to improve availability of water.v.	Central Government has launched the National Water Mission with the objective of conservation of water, minimizing wastage and ensuring its equitable distribution both across and within States through integrated water resources development and management.vi.	Central Government is implementing a nation-wide programme of National Aquifer Mapping and Management (NAQUIM) with a view to facilitate sustainable development of ground water resources. Artificial recharge and rain water harvesting are being implemented under various schemes of the Union Government. Aquifer rejuvenation is also being attempted in select over-exploited blocks on pilot basis.vii. 	Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has been constituted under the Environment (Protection) Act-1986, for the purpose of regulation and control of ground water development and management in the country.  CGWA also grants “No Objection Certificates” for ground water abstraction to industries, infrastructure units and mining projects in feasible areas with mandatory conditions for conservation, augmentation and efficient use of ground water.(b)  Government of India is implementing the scheme of Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of water bodies under Har Khet Ko Pani component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY). The details of Central Assistance (CA) released under RRR Scheme and particularly in Tamil Nadu during last 3 years are as below: (All figures in Rs crore)	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19 Total CA under RRR of water bodies scheme	0.0	79.649	24.795 CA to Tamil Nadu under RRR scheme	0.0	0	7.0279*****
