ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) & (b): The financial performance of Scheduled Indian Carriers for both Scheduled Domestic and Scheduled International services, as per information made available by the Scheduled Indian Carriers to Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is attached as Annexure.  (c): No, Sir. Each airline prepares its business plan on the basis of its own market assessment and the airline is responsible for its commercial operations.  The air fare is neither regulated nor established by the Government and the airlines are free to fix the reasonable tariff under the provision of Aircraft Rules, 1937 having regard to all relevant factors including the cost of operations, characteristic of service, reasonable profit and the generally prevailing tariff. Due to the outbreak of COVID 19, scheduled domestic operations were suspended w.e.f. 25.03.2020 which were subsequently resumed in a calibrated manner from 25.05.2020 with fare capping (lower and upper limit on different sector) and capacity cap to ensure that airlines do not charge excessive fare and the journey is performed only for essential purpose. The fare band serves the dual purpose of protecting the interests of the travelers as well as the airlines. ;(d): Does not arise in view of reply to part (c) above.
