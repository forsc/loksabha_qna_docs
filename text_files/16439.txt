Section 4 (5) of The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 states that save as otherwise provided, no member of a forest dwelling Scheduled Tribe or Other Traditional Forest Dwellers shall be evicted or removed from the Forest Land under his occupation till the recognition and verification procedure is complete. 	The Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, also provides that the Gram Sabha or the Panchayats at the appropriate level shall be consulted before making the acquisition of land in the Scheduled Areas or development projects and before resettling or rehabilitating persons affected by such projects in the Scheduled Areas; the actual planning and implementation of the projects in the Scheduled Areas shall be coordinated at the State Level. 	Constitutional provisions under Schedule -V also provide safeguards against displacement of tribal population because of land acquisitions etc.	Further, Land and its management fall under the legislative and administrative jurisdiction of states as provided under the Constitution of India (Seventh Schedule — List II (State List) — Entry No. (18). *****
