                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES (SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) & (b): Yes, Sir. Functioning of Mega Food Parks is closely monitored by the Ministry through a well-established mechanism as per the scheme guidelines. This includes detailed scrutiny of the progress reports received from the Special Purpose Vehicles(SPVs)/Implementing Agnecies(IAs), verification of the claims of SPVs/IAs by the Project Management Consultant (PMC) and Programme Management Agency (PMA), assessment of the progress through site visits by PMA and officers of Ministry, periodic review by Ministry through Inter-Ministerial Approval Committee (IMAC) headed by Hon’ble Minister for Food Processing Industries. The Ministry has set up a district level Mega Food Park Co-ordination Committee headed by District Collector in 2010 to resolve local issues which may arise during the implementation of the project. Ministry takes up issues with various concerned Departments/Agencies of the State Governments to expedite clearances and to remove the bottlenecks in implementation of projects.  State Governments have been involved in monitoring of the projects. Ministry has been requesting the State Governments to nominate an officer of a sufficiently senior level as Director on the Board of SPV for better monitoring and implementation of Mega Food Parks. (c):	 Does not arise. (d):	 There have been occasional complaints pertaining to the performance of Mega Food Park projects. Suitable corrective measures are taken by the Ministry in this regard.*****
