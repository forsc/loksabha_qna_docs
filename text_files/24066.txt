ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): Sirohi Airport in Rajasthan figures in the tentative list of Regional Connectivity Scheme (Scheme) airports of UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik) Document.  However, no airline has submitted bid for operation of RCS flight from Sirohi Airport so far.   In case, if any valid bid is received in future rounds of bidding under UDAN , the same shall be considered as per the provisions of Scheme Document. The Selected Airline Operators (SAOs) are obligated to commence RCS flight operations on a RCS-route, as part of individual route-proposal or a network proposal within a period of 180 days from the issuance of Letter of Award or within two months from the readiness of airport, whichever is later, unless any extension is granted by the Implementing Agency. 325 RCS routes have already operationalized connecting 49 RCS airports, 2 water aerodromes & 5 heliports so far. However, there is a delay in operationalizing some routes/discontinuation of the routes, for reasons which include:- i) Non-readiness of civil airports/heliports, which may be related to availability of land, creation of regional infrastructure, obtaining license from the Regulator etc. ii) Delay in obtaining Scheduled Commuter Operators Permit by new entrant Airlines. iii) Unsustainability of the operation on the awarded routes.The Ministry regularly interacts with the stakeholders from time to time with an aim to improve air connectivity and takes necessary steps for operationalization of RCS routes.
