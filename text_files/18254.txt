ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (d) : Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a joint venture of Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) under Ministry of Power, had concluded the procurement of 10,000 electric cars through an international competitive bidding process.These electric cars are given on lease/outright purchase basis to Government Departments, PSUs and others. As on date, 1,514 e-cars have been deployed in Government Departments, PSUs and others.Taking note of the launch of higher range e-cars over the last few months in India, EESL had procured 17 e-cars on a pilot basis in order to test their performance. Based on the performance feedback, procurement action for future requirement has been concluded through open competitive bidding. Accordingly, during the current financial year FY 2020-21, EESL has procured 250 higher range e-cars through an international competitive bidding process. The cost and manufacturer wise details are furnished at Annexure-I. All the e-vehicles procured by EESL have been procured from the manufacturers having their manufacturing plants in India. In future also, all procurements of e-vehicles by EESL will be done in accordance with Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India), Order. Further, under Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) Scheme, incentive is provided to those electric/ hybrid vehicles which are manufactured in the country. (e) : 		EESL aims to install 5,000 Public Charging Stations (PCS) across India in next 5 years. Towards this end, EESL has signed MoUs with multiple stakeholders across municipalities and DISCOMs for location assessment study and setting up of charging stations in their jurisdiction. 		The details of number of PCS installed and commissioned by EESL across India is furnished at Annexure-II. In addition, EESL has commissioned 488 (308 AC & 180 DC) captive chargers across all offices where EESL’s EVs have been delivered. (f) & (g) : 	The programme of procurement and  deployment of e-vehicles is being implemented by EESL with the objective to provide an impetus for domestic electric vehicle manufacturing and creation of charging infrastructure, through  efficiencies of scale. Further, in order to encourage domestic manufacture of charging infrastructure for Electric Vehicles, it has been proposed to include items for charging infrastructure for EVs in the comprehensive list of items which are being imported and suggesting replacement of those items under phased manufacturing in India through Manufacturing Hub.The Department of Heavy Industry (DHI) is administering FAME India Scheme since 1st April 2015 to promote adoption of electric/ hybrid vehicles (xEVs) in India. Phase-I of the Scheme was extended from time to time and the last such extension was allowed upto 31st March 2019. At present, Phase-II of FAME India Scheme is under implementation for a period of three years w.e.f. 1st April 2019. This phase focuses on supporting electrification of public and shared transportation and aims to support, through subsidies approximately 700 e-Buses, 5 lakhs e-3 Wheelers, 55000 e-4 Wheeler Passenger Cars and 10 lakh e-2 Wheelers. Further, Rs.1000 crore is allocated for creation of charging infrastructure.   *************
