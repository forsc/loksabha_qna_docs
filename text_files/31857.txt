ANSWER




 (a) to (d).   The State Governments/Union Territories(UTs) have notified their victim compensation schemes in terms of Section 357A of the Code for Criminal Procedure(Cr.PC). Further, in order to support and supplement the State Compensation Schemes,  Ministry of Home Affairs had released Rs 200 crores as a one time grant to State Governments/UTs under the Central Victim Compensation Fund from Nirbhaya Fund. States/UTs use the fund to compensate victims of various crimes, especially sexual offenses including rape, acid attacks, crime against children, human trafficking etc.Pursuant to the directions of Hon’ble Supreme Court in Writ Petition(C) No. 565/2012 (Nipun Saxena vs Union of India  and  others), National Legal Services Authority has  prepared compensation scheme for women victims/survivors of sexual assault/ other crimes and the same was circulated to all States/UTs.  (e).   The number of cases in which women (above 18 Years) and children (below 18 years) were trafficked in Jharkahand during the last three years  are as under: :2018	2019	2020Women (Above 18 years)	Children (Below 18 years)	Women (Above 18 years)	Children (Below 18 years	Women (Above 18 years)	Children (Below 18 years30	218	48	172	150	114 Cases registered in the districts of Jharkhand State under Human Trafficking are at Annexure. ''''Police'''' and ''''Public Order'''' are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule (List-II) to the Constitution of India and, therefore, the State Governments and Union Territory (UT) Administrations are responsible for prevention, detection, registration, investigation and prosecution of all crimes within their jurisdiction including trafficking in persons. State Governments/ UT administrations are competent to deal with such matters under extant provisions of law.******  Annexure Sl. No.	District Name	2018	2019	20201.	Bokaro	0	1	12.
