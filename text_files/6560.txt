PradhanMantriBhartiyaJanaushadhiPariyojana (PMBJP) has covered 689 districts out of 725 districts of the country.

In 2015, the scheme underwent a major revamp and it was decided to expand it and open 3000 retail outlets in the country. A franchisee like model was adopted, and an intensive media campaign was undertaken in national and regional newspapers inviting individual entrepreneurs to apply for establishing and running retail outlets. The applications received in response were scrutinized and eligible applicants were assisted in securing drug licenses and other infrastructure facilities to open the Kendras. Private participation was allowed in procurement as well as in sale of medicines. Before this, drugs were procured from PSUs only and the retail outlets were opened only by the State/Central Government at the Government premises and Government hospitals. (d) The product basket of PMBJP comprises 900 drugs and 154 surgical & consumables. (e) It was targeted to open 3000 Jan AushadhiKendras by end of FY 2019-20.

At present, the number of Jan AushadhiKendras has crossed 5700.  689 districts of the country are covered at present. The target is to cover all the districts of the country by end of FY 2019-20.  Further, total sales (at MRP) in the financial year 2018-19 were Rs 315.70 Crore, which led to an estimated savings of Rs 2000 Crore of common citizens. This scheme is also providing a good source of self-employment with sustainable and regular earnings. (f) As on 11.11.2019, the product basket of PMBJP comprises of 900 medicines and 154 surgicals and consumables.
