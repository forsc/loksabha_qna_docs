                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a): Jharkhand is a partial Decentralized Procurement System (DCP) State for paddy procurement since KMS 2016-17. Accordingly, procurement of paddy is carried out by FCI as well as State Government/Agencies in their respective clusters. ..........2/--2-The procurement policy of Government of India (GOI) is open ended, under which paddy and wheat offered by farmers within the stipulated period (conforming to specifications prescribed in advance by GOI) are purchased for Central Pool at Minimum Support Price (MSP) by Food Corporation of India/ State Governments/ State Government Agencies to help farmers get remunerative price and prevent distress sale. However, if any producer/farmer gets better price in comparison to MSP, he/she is free to sell his/her produce in open market.The following steps are taken to ensure that farmers  get remunerative price for wheat and paddy:i) 	Before the onset of each marketing season, Department of Food and Public Distribution, Government of India (GOI) holds a consultative meeting with the officials of Food Corporation of India, State Governments and others to make an assessment of availability of wheat and paddy/rice for procurement at MSP based on the prospects of production and market situation. ii) 	Minimum Support Price operations are given wide publicity through pamphlets, banners, sign boards, radio, TV and advertisements through print & electronic media. iii) 	Farmers are made aware of the quality specifications and purchase system, etc. to facilitate bringing their produce conforming to the specifications. iv) 	Procurement centres are opened by respective State Government Agencies/  Food Corporation of India, taking into account the production, marketable surplus, convenience of farmers and availability of other logistics / infrastructure such as storage and transportation, etc. Large number of temporary purchase centres, in addition to the existing Mandis and depots/godowns are also established at key points for the convenience of farmers.(b) and (c): 	There has not been any reported instance of non-purchase of paddy due to non-availability of godown. Entire quantum of paddy that arrived in mandis/ purchase centers have been purchased by FCI/State Government Agencies. Against the market arrival of 48483 MT paddy, entire paddy i.e 48483 MT has been procured in Jharkhand during KMS 2019-20 (as on 04.02.2020).(d) to (e): 	State Government of Jharkhand has announced a bonus of Rs 185 per quintal over and above MSP during KMS 2019-20 to encourage and support farmers.****
