ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to  (d)  : 	A capacity addition target of 88,537 MW from conventional sources was set for the 12th Five Year Plan (2012–17) against which 99,209 MW (112% of the target) has been achieved. (e)	:  		During the year 2018-19, demand not met and energy not supplied were 0.8% and 0.6% respectively. The same figures for the year 2019-20 (up to June, 2019) are 0.6% and 0.4% respectively. The gap between demand and supply of power in the country was on account of factors like constraints in distribution networks, financial constraints, commercial reasons etc. rather than inadequacy of power availability in the country. **************
