An All India Radio Station is functional in Darbhanga district of Bihar. This station has a Studio and an associated 20 KW Medium Wave Transmitter that carries the regional Service of Akashvani Darbhanga at 1296 KHz MW frequency. Presently, the station has daily 15 hours and 40 minutes transmission on Medium Wave; from 0550 hrs to 1520 hrs and 1700 hrs to 2310 hrs with 11 hours of transmission originating from Akashvani Darbhanga and relay of various national/regional programmes for a period of 4 hours and 40 minutes.This station is broadcasting programmes on a variety of themes to suit the needs, concerns and aspirations of the target audience, in Hindi and other languages such as Maithili, Urdu, Sanskrit, English and Bajjika dialect.(b) At present, there is no approved scheme to setup a 100KW transmitter and 10 KW FM channel in Darbhanga radio station. However, Akashvani Darbhanga is available to national and international audiences on “NewsOnAir” App through Internet Streaming. (c) and (d) AIR Complex at AIR Darbhanga has been affected due to increase in level of roads encircling AIR Station which causes water logging problem during the rains. An on-ground assessment has been carried out on required mitigation measures. To address the matter, as an immediate measure, Prasar Bharati has decided to raise the front area of the studio building so that the movement of vehicles and people is not affected during the rainy season. Funds have been sanctioned and the process of work has been initiated.****
