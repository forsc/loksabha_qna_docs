ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STEEL		   (SHRI RAM CHANDRA PRASAD SINGH)(a)	Yes, Sir. The emission intensity of the Indian steel sector is higher in comparison with the steel industry in EU and North America. The reasons for the higher emission intensity of Indian steel industry are:-•	Lower use of prepared burden (pellets & sinter) vis-à-vis the use of 100% prepared burden in Blast Furnaces in EU & North America, due to techno-economic reasons.•	The use of lower percentage of steel scrap in their Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) vis-à-vis steel industry in EU & North America due to inadequate availability of steel scrap at competitive rates. (b)	The present CO2 emission intensity of the Indian steel sector is around 2.55-2.60 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of crude steel, which has come down from around 3.1 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of crude steel in 2005. Keeping in view of the high emissions from the power and industrial sector of the country as a whole the Government is developing carbon market to reduce emissions and to pursue a low carbon path vigorously to realise the country’s Nationally determined contributions (NDC) targets under the Paris Agreement. Contd……2/- -: 2 :-(c)	Ministry of Power, through Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) has prepared the draft blueprint on National Carbon Market, to understand the present infrastructure and how carbon markets have been operating. This blueprint document proposes approaches for creating voluntary carbon market in India and gives suggestions to resolve the market barriers.(d)	The steel sector has adopted the Best Available Technologies available globally, in the modernisation & expansions projects. The steel sector has also been made an important stakeholder in the National Green Hydrogen Energy Mission to facilitate deployment of green hydrogen in the iron & steel making processes. Under this initiative, it has been proposed to set up two Pilot Plants to explore the feasibility of using green H2 in DRI production.********
