ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION (SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (d): Standard of education is a comprehensive term that includes learners, teachers, teaching learning process, learning environment, curriculum, pedagogy, learning outcomes, assessment, etc. To take cognizance of this, Government of India launched Samagra Shiksha - an Integrated Scheme for school education, w.e.f. 2018-19, as an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education.	Samagra Shiksha focuses on improvement in quality of education by providing support for different interventions like in-service training of teachers and school heads, conduct of achievement surveys at state and national level, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment, grants for library, sports and physical activities, support for Rashtriya Avishkar Abhiyan, ICT and digital initiatives, School Leadership development programme, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, support for Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat, etc.          Further, in order to improve the education standard, the Government has taken several steps:- <pre>1.	Central RTE Rules have been amended on 20th February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes at Elementary level. 2.	National Achievement Survey (NAS) is conducted to enable States/UTs to identify gaps in learning outcomes.3.	A 70 indicator based matrix Performance Grading Index (PGI) has been developed to grade the States/UTs.4.	NISHTHA (National Initiative for School Heads and Teachers Holistic Advancement), an Integrated Teacher Training Programme has been introduced.5.	It has been decided to participate in the Programme for International Students Assessment (PISA) to be conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2022, which is a competency based assessment. 6.	Learning Outcomes for Secondary level have been notified.</pre>Also, the National Education Policy, 2020 focuses on improving the quality of education through various measures such as introduction of New pedagogical and curricular structure, Early Childhood Care and Education, Foundational Literacy and Numeracy and Transforming Assessment for Student Development, Experiential and Competency based Learning etc.Further, Education is under Concurrent List of the constitution; therefore, most of the schools and their regulation are under the jurisdiction of respective State Governments and UTs.(e):	The recruitment of teachers is a continuous process and the vacancies keep arising due to retirement and additional requirements on account of enhanced students’ strength. Education is in the concurrent list of the Constitution. The recruitment, service conditions and deployment of teachers come under the purview of the concerned State/UT Government. However, Ministry of Education has been requesting all the State and UT Governments for filling-up the vacant posts of teachers and their rational deployment through advisories/review meetings etc. The state-wise vacancies of teachers for the year 2020-21 are at Annexure.******
