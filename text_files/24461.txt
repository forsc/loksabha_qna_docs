In this regard, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has adopted a multipronged strategy to address the needs of the agriculture sector for its development. The new high yielding and biotic/abiotic stress tolerant varieties and technologies of crops, breeds/ strains of livestock & poultry developed by National Agricultural Research System (NARS) under Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) have played pivotal role in increasing the food and nutritional security of country. ICAR/NARS has developed more than 5500 varieties of different field and horticultural crops since 1969. During last 7 years (2014 to Jan 2021) alone, 1575 varieties of 70 field crops were developed which include 770 of cereals, 235 of oilseeds, 236 of pulses, 170 of fibre crops, 104 of forage crops, 52 of sugarcane and 8 of other crops. In addition, 288 varieties of horticultural crops were also released and notified during this period. Against the indented quantity of 6.59 lakh quintals of breeder’s seed of different varieties received during the last 7 years, ICAR/NARS produced and supplied 8.20 lakh quintals. In livestock, 12 improved poultry varieties suitable for backyard poultry rearing, 9 high producing varieties of pigs and an improved sheep variety were developed. Twelve cloned buffaloes were also produced during the last 7 years to multiply superior germplasm. To augment the fish production, fish breeding and seed production technologies were developed for 25 species of food fishes and 48 species of ornamental fishes were identified during 2014-21. For better health management a total of 47 and 25 new vaccines/diagnostic kits were also developed in case of livestock & fish respectively. Owing to the varieties and technologies developed and promoted by ICAR/NARS and the enabling policies of the Government, the country has seen 6 folds increase in the annual production of total food grains since 1950-51. The corresponding increase in the production of pulses, oilseeds, milk & fish was 3.04, 7.10, 11.04 and 17.90 folds respectively. The increase in productivity (kg/ha) of all food grains, rice, wheat, sugarcane, pulses and oilseeds during the period 1950-51 to 2018-19 has been 4.04, 3.98, 5.30, 2.34, 2.83 and 2.63 folds respectively.  The percent increase in productivity (kg/ha) of all food grains, rice, wheat, sugarcane, pulses, oilseeds, milk and fish production during the period 2013-14 up to 2018-19 is, 7.78, 9.10, 10.32, 12.12, 9.90, 5.20, 7.70 respectively.
