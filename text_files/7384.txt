                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	to (d)	The Ministry in supersession of earlier waste management rules has comprehensively revised 6 waste management rules including Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The Rules prescribe that no waste generator shall throw, burn or bury the solid waste generated by him, on streets, open public spaces outside his premises or in the drain or water bodies. Further, the Rules direct the waste generators to segregate the waste at source and hand over the segregated waste to authorised waste pickers or waste collectors. The Rules mandate the Urban Local Bodies to frame Bye-Laws incorporating the provisions of Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 and ensure timely implementation.Collection of all type of wastes is a State subject and function of ULBs. State Governments/ ULBs plan, design, execute and operate mechanism for collection, transportation and processing of all types of wastes as per their requirements, capacities and capabilities, which suit their needs, geographical and climatic conditions, resources, manpower, equipment, etc.Though air pollution is one of the triggering factors for respiratory ailments and associated diseases, there are no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct correlation of disease exclusively due to unsafe disposal of waste.Apart from framing the policy, the Central Government is also supporting the efforts of State Governments in establishing the infrastructure related proper implementation of solid waste management in their states. MoHUA is implementing the Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) project under which various projects have been taken up. Under this programme during the mission period of 2014-15 to 2019-20, an allocation of Rs. 7424.24 Cr has been made for Solid Waste Management Projects*****
