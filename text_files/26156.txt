ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND EARTH SCIENCES(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)??????? ?? ???????????? ??? ?????? ??????? ??  ????? ?????? (???????? ??????)  (??. ???????? ????) (a) & (b)   Yes Sir. The ministry has been gauging the Gross Expenditure on R&D (GERD) as percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in India at regular intervals. As per latest available statistics, the National GERD as percentage of GDP remains at 0.7% during last three years. These figures have always been taken into consideration while formulating  R&D policies. (c)     The Government has taken up several initiatives to strengthen the linkage between all stakeholders in the STI ecosystem to boost knowledge generation and product manufacturing. The Government through Department of Science and Technology has recently initiated setting up of shared, professionally managed, Science and Technology infrastructure facility, which can readily be accessible to academia, start-ups, manufacturing units, industries and R&D Labs named "Sophisticated Analytical & Technical Help Institutes (SATHI)." These SATHI centres focused  on Technology, Testing, Certification & Compliance, will boost manufacturing clusters and industries. The Government through Office of Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA) to Government of India has set up 5 city clusters (Delhi, Pune, Jodhpur, Bhubaneswar & Hyderabad) for creating a shared ecosystem for sharing of resource-infrastructure and human capital, providing regional solutions and bringing national and global competitiveness contributing to national missions and mega science projects. (d)     The Government has taken several steps to incentivise investment by the private sector to increase expenditure on R&D. The government has been offering various financial incentives that fall under the category of direct incentives in the form of funding programmes for the private sector to contribute to the national R&D ecosystem through R&D programmes being implemented by various ministries and their associated departments. It also offers indirect incentives in the form of tax incentives on R&D investments to the private sector. Government has already allowed the corporate sector to make R&D investments under their mandatory Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). There are specific investment incentives offered such as Location-based tax incentives that lead to 100% deductions of profits generated from establishing and doing business in northeastern states of India for a period of 10 years. The government has also taken specific steps for the ease of doing business, IP management, and procurement policies that will aid in stimulating the private sector’s participation in the national R&D ecosystem. *****
