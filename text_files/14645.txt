ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (d):  Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project was launched with a purpose of protecting and conserving coastal and marine environment of the country.  The project has a National component and State level components in three pilot States viz., Gujarat, Odisha and West Bengal. Under the national component, the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM), Chennai in association with the Institute for Ocean Management (IOM), Anna University, Chennai have studied the shoreline changes for identification of high erosion, medium erosion and low erosion / stable coastal stretches of the country. Also, the Survey of India has undertaken mapping and demarcation of Hazard line along the mainland of the Indian coast to plan against natural hazards like storm, tsunami and cyclone etc.  The project further involved mapping of the Low/High Tide Line and all the Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESAs) along the entire mainland coastline of the country, including Karnataka.Projects for coastal erosion protection such as Mangrove plantations and shelter belt plantations have been undertaken in identified coastal stretches of Gujarat, Odisha and West Bengal, beside a pilot ‘Geo-tube’ embankment project for erosion prevention in highly eroding coastal stretch of Pentha village in Odisha.  Funds to the tune of approximately Rs.81 crores were allocated for such projects.  These activities have been completed within the targetted closure of the project, i.e., by 31/03/2020.***
