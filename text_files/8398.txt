ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO) (a)   Many studies have been published, from time to time, reporting model-based estimates of effects of environmental pollution, including those on health of children. These estimates are, however, based on models, simulations and extrapolations. There are no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct correlation of death/ disease exclusively due to pollution. Health effects of pollution are synergistic manifestation of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity, etc., of the individuals.(b) & (c) The Central Government has taken a number of regulatory measures for prevention, control and abatement of pollution. These inter alia include notification of National Ambient Air Quality Standards, emission/ effluent standards for industrial sectors, setting up of monitoring network for assessment of ambient air quality and water quality, launching of Air Quality Index, issuance of directions to 17 categories of highly polluting industries to install Online Continuous Effluent/Emission Monitoring System (OCEMS), etc. In particular, the Government has launched the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) in 2019 as a pan India time bound national level strategy to address the increasing air pollution across the country in a comprehensive manner. The overall objective is to augment and evolve effective ambient air quality monitoring network across the country besides ensuring comprehensive management plan for prevention, control and abatement of air pollution and enhancing public awareness and capacity building measures. (d)	Does not arise in view of the above.*****
