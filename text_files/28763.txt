Punjab has emailed that in Punjab, 4 suspected deaths have occurred due to lack of oxygen in one hospital (private) in Amritsar district. Detailed guidelines for reporting of deaths have been issued by Union Health Ministry to all States/UTs. Accordingly, all States/UTs report cases and deaths to Union Health Ministry on a regular basis. ICMR on 10th May 2020 issued ‘Guidance for appropriate recording of COVID-19 related deaths in India’  (Available at: https://www.icmr.gov.in/pdf/covid/techdoc/Guidance_appropriate_recording_of_related_deaths_India.pdf).

States/UTs were also provided with a proforma for undertaking death audits in this regard. The COVID-19 management toolkit for District Collectors shared by Ministry of Health & Family Welfare on 2nd April 2021 with states, also highlighted the need for deaths audits and follow up action as one of the key monitoring parameters.170 Central teams deployed to 33 states/UTs have also reiterated need for correct recording of deaths and undertake periodic death audits.Health is a State subject. Government of India is supporting States in their endeavor to enhance preparedness and response capacities against COVID-19. Various initiatives have been undertaken by the Government to provide technical guidance and further strengthen health infrastructure, availability of essential logistics including drugs and medical oxygen supply to manage COVID-19. Ministry of Health & Family Welfare continues to provide technical guidance for managing various aspects of COVID-19. So far more than 150 guidelines/advisories/SoPs/plans have been provided to States/UTs. This includes technical guidance on myriad of issues ranging from surveillance and containment of COVID-19, travel advisories, clinical management protocols for adults and children, management of mucormycosis, rational use of oxygen, SOPs for safe resumption of activities in workplaces, markets, religious places etc.Besides this all States/UTs are also being provided financial support through various avenues including National Health Mission, Emergency COVID-19 Response Packages and State Disaster Response Funds to assist in management of COVID-19 pandemic.As with regards to provisioning of medical oxygen, the following initiatives have been undertaken by Government of India:i.

As on 25th November 2021, all the PSA plants sanctioned under PM-CARES have been commissioned.iv.	Further, States have also been requested to set up similar oxygen generation plants in the remaining public health facilities.v.	Oxygen Demand Aggregation system (ODAS) which is an online digital solution has now been developed to ascertain the demand for medical oxygen from all medical facilities based on bed availability and occupancy and aggregating them at the State level. vi.	An Oxygen Digital Tracking System (ODTS) to track the daily allocations of oxygen, their dispatch and deliveries, including movement of oxygen tankers has also been developed and put in place.vii.
