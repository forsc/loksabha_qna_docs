Climate actions at the state level are based on the State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCC). Thirty-three States/Union Territories have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) in lines with NAPCC taking into account State’s specific issues relating to climate change. These SAPCCs inter-alia outline sector specific and cross sectoral priority climate actions.The Government is also implementing the scheme, “National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change” (NAFCC) to support adaptation measures of States/UTs in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate Change.  Under NAFCC, 30 projects have been sanctioned in 27 States to tackle the issues related to adaptation in agriculture, water, forestry, etc. Government of India has also embarked upon ambitious actions in the areas of renewable energy, afforestation, energy efficiency, and urban development.National Mission for a Green India (GIM) under the National Action Plan on Climate Change aims at protecting, restoring and enhancing India’s forest cover and responding to climate change. It envisages a holistic view of greening and focuses on multiple ecosystem services along with carbon sequestration and emission reduction as co-benefits. GIM emphasises the landscape approach to treat large contiguous areas of both forest and non-forest, public and private lands.National Forest Policy (NFP) 1988 encourages massive afforestation and social forestry programme on all denuded, degraded and unproductive lands. NFP 1988 also encourages for planting of trees alongside of roads, railway lines, rivers and streams and canals, and on other unutilized lands along with raising of green belts in urban/ industrial areas.National Afforestation Programme (NAP) is the major afforestation programme implemented by the government for regeneration of degraded forests and adjoining areas through participatory approach.The concerned State Forest Departmentsare taking up plantation activity on railway land in States like Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu, etc.(c)The government is currently implementing a centrally sponsored scheme namelyNational Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-systems (NPCA) for conservation and management of wetlands (including lakes) in the country on cost sharing basis between Central Government and respective State Governments. Under NPCA scheme, 180 wetlands including lakes in the country have been prioritized/identified for conservation & management. Financial assistance amounting to Rs. 963.88 crores have been released for 50 wetlands including lakes so far.For more effective conservation and management of wetlands in the country, the Central Government in consultation with the States, Union Territories, Central line Ministries and other stakeholders, have notified the Wetlands (Conservation & Management) Rules 2017.
