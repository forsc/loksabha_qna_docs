Under these Centrally Sponsored Schemes, financial assistance was provided to different States/Union Territories (UTs) for conservation and management of identified wetlands and lakes in the country. To have better synergy and to avoid overlap, the NWCP has been merged in February, 2013 with NLCP into a new integrated scheme of ‘National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-systems’ (NPCA) for holistic conservation of wetlands (includes lakes), which is operational on cost sharing basis between the Central and State Governments. NPCA aims at holistic conservation and restoration of wetlands for achieving the desired water quality enhancement, besides improvement in biodiversity and ecosystems through an integrated and multidisciplinary approach and a common regulatory framework. The scheme covers various activities such as interception, diversion and treatment of wastewater, shoreline protection, lake front development, in-situ cleaning i.e. de-silting & de-weeding, storm water management, bioremediation, catchment area treatment, lake beautification, survey & demarcation, bio-fencing, fisheries development, weed control, biodiversity conservation, education and awareness creation, community participation etc.The details of financial assistance provided to the States/UTs under NPCA for conservation and management of wetlands in the country during the last three years and the current year are annexed.(d) Yes, Sir.
