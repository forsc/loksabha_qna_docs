MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)&(b)	Shoreline change including erosion and sea level rise are slow phenomena and manifested globally. A national strategy for coastal protection along with guidelines for coastal protection measures have been framed for all Coastal States and Union Territories by the Ministry.The Ministry under the Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project (ICZMP) envisages large-scale assessment of the risks associated with shoreline changes and preparation of a framework for development of management solutions to combat these risks.  Under the project, shoreline management plans were prepared for five (05) identified coastal stretches in Gujarat, Odisha and West Bengal. To protect the coastal area from erosion, several initiatives such as mangrove plantation, shelter-belt plantation and Geo-Tubes installation have been taken up under ICZM Project. About 16000 ha of Mangrove plantation, 1900 ha of shelter-belt plantation and installation of Geo-tubes in 500 mt. have been undertaken and total about Rs.86 crores have been incurred to carry out above said activities. (c) & (d)   11 Groynes in the Gujarat coast, 45 in Kerala, 1 in Maharashtra, 16 in Andhra Pradesh, 89 in Tamil Nadu, and 45 in West Bengal respectively have so far been installed to check or control sea erosion. ***
