(a)	During the initial phases of the pandemic, several flights were operated by the Government of India, free of cost, for the evacuation of Indians stranded in China, Italy and Iran. Three special flights on January 31, February 1 and February 26, 2020 were operated to evacuate 766 persons, which included 723 Indian nationals and 43 foreign nationals from the city of Wuhan as well as other cities of Hubei Province in China.
