ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b): The objectives of the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) are mainly to providegood quality modern education including a strong component of culture, inculcation of values,awareness of the environment, adventure activities and physical education to the talentedchildren predominantly from the rural areas without regard to their family''s socio-economiccondition. These objectives have by and large been achieved as is evident from the performanceof the JNV students and demand for admission, the details of which are shown below:-<pre>2015 2016 2017 2018 2019Pass%Firstdivision%Pass%Firstdivision%Pass%Firstdivision%Pass%Firstdivision%Pass%Firstdivision%Class X 99.72 96.51 98.83 96.98 99.78 98.13 97.15 85.42 98.57 89.56ClassXII96.91 91.75 96.70 85.45 95.87 85.47 97.08 89.36 96.62 89.82Demand for admission 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019Registration for JNVST 2086927 2163039 2211507 2777504 3110710</pre>(c) & (d): The academic performance of students is reviewed regularly by the AcademicAdvisory Committee and guidance provided continuously. Individual performances aremonitored at Cluster, Regional and National levels. Training facilities for teachers provided atseven locations in the country, support for preparations for competitive examinations andcompetency building have resulted in large number of students qualifying in admission testsconducted for various professional courses. Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) has alsosucceeded in connecting resources from institutes of higher learning, research institutes anduniversities.(e) The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme provides for opening of one Jawahar NavodayaVidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country. Opening of new JNVs is a continuous processwhich depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government/UT Administration tomake available requisite suitable land free of cost and making available required temporarybuilding, free of rent to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However,actual sanction and opening of new JNV depends on availability of funds and approval by thecompetent authority. One JNV each has been sanctioned in all the districts of the country (as on31st May, 2014), excluding Tamil Nadu which has not yet accepted the Navodaya VidyalayaScheme. As on date, 661 JNVs have been sanctioned all over the country, including 20additional JNVs sanctioned in SC/ST concentrated districts, the details of which are annexed.*****
