HARSH VARDHAN)????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????; ??????? ?? ???????????? ??????; ?? ?????? ??????? ????????. ???? ?????(a)	The details of the funds allocated to Research & Development Institutes of Ministry of Science and Technology for Research and Development during the year 2013-14 and their utilization, institution-wise, are given at ANNEXURE-I.(b)	Patents are the exclusive rights granted for new innovations. Patents applied reflects innovations recorded. As per Annual Report 2017-18, ''Office of Controller General of Patent, Design and Trademarks'' the trends in last five years in respect of patent applications are shown below:-Year 	2013-14	2014-15	2015-16	2016-17	2017-18Patent Applications registered	42,951	42,763	46,904	45,444	47,854Similarly, Patent applications (innovations) filed by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) laboratories during last 5 years in different fields are given below:CSIR Patent applications filed in India during last 5 years	2014-15	2015-16	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19Biological Science	24	28	21	27	25Chemical Science	192	171	131	89	117Drug & Pharma	67	58	34	24	33Engineering	27	63	37	28	29Others	2	7	5	3	5Total	312	327	228	171	209(c) & (d): No Sir. The Public Funded Research Institutions and Autonomous Institutes under the administrative control of the Ministry of Science and Technology have excellent research facilities and highly competent faculty, researchers and technologists. These institutions are continuously engaged in training of young scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs to undertake S&T related innovations in a number of incubators and research parks established across the country and many of these youngsters have successfully launched a number of promising start-ups.National Innovation Foundation(NIF), an autonomous Institute under Ministry of Science and Technology provides adequate facilities and competent faculty to train young brains to undertake innovations in the field of Science and Technology. The interns from Engineering Colleges, Business Schools, Design Institutes and students from other courses and Institutes take up internship opportunities at NIF. NIF also facilitates mentoring of students by leading Technical Institutes of the country for students who have been successful at the State Level Exhibitions and Project Competitions. (e)	Government has taken up various steps to scale up innovations in the field of science and technology. National Initiative for Development and Harnessing Innovations(NIDHI) is an umbrella program conceived and developed by the Department of Science & Technology, Government of India, for nurturing ideas and innovations (knowledge-based and technology-driven) into successful start-ups. One of the key programmes under NIDHI is establishing Technology Business Incubators (TBIs) as an institutional mechanism at various institutions of higher learning. TBIs provide requisite infrastructure, facilities and  value added services to nurture innovative ideas in the field of Science & Technology through incubation of start-ups. Under NIDHI-PRAYAS (Promoting & Accelerating Young and Aspiring Innovators & Start-ups) program, financial support of upto Rs.10 lakhs is provided to convert Science & Technology led innovative ideas into prototype. In addition, few   TBI’s are also supported to provide the seed support to its start-ups under incubation for scaling up innovations in the field of science & technology.National Research Development Corporation is managing a program viz. ''Programme for Inspiring Inventors & Innovators (PIII)'' for supporting and scaling up innovations in the field of S&T in the country. Major activities undertaken are awarding innovations, setting up of Innovation Facilitation Centres, Seed funding innovations and setting up of Incubation Centres.CSIR launched Mission Mode Projects (MMPs) in order to put concerted and sustained efforts in an identified area by synergizing the best competencies available in various CSIR labs and outside institutions. The combined and time targeted efforts will enable CSIR to cross threshold of intellectual barrier in order to deliver scientific, industrial and social goods. Within MMPs, each project will have clearly defined objectives, scopes, and implementation timelines and milestones, as well as measurable outcomes and service levels.
