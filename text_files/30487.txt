ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a)	to (g) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 193* FOR 10TH DECEMBER, 2021During 2021 (till 5th December), total number of 1,77,695 cases of Dengue and 237 cases of Zika Virus have been reported. The States/UTs wise details of Dengue and Zika virus including Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh are at Annexure.Detection of various diseases including Zika Virus is monitored under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), under NHM in all States/UTs. Its objective is to detect and respond to outbreaks of epidemic prone diseases including vaccine preventable disease. All the Zika virus outbreaks in India have been detected through IDSP network.  At present 132 number of  Virus Research & Diagnostic Laboratories  (VRDLs) are engaged in ZVD surveillance.  Adequate quantity of reagents/test kits are available at these laboratories.  Till November, 2021, approximately 130,000 human serum and urine samples have been screened through this meachnism.The National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme (NVBDCP) for prevention and control of six vector borne diseases including Dengue is administered by the National Centre for Vector Borne Diseases Control (NCVBDC) under the overarching umbrella scheme of National Health Mission (NHM). For creating awareness among general public about vector borne diseases on Dengue, the Government of India observes disease-specific ‘days’ and ‘months’, for example, ‘National Dengue Day’ (NDD) on 16th May and ‘World Malaria Day’ on 25th April every year.  The 20th August is observed as ‘World Mosquito Day’. Similarly, the months of June and July are observed as ‘Anti Malaria Month’ and ‘Anti Dengue Month’ respectively. Under these programmes various messages were disseminated through Social media. This year, Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities like audio campaigns through All India Radio, FM channels, community radio across the country, the advocacy, and dissemination of messages on prevention and control of Dengue at India International Trade Fair (IITF) 2021 were undertaken.The Zika virus infection cases have been reported from four states i.e., Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Kerala and Delhi in 2021. Among these states, Uttar Pradesh has reported maximum cases.  A total of 8627 samples were tested of which 152 were found positive amounting to a  positivity rate of 1.7%.Central teams are constituted by MoHFW as and when outbreaks are reported by any State / UTs. These teams help the State to prepare micro plan for containment of the disease and institute suitable preventive and control measures. This year such multi-disciplinary teams were deputed to the States of Kerala (in July), Maharashtra (in August) and Uttar Pradesh (in October).At present, no vaccine or specific treatment is available against Zika virus. As per information available with ICMR, Bharat Biotech International Ltd. is developing an inactivated vaccine for Zika virus disease. Development of this vaccine is currently at clinical trials stage.*****
