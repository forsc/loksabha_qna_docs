ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  Yes sir. Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) generates ground water quality data on a regional scale through ground water quality monitoring throughout the country. This monitoring indicates the occurrence of Fluoride, Arsenic, Nitrate, Iron and Heavy Metals beyond the BIS permissible limits for human consumption in isolated pockets in various parts of the country.(b)  State-wise number of partly affected Districts with different contaminants in Ground Water are given at Annexure-I.(c)  Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management including conservation and water harvesting in the Country is primarily States’ responsibility.  However, the important measures taken by the Central Government for conservation, management of ground water and effective implementation of rain water harvesting in the country are available at the following URL: http://jalshakti-dowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_ Feb2021.pdf.A number of States have done notable work in the field of water management/conservation. Of these, mention can be made of ‘Mukhya Mantri Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan’ in Rajasthan, ‘Sujalam Sufalam Abhiyan’ in Gujarat, ‘Mission Kakatiya’ in Telangana, ''Neeru Chettu’ in Andhra Pradesh, ‘Paani Bachao, Paisa Kamao’ in Punjab and ‘Jal Hi Jeevan’ in Haryana among others. With a view to facilitate sustainable development of ground water, Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) is presently granting No Objection Certificates (NOCs) for groundwater extraction with mandatory conditions in 19 States and 02 Union Territories (UTs) as per the extant ground water regulation guidelines. In balance States/UTs they are regulating as per their extant provisions.  Contd…P/2//2//The latest guidelines (with pan-India applicability) for regulation and control of groundwater extraction in the country have been notified by the Ministry on 24 Sep 2020. As per the guidelines all new/ existing industries and industries seeking expansion, infrastructure projects and mining projects extracting groundwater shall be required to seek NOC from CGWA or, the concerned State/ UT Ground Water Authority.Further, the guidelines provide for registering the drilling rigs by the States/UTs to maintain a database of wells drilled by them to control illegal extraction of groundwater. 		Government of India launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) in 2019, a time bound campaign with a mission mode approach intended to improve water availability including ground water conditions in the water stressed  blocks  of  256  districts  in India. In this regard, teams of officers from Central Government along-with technical officers from Ministry of Jal Shakti were deputed to visit water stressed districts and to work in close collaboration with district level officials to undertake suitable interventions. In addition ‘Jal Shakti Abhiyan – Catch the Rain’ campaign has been launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister of India on 22 March 2021. The Campaign will be undertaken across the country, in both rural and urban areas, with the theme “catch the rain, where it falls, when it falls”. It is being implemented from 22nd March 2021 to 30th November, 2021 during the pre-monsoon and monsoon period in the country. It is being launched as a Jan Andolan to take water conservation at grass-root level through people’s participation for sustainable management of water resources. ***** ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred to in reply to part (b) of Unstarred Question No. †4981 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 25.03.2021 regarding “Ground Water Pollution.States Wise Number of Partly Affected Districts with different Contaminants in Ground Water of IndiaS.No.	State/ UT	Salinity (EC above 3000 micro mhos/ cm)(EC : Electrical Conductivity)	Fluoride(above 1.5 mg/l)	Nitrate(above 45 mg/l)	Arsenic(above 0.01 mg/l)	Iron(above 1mg/l )	Lead (above 0.01 mg/l) 	Cadmium (above 0.003 mg/l) 	Chromium (above 0.05 mg/l)1	Andhra Pradesh	12	12	13	3	7	 	 	 2	Telangana	8	10	10	1	8	2	1	13	Assam	 	9	 	19	18	 	 	 4	Arunachal Pradesh	 	 	 	4.	 	 	 	 	5	Bihar	 	13	10	22	19	 	 	 6	Chhattisgarh	1	19	12	1.	 	17	1	1	17	Delhi	7	7	8	2	 	3	1	48	Goa	 	 	 	 	2	 	 	 9	Gujarat	21	22	24	12	10	 	 	 10	Haryana 	18	21	21	15	17	17	7	111	Himachal Pradesh	 	 	6	1	 	 	 	 12	Jammu & Kashmir	 	2	6	3	9	3	1	 13	Jharkhand	 	12	11	2	6	1	 	 14	Karnataka	29	30	29	2	22	 	 	 15	Kerala	4	5	11	 	14	2	 	116	Madhya Pradesh	18	43	51	8	41	16	 	 17	Maharashtra	25	17	30	 	20	19	 	 18	Manipur	 	1	 	2	4	 	 	 19	Meghalaya	 	1	 	 	6	 	 	 20	Nagaland	 	1	 	 	1	 	 	 21	Odisha	17	26	28	1	30	 	 	122	Punjab	10	19	21	10	9	6	8	1023	Rajasthan	30	33	33	1	33	3	 	 24	Tamil Nadu	28	25	29	9	2	3	1	525	Tripura	 	 	 	 	4	 	 	 26	Uttar Pradesh	13	34	59	28	15	10	2	327	Uttarakhand	 	 	4	5.	 	 	 	 	28	West Bengal	6	8	5	9.	 	16	6	2	229	Andaman& Nicobar	1	 	 	 	2	 	 	 30	Daman & Diu	1	 	1	1	 	 	 	 31	Puducherry	 	 	1	 	 	 	 	  	Total	Parts of 249 districts in 18 states & UTs	Parts of 370districts in 23 states & UTs	Parts of 423districts in 23states & UTs	Parts of 152 districts in 21 states & UTs	Parts of 341 districts in 27 states & UTs	Pb in parts of 92 districts in 14 states 	Cd in parts of 24 districts in 9 states 	Cr in parts of 29 districts in  10 states *****
