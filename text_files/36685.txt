                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) Upper Bhadra Project envisages lifting of 17.40 Thousand Million Cubic Feet (TMC) of water from river Thunga to Bhadra reservoir and 29.90 TMC from Bhadra reservoir for utilization in Upper Bhadra Project. However, as intimated by Government of Karnataka, there is no proposal of construction of reservoir on Vedavathi river in between Vanivilasa Sagar in Karnataka and Bhairavanitippa project in Andhra Pradesh. (b) to (e) During appraisal, Central Water Commission under this Ministry has ascertained that the water utilization proposed under Upper Bhadra project by Karnataka is well within the allocations made to the State by Krishna Water Dispute Tribunal – I (KWDT-I). Accordingly, the project has been considered acceptable from inter-State angle and has been accepted by the Advisory Committee for Irrigation, Flood Control and Multipurpose Projects of this Ministry, in its 147th meeting held in December, 2020.  ****
