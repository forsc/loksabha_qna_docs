ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) to (f)	Sports is a ‘State’ Subject and the primary responsibility of development of Sports, including imparting training to sportspersons, conduct of sports tournaments, matches and leagues, grant of financial assistance to athletes, sportspersons and sporting organizations, and use of public stadia, rests with the respective State Governments and National Sports Federations (NSFs). The Government of India supplements and complements the efforts of the State Governments and NSFs in this regard.Conventional training of athletes under various sports promotional schemes of Government of India was suspended during the lockdown period due to restrictions imposed in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Standard Operating Procedures for opening of sports venues and resumption of sports training have been issued by the Ministry in consultation with the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Health. A COVID Task Force Committee has also been set-up by SAI to ensure that the guidelines are strictly implemented at the SAI training centre. The Committee is responsible for the constant monitoring and management of the health protocols issued by the Government.Regular interaction with the athletes was undertaken by SAI by way of seminars and workshops conducted by experts in sports psychology, sports science/medicating, nutrition in COVID 19, strength and conditioning, high performance sports environment, anti-doping were organized via, video conferencing and through social media platforms to educate athletes on coping with stress and depression and focusing on their objectives.With the help of local authorities, vaccination drive for Olympic bound athletes, National Campers and their Coaches, Support Staff was initiated at Sports Authority of India centres. In addition, the Government has ensured that few athletes who are training abroad also receive their vaccinations timely.During the second wave of Covid-19, Olympic-bound athletes continued their training at foreign facilities or trained in training camps following strict Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). Further, those Olympic-bound athletes who could not go back to their places due to lock down were given equipment in their rooms for training in SAI Centres. National Coaching Camps were conducted in a bio-bubble for the Olympic bound athletes. While the sports promotional schemes of the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports have provision for grant of financial assistance to eligible entities for creation of sports infrastructure and facilities, and training of sports persons, no specific scheme is being implemented by this Ministry that has provisions for grant of financial assistance to athletes, sportspersons or sporting organizations impacted as a result of COVID-19.	However, Department of Sports supports selected athletes/ campers through the Scheme of Assistance to National Sports Federations (NSFs), which includes medical insurance policy of ? 5.00 lakh and Personal accident policy (Disability/ Death) of ? 25.00 lakh. Since 01.06.2021 the Government has extended this facility to coaches, sports analysts, doctors, physiotherapists, masseurs etc. in National Camps held all over India, athletes undergoing training under Khelo India scheme, athletes and coaches in various training Centre of SAI, and sports science staff at various National Centre of Excellence (NCoE). Apart from this, under Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), Government takes care of sudden and unanticipated requirements of elite athletes including their medical needs.Also, under the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay National Welfare Funds for Sportspersons (PDUNWFS) Scheme, an assistance of upto ?10 lakh is extended to ex-sportspersons who have retired from active sports and their family members for medical treatment and assistance of upto ?5.00 lakh is provided to families of deceased sportspersons. Under this scheme, assistance upto ? 5.00 lakh is provided to sportspersons who have been injured during training and participation in sports competitions on case to case basis.	The Sports Authority of India (SAI) is responsible for maintenance and operation of only five stadia in Delhi, viz., the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium Complex, Indira Gandhi Sports Complex, Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Swimming Pool Complex, Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium and Dr. Karni Singh Shooting Range. The other centres of SAI are operational on sites made available by the respective State/UT Governments. No sports activities were undertaken in the SAI centres. *****
