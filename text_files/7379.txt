However, the production for the year 2018-19is 1589 Million Metric Ton.(b)to (e) As per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which conducted study in 60 major cities of India, it is estimated that around 25,940 Ton/day of plastic waste is generated in India. Approximately 15,384 Ton/day, which is 60% of the total plastic waste, is collected and recycled. This recycled plastic is used is manufacturing of several products. The remaining 10556 Ton/day of the plastic waste, which is estimated to be approximately 40% of plastic waste generation, remain uncollected and littered in the environment. To utilize the uncollected plastic waste, the Rules, 2016 prescribed the local bodies to encourage the use of plastic waste (preferably the plastic waste which cannot be further recycled) for road construction as per Indian Road Congress guidelines or energy recovery or waste to oil etc. Further, the Rules specify that recycling of plastic waste shall conform to the Indian Standard: IS 14534:1998. The Rules also prohibit the use of carry bags made of recycled plastic or products made of recycled plastic for storing, carrying, dispensing or packaging ready to eat or drink food stuff. Tamil Nadu generates approximately 1099 Ton/day of plastic waste. Hon’ble Prime Minister has announced India’s pledge to phase out all Single-use plastic by 2022. The Ministry has issued “Standard Guidelines on Single Use Plastic” with suggested different set of actions for State/UT Government to minimize the usage of single use plastics. The Ministry issued instructions to the offices coming under its administrative jurisdiction, Regional Offices of the Ministry, offices of Central Government and its departments, major PSUs, corporates, institutes etc. requesting them to prohibit single-use plastic products including water bottles, take away coffee cups, lunch wrapped in disposable plastic packaging, plastic bags, disposable food containers, plates and containers made of polystyrene foam, plastic straws etc. from their offices.*****
