ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a)	All construction works of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) are executed on “Deposit Work” basis from concept to commissioning stage through Government construction agencies viz. Central Public Works Department (CPWD), Military Engineer Services (MES), Railways, State Public Works Departments (PWD), Central / State Public Sector Undertakings. Administrative Approval and Expenditure Sanction (AA&ES) is issued by KVS on the basis of approved preliminary drawings as per KVS norms and preliminary estimate submitted by construction agencies. The progress of the construction activities are reviewed / monitored / inspected through Headquarters / Regional Office level, Works Committee of KVS, Vidyalaya Management Committee, web based app, etc. Third Party Quality Assurance (TPQA) is also carried out through Indian Institute of Technology / National Institute of Technology at different level of works generally at completion of 15-20%, 45-50%, 70-75% and 90-100% works.(b) & (c) KVS has informed that funds are released to the construction agencies in instalments based on physical and financial progress of work for which monthly progress reports in the prescribed format along with photographs are submitted by the construction agencies duly certified by the principal concerned and, hence, question of failure by principals / schools to utilize the funds does not arise.*****
