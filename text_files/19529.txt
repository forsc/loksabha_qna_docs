ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES(SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a) to (d) Doordarshan (DD) Free Dish is a Free to Air Direct-to-Home (DTH) platform. Reference was received from Prasar Bharati regarding reception of some channels of the private broadcasters on the Set Top Boxes of DD Free Dish subscribers which were not part of channels downlinkable from that platform. This situation has arisen due to co-location of signals and non-mandatory requirement for encryption of signals of a Free-to-Air TV Channel. The Ministry proposes to address this issue in the new uplinking and downlinking guidelines for private TV channels to be notified by the Government.******
