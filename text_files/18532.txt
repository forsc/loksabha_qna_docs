                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) As per NFHS-4 (2015-16), the rate of caesarean deliveries in the country is 17.2% which is lower than the developed countries viz. Latin America and the Caribbean countries (40.5%), North America (32.3%), Oceania (31.1%), Europe (25%), Asia (19.2%) as per the WHO 2018 report. The details of the C-section deliveries performed during the last three years and current year, State/UT-wise including Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh is given in Annexure as per HMIS.(b) The standards declared by WHO for Caesarean deliveries state that at population level, caesarean section rates higher than 10% were not associated with reductions in rates of maternal and newborn mortality. It recommended the adoption of the Robson classification system, which facilitates comparison and analysis of caesarean rates within and between different facilities, and across countries and regions.(c) & (f) Health is a State subject. However, MoHFW has taken the following steps to curb the rise in C-section;•	Conveyed the WHO Statement to all States/UTs urging them to share the same with all Obstetricians and Gynaecologists working in public health facilities in their respective States/UTs.•	Collaborated with Federation of Obstetrician and Gynaecologists in India (FOGSI) to share the WHO statement on C-section among all members.•	Under “LaQshya”- Labour room & maternity OT Quality Improvement Initiative, Caesarean section audit has been implemented in all LaQshya certified public health facilities to ensure that Caesarean sections are undertaken judiciously in only those cases requiring such surgical interventions•	All CGHS empanelled hospitals are directed to display the information regarding ratio of deliveries by caesarean section.(d) & (e) No such information is available with the Government.(f)  As above.
