                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) & (b):	“Police” is a State subject falling in List-II (State List) of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. It is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments/UT Administrations to implement appropriate measures for women in the police force. -2-L.S.US.Q.NO.1516 FOR 20.09.2020However, Ministry of Home Affairs issued advisories on 22.04.2013, 21.05.2014, 12.05.2015 and 21.06.2019 to all the State Governments to increase the representation of women police to 33% of the total strength, ensure gender sensitization in police, make provision of   basic infrastructure amenities for women police including suitable toilet facilities, separate hand washing and shower facilities with adequate supply of water and if it is not possible to provide access to permanent toilets, securely installed portable toilets with lockable doors, lighting and ventilation.Further, under the scheme of “Assistance to States for Modernisation of Police” construction, including construction of separate restrooms for women police was allowed to all the States till 2014-15. Since 2015-16 after the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission were implemented, the share of the States in the union taxes was substantially enhanced from 32% to 42% to enable the States to utilise these funds for various purposes including modernisation of Police Forces.  As per the scheme approved by the Government during the year 2017-18, construction including separate restrooms for women police is allowed only in case of specific theatres viz.  Jammu & Kashmir (till 2019-20), insurgency affected North East (NE) States and Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected districts.-3-L.S.US.Q.NO.1516 FOR 20.09.2020The Centre also issues advisories to the States to strengthen welfare measures for women police personnel and ensure their safety and a conducive work environment.  Women police personnel can avail benefit of maternity leave as per the provisions defined by the State Government to avoid any hardships for them and their children after the delivery period. Police Forces of the States work within the existing legal & institutional framework in the matter. (c):	The training institutions under MHA like Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy, North Eastern Police Academy and Bureau of Police Research & Development conducts various training courses, seminars, workshops which are equally open to women police officials. As “Police” is a State subject training of women police officials is the responsibility of respective State governments.**********
