                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): The Implementing Agency, AAI, has identified 17 airports in Uttar Pradesh under the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)- UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik) so far for operation of the RCS flights. Details of these 17 airports are attached as Annexure. An airport which is included in the awarded routes of RCS - UDAN and requires upgradation/development for commencement of RCS operations is developed under "Revival of unserved and underserved airports" scheme. The Selected Airline Operators (SAOs) are obligated to commence RCS flight operations on a RCS-route, as part of individual route-proposal or a network proposal within a period of 180 days from the issuance of Letter of Award or within two months from the readiness of airport, whichever is later, unless any extension is granted by the Implementing Agency. So far, out of the 17 identified airports, RCS flights have already commenced from five airports, namely, Agra, Kanpur, Bareilly, Prayagraj and Hindon.
