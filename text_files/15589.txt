                                                        MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a) to (f)   A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*** Statement referred to in reply to parts (a) to (f) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. *388 to be answered on Friday, the 20th March, 2020 on ‘Conservation of Wetlands’ raised by Shri Bhola Singh and Dr. Sukanta Majumdar.(a) India is a signatory to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and uses the definition of Ramsar Convention which states that ‘Wetlands are areas of marsh, fen, peat land or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six meters’ for identifying wetlands.  Using this definition, Space Application Centre has prepared National Wetland Atlas identifying wetlands covering an area of 15.26 million hectare across the country. The Atlas is available in public domain. The State/UT-wise wetland distribution of India is at Annexure-I.(b) Based on the criteria prescribed by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, 10 more Ramsar sites were designated in the FY 2019-2020 taking the total number of Ramsar sites in the country to 37. The newly designated sites are Nawabganj Bird Sanctuary, Parvati Arga Bird Sanctuary, Saman Bird Sanctuary, Samaspur Bird Sanctuary, Sandi Bird Sanctuary and Sarsai Nawar Jheel from Uttar Pradesh, Nangal Wildlife Sanctuary, Beas Conservation Reserve and Keshopur-Miani Community Reserve from Punjab and Nandur Madhameshwar from Maharashtra. Details of these sites are at Annexure-II.(c) This Ministry is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme of ‘National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Eco-systems (NPCA)’. The scheme aims at holistic conservation and restoration of wetlands including lakes for achieving the desired water quality enhancement, besides improvement in biodiversity and ecosystem through an integrated and multidisciplinary approach and a common regulatory framework. Under the scheme of NPCA, financial support is provided on cost sharing basis between Central Government and respective State Governments for various activities such as interception, diversion and treatment of wastewater, shoreline protection, lake front development, in-situ cleaning i.e. de-silting & de-weeding, storm water management, bioremediation, catchment area treatment, lake beautification, survey & demarcation, bio-fencing, fisheries development, weed control, biodiversity conservation, education and awareness creation, community participation, etc. The details of funds released during last three years are Annexure-III.(d) For conservation and management of wetlands in the country, the Central Government has notified the Wetlands (Conservation & Management) Rules, 2017.  The purpose of the Rules is to promote ‘wise use’ of Wetlands so as to ensure sustainable development of the wetland ecosystem.  In this context, certain activities that have potential adverse impact on wetland are prohibited or regulated.(e) & (f) The wetlands across the country have reportedly been impacted due to rapid urbanization, various developmental activities, pollution problems and other anthropogenic pressures. Ministry has recently initiated a target oriented action programme for rejuvenation and restoration of wetlands across the country. Under this programme, 130 wetlands were taken up in consultation with State Governments/UTs. A four pronged strategy was adopted and the nodal officers and managers of these wetlands have been trained for working out the threats and health of the wetlands. Analysis of the entire exercise has been shared with the State Governments/ UTs and they have been guided to prepare focused management plans based on the threats and health of the wetland. *****
