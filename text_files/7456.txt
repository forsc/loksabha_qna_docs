                                                        ANSWER  THE MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a): As per information received from the NCT of Delhi, no such record is available in this regard.(b) & (c): The Ministry of Women and Child Development is implementing the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (JJ Act) and in the said Act a separate chapter has been added in which stringent penalty has been imposed on whosoever employs or uses any child for the purpose of begging or causes any child to beg. Beggar children in the country fall within the category of Children in need of care and protection (CNCP) as described in the JJ Act. The primary responsibility of execution of the Act lies with the State/UTs. Department of Women & Child Development, National Capital Territory of Delhi is the Nodal Department for implementation of JJ Act & Juvenile Justice (Care & Protection of Children) Model Rules, 2016 thereunder in NCT of Delhi.A child rescued from begging is produced by the Police or Childline or NGO or any other person, before the Child Welfare Committee as per the provisions of JJ Act, who is the Competent Authority to take decision in the best interest of the child, keeping in view his/her socio economic circumstances. If required such children are also housed in the Child Care Institutions run by the Department where they are provided with all basic requirements of boarding, lodging, physical and mental care, formal and non-formal education and efforts are made to mainstream them into the society.  This is a continuous process to elevate the conditions of the children and to mainstream them into the society.   ***
