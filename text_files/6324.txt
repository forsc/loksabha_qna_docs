Opening of new JNVs is acontinuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government/UTadministration to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of thepermanent building and making available required temporary building, free of rent, to run theVidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening ofnew JNV depends on the availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority.OneJNV each has been sanctioned in all the districts of the country (as on 31stMay, 2014) includingthe State of Jharkhand (except the districts in the State of Tamil Nadu which has not yet acceptedthe Scheme).As on date, there are 637 functional JawaharNavodayaVidyalayas (JNVs) in the country.A statement showing the details of JNVs operating in the country including the State ofJharkhand, State/location-wise is annexed.*****
