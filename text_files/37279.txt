The Ministry has given a deadline of September, 2022 for completion of PMGSY-I & II and March, 2023 for RCPLWEA.  The implementation period of PMGSY-III is upto March, 2025.   (d) & (e)   Rural roads is a state subject. As per the programme guidelines of PMGSY, maintenance of roads constructed under the programme is the responsibility of the State Governments and all road works are covered by initial five year maintenance contracts to be entered into along with the construction contract, with the same contractor, as per the Standard Bidding Document. Maintenance funds to service the contract are required to be budgeted by the State Governments and placed at the disposal of the State Rural Roads Development Agencies (SRRDAs) in a separate maintenance account. On expiry of the 5 year post construction maintenance, PMGSY roads are required to be placed under Zonal maintenance contracts consisting of 5 year maintenance including renewal as per maintenance cycle, from time to time, which are also financed by the state governments.            There is no provision under PMGSY for special repairs and re-construction of  roads damaged due to incessant and heavy rains. The state may use funds for such repairs, available under various other provisions. *****
