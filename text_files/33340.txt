                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING; AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS                                                                               [RAO INDERJIT SINGH](a): The Insolvency Law Committee (ILC), which is a Standing Committee constituted by the Government to review the implementation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC), had, in its October, 2018 report, recommended that certain entities may be excluded from applicability of proposed cross-border insolvency provisions under the IBC. The Cross-Border Insolvency Rules/ Regulations Committee (CBIRC), which was constituted in January, 2020 to recommend rules and regulations for cross-border insolvency framework, in its June, 2020 report, recommended that financial service providers and certain other entities as may be notified by the Central Government, may be excluded from the application of cross border insolvency provisions. (b) to (d): Draft legislative framework to deal with cross-border insolvency matters under the IBC, on the basis of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, 1997, was first placed in public domain to invite suggestions from stakeholders in June, 2018. Based on the examination of public comments so received, the ILC made its recommendations in its October, 2018 report suggesting adoption of the UNCITRAL Model Law with certain modifications necessary in the Indian context. Further, certain changes to this framework, based on recommendations of the CBIRC, were placed in public domain to invite comments from stakeholders in November, 2021.(e) and (f): As stated in (a) above, two Committees have examined the legislative framework to deal with cross border insolvency matters under the IBC. The two reports are available on the website of Ministry of Corporate Affairs and that of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India. *****
