                                                    (a) 	whether the Pension revision of those employees who were absorbed by the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) is pending since the past three years; (b) 	if so, the details thereof and the reasons therefor; (c) 	whether the Government is considering revision of Pension for the absorbed retirees of BSNL; and (d) 	if so, the details thereof and if not, the reasons therefor?






ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS,  HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) to (d) 	No, Sir. Pension revision of absorbed employees of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) is linked to the pay revision of the serving employees inasmuch as pension is calculated on the basic pay which the retired employee was earning at the time of retirement. Pension may be revised if the said basic pay is revised on account of pay revision of serving employees.**********
