ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (c):		Unorganised Workers Identification Number (UWIN) Project was envisaged to provide National Database for Unorganised Workers and providing them with unique identification number. The pilot project for UWIN was commissioned in the State of Maharashtra in September, 2018 and the portal was also been made live. During the dry run of the project, it was observed that the software application, although was field ready, lacked the necessary security features and scalability for nation-wide rollout.  As the software application had an in-built feature for Aadhaar authentication, it was necessary to put in place adequate security and data privacy measures in order to make the application sufficiently secure. For a national rollout, the application needs  to  have   the  sufficient  level  of    scalability  so   as  to ensure Contd..2/-::  2  ::stability and reasonable availability for concurrent usage in multiple regions of the country. Further, this data base also required to be Aadhaar Seeded to ensure targeted delivery during the later stage of project.  Accordingly, the entire project was reviewed by this Ministry and it has been slightly retuned. Now, it has been decided that no new card or number will be issued separately to the unorganised workers. A National Database for Unorganised Workers will be prepared and this database will be accessed through Aadhaar number for future references.  National Informatics Centre (NIC) has been entrusted with the task to develop this data base.******
