                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a)  & (b): Yes Sir.  Representations/ demands from various farmers’ organizations for making the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) voluntary for loanee farmers have been received.   To review the scheme to make revisions/ improvements in the crop insurance schemes is a continuous process and decisions on suggestions/representations are taken from time to time after consultation with various stakeholders.  (c):    To increase the coverage under the PMFBY, the Operational Guidelines of the PMFBY provides for creation of awareness among farmers.  Accordingly, Government has taken several initiatives including active involvement of all stakeholders especially States and implementing insurance companies for conduct of publicity campaign/awareness programmes including organization of camps in the rural areas to build farmer awareness about crop insurance schemes.    Insurance companies have been asked to mandatorily utilize 0.5% of gross premium collected by them for publicity and awareness generation.  Other activities for awareness generation involve the publicity of features and benefits of the scheme  through  advertisements in  leading  National/local  News  Papers,  telecast throughaudio-visual media, distribution of pamphlets in local languages, participation in agriculture fairs / mela / goshti, dissemination of SMS through Kisan Portal/national crop insurance portal and conduct of workshops/ trainings of State officials, financial institutions and farmers. Due to these efforts coverage under the scheme has increased to 30% of the Gross Cropped Area (GCA) from 23% in 2015-16 under erstwhile schemes.  Participation of non-loanee farmers have also increased from 5% under erstwhile schemes to 42% (Kharif 2019) under PMFBY.(d): 	Does not arise.*****
