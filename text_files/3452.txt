ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (c) 	Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) was launched with the motto of ‘Har Khet Ko Paani’ for providing end to end solutions in irrigation supply chain, viz.water resources, distribution network and farm level applications. The PMKSY has four programme components, namely: (i) Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP); (ii) Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP); (iii) Per Drop More Crop (PDMC); and (iv) Watershed Development Component (WDC). The successes achieved under different programme components are as below:-i.	Under PMKSY-AIBP, during 2016-17, ninety-nine (99) ongoing major/ medium irrigation projects having ultimate irrigation potential of 76.03 lakh ha were prioritized in consultation with States for completion in phases up to December 2019. During 2016-19, Central assistance of Rs. 9,750.56 crore has been released through NABARD under Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF) for these projects. States have reported creation of an additional irrigation potential of 17.78 lakh ha so far, leading to cumulative irrigation potential of 59.17 lakh ha.  ii.	As part of PMKSY-HKKP component, CADWM works are presently limited to 99 prioritized AIBP projects for pari-passu implementation. Out of 99 prioritized Projects, depending on the requirements of State Governments, 87 projects spread over 17 States have been included under CADWM programme so far. During 2016-19, Central Assistance of Rs.2380.24 crore has been released to 70 projects and works in Culturable Command Area (CCA) of 13.43 lakh ha is reported as completed. Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI) projects are Contd...P/2//2//also funded under PMKSY-HKKP. Since commencement of PMKSY (2015-16), Central Assistance of Rs.2140.4 crore has been released to the States under SMI Scheme with reported creation of irrigation potential of 2.91 lakh ha. The Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of water bodies are also taken up under PMKSY-HKKP component. Since 2015-16, Central Assistance of Rs.265.6 crore has been released to the States under RRR Scheme with reported creation of irrigation potential of 0.763 lakh ha. iii.	The PMKSY-PDMC mainly focuses on water use efficiency at farm level through precision/ micro irrigation. Besides promoting precision irrigation (Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation System) and better on-farm water management practices to optimize the use of available water resources. This component also supports micro level water storage or water conservation/management activities to supplement Micro Irrigation. During 2015-19, Central Assistance of Rs.9,285.44 Cr. has been released to the States with reported Micro-irrigation coverage over 36.17 lakh ha, and protection of irrigation potential over 3.869 lakh ha.  iv.	The PMKSY-WDC is operated primarily keeping at centre stage the degraded land and waste land area treatment. During 2015-19, about 4.79 lakh water harvesting structure were created/ rejuvenated, and an additional area of 10.98 lakh ha has been brought under protective irrigation. 	The above programme components are closely monitored by different Ministries (Ministry of Jal Shakti in case of AIBP and HKKP, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare in case of PDMC, and Ministry of Rural Development in case of WDC).  The field offices of Central Water Commission carry out regular field visits for monitoring of AIBP and HKKP components. A Project Management Unit (PMKSY) has been established for the overall management of Scheme and upkeep of its MIS. A National Executive Committee (NEC) is also constituted under the Chairmanship of Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog to oversee programme implementation, allocation of resources, inter ministerial coordination, monitoring & performance assessment, addressing administrative issues etc.
