                                                        THE MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a):	Disposal of cases pending in various courts is within the domain of judiciary. Timely disposal of cases in courts depends on several factors which, inter-alia, include availability of adequate number of judges and judicial officers, supporting court staff and physical infrastructure, complexity of facts involved, nature of evidence, co-operation of stake holders viz. bar, investigation agencies, witnesses and litigants and proper application of rules and procedures. There are several factors which may lead to delay in disposal of cases.  These, inter-alia, include vacancies of judges, frequent adjournments and lack of adequate arrangement to monitor, track and bunch cases for hearing.  The Central Government is fully committed to speedy disposal of cases in accordance with Article 21 of the Constitution and reducing pendency.  The Government has taken several initiatives to provide an ecosystem for faster disposal of cases by the judiciary.  National Mission for Justice Delivery and Legal Reforms was set up in August, 2011 with the twin objectives of increasing access by reducing delays and arrears in the system and enhancing accountability through structural changes and by setting performance standards and capacities.  The Mission has been pursuing a co-ordinated approach for phased liquidation of arrears and pendency in judicial administration, which, inter-alia, involves better infrastructure for courts including computerization, increase in strength of subordinate judiciary, policy and legislative measures in the areas prone to excessive litigation, re-engineering of court procedure for quick disposal of cases and emphasis on human resource development.(b):	The National Court Management System was constituted in the Supreme Court in May, 2012.  The major recommendations of the NCMS Committee include preparation of Baseline Reports on National Framework of Court Excellence, Case Management System, Court Development Planning System &Human Resource Development Strategy.  So far as the Judicial Infrastructure facilities are concerned, the Union Government has been implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for Development of Infrastructure Facilities in district and subordinate courts by providing financial assistance to State Governments / UTs in the prescribed fund sharing pattern since 1993-94. The scheme has been evaluated from time to time.The third party evaluation of the CSS for Judicial Infrastructure was got done through NITI Aayog recently, which recommended continuance of the scheme. (c):   The requisite details as maintained High Court wise is attached at Annexure-I. (d):  The requisite details are attached at Annexure-II.(e)&(f):	A proposal has been received from the Chief Justice of India for setting up of National Judicial Infrastructure Authority of India (NJIAI) for arrangement of adequate infrastructure for courts, as per which there will be a Governing Body with Chief Justice of India as Patron-in-Chief. The other salient features in the proposal are that NJIAI willact as a Central body in laying down the road map for planning, creation, development, maintenance and management of functional infrastructure for the Indian Court System, besides, identical structures under all the High Courts.  Presently, the primary responsibility of development of Infrastructure facilities for judiciary rests with the State Governments.  To augment the resources of the State Governments, the Union Government has been implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for Development of Infrastructure Facilities in district and subordinate courts by providing financial assistance to State Governments / UTs in the prescribed fund sharing pattern.The Scheme is being implemented since 1993-94. Till date the Central Government has sanctioned Rs. 8709.77 crore under the Scheme to States/UTs. The scheme has been extended from time to time.  Under this scheme funds are released by theCentral Government for construction of court buildings and residential accommodations for Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Judiciary. The Government has extended the above scheme for a further period of five years from 01.04.2021 to 31.03.2026, with a total budgetary outlay of Rs.9000 crores, including Central share of Rs.5307 crores. The scheme components have been expanded, to also cover the construction of toilets, digital computer rooms and Lawyers’ Hall in the district and subordinate courts. As per information made available by the High Courts, 20,565 Court Halls and 18,142 Residential Units are available in the District and Subordinate Courts as on 31.10.2021.
