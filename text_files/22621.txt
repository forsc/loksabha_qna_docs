                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b) Calicut Airport is owned and operated by Airports Authority of India (AAI) and licensed by Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) for public use category. Accordingly, adequate safety measures are already in place for ensuring safe operation of aircraft at Calicut International Airport as per International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards and DGCA Civil Aviation Requirements. However, a Committee constituted to identify airports for deployment of additional safety measures has made a few recommendations in respect of Calicut International Airport such as exploring the feasibility of providing 280m runway strip instead of 150m at present, construction of Runway End Safety Area at both ends of runway to reduce payload restrictions of aircraft, exploring the feasibility of increasing length of runway and filling/ levelling and construction of embankments.(c) In view of COVID-19 pandemic situation, the number of Embarkation Points for Haj 2021 has been reduced from existing 21 to 10. Calicut International Airport has not been designated as an Embarkation Point for Haj 2021. Moreover, embarkation point are decided by the Ministry of Minority Affairs on the recommendation of Haj Committee of India.
