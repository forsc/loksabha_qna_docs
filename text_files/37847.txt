ANSWER




                                                                   THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE  MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                           (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a) & (b): Land and Colonization are State Subjects. Therefore, Schemes on housing are implemented by States/ Union Territories (UTs). However, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs under the vision of ‘Housing for All’, is supplementing the efforts of States/ UTs by providing Central Assistance under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) for construction of houses for all eligible families/ beneficiaries. Eligible beneficiaries can avail the benefit of PMAY-U through four verticals, i.e., Beneficiary-led Construction or enhancement (BLC); Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP); ‘In-Situ’ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) and Credit Linked SubsidyScheme (CLSS).  Under PMAY-U, State/ UT-wise details of houses sanctioned during last three and current year (2018-2022) along with status of houses grounded for construction and completed are at Annexure-I.(c) & (d): As per Scheme guidelines, the minimum size of houses constructed under the Mission under each component should be conform to the standards provided in the National Building Code (NBC). However, if the available area of land does not permit building of such minimum size of houses as per NBC and, if beneficiary consent is available for reduced size of house, a suitable decision on area maybe taken by States/ UTs with the approval of State Level Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee (SLSMC). The Mission supports construction of houses upto 30 square meter carpet area with basic civic infrastructure. States/ Uts have flexibility in terms of determining the size of house and other facilities at the State/ UT level in consultation with the Ministry. Under CLSS vertical, permissible carpet areas are as under:Particulars    Economically Weaker   Low Income      Middle Income        Middle Income                Section (EWS)	     Group (LIG)     Group  (MIG-I)	  Group MIG-II)	 Scheme duration     17.06.2015 to 31.03.2022	        01.01.2017 to 31.03.2021Carpet Area	  Upto 30 sqm.	   Upto 60 sqm.	       Upto 160 sqm	  Upto 200 sqm.States/ Uts are required to adhere to the area of the houses as proposed in Detailed Project Reports.                                           ******
