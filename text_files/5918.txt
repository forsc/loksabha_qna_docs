ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a): No, Sir. Union Government does not propose to take up the operation and maintenance of small airports such as Jeypore, Utkela and Rourkela through Airports Authority of India (AAI). Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik) in October, 2016 with the objective to facilitate / stimulate regional air connectivity to currently underserved and unserved airports in the country. The operationalization of airports under the scheme is ''demand driven'', depending upon firm commitment from airline operators as well as from the State Government for providing various concessions.The airports at Jeypore, Utkela and Rourkela have been included in the RCS scheme and the bids have been received from M/s Alliance Air for operations from Rourkela Airport.;;(b): Does not arise.;(c) & (d): Under RCS - UDAN, the Union Government is providing 80% of the share in Viability Gap Funding (VGF) for States other than North-Eastern States, A&N Islands and Lakshadweep Islands, where the share of Union Government is 90%. The Union Government is also bearing the cost of up-gradation of airports for operationalization under RCS.;;One of the guiding principles of the scheme is to minimize the cost of operations for air transport operators through concessions from State Governments. RCS is, accordingly. to be made operational only in States and at airports/helipads which demonstrate their commitment and support to regional air transport operations by providing concessions / support as required under the Scheme. ;
