SREEKANDAN TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 23.03.2022 REGARDING MANUFACTURE OF ALUMINIUM COACHES	(a)	The work of land acquisition and preliminary works in Palakkad has been sanctioned in 2012-13. Railways has purchased 228.85 acres of land from Govt of Kerala in 2012 and completed the preliminary works.Another work of setting up of Rail Coach Factory at Palakkad in Kerala was sanctioned in the Railway Budget 2012-13 in JV/PPP mode. However, a pre-requisite to setting up such projects is a sustained demand of coaches in the future. The requirement of coaches vis-à-vis available manufacturing capacity has been reviewed. The requirement of main line coaches in near future does not justify immediately initiating construction of a new coach factory. 	(b) and (c) : Do not arise	(d) Yes, Sir. 	(e) The representations in this regard have been received as follows:•	From General Manager/Southern Railway vide letter dated 23.04.2018.•	From Hon’ble Chief Minister, Kerala vide letter dated 14.06.2018.•	From Chairman, Administrative Reforms Commission Member, Kerala Legislative Assembly vide letter dated 21.06.2018.•	From PS/MoS (IC) for Tourism & Minister of State for Electronics & Information Technology vide letter dated 05.03.2018.•	From an Hon’ble Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha) vide letter dated 18.03.2018.However, adequate capacity of coach production in Indian Railways exists for meeting the present demand and that in near future, immediate start of a new coach factory is not contemplated.*****
