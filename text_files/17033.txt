                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):	The epidemic curve of any pandemic goes through an ascending, peaking and descending phase. The current phase of pandemic in India is on multiple trajectories across the urban and semi urban areas of the country. Since the country has a huge population, it is expected that there would be large number of cases every day during this phase. However, the cases and deaths per million population in India is among the lowest if one were to compare between similarly affected countries.(c) & (d):	According to WHO, the extent to which children contribute to transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains incompletely understood. Young children seem to have lower susceptibility to infection compared to adults. Infection among children is generally mild. Current evidence also suggests that children are less likely than adults to be main transmitters of infection. In India, children 0-17 years of age account for 8% of the total cases, which is similarly to globally reported figures. COVID-19 infection in children generally causes mild disease, and serious illness due to COVID-19 is seen only infrequently.
