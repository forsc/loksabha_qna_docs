                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a)	The National Export Insurance Account (NEIA) Trust aims to ensure the availability of credit risk cover for projects and other high-value exports, which are desirable from the point of view of national interest, but which ECGC is unable to underwrite due to capacity constraints or at terms, which are different from its regular policies. NEIA provides additional support to the insurance cover provided by ECGC for project exports making Indian project exporters more competitive and gain a stronger foothold in various jurisdictions, highlighting India’s capabilities to execute large projects abroad.(b)	Yes, Sir. Government has approved financial aid for the period from 2021-22 to 2025-26 to NEIA Trust. (c)	Government has approved Grant-in-aid infusion of Rs.1,650 crore into NEIA Trust during 2021-22 to 2025-26.(d)	No, Sir.(e)	In view of the reply at (d) above, question does not arise. ****
