ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Van Dhan Vikas Karyakram is an initiative targeting livelihood generation for tribal population by harnessing the wealth of forest i.e. Van Dhan. The programme aims to tap into the traditional knowledge and skill sets of tribal people by adding technology and Information Technology for upgradation of output at each stage and to convert the tribal wisdom into a remunerative economic activity. Van Dhan Vikas Karyakram seeks to promote and leverage the collective strength of tribal people to achieve a viable scale. (b) & (c) Implementation of Van Dhan Vikas Karyakram is through Van Dhan Kendras. Selection of a place for setting up of a Van Dhan Kendra is dependent upon the area’s potential and availability of land to be provided by the State Government. The number of Van Dhan Kendras developed depends on the above factors. A National Workshop was held on 28/02/19 for all State Nodal Departments i.e. Tribal Welfare & Forest Departments to sensitize them for implementation of the scheme in the respective States.*****
