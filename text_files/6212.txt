ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE;AND MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING(SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR):(a) and (b): No such data is available.(c) In GST regime, cinema tickets of price Rs. 100 or less attracts GST of 12% and tickets of price more than Rs. 100 attracts GST of 18%. Input tax credit (ITC) of tax paid on goods and input services is also freely available.	As compared to this, pre GST era weighted average of entertainment tax on admission to cinema, based on Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) data, was more than 30%. Input tax credit (ITC) of tax paid on goods and input services was also not available, thereby making the effective incidence of tax even higher. 	Therefore, under GST regime, tax on cinema tickets has significantly reduced.(d) The subject exhibition of cinema and regulation of cinema screens/ theatres fall within jurisdiction of respective State Government. However, as per report of Economic Survey 2018-19, number of screen in the country has been reached upto 9601 in 2018 from 9530 in 2017.(e): The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in the process of introduction of a component ‘Incentive to State Governments/ Union Territories to increase theatre density” under-sub scheme Audio Visual Services of Champion Services Sectors Scheme. Under this component, financial incentive will be provided through respective State Governments/ Union Territories to such applicants who are interested in establishing single screen cinema theatres in non-metro (tier II and III) cities of the country.
