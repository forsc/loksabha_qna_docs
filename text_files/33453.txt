ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (Finance) (a)	to (e) Representations have been received from time to time which include the request for restoration of Old Pension Scheme. There is no proposal under consideration of Government of India for restoration of old pension scheme in respect of Central Government employees recruited on or after 01.01.2004. The National Pension System (NPS) was introduced by the Government of India to replace the defined benefit pension system by defined contribution pension scheme in order to provide old age income security in a fiscally sustainable manner and to channelize the small savings into productive sectors of the economy through prudential investments.******
