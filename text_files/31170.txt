                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a):	 Yes Sir.  Sale/movement of wheat through rake under OMSS (D) policy 2021-22,  bidders who intend to purchase large quantity in a single e-auction will be allowed to participate. A bidder will have to bid for minimum 05 rakes (one rake = 2650 MT) and there will be no upper restriction on number of rakes that a bidder may bid.(b):	Under OMSS (D) 2021-22, small private trader can purchase wheat from 1-9 MT per person per depot from nominated FCI/State Agency depots  without participation in e-auction.   Further a bulk consumer/trader can bid for the Minimum and maximum quantity of wheat ranging from 10 MT (in multiple of 10) and 5000 MT respectively. For rice the minimum and maximum quantity that a bulk consumer/trader can bid is 50 MT and 3500 MT respectively.(c):	The objective of the OMSS (D) scheme is to offload the Foodgrain stocks in central pool over and above buffer and strategic reserve norms through open sale. Since the introduction of OMSS (D) scheme for the year 2021-22, there is substantial Increase in quantum of sale compared to last year which is serving the very objective of offloading of surplus stock as well as controlling inflationary trends in economy.****
