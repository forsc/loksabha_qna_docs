ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): Ministry of Civil Aviation has been receiving requests for connecting various cities by air across the country including Belagavi-Mangalore sector. As per approved Winter Schedule (WS)-2019, no scheduled domestic airline has filed the request to commence direct flights between Belagavi and Mangalore. As per WS-2019, scheduled airlines are operating 22 flights per week on Bengaluru-Belagavi-Bengaluru sector. Further, flights from Belagavi to Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Indore, Mumbai, Mysore, Pune and Tirupati have also commenced under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)-UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik).;;With repeal of Air Corporation Act in March, 1994, the Indian domestic aviation was deregulated. Airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type and select whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate. Government has laid down Route Dispersal Guidelines, with a view to achieve better regulation of air transport services of different regions in the country. It is, however, up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability. As such, the airlines are free to operate anywhere in the country subject to compliance of Route Dispersal Guidelines issued by Government.
