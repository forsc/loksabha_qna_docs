ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a), (b) and (c): During the 12th India – U.S. Trade Policy Forum (TPF) meeting held in November, 2021, both the countries agreed to finalize work on market access facilitation for mangoes, pomegranates and pomegranate arils from India and cherries and alfalfa hay from the United States.  In addition, U.S. agreed to work to complete market access for table grapes from India to the United States, and India agreed to work to finalize the export certificate to allow the importation of pork and pork products from USA.In pursuance of the above, the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and U.S. Department of Agriculture have signed a framework agreement for implementing the market access issues i.e., inspection / oversight transfer for Indian mangoes and pomegranates and market access for pomegranate arils from India, and market access for cherries and alfalfa hay from USA. Further, as agreed in the TPF meeting, both sides are in the process of finalizing the Veterinary Health Certificate for export of pork and pork products from USA. Similarly, the U.S. is also working on providing market access for table grapes from India.These measures are likely to boost bilateral trade between India and the U.S., benefiting both the countries.******
