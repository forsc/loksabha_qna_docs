ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	A Statement showing State/UT-wise number of beneficiaries successfully registered on PM-Kisan Portal and who have received the financial benefits under the Scheme till date is enclosed at Annexure-I.(c) & (d):	Yes, Sir. The Government has extended the PM-KISAN Scheme to all farmers in the country, irrespective of the size of their landholdings, subject to all other existing exclusion criteria relating for higher income strata. For calculating the total number of eligible farmers in the country, the projections of landholding farmers’ data of Agricultural Census 2015-16 for the year 2018-19 have been utilized, as per which the total number of projected landholdings are 15,11,46,000.   The State/UT-wise projections are given in Annexure-II (Column-IV). After exclusions, the approximate total number of Small and Marginal Farmer beneficiaries as per the original Scheme beneficiaries had been taken as 12.50 crores. In the same way, the approximate total number of beneficiaries under the revised Scheme has been taken as 14.50 crores. Initially Rs.75000 crore was allocated for the Scheme for the financial year 2019-20.  With expansion of the ambit of the scheme, the expected expenditure of the Scheme for the financial year 2019-20 has been revised to Rs.87,217.50 crore, including the administrative charges of Rs.217.50 crore. Further, the Government has approved a pension scheme for all Small and Marginal Farmers (SMF) in the country, subject to certain exclusion clauses, with a view to provide them social security net as they have minimal or no savings to provide for old age and to support them in the event of consequent loss of livelihood. The scheme provides for payment of a minimum fixed pension of Rs.3,000/- per month to the eligible farmers on attaining the age of 60 years. It is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme, with entry age of 18 to 40 years. The beneficiary can opt to become member of the Scheme by subscribing to a Pension Fund, managed by the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC). The farmers have the option to allow his/her voluntary contribution to the Scheme from the benefit drawn by him/her on account of PM-KISAN Scheme directly. The Central Government’s share is 50% of the monthly contribution. For example, the beneficiary is required to contribute Rs100/ - per month in the pension fund at median entry age of 29 years, with matching contribution of Rs.100 by the Central Government. On death of the subscriber, the spouse / heir may continue to subscribe to the Scheme. On death of the pensioner farmers, his / her spouse is entitled to receive 50% of the pension as family pension, provided he/she is not already an SMF beneficiary of the Scheme. The data of original PM-Kisan Scheme of 12.5 crores Small and Marginal Farmers (Annexure-II, Column-III) has been taken as the basis for arriving at the total number of beneficiaries for pension scheme. After exclusions, the net beneficiaries in the prescribed age group of 18-40 years are expected to be about 5 crore farmers.
