                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a):  As per the Census 2011, there are 695 villages in Andhra Pradesh which have more than 50% Scheduled Castes population. The district-wise details are at Annexure-I(b): Yes, Sir. To enable an area based development approach for Scheduled Caste persons, the Government is implementing the Scheme of Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana (PMAGY) since 2009-10 with the aim of integrated development of villages having Scheduled Castes population of more than 50%. (c) to (e): Whereas 07 villages were taken up under the Scheme in Andhra Pradesh in 2014-15, 99 have been selected in 2018-19. The district-wise details are at Annexure-I. Apart from infrastructure development, the scheme relies heavily on convergence of the Schemes of Central as well as State Governments so as to ensure that the residents are provided with all such critical infrastructure and basic services as are necessary to have a dignified living, creating thereby an environment in which everyone is enabled to utilise her/his potential to the fullest.As per the latest guidelines of 2018-19, the selected villages are required to improve their score against 50 pre-set monitorable socio-economic indicators under 10 domains of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Education, Health and Nutrition, Social Security, Rural Roads and Housing, Agricultural Practices, Electricity and Clean Fuel, Financial Inclusion, Digitization, Livelihood and Skill Development. As per the provisions of the Scheme, in order to ensure stabilization and improvement in the monitorable indicators, the convergent implementation of the Schemes is to continue for a period of 05 years from the date of start of implementation.****
