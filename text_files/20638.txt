                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c): As per constitutional provisions, ‘Health’ is a State subject. It is the responsibility of the respective State/Union Territory (UT) Government to take cognizance of instances of charging of high rates from patients by hospitals, including private hospitals and take action to prevent and control such practices. Such complaints, as and when received at the Centre, are therefore forwarded to the concerned States/UTs. The details in this regard are not maintained Centrally.  States/UTs are also being provided required assistance for strengthening of their healthcare system including management of the COVID-19 Public Health Challenge from time to time. Further, the Government of India has enacted the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010 and notified Clinical Establishments (Central Government) Rules, 2012 for registration and regulation of clinical establishments (both Government and Private).   As on date, the Act is applicable in 11 States and 5 UTs.   In the States/UTs where the said Act is applicable, the clinical establishments are required to meet several norms, which also include charging rates for each type of procedure and service within the determined range of rates, display of rates at a conspicuous place etc. The implementation and monitoring of the Clinical Establishments Act is within the remit of the respective State Government/UT Administration.
