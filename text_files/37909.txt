ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)a) to c) ‘Seekho Aur Kamao’ scheme (Learn and Earn) is a placement-linked skill development scheme for minorities. It aims to upgrade the skills of minority youth (in the age group of 14-45 years) in various modern/ traditional skills depending upon their qualification, present economic trends, and market potential, that can earn them suitable employment or make them suitably skilled to take up self-employment. 33% of the total targets in the scheme are earmarked for female beneficiaries.Under Seekho aur Kamao scheme, till date about 4.60 lakh beneficiaries have been trained under the same and of this, 2.64 lakh beneficiaries (58% of total trained) are females.    In the state of Andhra Pradesh, 14,845 No. of beneficiaries have been trained out of which 8,951 are female beneficiaries.  The scheme is implemented by Project Implementing Agencies (PIAs) that are empanelled by the Ministry by inviting applications from all over India. The scheme mandates at least 75% placement out of which at least 50% should be in wage employment. The data on number of trainees who were trained and employed within three months of being trained is not maintained in the Ministry. However, 1,72,005 beneficiaries have been reported as placed/ employed out of which 7,577 are in the State of Andhra Pradesh.   Beside this, the Ministry also implements  “Nai Manzil”  Scheme to benefit the minority youth  (both men & women) belonging to six notified minority communities of 17-35 years of age,  who do not have  formal school leaving certificate, i.e., those in the category of school –dropouts  or  these educated in community education institutions like Madarasas. 30% of the beneficiary seats are earmarked for girl/women candidates and 5% of the beneficiary seats for persons with disability belonging to the minority community under the scheme.  The scheme provides a combination of formal education (Class VIII or X) and skills, to enable beneficiaries to seek better employment and livelihood.  The Scheme is implemented through selected Project Implementing Agencies (PIAs) which are empanelled through an open transparent process by inviting Expression of Interest (EOIs) for organizations. Under the Nai Manzil scheme, since inception, a total of 98697 beneficiaries (both male and female) were  enrolled out of which 39,635 female candidates were skill certified.  Out of the total placement of 34,340 beneficiaries, 833 are in the State of Andhra Pradesh.Maulana Azad Education Foundation (MAEF) has launched Gharib Nawaz Skill Development Training for minorities from the year 2017-18 which has been renamed as Gharib Nawaz Employment Scheme from the year 2019- 20. Under this scheme various short-term job oriented skill development courses are provided to minorities youth in order to enable them for skill based employment. This scheme is being implemented as per common norms of the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSD&E) through the empanelled Program Implementing Agencies (PIAs). Under this Scheme, since inception a total 67,986 beneficiaries ( out of which 39,297 females) have been skill trained . Upgrading the Skills and Training in Traditional Arts/Crafts for Development (USTTAD) scheme was launched on 14th May, 2015 to preserve the rich heritage of traditional arts/crafts of minorities. The scheme aims at capacity building and updating the traditional skills of master craftsmen/artisans, documentation of identified traditional arts/crafts of minorities, set standards for traditional skills, training of minority youths in various identified traditional arts/crafts through master craftsmen, and develop national and international market linkages.
