                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS,HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a)	No, Sir.

During the last five years, 62 new post office buildings have been constructed across the country and 4114 postal buildings have been renovated and given face-lifting with financial expenditure of around `730.0 Crore. Further, when a building is taken on rent for the purpose of operating a post office, it is ensured that the building meets all requirements, like prescribed schedule of accommodation, connectivity, good physical condition of the building and other essential facilities. The rent is revised periodically as per the agreement. If any rented building is not found suitable, the post office is shifted to another suitable building.(d)	Yes, Sir. In order to improve the functioning of Department, Core Banking Solution (CBS) has been implemented in 23760 Post Offices and 996 Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) have also been installed. Our ATM cards are inter-operable with the banks. Further, intra-operable Net-Banking and Mobile Banking facilities have been launched in Core Banking Post Offices for Post Office Saving Bank (POSB) customers. With this facility, a POSB customer can be able to view balances, view transaction details, open new Recurring Deposit (RD)/Time Deposit (TD) accounts, close RD/TD Accounts, make Public Provident Fund deposits, transfer fund to another Post Office Savings Account and lodge stop cheque request etc, online. Further, India Post Payments Bank(IPPB) has been incorporated as a public limited company under the Department of Posts with 100% Government of India equity on 17th August, 2016.
