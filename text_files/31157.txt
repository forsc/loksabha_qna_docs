Most of the powers under the Act have been delegated by the Central Government to the State Governments with the direction that they shall exercise these powers. The Prevention of Black-marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980 is complementary to the EC Act, 1955. It is implemented on an ongoing basis through the State Governments/ UT Administrations for the prevention of illegal and unethical trade practices like hoarding and black-marketing of essential commodities etc.*****
