At the time of launch of Jal Jeevan Mission on 15thAugust, 2019, out of total 18.98 Crore rural households in the country, 3.23 (17%) crore rural households had tap water connections. Since then, 4.56 Crore (24%) rural households have been provided with tap water connections thus, as on date, 7.79 Crore (41%) rural households in the country have provision of tap water supply.A number of steps have been taken to plan and implement JJM with speed, inter alia, which includes detailed discussion and finalization of annual action plan (AAP) of States/ UTs, regular review of implementation, workshops/ conferences/ webinars for capacity building and knowledge sharing, field visits by multi-disciplinary team to provide technical support, etc. A detailed Operational Guideline for the implementation of JJM; Margdarshika for Gram Panchayats & VWSCs to provide safe drinking water in rural households and Guidelines on 100–days campaign to provide piped water supply in anganwadi centres, ashramshalas and schools have been shared with States/ UTs to facilitate planning and implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission. For online monitoring, JJM–Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) and JJM–Dashboard has been put in place. Provision has also been made for transparent online financial management through Public Financial Management System (PFMS). (c) 	The State/ UTs wise details of budgetary allocation made under the mission in 2021-22, are at Annex–I.(d)	The status of JJM implementation in blocks of Osmanabad, Washim and Yavatmal districts of Maharashtra is at Annex–II.(e)	As on 15thAugust, 2019, at the time of launch of Jal Jeevan Mission, in Maharashtra, out of total 142.36 lakh rural households, 48.44 lakh households (34%) had tap water connections.
