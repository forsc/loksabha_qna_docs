MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (c)	It is estimated that in early 2021, there were around 5,000 Indians working in Afghanistan including those employed by the United Nations, and other countries. In view of the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan, the Government of India issued several security advisories from April 2021 onwards. As a result, many Indian nationals had left Afghanistan.	After 15 August 2021, under the Government of India’s “Operation Devi Shakti”, 438 Indians were evacuated from Afghanistan. A few Indians, who had contacted the Special Afghanistan Cell and desired to be evacuated, still remain stranded. The Special Afghanistan Cell is in touch with these remaining Indians.***
