ANSWER




ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)  (a) to (d):    As per census 2011 data, the sex ratio for India is 943 females to 1000 males which translate to 48.5% females in the country. Further, as per the vaccination coverage reported on Co-WIN as on 07.07.2021, out of 35.89 crore vaccinations done across the country, a total of 16.63 crore vaccinations were of women i.e.46.32% of the total vaccinations.               The difference of approximately 2% between estimated proportion of females and proportion of vaccinations of females could be due to earlier guidelines which had mentioned pregnancy and lactation as contra-indications for COVID-19 vaccination. However, subsequent to review of evolving scientific evidence, COVID-19 vaccination has been allowed for lactating women from 19.05.2021 and for pregnant women from 02.07.2021. The COVID-19 vaccination drive does not make any discrimination on the basis of gender, socio-economic conditions or residence etc of citizens. *****
