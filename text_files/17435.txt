The health of these tribals has been vigorously monitored and proactive measures to prioritize their testing have helped early detection of cases. 11(Eleven) infected members of the Great Andamanese tribes are among those who were either themselves engaged or had families working in Government establishments.

These translated guidelines have been widely circulated among the tribal people including PVTGs for generating awareness on COVID-19.
