                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT        (SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a)    The Government of India had set up a dedicated fund called ‘Nirbhaya Fund’ for implementation of initiatives aimed at enhancing the safety and security for women in the country. An Empowered Committee (EC) of officers constituted under Nirbhaya Framework appraises and recommends the proposals for funding under Nirbhaya Fund in conjunction with the concerned Ministries/ Departments/ Implementing Agencies. After appraisal by the EC, the concerned Ministries/ Departments obtain approval of their respective competent financial authorities to release funds out of their respective budgets and implement the approved projects/ schemes directly or through States/ UTs/ Implementing Agencies. Under the Nirbhaya Fund, one of the schemes namely “One Stop Centre (OSC) Scheme” is implemented across the country since 1st April 2015. OSCs aim to facilitate women affected by violence with a range of integrated services under one roof such as Police facilitation, medical aid, providing legal and psycho-social counselling and temporary shelter. OSCs are to be set up within 2 kms radius of the hospitals or medical facilities either in new constructed building in an approved design or in pre-existing buildings. Under the scheme, One Stop Centres are being set up in all districts of the country. So far, 704 OSCs have been operationalised and more than three lakh women have been assisted through them. (b) & (c)  The details of funds released and utilised under the OSC scheme during the last three years, State/UT-wise including Karnataka, Rajasthan and Assam are placed at Annexure-I. (d)      The details of number of centres set up under the scheme, State/UT-wise including Rajasthan and Assam are placed at Annexure-II. (e)      The Ministry of Women and Child Development has decided to implement the umbrella scheme for safety, security and empowerment of women as an integrated women empowerment programme under the name ‘Mission Shakti’, including the component of One Stop Centres.  For providing speedy assistance and services to distressed and violence affected women at OSCs, the Ministry has decided to set up more OSCs in areas which are distant from district headquarters or are having high rates of crime against women, to enhance the costing provisions for OSCs, and to further enhance the synergy and coordination of OSCs with the other initiatives of the government, including those under Nirbhaya Fund and under Mission Shakti.*****  Annexure-I Annexure referred to in reply to parts (b) & (c) of Lok Sabha Un-starred Question No. 3167 for answer on 06.08.2021 regarding ‘Nirbhaya Scheme’ The State/UT-wise details of funds released and utilised under the scheme (OSC) during the last three years,(Amount in Rupees)Sl.No.	States/UTs	Amount released	Utilisation		2018-19	2019-20	2020-21	1	Andaman and Nicobar Islands	3687641	4159792	3859069	79909512	Andhra Pradesh	39063148	26099278	21105250	351435453	Arunachal Pradesh	78202084	13418151	52014408	88115084	Assam	78695087	80408520	63614400	154926975	Bihar	30832455	104609180	70966339	9898136	Chandigarh	930799	1500450	3383756	23812497	Chattishgarh	66244372	67738483	35320987	877362698	Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu	50000	7345503	4601200	3068799	Delhi	0	36255258	18304950	885190310	Goa	492000	1500450	3000900	39200011	Gujarat	56269778	67951666	85084669	6333610112	Haryana	47960546	40192416	40443694	4236275813	Himachal Pradesh	10118850	31729794	19805400	170395014	Jammu and Kashmir	15020425	9639473	22483933	725320415	Jharkhand	70436941	40853107	69124908	3553669416	Karnataka	59444419	58203580	73508758	1742320817	Kerala	28331849	14090453	23705850	851607618	Ladakh-UT	0	0	6545042	220317219	Lakshdweep	0	2091225	1350225	020	Madhya Pradesh	112391390	167092445	104431900	6051982221	Maharashtra	38929425	66998501	64620010	2134425722	Manipur	35722445	24884407	50193815	2043659223	Meghalaya	18639947	37430224	21161595	967646724	Mizoram	27264535	21870881	17263928	1706567525	Nagaland	45487024	19173411	33590577	4297980826	Odisha	77459998	20934647	93155192	1500598527	Puducherry	4766836	4376136	7201800	028	Punjab	52633488	35183739	48461272	3339419229	Rajasthan	30860275	67711508	56686911	2273809130	Sikkim	3923225	6809569	6601800	12360831	Tamil Nadu	113995447	71359691	106060397	11740758532	Telangana	58948915	62446827	77573415	3063578633	Tripura	26901349	6001800	15603600	034	Uttar Pradesh	222830497	123193989	228832664	12981149335	Uttrakhand	27225409	22907445	27308659	3036038136	West Bengal	0	9546450	19890150	0 ***** Annexure-II Annexure referred to in reply to part (d) of Lok Sabha Un-starred Question No. 3167 for answer on 06.08.2021 regarding ‘Nirbhaya Scheme’ The State/UT-wise details of number of centres set up under the scheme (OSC) Sl.No.	States / UTs	Number of OSCs set up1.
