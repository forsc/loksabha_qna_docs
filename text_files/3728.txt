ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a)	to (c):	A statement is laid on the table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION No. 309 FOR 15.07.2019 ASKED BY DR. SANJAY JAISWAL, HON’BLE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT REGARDING MODEL DEGREE COLLEGES. (a) to (c):	Under Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA), Central assistance has been approved for creation of 130 New Model Degree Colleges (MDC)  with a unit cost of Rs. 12.00 crores each (including State share). Based on Detailed Project Reports (DPRs), undertakings, land documents etc provided by the State Governments, an amount of Rs. 655 crores has been released for 121 MDCs as central support. Further funding is dependent upon submission of documents such as Utilisation Certificates, physical inspection reports etc.	Under RUSA 1.0, Cabinet had approved establishment of 60 MDCs. These MDCs were to be established in Educationally Backward Districts (EBDs). In addition to 60 MDCs, 12 more MDCs were approved in-principle by Project Approval Board (PAB) of RUSA. The in-principle approvals were made subject to approval of the Cabinet. As part of the approval for RUSA 2.0, the Cabinet had approved establishment of 70 more MDCs. However, in RUSA 2.0 the eligibility of districts for establishing MDCs has been changed from EBDs to Aspirational Districts identified by NITI Aayog and in unserved and underserved areas in North-Eastern and Himalayan States. Therefore, the additional 12 MDCs approved in RUSA 1.0, including 1 in West Champaran were cancelled in the 12th meeting of the Project Approval Board (PAB) of RUSA held in 25th May, 2018.Additionally, in the 15th meeting of the PAB held on 24th January, 2019, one new professional College costing Rs. 26 crores (including State share) was approved for the State of Bihar to be established in one of the five places proposed by the State Government i.e. West Champaran, Rohtas, Kaimur (Bhabua), Navada or Jamui.***
