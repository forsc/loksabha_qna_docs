The Programme has got extended for a period of five years from the year 2021-22 to 2025-26. Substantial progress has been made under DILRMP.

As per information provided by Department of Rural Development, representations were received from State Government of Andhra Pradesh and other public representatives regarding including the work of planting of stones and clearing the bushes during re-survey of Lands under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA. In this regards after detailed examination of the matter it was found that the proposed work is not permissible activity under the Mahatma Gandhi NREGA, as they are not-tangible and will not lead to creation of productive and durable assets.  Thus the proposal of State Government of Andhra Pradesh was not accepted as the proposed activity was not in line of the objectives of the Mahatma Gandhi NREG Act.
