ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c): Out  of  a  total  of  420  Wellness  Centres  under  Central  Government  Health  Scheme (CGHS),  124  Wellness  Centres  are  functioning  in rented  buildings  including  the  Wellness Centres (D-91) at Kishangarh, Delhi. A statement showing such CGHS Wellness Centres housed in rented buildings is at Annexure. Shifting  of  Wellness  Centres  to  their permanent  buildings depends  on  the  availability  of  suitable  land/  building  and  other  resources.  This is  a  continuous process.  Efforts  are  made  to  ensure  that  neither  CGHS  beneficiaries  nor  Medical  Officers/ employees at Wellness Center(s) face inconvenience.
