ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND PENSIONS AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a) & (b):   The Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2014 (No. 17 of 2014) was notified on 12th May, 2014. In terms of provision of sub-section (3) of section 1 of the Act, the provisions of the Act shall come into force on such date as the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint.  No such notification has been made by the Government for the reason that the Act requires amendments aimed at safeguarding against disclosures affecting sovereignty and integrity of India, Security of the State, etc., before it is brought into force. To make these amendments to the Act, the Government introduced the Whistle Blowers Protection (Amendment) Bill, 2015 in the Lok Sabha on 11th May, 2015 which was passed by the Lok Sabha on 13th May, 2015 but discussion on the Bill remained inconclusive in Rajya Sabha. The Bill has since lapsed upon the dissolution of the Sixteenth Lok Sabha. (c) & (d):    No such data is centrally maintained by this Department. The framework of existing laws such as Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code etc. is considered adequate to provide for safety and security to all citizens, including RTI activists. Further it is stated that maintenance of law and order and providing safety and security for all citizens is primarily the subject matter of State Government concerned. *****
