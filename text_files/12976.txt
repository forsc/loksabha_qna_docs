ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a)	& (b) Government follows a policy of strategic disinvestment of CPSEs, which are not in ‘priority sector’.  For this purpose NITI Aayog has been mandated to identify such CPSEs based on the criteria of (i) National Security; (ii) Sovereign function at arm’s length; and (iii) Market Imperfections and Public Purpose.  Profitability and loss are not among the relevant criteria.Government also follows a policy of closure of CPSEs as per the approved revised guidelines dated 14.06.2018 issued by the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE). Government may consider closure of the CPSE on a case to case basis even in cases earlier approved for strategic disinvestment.(c) The guidelines dated 14.06.2018 on closure of CPSEs addresses these concerns also.      (d) The government had given ‘in-principle’ approval for strategic disinvestment of 34 CPSEs, including subsidiaries, Units and Joint Ventures.  List of CPSEs, Subsidiaries, Units and Joint Ventures for which Government has given ‘in-principle’ approval, which are still pending for strategic disinvestment, is given at Annexure - I.(e) The Budget target (revised) for disinvestment during 2019-20 has been set at Rs. 65,000 crore.  For achieving disinvestment targets, Government, in addition to strategic sale, also uses various modes of minority stake sale which include Initial Public Offer (IPO), Offer For Sale (OFS), Buyback of Shares and Exchange Traded Funds (ETF).  The execution and outcome of disinvestment transactions is dependent on the prevailing market conditions and investor interest. ****Annexure – IAnnexure to Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 1771 for reply on 02.03.2020.List of CPSEs, including Subsidiaries, Units and Joint Ventures ‘in-principle’ approved by Government which are pending strategic disinvestment.S.No	Name of CPSE	Date of CCEA approval1.
