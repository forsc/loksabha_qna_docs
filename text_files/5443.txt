                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI KRISHANPAL GURJAR)(a)	26,20,980 applications have been received from Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) under UDID portal as on 18.07.2019.(b)	The number of e-UDID cards generated State-wise is annexed.(c)	& (d) Under the UDID project, the applications are processed, verified and approved by the District/competent medical authorities of the States/UTs. Various States/UTs are at different stages of implementation of the UDID project. Some of the States namely Assam, Manipur, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Uttarakhand and Delhi have started implementing the project very recently.(e)	The UDID project has already been designed to cater to all the categories of PwDs covered under the RPwD Act, 2016. Since the UDID project provides an online platform for issue of Certificate of Disability, more number of Persons with Disabilities(PwDs) opt for applying for Certificate of Disability through UDID portal.(f)	The Government provides financial support to the States/UTs for carrying out publicity and awareness activities, providing IT infrastructure and manpower support.(g)	Since the State Governments/UTs are primarily responsible for grant of Certificate of Disability and UDID card, the Central Government continuously monitored the project through written correspondence, meetings and video conferencing with District/State authorities. Further, Hon’ble Minister (SJ&E) has recently requested all the States/UTs to expedite the implementation of the project. The matter is followed up at the level of Secretary (DEPwD) with Chief Secretary/ Administrator of States/UTs.*****
