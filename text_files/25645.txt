As per the Quality Control Order (QCO), every toy shall conform to the requirements of relevant Indian Standard and bear the Standard Mark under a license from BIS as per Scheme-I of BIS (Conformity Assessment) Regulations,2018. This QCO is equally applicable to domestic manufacturers as well as foreign manufacturers who intend to export their toys to India.(c)	& (d): India does not maintain any country  specific import restrictions except for considerations like scientific, environmental concerns, health and life of humans, animal and plant.  Adequate provisions exist to protect the Indian consumers as imported goods are subject to domestic laws, rules, orders, regulations, technical specifications, environmental and safety norms. Any violations are punishable under provisions of Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992.  *********
