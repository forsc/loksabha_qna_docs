ANSWER




EDUCATION MINISTER (SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (d): Government has launched TEQIP (Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme) to improve the quality of technical education since 1st April 2017. As of now, the project is going to end on 31st March, 2021.	Since TEQIP is an Externally Aided Project supported by the World Bank, therefore Department of Economic Affairs and World Bank are being consulted on the project extension. Further, Government is making efforts to introduce new project titled “Multidisciplinary Education Research Innovation in Technical Education (MERITE)” which is announced in the recent budget 2021-22. MERITE will be based on the lessons learnt from TEQIP, challenges in Tertiary Education, Objectives of NEP 2020 and the targets for Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan.*****
