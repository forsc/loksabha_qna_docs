ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES(SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a) to (c) Doordarshan (DD) Free Dish is a Free to Air Direct-to-Home platform. Reference was received from Prasar Bharati regarding reception of some channels of the private broadcasters on the Set Top Boxes of DD Free Dish which were not part of channels downlinkable from DD Free Dish through the auction process. This matter has been examined and it was observed that the situation has arisen due to co-location of the signals and non-mandatory requirement for encryption of signals of Free-To-Air TV channels while being uplinked to a teleport.******
