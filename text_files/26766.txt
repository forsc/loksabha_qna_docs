National Trust runs various schemes and programmes ranging from early intervention for children upto 10 years to residential centres for adults with severe disabilities.

The Act provides various rights and entitlements for Persons with Disabilities and mandates the appropriate Government to take measures to promote education, skill development, social security, health, rehabilitation and recreation for PwDs so that they can enjoy their rights equally with others. The Act provides for reservation in seats in Government/ Government aided higher educational institutions and reservation in Government jobs as well as in allotment of land for housing, setting up of business etc. for persons with benchmark disabilities including persons with intellectual disabilities.Further, in order to implement the provision of reservation in Government employment envisaged under the RPwD Act, 2016, the Ministry notified the list of 3566 posts suitable for various categories of persons with benchmark disabilities on 04.01.2021.In addition, the Department implements a National Action Plan (NAP) for Skill Development of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) under which skilling of PwDs is conducted through a network of empanelled training partners comprising Government organizations and non-Governmental organizations.*****
