ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	to (c) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 316 ANSWERED ON 10.12.2019 REGARDING DEVELOPMENTAL WORKS AT PANCHAYAT LEVEL(a) Yes. Complaints are received in the Ministry regarding corruption in the developmental works undertaken at the Panchayat levels, through grievance redressal mechanism in place on Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS) Portal (https://pgportal.gov.in/) as well as offline. Constitution of India establishes a federal structure of government and according to the provisions of Constitution, Panchayat being “Local Government”, is a State subject and part of State list of Seventh Schedule of Constitution of India. Mandate for setting up of Panchayats is provided by Article 243 in Part IX of the Constitution of India and Panchayats are setup and operate through the respective State Panchayati Raj Acts. Since Panchayat is a State subject in the State List, the complaints regarding Panchayats on all issues including corruption are transferred to respective State Governments for appropriate action.(b)    In order to promote transparency and accountability and also, inter alia, take corrective action on various complaints, the Ministry has provided guidelines to States to carry out Social Audit of the works /activities undertaken by the Gram Panchayats.   Besides, Ministry of Panchayati Raj has also setup and is implementing a holistic e-governance system under the e-Panchayat Mission Mode Project (MMP), wherein a suite of core software applications for Panchayats have been developed.  These applications address planning (PlanPlus), budgeting, implementation (ActionPlus), accounting (PRIASoft), monitoring, social audit etc. One holistic annual plan (Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP)) through converging resources and schemes of sectors allotted by the respective States through their Panchayati Raj Acts to the Gram Panchayats is formulated by Gram Panchayats and approved by Gram Sabhas. The works are taken up by the Gram Panchayats during the year out of the works enumerated and prioritized in GPDP. These works/ activities are implemented, monitored through ActionSoft application and payment is made through the PRIASoft application and Public Financial Management System (PFMS). It is highlighted here that PFMS which is implemented by Ministry of Finance is a financial management platform for all plan schemes to provide information across all plan schemes, integrates core banking solutions and effectively tracks the fund flow upto the lowest level of implementation agency for a planned scheme. As a result efficiency of fund utilization is enhanced and transparency of the implementation is augmented. Further Panchayats are required to get their accounts audited and spend funds in accordance with the approved GPDP.     To monitor the progress of implementation and ensure transparency in implementation, geo-tagging of assets is also done during various stages of progress of the works through mActionSoft Mobile Application. (c) As per information available in the Ministry, from 1stJanuary, 2014 to 5th December, 2019, eight complaints on CPGRAMS Portal have been received from Etawah District of Uttar Pradesh. All these grievances have been transferred to the State Government of Uttar Pradesh for appropriate action.*****
