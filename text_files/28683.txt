                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a) to (c): Yes Sir. On 23 September, 2021 India has introduced a document at the WTO containing ‘Polluter Pays’ principle for fisheries subsidies negotiations. It proposes a moratorium on subsidies by distant water fishing nations for fishing and fishing related activities beyond their Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and also seeks reduction commitments on distant water fishing capacity by these nations. In these negotiations, India has also sought policy space to support low income, resource-poor or livelihood fishing or fishing related activities up to our EEZ, to develop and modernize our fisheries sector and for expanding our fishing activities in the high seas.  *****
