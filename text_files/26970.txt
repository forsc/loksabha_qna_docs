                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION, MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS (RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a) Yes Sir.  (b) Para 4.10.1 of the  MPLADS guidelines provides the timeline for the completion of works and settling of accounts of the Members of Parliament (MP) demitting the office; and  Paras 4.7 to 4.10  of the  MPLADS guidelines provides the details of transfer of funds not committed for recommended works by the predecessor MP to the accounts of sitting MPs (Annexure-I). (c) Yes sir.  (d)   The reasons for not settling the said accounts are as under: i.  The latest Monthly Progress Report in respect of Ex MP of 16th Lok Sabha of Giridih Parliamentary constituency indicates that Ex MP has recommended works of Rs. 25.38 crore before he demitted  the office of 16th Lok Sabha. Therefore, the said account can''t be closed prematurely.    ii.  The second installment of 2018-19 in respect of ex MP of 16th Lok Sabha of Giridih Parliamentary constituency is pending for release due to decision of the Government not to operate the MPLADS for 2020-21 and 2021-22 and non-release of pending instalments of 2018-19 in 2021-22. The second installment of 2018-19 in respect of 16th Lok Sabha of Giridih Parliamentary constituency was  not  released by the Government in 2019-20 due to non fulfilment of eligibility criteria   and non-submission of eligible documents by the Nodal District Authority as per the guidelines on MPLADS.  (e) The time for the closure of accounts and transfer of the unspent balance to the sitting Member of Parliament will be subject to release of second instalment of 2018-19 by the Government and in accordance with the MPLADS guidelines.                                                  *****
