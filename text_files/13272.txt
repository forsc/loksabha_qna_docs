The details with reason are attached in Annexure A. (b): In the auction process of coal mines both Government companies and Private companies are allowed to participate in the auction process. However, in the auction for allocation of coal mines carried out so far, only one Government company had participated for one coal mine. For the remaining coal mines put up auction, only Private companies participated in auction process.  (c): The details of revenue earned through coal mines auction mine wise is attached in Annexure B.  Annexure AReasons for termination of allocation of 7 auctioned coal mines are given below:  1.

Due to this the extractable reserve of the coal mines exceeded 150% of the annual coal requirement of left out end –use plants taken over a period of 30 years which is in violation of Clause 4.1.2 (b)(i) of tender document and clause 2.1 of Coal Mine Development and Production Agreement (CMDPA). Consequently the Successful Allocate did not remain eligible for this mine and attracted termination event under Clause 24.3.1(k) of the CMDPA. 2. Mandakini and Utkal-C:-  (2 coal mines)Allocattee:  Mandakini: -    Mandakini Exploration and Mining LtdUtkal –C:-    Monnet Power Company Ltd Ministry of Power vide its letter dated 15.4.2015 ordered capping on fixed charges component of tariff of electricity. Against this order of Ministry of Power, Allocattee approached Hon’ble High court of Delhi. Hon’ble Delhi High Court allowed allocattee to surrender  the mine due to change in tender conditions of allocation. Consequently Allocates applied for surrendering of coal mines and thus allocation of these 2 coal mines was terminated.  3. Tokisud North:-  (1 coal mine) Allocattee: Essar Power MP Ltd Tokisud North coal mine is a scheduled II coal mine. There was inordinate delay in operationalisation of the mine and the matter was referred to the Scrutiny Committee. Scrutiny Committee recommended for termination of allocation of this mine and accordingly the allocation was terminated. 4. Gare Palma IV/7:-  (1 coal mine) Allocattee:  Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd. As per Coal Mine Development and Production Agreement (CMDPA) Performance Bank Guarantee (PBG) were required to be renewed but allocattee of this mine did not renewed the Performance Bank Guarantee (PBG) and thus attracted termination clause of CMDPA.
