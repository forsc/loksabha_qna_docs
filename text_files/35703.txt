ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL) (a)	Non-availability of adequate funds, low governance capability of the elected representatives of the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) to plan, manage and utilize limited funds and raise their own sources of revenue, limited technical and trained manpower, and ensuring transparency in governance are some of the major impediments/hindrances faced by the Panchayats while implementing various developmental works in the villages.  (b)	The work of strengthening Panchayati Raj Institutions is a continuous process in which the Central and State Governments are involved. The performance of Panchayats depends on how much powers and resources are devolved to them, which vary from state to state. Appropriate steps have been consistently taken by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj to strengthen the Panchayati Raj Institutions in the States and Union Territories covered under Part IX of the Constitution. Prominent among these steps are the provision of financial and technical assistance under the schemes and programs of the Government and issue of advisories from time to time. In addition, under the Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan scheme, financial and technical assistance is also provided for capacity building of Panchayats to enable them to effectively and efficiently carry out the assigned tasks.The Ministry of Panchayati Raj also assists in the preparation of guidelines for participatory planning and preparation of Gram Panchayat Development Plans by Panchayats, bringing about efficiency, transparency and accountability for achieving development objectives.In order to empower Panchayats to be strengthened digitally and to bring transparency, accountability and efficiency in their functioning, the Ministry has developed a simplified task based accounting application- E-GramSwaraj (egramswaraj.gov.in) to provide a system of budgeting, accounting and auditing in Panchayats. Apart from this, incentive awards to selected best performing Panchayats and assistance to the States in preparing detailed guidelines for preparation of participatory Gram Panchayat Development Plans are also included.Further, the efforts of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj have led to a substantial increase in the transfer of funds to rural local bodies through the Central Finance Commission, especially during the tenure of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Finance Commissions. The enhanced allocation to Gram Panchayats has provided untied funds to meet the basic Gram Panchayat specific requirement.(c) &(d)The State-wise grants allocated under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Finance Commissions for the Panchayati Raj Institutions during the last three years is at Annexure.***
