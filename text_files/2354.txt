ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)	 to (d)  Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in collaboration with the State Pollution Control Boards is regularly monitoring the water quality of rivers across the country through a network of monitoring stations under the National Water Quality Monitoring Programme. Based on monitoring results in terms of Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) levels, a key indicator of organic pollution, CPCB has identifies the polluted river stretches in the country. In the latest CPCB report of September 2018, 351 polluted river stretches have been identified on 323 rivers. As per National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRB) framework, it is envisaged that no untreated sewage shall be disposed to Ganga by the year 2020. Accordingly, Namami Gange programme has been launched which provides necessary actions towards achieving the objective. A number of activities/ projects covering sewage infrastructure projects, rural sanitation projects, industrial pollution abatement works, ghats & crematoria development projects, river surface cleaning projects, bio- diversity conservation projects, afforestation projects and public outreach has been undertaken towards abatement of pollution in river Ganga and its tributaries.So far, under Namami Gange Programme, a total of 298 projects have been sanctioned at an estimated cost of Rs.28,451.29 Crore. Out of these 298 projects, 150 are sewerage projects (111 on Ganga stem & 39 in tributaries) sanctioned at cost of Rs.23,130.95 Crore for creation of new STP capacity                      of 3729.92 Millions of Litres Per Day (MLD), 1114.39 MLD rehabilitated STP capacity and laying of around 4972.35 km sewerage networks.Contd…P/2//2//Assistance is provided to State Governments for abatement of pollution in identified stretches of various rivers ( excluding Ganga and its tributaries) under the Centrally sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) on cost sharing basis between the Central & State Governments for taking up various pollution abatement works relating to interception & diversion of raw sewage, construction of sewerage systems, setting up of sewage treatment plans, low cost installation, river front/ bathing ghat development, etc. Implementation of NRCP works has led to reduction in pollution load draining into rivers as well as improving the environment & sanitation conditions in the towns in which the programme have been implemented.Further, to control discharge of industrial effluents, CPCB and respective  State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) and Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) monitor industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under the water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. To improve the monitoring of compliance, directions have been issued by CPCB to specific industries to install online 24x7 effluent monitoring systems.  Steps have also been taken by CPCB to promote low waste concept in grossly water polluting industries, particularly those located on the river banks.*****
