ANSWER




(a)  Yes, Sir. As per the census 2011, the Child Sex Ratio (CSR) in comparison of census 2001 has declined in 21 States/UTs. A statement regarding CSR for years 2001 and 2011 is annexed at Annexure-I. (b)  No, Sir. The Census 2011 was itself a survey of the Government of India conducted through the Registrar General of India in every ten years to ascertain the factual status and obtaining data related to CSR. (c)   Child Sex Ratio (Census by Registrar General of India) is a decadal process. Hence, an intermediary targets i.e. Sex Ratio at Birth have been set as a monitoring parameter for the progress of Scheme. As per the latest available report of Health Management Information System (HMIS) of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,  an improving trend of 19 points at National level from 918 (2014-15) to 937 (2020- 21) has been observed. The State/UT wise SRB of 2014-15 and 2020-21 is at Annexure-II. (d) & (e)  BBBP scheme is being implemented as per schematic norms only. Consistent efforts are made under BBBP at all levels to generate awareness about the rights of girl child through community engagement, stop sex selection at birth and encourage positive action to support their education growth and development. Convergent efforts are made in collaboration with other Ministries and stakeholders. The implementation of the Scheme is monitored by the task force under BBBP at District, State and National level. **** Annexure - I Statement referred to in reply to Part (a)  of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 1086 for 03.12.2021 regarding Decline in Child Sex Ratio raised by SHRI NIHAL CHAND:  State/UT-wise statement for Child Sex Ratio (CSR) in India (2001-2011).
