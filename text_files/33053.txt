                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS [SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a)	As per available details, about 1509 Indians died due to accidents while working in the companies abroad during the last three years;(b)	The country-wise details of the pending cases where compensation claims are under process may please be seen at Annexure -I.(c) & (d) 	Government of India has instituted a mandatory insurance scheme, the Pravasi Bhartiya Bima Yojna for emigrant workers who need Emigration Clearance.  The scheme was further strengthened in 2017 which will be beneficial to Indian emigrant workers.  The scheme provides an insurance cover of Rs.10 lakhs in case of death or permanent disability and a few other limited benefits at a nominal insurance premium of Rs.275 and Rs.375 for a period of two and three years respectively.  Additionally, in many countries such cases are being settled directly between employers and families of the deceased as per local laws of the host countries.  Some Indian Missions and Posts also provide legal assistance through their empanelled lawyers if any request received from the family of the deceased.  Besides, there are also dedicated labour wings/sections in some Indian Missions and Posts to provide assistance to settle compensation claims of the family.***
