                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS (SHRI DEVUSINH CHAUHAN)(a)	State/UT-wise detail of spectrum provided to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) across the country is at Annexure.(b) to (e) 	BSNL is providing 4G services on limited scale through 8,637 Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) using its existing spectrum. Despite intense competition in mobile segment and data centric telecom market, BSNL continue to maintain its mobile subscriber base.  The mobile subscriber market share of BSNL for the last five years is as under:<pre>Subscribers market share (in %age) of BSNL as on31.03.2017	31.03.2018	31.03.2019	31.03.2020	31.03.20218.66	9.44	9.96	10.35	10.03</pre>The competition in the telecom sector has led to reduction in tariffs. Further, for BSNL, in the data centric telecom market, the absence of 4G services (except in few places) has also impacted the Average Revenue per User (ARPU). However, the Government has approved the revival plan for BSNL on 23.10.2019, which, inter-alia, includes administrative allotment of spectrum for providing 4G services with funding through budgetary allocation. The funds of Rs. 24,084 crores for the spectrum have been provided in the budget for the FY 2021-22.BSNL invited the Expression of Interest (EoI) on 01.01.2021 for Proof of Concept (PoC) from Indian Companies interested in participating in BSNL’s upcoming 4G tender. Letter of Intent (LoI) has been issued to 5 eligible bidders on 01.07.2021.
