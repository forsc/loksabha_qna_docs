ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a): The State-wise details of the central share released to State/UT Governments from 2013-14 till date under the scheme of Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) is annexed(b): Under the scheme of RUSA, State/UT Governments submit their proposals as per the identified needs of higher education sector in their respective States/UTs, based on the norms set under the scheme. Approval of proposals is done by the Project Approval Board (PAB) of RUSA in which States/UTs participate as members of the board. The central funding flows from the Ministry to institutions, through the State Governments. Since RUSA is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, State/UTs contribute their share as per applicable funding pattern. (c): Under RUSA, Central support is provided for creation of Universities by way of up-gradation of existing autonomous colleges and creation of Universities by conversion of colleges in a cluster. Under the scheme, one university each in Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Puducherry and Uttar Pradesh; two universities each in Jammu & Kashmir and Jharkhand; three Universities in Odisha and four Universities each in Karnataka and Maharashtra have been approved. Thus 21 such Universities have been approved under RUSA.***
