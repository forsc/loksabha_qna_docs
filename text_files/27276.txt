ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT & HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)  (a) Projects for construction of Roads in Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas in 9 states with a total length of  5422 km at a total cost of Rs 8673 Crore have been taken up by Ministry of Road Transport and Highways under Road Requirement Plan-I (RRP-I).  Out of this, 4932 km has been completed and the balance works are in progress.   (b) & (c) Vijayawada-Ranchi Corridor Scheme is conceived to improve roads in backward regions and LWE affected areas but is distinct from RRP-I. Under this scheme projects covering a length of 594 km in the state of Odisha at a cost of Rs 1345.91 Crore have been taken up. All these works with a modified length of   592.95 km at a cost of Rs 1168.76 Crore have been completed.  (d)      The State wise length of the roads built in LWE affected areas under RRP-I and under Vijayawada-Ranchi Corridor Scheme are at Annexure.  (e)       Projects under RRP-I and Vijayawada – Ranchi Corridor Scheme got delayed due to several reasons including repeated bidding due to poor response to the bids invited, delays in providing dedicated security, delays in pre-construction clearances etc. The balance works in RRP-I and Vijayawada –Ranchi Corridor are likely to be completed by 2023-24.
