ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c): Sanction of Railway Projects of new lines, gauge conversion and doubling is a continuous process. Railway lines/Railway Projects are sanctioned after examination of survey reports based upon merits, which includes financial and economic return on project, operational requirement, willingness of State Governments to share the cost of project, socio-economic considerations etc. Hence, all the Railway lines/Railway Projects for which surveys are done, do not convert into sanctioning.During the last three years (2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19) and the current financial year, 276 surveys pertaining to New Line, Gauge Conversion and Doubling have been completed. Out of above, 50 Railway projects have been included in the Budget subject to requisite approval, list of which is appended.*****
