ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI RAMVILAS PASWAN)(a) to (c): 	Department of Food and Public Distribution in collaboration with States/UTs is implementing a scheme on ‘End-to-End Computerization of TPDS Operations’ to improve the efficiency and transparency in Public Distribution System (PDS) operations. Under Component-II of scheme comprises automation of Fair Price Shops (FPSs), which involves installation of electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices at FPSs for authentication of beneficiaries and electronic recording of sale transactions. Presently, as per information received from States/UTs, out of total 5.34 lakh FPSs across the country, about 4.12 lakh FPSs have been automated so far.  A statement showing automation of FPSs during last three years (State-wise including Bihar) is at Annexure......2/--2-(d) & (e): 	Initially the implementation of the scheme on ‘End-to-End Computerization of TPDS Operations’ was slow and uneven across the country due to delay in finalization of action plans by States/UTs, late submission of their proposal for financial assistance and practical problems faced during the implementation. However, due to vigorous efforts and regular monitoring of the project there has been significant progress in implementation of the scheme. Ration cards have been completely digitized in all States/UTs, transparency portal and online grievance redressal facility/Toll-free number have been implemented in all States/UTs, online allocation has been implemented in 34 States/UTs and supply chain has been computerized in 26 States/UTs. Progress is being monitored vigorously to ensure the automation of the remaining FPSs and Computerisation of Supply Chain Management in all States/UTs.    **** ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (c) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.624 DUE FOR ANSWERED ON 25th JUNE, 2019 IN THE LOK SABHA.Statement showing status of FPS automation during last three yearsSl.
