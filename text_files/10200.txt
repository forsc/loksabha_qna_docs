ANSWER




MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (f):	   Financial benefits of Rs.6000/- per year under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) is transferred in three 4-monthly installments of Rs.2000/- each directly into the bank accounts of the farmers. 		Registration of farmers for this scheme and subsequent installment-wise transfer of benefits to them is a continuous and ongoing process. The transfer of benefits to the identified eligible beneficiaries takes place as and when their correct and verified data are uploaded by the concerned State / UT Governments on PM-Kisan web-portal www.pmkisan.gov.in. The speed with which error-free beneficiaries’ data is uploaded differs from State to State. The West Bengal Government has not yet decided to join the scheme at all. 		The data of beneficiaries so uploaded by the State / UT Governments undergoes a multi-level verification and validation by various concerned agencies, including the banks, which includes rejection of data for errors at various levels and re-uploading of error-free data by the State / UT Governments. Thereafter only the amount is successfully transferred into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. This entire process is replicated for transfer of every installment. Contd…2/--2-		Hence, at any point of time, there remains substantial unprocessed data of beneficiaries which are taken care of in due course of time. However, all eligible beneficiaries are entitled to be paid their benefits from the 4-monthly period in which their registration has taken place, and hence they will not lose the benefit of any installment for procedural delays, except on account of their ineligibility.		Accordingly, as per the format of the scheme, release of benefits to farmers are in various stages of progress for different 4-monthly periods, namely, 1st December, 2018 to 31st March, 2019, 1st April, 2019 to 31st July, 2019 and 1st August, 2019 to 30th November, 2019. Hence, some farmers have got all 3 installments, some only two and some only one, depending upon the 4-monthly period in which they have been first registered by the concerned State/UT-Governments. The details of beneficiaries who have been transferred the benefits so far, State-wise and instalment-wise are given at Annexures – I, II & III.		To further facilitate registration of farmers, an exclusive ‘Farmers Corner’ has been provided in the PM-KISAN Web-portal through which the farmers can do their self-registration.  Farmers can also edit their names in PM-Kisan database as per their Aadhaar Card through the Farmers Corner.  Farmers can also know the status of their payment through the Farmers Corner.  The village-wise names of the beneficiaries are also available in the Farmers Corner.  Common Service Centres (CSCs) have also been authorized to assist the farmers in performing the above tasks.		On the instructions of the Union Government, the States have organized Publicity/Awareness Camps to ensure expeditious Aadhaar authentication of the data of the beneficiaries along with new registrations and correction of already registered data.*******
