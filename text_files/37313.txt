So far 530 proposals with projected investment of about Rs. 3343 crore have been approved by the EC. Approved investments take 1-2 years to fructify or reach commercial production stage.The Development Monitoring and Evaluation Office (DMEO), NITI Aayog has been entrusted with the evaluation study of the NEIDS, 2017, as per Department of Expenditure''s guidelines issued vide OM F.NO. 42(02)/PF-II/2014 dated the 08.12.2020 for formulation and approval of public funded schemes.  *******
