ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a):		In order to provide social security benefits to the workers in the unorganized sector including women workers, the Government has enacted the Unorganized Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008. This Act stipulates formulation of suitable welfare schemes for unorganized workers on matters relating to: (i) life and disability cover (ii) health and maternity benefits (iii) old age protection and (iv) any other benefit as may be determined by the Central Government.Life and disability cover is provided through Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) to the unorganized workers including women workers depending upon their eligibility. Government of India and State Governments pay the annual premium in equal share.Contd..2/-:: 2 ::The health and maternity benefits are addressed through Ayushman Bharat scheme. For old age protection in the form of monthly pension, Government of India has recently launched Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandhan.  Under the scheme, minimum assured monthly pension of Rs.3000/- will be provided to the unorganized workers including women workers after attaining the age of 60 years. This scheme is based on the 50:50 basis where 50% monthly contribution is payable by the beneficiary and equal matching contribution by the Central Government. Similarly, Cabinet has approved Pradhan Mantri Laghu Vypari Maan Dhan Yojana, a pension scheme for shopkeepers/retail traders and self –employed persons on the same lines for providing them a minimum assured monthly pension of Rs.3000/-.(b) to (d):   The estimated female labour force participation rate (LFPR) on usual status (Principal Status+ Subsidiary status) basis for persons aged 15 years and above in India is as follows:Survey	Employment Unemployment survey (2009-10)	Employment Unemployment survey (2011-12)	Employment Unemployment survey (2012-13)Female LEPR(in%)	16.3	30.0	26.5Survey	Employment Unemployment survey (2013-14)	Employment Unemployment survey (2015-16)Female LEPR(in%)	31.1	27.4Source: Annual report of 5 rounds of Employment Unemployment Survey conducted by Labour Bureau, Ministry of Labour & Employment.          		These results depict a fluctuating but declining female labour force participation rate Over the years. In a recent report titled "A Quantum Leap Gender Equality" published by ILO in 2019, it is stated that the Asia Pacific region has seen women''s employment rates fall more markedly than men''s.            	Contd..3/- :: 3 ::		As evident in other countries of the Asia Pacific region, this decline may be attributed to factors like higher level of participation of women in education, migration etc. The Government is keen on addressing the issue of low female labour force participation and has launched various legislation based schemes and Other programmes where the emphasis is on female participation. With a view to promote women participation in new sectors, women are now allowed to work during night in mines (open east mines) above and below ground for certain classes of work. In addition, night work for women in factories as well as shops and establishments is also promoted subject to the employer providing adequate safely provisions and Other facilities. Also, a number of protective provisions have been incorporated for creating a congenial work environment for women workers. This include enhancement in paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks, child care centers and time off for feeding children, provisions for mandatory crèche facility for children aged 6 months to 6 years of working women.******
