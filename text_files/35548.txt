They are governed by provisions of the Act, Statutes and Ordinances made thereunder.   All the appointments to permanent posts of teachers in the University are made by the Executive Council on the recommendation of a Selection Committee in accordance with the provision of the relevant statutes of the University.Central University of Tamil Nadu has informed that notification for recruitment has been issued on 2.12.2021 for filling up of 26 backlog vacancies, 6 had fallen back from before 2019 and 20 had fallen as backlog from the advertisements of May/November 2019.  Many of the posts advertised in 2019 could not be filled up due to inadequate applications, COVID-19 restrictions and applicable Government of India rules requiring recruitment to be completed within 6 months from the date of advertisement. As this recruitment process exceeded nearly two years, the University cancelled the process and no interviews were conducted.    ******
