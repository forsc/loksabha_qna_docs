ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a): The salient features of the scheme are as under:i. The Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) intends to enable air operations on unserved routes connecting regional areas, promote balanced regional growth and make flying affordable for masses. ;ii. Financial incentives in terms of concessions from Central, State Governments and airport operators are extended to Selected Airline Operators to encourage operations from unserved/underserved airports/heliports and to keep the fare affordable.iii.Support to the Selected Airline Operator in the form of Viability Gap Funding (VGF). Provision of a 20% share towards VGF for respective RCS Routes pertaining to the State whereas the share of States in the North-Eastern region of India and Union Territories would be 10%.iv. Excise Duty at the rate of 2% shall be levied on Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) drawn by Selected Airline Operators at RCS Airports for RCS Flights for a period of three (3) years from the date of commencement of RCS flight.v.The airlines are required to commit around 50% of the seats as RCS seats (limited to 40 seats) on RCS flights.vi. Regional Connectivity Fund (RCF) is created by levying Rs.5000/- on each departure of flights on aircraft having MTOW (Maximum Take-Off Weight) above 40 Tonne except the route, North East Region, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Andman & Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep Islands.vii.For balanced regional growth, the allocations will be spread equitably across five regions in the country viz. North, South, East, West and North East (with a cap of 30% in a given region).viii. RCS-UDAN is a market driven mechanism. Development of regional air connectivity routes is proposed to be left to market forces so that airlines undertake assessment of demand and nature of supply required on particular routes and lead the process of bidding under RCS.;;(b): Details of the 228 RCS - UDAN routes connecting various cities across India commenced under RCS - UDAN are attached at Annexure-A.;;(c): In the 3rd round of bidding under RCS - UDAN Tourism, 46 routes have been awarded to Selected Airline Operators (SAOs) across the country on the request of Ministry of Tourism. Details of these routes are at Annexure-B. Ministry of Tourism has agreed to pay 100% of VGF for these routes awarded under UDAN Tourism.;(d): Chandigarh airport is a served airport.  With repeal of the Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation was deregulated. Airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type, free to select whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate. Government has, however, laid down Route Dispersal Guidelines with a view to achieve better air transport services to different regions of the country. It is, therefore, up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability in the country subject to compliance with Route Dispersal Guidelines. However, the RCS routes connecting Chandigarh to Dharamshala, Thoise, Pantnagar, Shimla have been awarded to SAOs.
