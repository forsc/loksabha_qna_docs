ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION; MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	& (b):  Yes Sir, Government has identified 112 aspirational districts (including Tribal and Rural Districts) remaining backward in the sectors like; Health & Nutrition, School Education, Agriculture & Water Resources, Financial Inclusion and Skill Development and Basic Infrastructure, list of such 112 aspirational districts is placed at Annexure.  (c)  Government is implementing Aspirational District Programme.  The broad strategy of the Aspirational District Programme rests on the 3 Cs – Convergence (between Central and State Schemes), Collaboration (between Centre, State, District, Administration, Development Partners and Citizens) and Competition (between Districts).  Every month, districts are ranked on basis of progress made and this instills them with a sense of competition which results in rapid improvement.  Another strategy of the programme is nomination of Joint Secretary/Additional Secretary level officials from Government of India as Central Prabhari Officers for each of the district.  The role of these Prabhari Officers is to guide the district administration on basis of their long experience.As the main strategy of the programme is based on convergence of existing schemes which have their own funding arrangement, infusion of additional fund is not envisaged.  However, in order to foster competitive spirit, and for addressing the critical gaps, selected Districts are given some additional allocation on the basis of their performance every month, districts are assessed on the basis of monthly progress and the best performing District in overall terms and in each of the five sectors are identified.  The first and second rankers in overall terms are awarded Rs. 10 crores and Rs. 5 crores respectively.  The first ranker from each of the five sectors is awarded Rs. 3 crores each.*****AnnexureState wise list of Aspirational Distrcits S.No.	State	District1	Madhya Pradesh	Chhatarpur2	Madhya Pradesh	Damoh3	Madhya Pradesh	Barwani4	Madhya Pradesh	Rajgarh5	Madhya Pradesh	Vidisha6	Madhya Pradesh	Guna7	Madhya Pradesh	Singrauli8	Madhya Pradesh	Khandwa9	Uttar Pradesh	Bahraich10	Uttar Pradesh	Shrawasti11	Uttar Pradesh	Balrampur12	Uttar Pradesh	Siddharthnagar13	Uttar Pradesh	Chandauli14	Uttar Pradesh	Sonebhadra15	Uttar Pradesh	Chitrakoot16	Uttar Pradesh	Fatehpur17	Odisha	Dhenkanal18	Odisha	Gajapati19	Odisha	Kandhamal20	Odisha	Balangir21	Odisha	Kalahandi22	Odisha	Rayagada23	Odisha	Koraput24	Odisha	Malkangiri25	Odisha	Nawarangpur26	Odisha	Nuapada27	Punjab	Moga28	Punjab	Firozpur29	Himachal Pradesh	Chamba30	Uttarakhand	Udham Singh Nagar31	Uttarakhand	Haridwar32	Andhra Pradesh	Vizianagaram33	Andhra Pradesh	Visakhapatnam34	Andhra Pradesh	Y.S.R.
