Out of 1.14 crore houses sanctioned under PMAY-U, around 54.4 lakh houses are complete and the remaining houses are at various stages of construction/grounding.  (b)	Under PMAY-U, Government of India is sanctioning the proposals based on the Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) along with project cost prepared by the implementing agencies of States/UTs. Government of India is providing its fixed share as Central Assistance of ?1.0 lakh under In-Situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR), ?1.5 lakh for Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP) & Beneficiary-led individual house construction or enhancement (BLC) verticals of PMAY-U. The remaining cost of the house as per DPR is shared by States/UTs/ULBs/Beneficiaries. Completion of projects generally takes 12-36 months under different verticals of the scheme.  Any cost escalation, due to delay in construction or otherwise is borne by State/ UTs/ ULBs/ beneficiaries as per DPR. Under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban [PMAY-U], identification of eligible beneficiaries, implementation of projects including completion of houses, allotment to beneficiaries and ensuring occupancy by providing all necessary infrastructure is the responsibility of States/UTs.  (c)& (d)  No Sir. Out of 54,39,898 houses constructed so far under PMAY-U, only 5,76,735 houses are yet to be occupied.  State/UT wise details of number of houses constructed and houses in the process of allotment/ occupancy is at Annexure-II.  (e) & (f)  In order to achieve the vision of ‘Housing for All’, Ministry monitors progress of the Scheme through periodic review meetings, video-conferences and field visits.  Ministry, at various fora such as Review meetings, Workshops/ Conferences, Central Sanctioning & Monitoring Committee (CSMC) meetings etc., and through correspondences, has advised States/ UTs to expedite the construction of sanctioned  houses so that all houses are completed within the stipulated period and allotted to eligible beneficiaries.                                        *****
