ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI  R.K. SINGH)(a) to (e) : 	No  such incident of fire has been reported in the lines owned by Inter State Transmission licensees including Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd during the last 3 years due to loose high tension wires of transmission lines. Various regulations and standards for safe construction, operation & maintenance of electricity infrastructure including for HT lines viz. minimum ground clearance, support structures, right of way, span, sag and tension, etc. have been notified by the Government of India/ Electricity Regulatory Commissions/State Power Departments to be strictly adhered to by the Distribution and Transmission Utilities.In addition, the Government of India through Skill India has taken initiative to train the linemen of the DISCOMs to help them maintain the infrastructure created.Electricity is a concurrent subject and distribution of electricity falls primarily under the purview of the respective State Governments and it is the responsibility of the respective State Power Utility to operate and maintain the electricity infrastructure in proper condition. Accordingly, the compensation for losses caused by any electricity accidents including fire in the fields caused by loose high-tension wires falls within the domain of the State Government/Utilities and is decided by the respective State Government/State Power Utility as per their policies in this regard.Information in this regard was sought from all the States. However, only State of Karnataka, so far, has reported that they have paid compensation amounting to Rs. 136 lakh towards 352 incidents of fire in the field related to loose high-tension wires of the Distribution Companies, as per their State policy during the periods 2018-19 to 2020-21.********
