                                                    (a) whether according to latest orders of National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), all passengers stuck at various airports have the right to free refreshment, meals and communications during the delay of flights;(b) if so, the details thereof; and(c) whether Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) proposes to issue instructions to all airlines on the basis of the orders of NCDRC and if not, the reasons therefor?






ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c) National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) in the order  dated 15.10.2019 made the observation, which is not a part of its operative portion. While deciding the revision petition no. 1933 - 1937 of 2017 against a scheduled airline, the NCDRC only upheld the compensation amount awarded by District Forum which was reduced by the State Commission. However, the  Civil Aviation Requirement(CAR) Section-3, Series M, Part IV titled "Facilities to be provided to passengers by airlines due to denied boarding, cancellation of flights and delays in flights" issued by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation( DGCA) has provisions to safeguard passenger interest with regard to facilities such as meals etc to be provided to a passenger by airlines in case of delays, cancellation and denied boarding.
