Under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G), the targets are set annually on the basis of availability of eligible beneficiaries, achievements of target allocated during the preceding years and proposal of the States/UTs. After allocation of Annual targets, further distribution amongst beneficiaries in various districts/blocks/villages is done by the States/UTs. The State-wise number of houses sanctioned and allotted especially in Jalore and Sirohi district of Rajasthan and Latur, Satara and Solapur districts of Maharashtra during the last three financial years is given in Annexure.

A Permanent Wait List (PWL) of beneficiaries is thus generated. The PWL of the State of Jharkhand including Chatra, Latehar and Palam districts has been saturated with the targets under the Scheme. The State-wise number of houses allocated and sanctioned is given in Annexure.* * *                                                                               ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO 1364 TO BE ANSWERED ON 09.02.2021      State-wise details of number of houses sanctioned and allotted under PMAY-G                               (units in Nos.)
