ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) to (c)	Ministry of Communications has not fixed any new Electromagnetic Field (EMF) emission limit for Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) installed at various mobile towers.The present EMF emission limit as laid down for BTSs installed at various mobile towers in India, for which license amendment was issued on 10.01.2013, are as follows:<pre>Frequency Range	E-Field Strength   (Volt/Meter)	H-Field Strength (Amp/Meter)	Power Density (Watt/Sq.Meter)400 MHz  to 2000 MHz	0.434 f ½	0.0011 f ½	f / 20002 GHz to 300 GHz	19.29	0.05	1</pre> (f is frequency in MHz)These norms are 10 times more stringent than the safe limits prescribed by International Commission on Non Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP)and recommended by World Health Organization (WHO). Further, Government of India has put in place a well-structured process & adequate mechanism to ensure that Telecommunications Service Providers strictly adhere to these prescribed norms. Upto 31.05.2019, 334 number of Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) have been found exceeding the prescribed EMF radiation limits. Field units of Department of Telecommunications (DoT) have imposed financial penalty on defaulting Telecom Service Providers (TSPs). In addition, one non-compliant BTS in Haryana LSA was shut down as per prescribed DoT guidelines. For remaining non-compliant BTSs, radiation levels have been brought within prescribed radiation limits.(d)	Mobile towers are established/ provided by the telecom service providers at suitable locations, as per their Radio Frequency (RF) network planning for proper coverage of the area to fulfil the license conditions, regulatory compliances and to meet their business requirements. As per the advisory guidelines for State Government issued by Department of Telecommunications (DoT) no restriction has been imposed on installation of tower at any specific locations.(e)	With a view to ensure Quality of Service including call drops, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) notifies Quality of Services regulations namely “The Standards for Quality of Service of Basic (Wireline) and Cellular Mobile Telephone Service Regulations” and in accordance with this regulation TRAI undertakes assessment of performance of all telecom service providers. In the Quality of Service Regulations issued by TRAI, provisions have been made for imposition of financial disincentives for non-compliance with the benchmarks for various quality of service parameters including call drop.
