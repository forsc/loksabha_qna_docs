                                                        The MINISTER OF LAW & JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a):  As per information provided by High Courts, the details of the number of the pending cases in POCSO courts in various States in the country including Rajasthan is given at Annexure-I(b): Union Government has started a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for setting up of 1023 Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) including 389 exclusive POCSO (e-POCSO) Courts in 31 States/UTs for expeditious trial and disposal of cases related to rape and POCSO Act, in pursuance to the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2018 and the direction of Hon''ble Supreme Court of India in Suo Moto 1/2019 dated 25.7.2019.  Initially, the Scheme was for 1 year which has been continued up to 31.03.2023 at a cost of Rs. 1572.86 crore with Central share of Rs.971.70 crore. Central share is to be met from Nirbhaya Fund. 28 States/UTs have joined the scheme while States of West Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh and UT of Andaman & Nicobar Island are yet to join. As per information received from the High Courts for the month of February, 2022, total 712 FTSCs including 399 e-POCSO Courts are operationalized which disposed more than 81,400 cases. Nodal Officers have been appointed by the High Courts and a dedicated dashboardhas been created for the States/UTs to upload monthly data. The issue of setting up of FTSCs and their early operationalization has been taken up with concerned States/UTs at various level from time to time. Minister of Law & Justice has addressed letters to Chief Ministers of States and Chief Justices of High Courts in this regard. In addition, regular review meetings with officials of the States/UTs and High Court functionaries are being held from time to time. Apart from the above, the issueof early operationalization of remaining FTSCs and robust implementation of the scheme has been raised as one of the agenda point in Inter State Zonal Council meetings.***Annexure given in Lok Sabha Unstarred Q.
