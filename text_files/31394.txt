ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) to (c)	 The Ministry is primarily responsible for development and maintenance of National Highways (NHs). Apart from this the Ministry also allocates fund for State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) for development and maintenance of State Roads under the Central Road & Infrastructure Fund (CRIF) and Economic Importance & Interstate Connectivity (EI&ISC) schemes as per the provisions of the CRIF Act, 2000 amended by the Finance Act, 2019. 	The Ministry finalized the criteria for allocation of funds for development and maintenance of State Roads [for CRIF and EI & ISC Schemes] under the CRIF Act, 2000 in consultation with the Ministry of Finance and circulated the same to all State Governments and UTs in January, 2020. State Government/ UT submits the proposal of release of funds under CRIF depending on the progress of the work, there is no specific restriction for project and location – wise utilization of fund. This criteria inter-alia provides for: -(i).	Maintaining a revolving balance of one third of accrual/ allocation for the States/ UTs for the year with State/ UT while releasing funds.     (ii).	Release of funds to States/ UTs in Quarterly instalments linked to submission of Utilization Certificates (UCs). (iii).	Further release of funds by State Governments/ UTs to concerned executive agencies (e.g. Public Works Department (PWDs), Road Construction Department/ Corporation, etc.) within 7 days of release of funds by the Ministry.The salient features of these criteria is at Annexure-I. As per the CRIF Act, 2000 amended through Finance Act, 2019, the Central Government is no longer responsible for monitoring of State road projects under these schemes and expenditure incurred thereon. The State/ UT - wise details of accrual/ allocation of funds and the funds released/ expenditure incurred for development and maintenance of State roads under CRIF and EI&ISC schemes during each of the last three years and current year, including for the State of Maharashtra, are placed at Annexure-II and Annexure-III respectively(d) and (e)	No instances of misuse of the funds released for state roads under CRIF and EI&ISC schemes for other projects have come into the notice of the Ministry.
