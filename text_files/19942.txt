ANSWER




                                                        The MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a)  to (f) :	In terms of Section 3 (1) of the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, the State Governments are responsible for establishing Gram Nyayalayas in consultation with the respective High Courts.  Presently only 12 States have established Gram Nyayalayas. The Central Government has been requesting States and High Courts for establishment of Gram Nyayalayas in the respective States. As per the information made  available by  the various State Governments / High Courts there are 402 Gram Nyayalayas notified, out of which 225 are operational. The State-wise details are given as follows:State 	Gram NyayalayasNotified	Gram NyayalayasFunctionalMadhya  Pradesh	89	89Rajasthan	45	45Karnataka	2	2Odisha	22	16Maharashtra	39	24Jharkhand	6	1Goa	2	0Punjab	9	2Haryana	3	2Uttar Pradesh	113	14Kerala	30	30Andhra Pradesh	42	0Total	402225 The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008 has been enacted vide notification dated 7th January, 2009 for establishment of Gram Nyayalayas at the grass roots level for the purposes of providing access to justice to the citizens at their doorsteps. The Gram Nyayalayas Act provides for establishment of Gram Nyayalayas for every Panchayat at intermediate level or a group of contiguous Panchayats at intermediate level in a district or where there is no Panchayat at intermediate level in any State, for a group of contiguous group Panchayats. However, the Act does not make setting up of Gram Nyayalayas mandatory. The issues affecting the implementation of the Gram Nyayalayas scheme were discussed in the Conference of Chief Justices of High Courts and Chief Ministers of the States on 7th April, 2013. It was decided in the Conference that the State Governments and High Courts should decide the question of establishment of Gram Nyayalayas wherever feasible, taking into account their local problems with focus on covering those Talukas under the Gram Nyayalaya scheme where regular courts have not been set up.A sum of Rs. 74.60 crore has been released so far by the Central Government for establishment and operationalization of Gram Nyayalayas including Rs. 6.00 crore released during the current financial year. For the next financial year, a sum of Rs. 8.00 crore has been allocated for the establishment and operationalization of Gram Nyayalayas. The Union Government provides central assistance for meeting the non-recurring expenditure limited to Rs.18.00 (eighteen) lakhs. In addition, the central assistance to the States for meeting the recurring expenditure is limited to Rs.3.20 lakhs per completed year of operation of a Gram Nyayalaya and is released to the States for the first three completed years of operation of the Gram Nyayalaya. *********
