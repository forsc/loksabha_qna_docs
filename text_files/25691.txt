ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE (SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a) to (c): To provide access to justice to the citizen at their door steps, the Central Government has enacted the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008.  It provides for establishment of Gram Nyayalayas at intermediate panchayat level.  The State Governments are responsible for establishing Gram Nyayalayas in consultation with the respective High Courts.  However, the Act does not make setting up of Gram Nyayalayas mandatory. The issues affecting operationalization of the Gram Nyayalayas were discussed in the Conference of Chief Justices of High Courts and Chief Ministers where it was decided that the State Governments and High Courts should decide the question of setting up of Gram Nyayalayas wherever feasible, taking into account the local issues and situation. However some of the challenges related to efficient functioning of Gram Nyayalayas are overlap of jurisdiction with regular courts, shortage of First Class Magistrates to man Gram Nyayalayas, need of a cadre of Gram Nyayadhikaris and their training, awareness amongst stakeholders and need for mobile  courts etc.As per information made available by State Governments / High Courts, while the State Government of Uttarakhand has not notified any Gram Nyayalaya,  455 Gram Nyayalayas have been notified so far by 13 States including the States of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. State-wise details of the Gram Nyayalayas notified and operationalised by the State Governments, are as under:Sl. No.	State 	Gram NyayalayasNotified	Gram NyayalayasFunctional1	Madhya  Pradesh	89	892	Rajasthan	45	453	Karnataka	2	24	Odisha	23	185	Maharashtra	36	236	Jharkhand	6	17	Goa	2	08	Punjab	9	29	Haryana	3	210	Uttar Pradesh	113	1411	Kerala	30	3012	Andhra Pradesh	42	013	Telangana	55	0	Total	455	226 A third party evaluation of the scheme was done by NITI Aayog which had recommended the continuance of Gram Nyayalayas. The Central Government has been encouraging the States to set up Gram Nyayalayas by providing non-recurring and recurring financial assistance. ***********
