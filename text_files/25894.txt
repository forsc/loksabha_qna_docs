ANSWER




                                                        (a)   Yes, Sir.  Ganga-Bhagirathi-Hooghly River System from Prayagraj (Allahabad) Uttar Pradesh to Haldia was declared as National Waterway-1 in the year 1986.  (b) to (e)   Development of inland waterways transport in National Waterway-1 has been taken up in two stretches i.e. between Haldia – Varanasi (about 1400 km) stretch and between Varanasi –  Prayagraj (Allahabad) stretch (about 220 km).  The stretch between Haldia-Varanasi has been taken up for development by Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) under the Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) with the technical and financial assistance of the World Bank.  Varanasi- Prayagraj (Allahabad) stretch has low cargo potential. Presently IWAI is undertaking operation and maintenance of Lawayne (Prayagraj) floating terminal and regular thalveg survey in this stretch.  Further, development of 2 tourist jetties has been taken up through Central Public Works Department (CPWD) on deposit basis.  The movement of mechanized country boats and small tourist boats exists in Prayagraj (Allahabad) – Varanasi stretch of NW-1.   IWAI and private sector vessels have operated in the stretch.  During lean season of about 6 months when the discharge of water upstream Prayagraj (Allahabad) is very low, movement of vessels face problems due to low depth of water. (f)   A floating terminal is being maintained by IWAI at Prayagraj, U.P. at a total operational cost of approx. Rs. 10 Lakhs per annum.   As of now, no proposal for development under PPP model at Prayagraj is under consideration.                                                *****
