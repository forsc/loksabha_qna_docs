ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS [SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) 	Information is placed at Annexure 1(b)	Information is placed at Annexure 2(c) 	Information is placed at Annexure 3(e)	 Information is placed at Annexure 4(d), (f) and (g) High level visits are an important means by which nations serve their national interests and implement their foreign policy objectives. Visits by dignitaries enable enhanced understanding of India’s perspectives on regional and global issues among foreign partners at the highest level. These visits and the understandings reached therein, enable India to strengthen relations with partner countries across a wide range of sectors including trade & investment, technology and defence collaboration. Such outcomes also contribute to India’s national development agenda to promote economic growth and well being of our people. At the multilateral level, India is increasingly contributing to shaping the global agenda on an array of cross-cutting issues such as climate change, trans-national crime & terrorism, cyber security & nuclear non-proliferation, while also offering the world, India’s own unique solutions to global partners for addressing global issues, like the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.  ***
