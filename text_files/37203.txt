The Satellites were injected into the polar sun synchronous orbit at 524.84 km altitude.EOS-4 is a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging satellite for Earth Observation, operating in C-band at 5.4 GHz frequency, for applications in the domains of agriculture, disaster management, water resources and forestry. INS-2TD is the first satellite of the 2nd generation nanosatellites intended to demonstrate indigenously developed Nano systems for in-orbit performance. INSPIRESat-1 is a student satellite of the class 9U, jointly developed by Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST), Thiruvananthapuram, India and Laboratory of Space Physics, University of Colorado, Boulder, the USA, to study the Ionosphere dynamics and sun’s coronal heating processes.(c)		Currently, the satellites are undergoing various in-orbit tests and calibrations. Subsequently, the data available from the satellites will be used for achieving the mission objectives, during the designated mission life.(d)		The total time taken to realize the satellite is 63 months from date of financial sanction and the expenditure towards realization of satellite is nearly Rs. 490 crore.(e)		No, Sir.(f)		7 satellites are likely to be launched by ISRO during the current year.****
