While the workers in organised sector are comprehensively covered by the Employees Provident Fund & Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952	and the Employees State Insurance Act, 1948. The workers in unorganised sector are provided social security and other welfare benefits as enshrined in the Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008, which provides for formulation of suitable welfare schemes for unorganised workers on matters relating to: (i) life and disability cover, (ii) health and maternity benefits, (iii) old age protection and (iv) any other benefit as may be determined by the Central Government.Contd..2/-:: 2 ::Life and disability cover is provided through Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) to the unorganised workers depending upon their eligibility.

For old age protection in the form of monthly pension, Government of India has recently launched Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandhan (PMSYM). Under the scheme, minimum assured monthly pension of Rs. 3000/- will be provided to the unorganised workers after attaining the age of 60 years.
