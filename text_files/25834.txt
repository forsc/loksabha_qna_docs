The objective of SCM is to promote cities that provide core infrastructure and give a decent quality of life to its citizens, a clean and sustainable environment through application of `Smart’ solutions. The focus is on sustainable and inclusive development and the idea is to look at compact areas, create replicable models which will act as lighthouses for other areas in the same city/other aspiring cities.10 cities of Uttar Pradesh (UP) viz. Agra, Aligarh, Bareilly, Jhansi, Kanpur, Lucknow, Moradabad, Prayagraj, Saharanpur & Varanasi have been selected for development as Smart Cities. Smart Cities in UP have tendered out 582 projects worth ? 19,444 crore; out of which work orders have been issued in 504 projects worth ? 17,029.86 crore (88%); out of these, 261 projects worth ? 8,911.74 crore (46%) have been completed. Government of India has released ? 1,827 crore for Smart Cities of UP, out of which, these Smart Cities have already utilized ? 1,575.18 crore (86.2%). The details of projects, funds released by Central Government & utilization thereof by Smart Cities in UP are given in Annexure-I.COVID-19 pandemic related lockdowns and other unprecedented situations have led to temporary interruptions in execution of Smart City works across the country. However, most of the Smart Cities have commenced works after un-lockdown and are trying their best to make up for the time lost due to such unprecedented and unforeseen circumstances.Smart cities are expected to complete their projects within 5 years from their date of selection.                                            *****
