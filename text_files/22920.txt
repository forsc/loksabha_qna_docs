ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	Forest Survey of India (FSI), Dehradun, an organization under the Ministry carries out the assessment of forest cover of the country biennially since 1987 and the findings are published in India State of Forest Report (ISFR). As per ISFR 2019, the total forest and tree cover of the country is 8,07,276 square kilometers which is 24.56 % of the geographical area of the country. There is an increase of 13,209 square kilometer of forest and tree cover at the national level in the ISFR-2019 as compared to the ISFR- 2015. The State/UTs wise details of forest and tree cover as per ISFR-2019 is given in Annexure. (b)	There is no information on directly correlating forest area with air pollution and scarcity of rain. However, in general, forests help in absorbing carbon dioxide and other gaseous pollutants and releasing oxygen, thereby improving air quality. Tree cover also generally helps in ground water recharge, thereby, improving ground water table and reducing runoff.  (c) & (d) Various schemes are being implemented by Central and State Government /  Union   Territory Administration for increase in forest cover of the country. These include National Afforestation Programme (NAP) and Green India Mission (GIM) being implemented by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. Afforestation activities are also taken up under various programmes/ funding sources such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana, Compensatory Afforestation Funds under Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA). Afforestation activities are also taken up under various schemes of State Government /UT Administration.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare is also implementing National Agroforestry Policy 2014 with an objective to meet the demand of timber, food, fuel, fodder, fertilizer, fibre and other agroforestry products, conserving the natural resources and forest; protecting the environment & providing environmental security; and increasing the forest/tree cover. Also, Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for the holistic growth of the horticulture sector covering fruits, vegetables, root & tuber crops, mushrooms, spices, flowers, aromatic plants, coconut, cashew, cocoa and bamboo. **********
