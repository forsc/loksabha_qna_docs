Special Leave Petition Civil No.13838 of 2010 was filed by Transport department of Kerala against decision of Hon’ble High Court of Karnataka on banning of night traffic. An expert committee under Chairmanship of Secretary (RT&H) was constituted by Hon’ble Supreme Court for sorting out the issue.  (f)	A meeting of the committee of Secretaries chaired by the Union Cabinet Secretary was held on  18.02.2019, wherein it was recommended that the status quo shall be maintained on restriction of night-time traffic through Bandipur National Park, as it is a core area of wildlife habitat and an alternative route is already available for night time traffic and four buses and emergency vehicles are already permitted through Bandipur National Park. *****
