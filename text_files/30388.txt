ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) & (b): In Porbander constituency of Hon’ble Member of Parliament, some of the Road Under Bridges (RUBs) are having problem of water logging where, suitable avenues for disposal of water is not available.  Hence,   the problem is being tackled by provision of pumping arrangement during the rainy season.  (c) & (d):  Initially subways were constructed only at locations where high embankment permitted natural drainage.  With experience subways were adopted as a techno-economic solutions for elimination of Level Crossings (LCs) (Primarily UMLC) which provided safe and uninterrupted passage to road users.  Prior to 2018, the responsibility of  providing, drainage was with state agencies.  However, due to complaints, Railways took over this responsibility afterwards.   Railways have taken several remedial measures to minimise the problem of water logging. Adequate drainage arrangement has been made integral part of planning of new Road Under Bridge (RUB)/Subways. In existing RUB/subways feasible remedial measures like water flow diversion to nearest bridge & nallahs, provision of covered shed on approach roads, provision of hump at entry to Road under Bridge (RUB), provision of cross drains, sealing of joints etc. have been made as per site suitability. In addition, pumping arrangement has also been made in identified RUBs, to drain out water expeditiously in case of emergency.*****
