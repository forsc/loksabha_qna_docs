ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) 	Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM) a centrally sponsored scheme was launched in June 2011. It aims to reduce poverty through promotion of diversified and gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment resulting in appreciable income increase of the rural poor on sustainable basis. The mission seeks to achieve its objective through investing in four core components viz., (i) social mobilization and promotion of sustainable community institutions of the rural poor (Self Help Groups-SHGs, Village Organisations-VOs, Cluster Level Federations); (ii) financial inclusion, (iii) sustainable livelihoods; and (iv) convergence and entitlements.  In addition, there are various sub-schemes like Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana (MKSP), Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Programme (SVEP), Aajeevika Gramin Express Yojana (AGEY), National Rural Economic Transformation Project (NRETP), Deendayal Upadhyay Gramin Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETI) being implemented within the mission for enhancing the income on sustainable basis of the rural poor.(b)  	The funds allocated and released along with the number of women households mobilized into SHGs during the last four years is given in the table below: Indicators	                2018-19	       2019-20	     2020-21	2021-22 (up to Feb’22)Women Households mobilized into SHGs (in Lakh)	         113.83	      107.06	      61.82	     56.51SHGs promoted (in Lakh)	          10.32	        9.77	       6.02	      5.43Central Allocation under NRLM (Rs in crore)	        3043.37	     4292.91	    4826.46	   8475.72Central Release under NRLM* (Rs in crore)	                3010.63	     4088.16	    5223.30	   5499.89 *There is a provision of providing third installment to better performing States(c) 	No such proposal is under consideration of the Government. However, it is always open to Hon''ble MPs to support SHGs through grants from the Member of Parliament Local Area Development funds.(d) 	Does not arise. (e) 	Under DAY-NRLM, funding support is provided to the SHGs and their federations in the form of Revolving Fund and Community Investment Support Fund.  This helps them in creating a corpus from which the members can avail loans for various purposes.  In addition, the SHGs are facilitated for bank linkage for accessing credit at subsidised rate of interest. This Ministry is also implementing Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Programme (SVEP) as a sub-scheme under the DAY-NRLM with the objective to help the SHG households to set-up enterprises at the village level in non-agricultural sectors. SVEP has a provision for support through Community Enterprise Fund for the beneficiary households to partly meet the cost of setting up the enterprise and the rest is expected to be contributed by the beneficiary from her own savings or bank credit.    *******
