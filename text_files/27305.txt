ANSWER




              THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE          MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS               (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE) (a): States/ Union Territories (UTs)have undertaken demand survey to assess the actual demand of housing under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana–Urban (PMAY-U) and assessed demand reported by States/ UTs is around 112.24 lakhs. Based on the project proposals submitted by  the states/UTs as per their assessed demand, a total of 112,95,047 houses have been sanctioned across the country. Against the total sanctioned houses, 84,67,568 have been grounded for construction and 50,16,642 have been completed and delivered to beneficiaries. State/ UT-wise details are at Annexure.(b)& (c):	Yes, Sir. The Scheme has progressed well, which is reflected from the fact that this Ministry has already sanctioned entire assessed demand of houses under the Scheme; out of which over 50 lakh have already been completed/delivered to beneficiaries and remaining are at various stages of construction. The Scheme is well poised to achieve the vision of ‘Housing for All’ within the Mission period.(d):	To achieve the Mission of ‘Housing for All’ by 2022, States/ UTs have been advised to ground for construction of the remaining sanctioned houses, complete all houses already grounded and saturate the demand city-wise.  Further, this Ministry has taken following steps for effective implementation of the Scheme:i.	Ministry monitors progress of the Scheme through periodic review meetings, video-conferences and field visits. ii.	To ensure uninterrupted flow of funds, in addition to budgetary resources, National Urban Housing Fund (NUHF) for ?60,000 crore has been created for raising Extra Budgetary Resources (EBR) in phases for rapid implementation of the Scheme.  iii.	Use of Information/ Space Technology through PMAY(U)-MIS (Management Information System), Bhuvan Portal, PFMS (Public Financial Management System) and Geo-tagging/ Geo-fencing of sanctioned houses are being done for effective monitoring and expeditious release of Central Assistance.iv.	Payment through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) Mode and Aadhaar seeding of beneficiaries is ensured for transparency and accountability.v.	Alternative and innovative construction technologies have been promoted under the Scheme for rapid delivery of houses.  vi.	A web based monitoring system; CLSS Awas Portal (CLAP) has been developed where all stakeholders such as MoHUA, Central Nodal Agencies, Primary Lending Institutions, Beneficiaries and Citizens are integrated in real time environment. The portal facilitates expeditious processing of applications along with tracking of subsidy status by beneficiaries.vii.	PMAY-U Awards 2021 have been strategized through 100-Days Challenge for performance against pre-defined indicators with emphasis on grounding, completion, occupancy of houses and declaration of ‘HFA Achieved Cities/ States/ UTs’ during the period from 21.06.2021 to 30.09.2021.(e):	Yes, Sir.  In-Situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) vertical of PMAY-U, specifically targets at redevelopment of slums in the country towards making urban India slum free. It adopts the strategy of using land as a resource, aiming at leveraging the locked potential of land under slums to provide houses to eligible slum dwellers. The projects for redevelopment of slums are prepared by respective States/UTs and approved by State Level Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee (SLSMC). After approval from the concerned SLSMC, the States/UTs submit the proposals to this Ministry for approval of Central Assistance by the Central Sanctioning and Monitoring Committee. This Ministry provides Central Assistance of ?1 lakh/house under ISSR vertical of the Scheme.                                     ******
