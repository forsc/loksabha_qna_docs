ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SUSHRI PRATIMA BHOUMIK)(a)& (b): The targets originally set under the Accessible India Campaign have not been revised, however the deadlines have been revised.  The details of the targets and revised deadlines are attached at Annexure-I.In the Central Advisory Board meeting held on 26.11.2020, deadlines of the Campaign were reviewed and extended till 14th June, 2022. The reasons for revision of deadlines are: i) Slow progress by the Implementing agencies (State/UT Governments). ii) Severe effect of COVID 19 Pandemic on-site activities. (c): As per the information received from Ministry of Railwaysin the year 2015, a target was set to make A1, A & B category railway stations fully accessible. Consequently, all 709 A-1, A & B category railway stations (erstwhile) have been provided with all facilities to make railway stations accessible for Divyangjans such as ramps, reserved parking near entrance, accessible toilets, accessible drinking water facilities, accessible lifts, “May I Help You” booths, signages etc. In February, 2020 the harmonized guidelines for accessibility of Railways have been circulated for implementation over Indian railways. Indian Railways endeavor to provide comprehensive facilities and services to Divyangjan, which inter-alia include an easy use of information system, accessible infrastructure, various concessions to passengers travelling on Divyangjan concession Tickets, Human Assistance, Wheel Chairs, Signages, etc at railway stations on Indian Railways. 	The state/UT Governments send proposals to the Ministry to provide accessibility features in the identified Government buildings. After conducting detailed scrutiny of the proposals, funds are released as per the provisions of scheme guidelines. If these are not as per the scheme guidelines or any deficiency is found in the proposal, clarification /revised proposal is sought from the Implementing agencies (State/UT Government).Under the Accessible India Campaign,  as per the information received from CPWD, retrofitting work of 1030 Central Governments buildings out of 1108 buildings has been completed. Further, 1671 State/UT Government owned buildings were audited for providing accessibility features in the most important government buildings in 48 cities. Out of these 1671 buildings, proposals for 1484 buildings were received from States/UTs. Out of the 1484 buildings, 1191 buildings were given funds as the proposals were found to be compliant with provisions of the Scheme. State-wisestatus of State/UT government buildings is at Annexure II. (d) & (e): All public buildings including restaurants are to be made accessible as per the ‘Harmonized Guidelines’ which are the notified standards for accessibility in public buildings under the RPwD Rules, 2017. All stakeholders of the campaign have already been informed of the provisions of the Act, 2016 and Rules 2017.Further, the Department is also working with Ministry of Tourism for formulation of accessibility guidelines which can be applicable to tourist places including restaurants.
