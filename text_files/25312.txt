                                                        (a)	Yes Sir. Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE) has formulated the special programme for the training of reverse Shramik (migrant) imparted from COVID-19 under its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY). (b)       This special programme for training of reverse migrants under PMKVY has covered 116 districts of 6 States namely Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh selected under Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan (GKRA) of Ministry of Rural Development. PMKVY has two components namely Short Term Training (STT) and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). As on 10.07.2021, 70,823 migrants have been trained / oriented (32,789 in short term training STT) + 38,034 in Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)) including 31,619 from State of Bihar and 12,478 from State of Rajasthan. (c)	Under this special programme the identification of reverse migrants and their mapping with job roles was done with the support of District Administration. Also, STT is linked to placement, while RPL recognizes the exciting skills of candidates and does not mandate placement. Under STT-PMKVY, 32,789 and 22,954 candidates have been rained and certified, respectively. Out of certified Candidates, 9,161 candidates have been provided with the placement (wage/self employment) in various sectors.
