ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	The Radhakrishna Committee was set up by the Ministry of Rural Development to examine the credit related issues under SGSY and bringing out the deficiencies in the delivery system.(b):	Some of the major findings of the study are as follows : •	Delay in sanctioning of loans, non-cooperation of the banks and lack of proper guidance were creating problems•	There was lack of coordination between bank branches and block officials•	No effective monitoring was being made after sanctioning loans(c):	The Radhakrishna Committee noted that the overall credit achievement under SGSY was very low and that there were persistent gaps between credit targets set and the actual mobilization of credit. The report also states that this is partly due to failure to strengthen the demand side of the credit by improving the capacity of the poor to absorb credit for income generating activities and also due to supply side failures. The report notes that the financial services did not have the systems and procedures suited to the poor. In addition, the credit flow was severely handicapped due to the low number of bank branches and manpower. (d):	The Swarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY) was started in 1999 and restructured in FY 2010-11 as the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (Aajeevika) based on the recommendation of Radhakrishna Committee and was formally launched on 3rd June, 2011. After a transition period of two years, SGSY has ceased to exist with effect from 1.4.2013. National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM), now known as DAY-NRLM, aims to cover all rural poor families in a phased manner by 2023-24. The programme aims at building strong and sustainable grass roots institutions of rural poor women and enabling them to access resources and knowledge for gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities and thereby achieve appreciable improvement in their incomes on a sustainable basis. (e):	The State-wise details of financial assistance provided under NRLM since inception is annexed at Annexure-1 and credit disbursed to SHG Members is annexed at Annexure -2.
