MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) & (b):	The revisions/improvements in the crop insurance schemes is a continuous process and decisions on suggstions/representations are taken from time to time after consultation with various stakeholders.    Accordingly, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) has been introduced from Kharif 2016 to provide a simple and affordable crop insurance product to ensure comprehensive risk cover for crops of farmers against all non-preventable natural risks from pre-sowing to post-harvest, to provide adequate claim amount and timely settlement of claims.   Based on the discussions with stakeholders, Government has introduced various changes over the erstwhile crop insurance schemes.  Major changes made interalia include very low premium rates i.e. maximum 1.5% for Rabi, 2% for Kharif food and oilseed crops and 5% for commercial/horticultural crops and remaining part of the actuarial/bidded/premium is paid by the Government; removal of capping on premium, equating of sum insured with scale of finance/notional average yield to provide maximum risk coverage and adequate claim amount etc. to increase the benefit under PMFBY to farmers.	Based on the experience of implementation of PMFBY and views of stakeholders, the scheme and its Operational Guidelines were further revised/revamped twice  w.e.f. Rabi 2018-19 season and Kharif 2020 season respectively. Major features of revamped PMFBY are annexed.
