ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE)OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING and URBAN AFFAIRS                             (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a) to (c)  Land and Colonization are State subjects and hence fulfilling the requirement of housing for the people of the State is the responsibility of the State Government. The Union Government, however, through its programmatic intervention assists the States/UTs in their efforts for providing houses to the needy people. The Pradhan Manti Awas Yojana (Urban) [PMAY (U)] launched in June 2015 aims at providing Central Assistance to implementing agencies through States and UTs for providing houses to all eligible families/beneficiaries by 2022.	The scheme of PMAY (U) focuses to cover the entire urban area consisting of all statutory towns and planning areas including Urban Development Authorities (UDAs) notified with respect to the Statutory Towns, and which surround the concerned municipal areas. The scheme guidelines does not provide for any restriction for States/UTs to consider projects for Affordable Housing under the scheme in the vacant land of SEZs in urban area. 	The Ministry has considered all the project proposals submitted by the States/UTs so far under PMAY (U). The details of such housing projects considered duringthe last three years and the current year, State-wise, including Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, along with funds sanctioned/spent thereon are given at Annexure. The Ministry does not separately maintain any data regarding projects taken up by States/UTs under the scheme in SEZs.                                          *****
