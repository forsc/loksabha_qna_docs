Average annual Budget allocation for infrastructure and safety works, falling fully/partly in State of Bihar during 2014-19, has been enhanced to ?3,061 crore per year from ?1,132 crore per year during 2009-14, which is 170% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14 and budget outlay of ?4,489 crore was provided for these projects for financial year 2020-21 which is 297% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14. For financial year 2021-22, highest-ever budget outlay of ?5,150 crore has been provided for these works, which is 355% more with respect to average annual budget outlay of 2009-14.During 2014-21, 968 Km length (317 Km New Lines, 345 Km Gauge Conversion and 306 Km Doubling) falling fully/partly in the State of Bihar has been commissioned at an average rate of 138.29 Km/year, which is 117% more than the commissioning during 2009-14 (63.6 Km/year).State of Bihar is covered by East Central Railway (ECR), Eastern Railway (ER), North Eastern Railway (NER) and Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) Zone of Indian Railways.  The project-wise details including cost, expenditure and outlay are available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in> Ministry of Railways> Railway Board > About Indian Railways> Railway Board Directorates> Finance (Budget)> Pink Book (year)>Railways-wise Works, Machinery & Rolling Stock Programme (RSP).(c):  Government of Bihar has not proposed to bear cost of any ongoing railway project(b) and (f):   Railways have taken up various steps for effective and speedy implementation of rail projects which include (i) prioritisation of projects, (ii) substantial increase in allocation of funds, (iii) delegation of powers at field level, (iv) close monitoring of progress of project at various levels (v) regular follow up with State Governments and concerned authorities for expeditious land acquisition, forestry and Wildlife clearances and for resolving other issues pertaining to projects.(g) and (h): Completion of any Railway project/s depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forestry clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project/s site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions, etc.  All these factors vary from project to project and affect the completion time of the project/s.  As such, no confirmed timeline of completion of the project/s can be ascertained at this stage.  Nevertheless, Railways are making all efforts to complete these projects at the earliest.*****
