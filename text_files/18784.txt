ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) 	The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) was launched with the objective to provide rural connectivity, by way of a single all-weather road, to the eligible unconnected habitations of designated population size (500+ in plain areas and 250+ in North-Eastern States, Himalayan States and Himalayan Union Territories, Deserts and Tribal Areas as per 2001 census) in the core network for uplifting the socio-economic condition of the rural population. In the critical Left Wing Extremism affected blocks (as identified by Ministry of Home Affairs), additional relaxation has been given to connect habitations with population 100 persons and above (2001 census). The mandate of the scheme was subsequently widened and new interventions namely PMGSY-II with a target to upgrade 50,000 Kms  of the existing rural road network to improve its overall efficiency as a provider of transportation services for people, goods and services;  Road Connectivity Project for Left Wing Extremism Affected Areas (RCPLWEA) for construction/upgradation of strategically important roads; and   PMGSY-III for consolidation of 1,25,000 Km Through Routes and Major Rural Links connecting habitations,  inter-alia, to Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs), Higher Secondary Schools and Hospitals were launched.The main features of PMGSY are decentralized and evidence based planning, standards and specifications as per Indian Road Congress (IRC) and Rural Roads Manual, dedicated implementation mechanism at central, state and district level, scrutiny of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) at multiple level, strong IT backbone for monitoring and implementation of programme, three-tier quality management system, unbroken flow of funds, inbuilt mechanism for consultation with public representatives at planning, selection of roads and monitoring stages, etc. (b) 	The State of Rajasthan has been allocated target length of 8,662.5 Km under PMGSY-III, against which the State has already been sanctioned 5,821.363 Km.  The district-wise break-up of roads sanctioned under PMGSY-III is given at Annexure-I. (c)  	The details regarding States/UTs-wise status, including the State of Rajasthan of value of projects sanctioned, central and state shares of value of project and central share released,  is attached at Annexure-II. The release of funds to the States/UTs depends on works in hand, execution capacity, unspent balance available with the state etc. Thus, the states have sufficient funds to execute works at hand.(d) 	There is no proposal under consideration of the Government of as of now for next phase of the scheme. (e) 	Dausa district of Rajasthan is included in 3rd phase of PMGSY. A total of 22 roads of 183.450 Km have been sanctioned to the district so far under PMGSY-III.    ******
