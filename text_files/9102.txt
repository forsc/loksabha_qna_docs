                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) :  Under the eCourts Mission Mode Project, video conferencing facility has been enabled between 3240 court complexes and 1272 corresponding jails.  State/UT wise information is placed in the Annexure.(b)	and (c): An amendment was made in section 167 (2) (b) of Code of Criminal Procedure to extend further detention of the accused in judicial custody through the medium of electronic video linkage. As per the said section, no Magistrate shall authorise detention of the accused in custody of the police under this section unless the accused is produced before him in person for the first time and subsequently every time till the accused remains in the custody of the police, but the Magistrate may extend further detention in judicial custody on production of the accused either in person or through the medium of electronic video linkage.  (d)	 and ((e) : The nodal agency in charge of monitoring and documenting the use of video conferencing varies from State to State. In some States, the documentation is recorded in the proceedings of case records. In some States, Nodal Officers under eCourts project at District Level and Central Project Coordinator (CPC) of High Court at State Level do the monitoring and documenting of use of video conferencing.  In some other States, the remote end District Jails are also maintaining the records of such under trial prisoners in which judicial proceedings are conducted through video conferencing.  Therefore, the details of number of prisoners being produced via video conferencing for remand hearing and trial hearings across the country are not maintained centrally but by the respective nodal agency.----- ANNEXURES.No	High Court	State/UT	Total Court Complexes	Total Jails1	Allahabad	Uttar Pradesh	150	652	Andhra Pradesh	Andhra Pradesh	212	1113	Bombay	D & N Haveli	1	1		Daman & Diu	2	2		Goa	17	2		Maharashtra	466	1384	Calcutta	A & N Islands	4	4		West Bengal	84	535	Chhattisgarh	Chhattisgarh	90	286	Delhi	Delhi	6	107	Gauhati	Arunachal Pradesh	14	2		Assam	68	29		Mizoram	8	7		Nagaland	11	118	Gujarat	Gujarat	327	239	Himachal Pradesh	Himachal Pradesh	43	1210	Jammu and Kashmir	Jammu and Kashmir	86	1411	Jharkhand	Jharkhand	28	2712	Karnataka	Karnataka	200	9713	Kerala	Kerala	156	33		Lakshadweep	3	414	Madhya Pradesh	Madhya Pradesh	203	12215	Madras	Puducherry	4	2		Tamil Nadu	263	11716	Manipur	Manipur	17	217	Meghalaya	Meghalaya	6	418	Orissa	Odisha	141	8819	Patna	Bihar	76	5620	Punjab & Haryana	Chandigarh	1	1		Haryana	53	19		Punjab	64	2421	Rajasthan	Rajasthan	238	9522	Sikkim	Sikkim	4	223	Telangana	Telangana	129	4424	Tripura	Tripura	13	1325	Uttarakhand	Uttarakhand	52	10TOTAL	3240	1272
