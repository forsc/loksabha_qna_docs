Many species like tiger, elephants, rhino etc. have been saved from the brink of extinction and are thriving in the country.iii.	Eco-sensitive Zones around most of the national parks and sanctuaries have been notified providing more area as buffer for the safety and conservation of the endangered species.iv.	Financial assistance is provided to the State/Union Territory Governments under the Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Development of Wildlife Habitats, Project Tiger and Project Elephant, for providing better protection to wildlife including rare species of animals and improvement of their habitat.v.	A specific component of ‘Recovery Programmefor Saving Critically Endangered Species and Habitats’ is provided in the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of ‘Development of Wildlife Habitats’ for focused conservation action on 21 identified critically endangered species, including Arabian Sea Humpback Whale, Gangetic dolphins, Snow leopard, Hangul, Sangai deer, Marine turtle, Bustards, vultures, etc. Financial assistance is provided to States/UTs for recovery programme of the critically endangered species of birds and animals. vi.	Rare and endangered species found in India, like Tiger, Snow Leopard,  Great Indian Bustard, Gangetic Dolphin, Dugong, etc. have been listed in Schedule-I of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, thereby providing them highest degree of protection.vii.	The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 provides for stringent punishment for violation of its provisions. The Act also provides for forfeiture of any equipment, vehicle or weapon that is used for committing wildlife offence(s). viii.	The local communities are involved in conservation measures through eco-development activities who help the forest department in protection of wildlife. ix.
