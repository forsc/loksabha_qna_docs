ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STEEL			   (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a)to(c): In view of huge steel capacity available with China, the Indian Steel sector could have faced threat from cheap Chinese steel imports.  Under RCEP, such imports would have got the advantage of preferential tariff and harmed the Indian Steel Industry.  The Government’s decision not to join RCEP has been welcomed by the domestic steel industry.During the 3rd Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) summit, which was held on 4th November, 2019 in Bangkok, India highlighted the fact that the current structure of RCEP did not fully reflect the RCEP Guiding Principles or address the outstanding issues and concerns of India, in light of which India did not join the consensus.  India also stated that the Act East Policy was the bedrock of India’s economic policy and India’s engagement with other trading partners would continue. ********
