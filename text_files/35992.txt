The Average Annual Budget allocation in the Indian Railways for New Line, Gauge Conversion and Doubling projects during 2014-19 has been increased to `26,026 crore per year from `11,527 crore per year during 2009-14, which is 126% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14. The Annual budget allocation for these Projects for Financial Year 2019-20 was `39,836 crore (246% more than average annual budget allocation during 2009-14) and `43,626 crore in Financial Year 2020-21 (278% more than the Average Annual Budget allocation during 2009-14). For Financial year 2021-22, budget outlay of `52,398 crore has been provided for these projects, which is 355% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14. For Financial year 2022-23, highest ever budget outlay of `67,001 crore has been proposed for these projects, which is 481% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14.Since 2014, there has been substantial increase in fund allocation and commensurate commissioning of projects falling fully/partly in Rajasthan. Average Annual Budget allocation for Infrastructure projects & safety works, falling fully/ partly in State of Rajasthan, during 2014-19 has been enhanced to `2,951 crore per year from `682 crore per year during 2009-14, which is 333% more than Average Annual Budget allocation during 2009-14. These allocations have increased to `4,686 crore in Financial Year 2019-20 (587% more than the Average Annual Budget allocation of 2009-14) and `4,582 crore in Financial Year 2020-21(572% more than the Average Annual Budget allocation of 2009-14). For Financial Year 2021-22, Budget outlay of `6,006 crore has been provided for these projects, which is 781% more than the Average Annual Budget outlay of 2009-14 (`682 crore per year).

During 2014-21, across the Indian Railways, 17,720 km length (3,681 km New Line, 4,871 km Gauge Conversion and 9,168 km Doubling) has been commissioned at an average of 2,531 km/year which is 67% more than the average commissioning during 2009-14 (1520 km/year). During 2014-21, 1947 Km length (176 km of New line, 637 km Gauge conversion and 1134 km Doubling) falling fully/partly in the State of Rajasthan has been commissioned at an average rate 278.14 km per year, which is 74% more than commissioning during 2009-14 (159.6 Km/Yr.).Railway has reviewed all the projects based on last mile connectivity, missing links, traffic potential on the project, capacity enhancement, availability of land, forest/wild-life clearance etc. and based on the review, Railway projects have been prioritized. Presently, Railway’s focus is on completion of capacity enhancement projects and last mile connectivity projects. Budget outlay has been provided to the projects in a rationalized manner and budget has been allotted to the projects which are in advance stage of completion,  priority projects,  important New Line & National projects, executable & important Gauge conversion projects and the projects which are important from the throughput enhancement considerations. Thus, focused attention is given in fund allotment, rather than thinly spreading the resources without commensurate results.The completion of any Railway project(s) depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, deposition of cost share by State Government in cost sharing projects, priority of projects, shifting of infringing  utilities,  statutory  clearances  from  various  authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project(s) site, number of working months  in  a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions etc. and all these factors affect the completion time and cost of the project(s) due to which the confirmed time frame for completion of projects cannot be ascertained at this stage. However, Railways is making all the efforts for expeditious completion of projects. Various steps being taken by the Government for effective and speedy implementation of rail projects include (i) prioritisation of projects (ii) substantial increase in allocation of funds on priority projects (iii) delegation of powers at field level (iv) close  monitoring  of  progress  of project at various levels, and (v) regular follow up with State Governments and concerned authorities for expeditious land acquisition, forestry and Wildlife clearances and for resolving other issues pertaining to projects.(f): Various steps have been taken by the Government to check train accidents. Some of these are enumerated below:•	Indian Railway has developed its own indigenous Automatic Train Protection (ATP) Systems called Kavach for enhancing safety of running trains. KAVACH has been developed indigenously by RDSO in association with three Indian Vendors and it has been adopted as our National Automatic Train Protection (ATP) System. KAVACH will not only aid Loco Pilot to avoid Signal Passing At Danger (SPAD) and over speeding but also help in train running during inclement weather such as dense fog. Thus, Kavach will enhance safety and efficiency of train operations. •	Electrical/Electronic Interlocking System with centralized operation of points and signals are being provided to eliminate accidents due to human failure. These systems have been provided at 6297 stations as on 31.01.2022;•	Track Circuiting of stations to enhance safety for verification of track occupancy by electrical means instead of human element has been provided at 6273 stations upto 31.01.2022;•	Axle Counter for Automatic clearance of Block Section (BPAC) to ensure complete arrival of train without manual intervention before granting line clear to the next train have been provided on 5958 block sections upto  31.01.2022;•	Interlocking of Level Crossing Gates (LC) has been provided at 10731 Level Crossing Gates upto 31.01.2022 for enhancing safety at LC Gate;•	Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh (RRSK) has been introduced in 2017-18 for replacement/renewal/upgradation of critical safety assets;•	All locomotives are equipped with Vigilance Control Devices(VCD) to ensure alertness of Loco Pilots;•	Retro-reflective sigma (S) boards are being provided on the mast which is located two OHE masts prior to the signals in electrified territories to warn the crew about signal ahead when visibility is low due to foggy weather;•	A GPS based Fog Pass device is being provided to loco pilots in fog affected areas which enables loco pilots to know the distance of the approaching landmarks like signals, level crossing gates etc.;•	Modern track structure consisting of 60kg, 90 Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) rails, Pre-stressed Concrete Sleeper (PSC) Normal/Wide base sleepers with elastic fastening, fanshaped layout turnout on PC sleepers, Steel Channel/H-beam Sleepers on girder bridges is used, while carrying out primary track renewals;•	Patrolling of railway tracks is done to look out for weld/rail fractures for ensuring safety;•	Ultrasonic Flaw Detection (USFD) testing of rails to detect flaws and timely removal of defective rails;•	With a view to provide safer and more comfortable journey to thetravelling passengers, conventional Integral Coach Factory (ICF) type coaches are being gradually replaced with Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches in a phased manner. Production Units of Indian Railways have stopped the manufacturing of ICF type coaches from 2018-19 onwards;•	Provision of fire detection and suppression system in newly manufactured Power Cars and Pantry Cars and Fire and Smoke detection system in newly manufactured AC coaches;•	All Unmanned Level Crossings (UMLCs) on Broad Gauge (BG) route on Indian Railway have been eliminated;•	Elimination of Manned Level Crossing gates by closure and providing Road Under Bridge (RUB) and Road Over Bridge (ROB) at location;•	Mechanization of track maintenance is being carried out to reduce human errors. Track management system has been introduced on Indian Railways for development of database and decision support system and to decide rationalize maintenance requirement and optimize inputs.*****
