MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (c): A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) TO (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 89 TO BE ANSWERED ON 26.07.2021 ASKED BY MS. LOCKET CHATTERJEE, HON’BLE MP REGARDING GIRLS EDUCATION DURING PANDEMIC.(a): Education being in the concurrent list of the Constitution, majority of the schools are under the domain of respective State and UT Governments. A sample survey was conducted in the month of July, 2020 for schools of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) and Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) by the Department. Subsequently, further surveys were conducted in early 2021 regarding availability of various forms of digital devices with children. NVS has reported 92.5% and KVS has more than 98% of students having full or partial access to some digital device. Subsequently, NCERT has prepared ‘Alternative Academic Calendar’ and ‘Students’ Learning Enhancement Guidelines’. The guidelines suggest models for the following three types of scenarios to ensure that no child is deprived of reach of education and are available at Education Ministry’s and NCERT’s website:-a) Learning Enhancement during COVID-19 for students without digital devices;b) Learning Enhancement during COVID-19 for students with limited accessibility to digital devices &c) Learning Enhancement during COVID-19 for students with digital devices.States/UTs were again advised vide letter dated 01.02.2021 to conduct survey of children with access and without access to digital devices and also the special efforts made for the girl child.(b) to (c): The complexity and diversity of digital penetration in India could make it possible that children in rural areas including girls have inadequate access to computer or smart phones. A comprehensive initiative called PM eVIDYA has been initiated as part of Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan on 17th May, 2020, which unifies all efforts related to digital/online/on-air education to enable multi-mode access to education. The initiative includes:• DIKSHA (one nation, one digital platform) is the nation’s digital infrastructure for providing quality e-content for school education in states/UTs and QR coded Energized Textbooks for all grades are available on it.• One earmarked Swayam Prabha TV channel per class from 1 to 12 (one class, one channel).• Extensive use of Radio, Community radio and CBSE Podcast- Shiksha Vani.• Special e-content for visually and hearing impaired developed on Digitally Accessible Information System (DAISY) and in sign language on NIOS website/ YouTube.Several measures have been taken by the State and UT Governments amid the economic crisis faced by the people due to COVID pandemic. States/UTs have prepared educational content in the form of audios and videos and telecasted on local Radio and TV channels or YouTube Channels. Bridge course material, workbooks, text books etc along with digital devices have also been provided to help the students. Mobile applications with pre-loaded content have been developed. Also alternate academic calendar has been made for home based learning. Regular home visits have been made by the teachers/volunteers and Mohalla classes or Community classes etc. have been conducted to support education.Further, due to COVID pandemic, since schools were closed, all enrolled children at elementary level were provided Food Security Allowance comprising of food grains and dry ration of pulses etc.*****
