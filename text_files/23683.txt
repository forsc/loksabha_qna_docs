STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. 415 BY SHRI RAJESHBHAI CHUDASAMA TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 24.03.2021 REGARDING STENGTHENING OF RAILWAY BRIDGES.(a) to (c): Safety of Bridges across the country including Gujarat is accorded high priority by Indian Railways. Railways follow a well established system of inspection of each bridge including Road Over Bridge (ROB)/Road Under Bridge (RUB) twice a year, once before the onset of monsoon and once after monsoon by the designated officials. After inspection, every bridge is assigned an Overall Rating Number (ORN) and based on the ORN of bridge, Repair/Rehabilitation/Rebuilding/Strengthening is undertaken, which is an ongoing process. Each year, bridges including over bridges are identified for Rebuilding/Rehabilitation/Strengthening based on priority of repair required depending on their physical condition and functionality.To further ensure the safety of bridges, 3rd party audit of 815 identified bridges have been undertaken through expert agencies like IIT, NIT etc. Necessary repairs, wherever required, have been carried out.To make the entire system transparent, Boards have been provided at all ROBs, FOBs and for railway bridges at the stations. To further increase the transparency and to establish reliability of railway’s infrastructure, the photographs of boards at ROBs/FOBs and at stations have been uploaded on rail drishti.*****
