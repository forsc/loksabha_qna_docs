                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (e): A statement is laid on the Table of the House.Statement in reply to part (a) to (e) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No.156 for 28.11.2019 regarding DELIVERY OF AIRCRAFT tabled by SHRI SHANMUGA SUNDARAM K., MP  (a): Total number of Aircraft ordered by Indian Scheduled Carriers  from Boeing is at Annexure-I.    (b) : The delivery of 27 B787-8 aircraft to Air India was delayed by Boeing due to production / design problems. The delay in the actual delivery vis-a-vis scheduled delivery of these 27 aircraft is attached as Annexure-II; ; (c): The Purchase Agreement between Boeing and Air India relating to B787 aircraft provided for certain contractual remedies and compensation to Air India in case of delayed deliveries by Boeing. Since there was a considerable delay in B787 aircraft deliveries, a Board Overseeing Committee was constituted by Air India Board to initiate discussion with Boeing to arrive at an enhanced settlement package prior to taking delivery of the first aircraft. The Board Sub-Committee had series of meetings with Boeing and had forwarded the final compensation offered by Boeing to Government for approval. On receiving approval, Boeing and Air India signed a supplemental delay agreement on 5th September 2012 with Boeing for enhanced compensation for these delays.  (d) and (e): In accordance with the clause for delayed delivery in purchase agreement entered with Boeing, the compensation was based on a daily lease rentals capped to maximum of 180 delay days. Air India further extensively negotiated with Boeing and was able to raise the compensation level and also secure concession that the escalation clauses in the agreement will not be applicable for the delayed deliveries and B787 aircraft would be delivered as per the price of original delivery schedule.
