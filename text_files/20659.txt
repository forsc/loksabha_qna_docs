The strategy comprises of (i) Awareness generation and behavioural change, (ii) regulatory regime for phase out of identified single use plastic items under Plastic Waste Management (PWM) Rules, 2016, (iii) engagement with central ministries, State Governments, Local Bodiesfor better enforcement and wider penetration of alternatives to single use plastic items, (iii) engagement with industry and industry associationsfor assistance and capacity building, and (iv) strengthening of institutional mechanism for enforcement of PWM Rules.Already under Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, plastic carry bag and sheets less than fifty microns in thickness have been prohibited. There is complete ban on sachets using plastic material used for storing, packing or selling gutkha, tobacco and pan masala. Further, the single use plastic items to be phased out by 2022 have been identified on the basis of report of the Expert Committee constituted by Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals on ‘Single Use Plastic’.(c)  The Ministry had also issued “Standard Guidelines for Single-Use Plastic” on 21st January 2019 to all States/UTs and Ministries. The Standard guidelines entails waste management system improvements, legal options for States/UTs to prohibit SUP items through regulatory measures, eco-friendly alternatives, social awareness and public education.
