ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): After repeal of the Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation market has been deregulated. Consequently, airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type for selecting whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate across the country subject to compliance with the Route Dispersal Guidelines (RDG). The Government of India with a view to achieve better connectivity of air transport services of different regions of the country has issued the RDG wherein all scheduled operators have to deploy certain percentage of their deployed capacity on Category-I routes to other Categories mentioned therein. However, it is up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and their commercial viability, in compliance with the RDG. The Ministry regularly interacts with the stakeholders from time to time with an aim to improve air connectivity. Whenever a demand for starting a route is received in the Ministry, it is shared with the airline operators for consideration.
