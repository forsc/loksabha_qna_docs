                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) In case of intra-State supply of goods or services or both, CGST so collected has been credited to Consolidated Fund of India(CFI) while SGST being credited to the Consolidated Fund of respective States, whereas inter-State supply of goods or services or both is concerned, IGST is being levied and collected by the Centre. The IGST so collected has been apportioned/settled between the Union and the States/UTs on monthly basis, on the basis of place of consumption and cross utilization as envisaged under GST law. Therefore, no State’s share of Goods and Services Tax (GST) is pending with Union of India to be paid to the States. The details of the IGST collected and shared with the States/UTs are as under:- (? in crore)FY	IGST collected 	SGST share of IGST released to States/ UTs2017-18	3,87,356	1,19,6632018-19	5,98,739	2,39,9482019-20	5,86,699	2,10,9722020-21 (till Feb’21)	5,02,877	1,86,654(b) (c) & (d) As per provisions in Section 7 of the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 loss of revenue to the States shall be calculated and released at the end of every two months’ period for 5 years. Accordingly, admissible GST compensation has already been released to the States for the FY 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 for loss of revenue due to implementation of GST (w.e.f. 01.07.2017). Further, GST compensation of Rs. 40,000 crore has been released to all States/UTs to meet partly the bi-monthly compensation for period April-May, 2020. The balance GST Compensation for the period April-May, 2020 and GST Compensation for the full period June-January’21 is pending to all States/UTs due to inadequate amount in GST Compensation Fund during current Financial Year. This has happened mainly due to the economic impact of the pandemic that has led to higher compensation requirement due to lower GST collection and at the same time lower collection of GST Compensation Cess.In order to meet the shortfall in GST Compensation to be paid to States, under the special window, Rs. 1.1 lakh crore will be borrowed by Government of India in appropriate tranche. The amount so borrowed will be passed on to the States as loan on back-to-back basis to help the States to meet the resource gap due to non-release of compensation due to inadequate balance in the compensation fund. As per this decision, Central Government has released ?1,06,104 crores to the States till 08.03.2021 as per Annexure. All States have decided to take benefit of this assistance to tide over the temporary resource gap. The states will be paid full GST Compensation as per GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 for the transition period by extending the levy of Compensation cess beyond 5 years to meet the GST revenue shortfall as well as servicing the loan borrowed through special window scheme.***** AnnexureDetails of payment of back to back loan in lieu of GST Compensation Shortfall                                                           (Amount ? in Crore)Name of State/UT	Amount released under Special borrowing scheme (as on 08.03.2021)Andhra Pradesh	2307Arunachal Pradesh	0Assam	992Bihar	3898Chhattisgarh	2655Goa	838Gujarat	9204Haryana	4344Himachal Pradesh	1714Jharkhand	1442Karnataka	12383Kerala	4923Madhya Pradesh	4533Maharashtra	11954Manipur	0Meghalaya	112Mizoram	0Nagaland	0Odisha	3815Punjab	7138Rajasthan	4249Sikkim	0Tamil Nadu	6229Telangana	2197Tripura	226Uttar Pradesh	5995Uttarakhand	2312West Bengal	3784UT of Delhi	5854UT of J&K	2268UT of Puducherry	741Total	106104
