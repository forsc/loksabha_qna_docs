ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): Vande Bharat Mission consists of special repatriation flights operated by Indian carriers and chartered flights operated by both Indian and foreign carriers. As per information provided by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), till 31.08.2020, more than 11  lakh  Indians (excluding land border crossings) have returned to India under the Vande Bharat Mission.As per information provided by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), till 31.08.2020, a total of 5817 inbound flights have been operated under the Vande Bharat Mission. Out of these, 2292 flights have been operated by Air India Group and 1938 flights by Private Indian carriers while the remaining have been operated by foreign carriers. Airline-wise details and name of countries from which evacuation has taken place till 31.08.2020 are available in Annexure. (c) & (d): There were initially some complaints regarding high airfares in VBM flights in some sectors. The aircraft were travelling empty (ferry) on the outbound leg and fares were high as the cost of operations had to be recovered from the one-way load. Also, the COVID situation has added to the cost of operations towards PPE kits, new guidelines for ground handling, sanitizers, etc. However, these fares were substantially  lower than fares charged by some of the competitor airlines. With the establishment of Air Bubble arrangements with various countries, the fares have come down and reflect market conditions.(e) & (f): The number of persons awaiting repatriation is dynamic and the number of special repatriation flights is planned accordingly. As India enters into Air Bubble arrangements with different countries, the Vande Bharat Mission gets subsumed into this new arrangement.(g) & (h): As on 10.09.2020, the total number of Air India group staff including pilots and cabin crews found affected with corona virus during operations are 829. All affected pilots and cabin crew have since recovered.
