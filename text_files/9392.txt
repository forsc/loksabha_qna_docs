ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)	 & (b)  Canals are technically designed so as to minimise the possibilities of silting during their operation. However, silting may occur in canals which reduces the design carrying capacity of canals. (c)	 & (d)  Water resources projects including operation and maintenance of canals are planned, funded, executed and  maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priorities. As part of regular maintenance activities, removal of accumulated silt is undertaken by project authorities. In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes. Activities related to micro and minor irrigation works and creation, renovation and maintenance of irrigation canals and drains etc. are also permissible under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA).De-silting of Canal is also considered under Extension, Renovation and Modernisation (ERM) of the irrigation projects. The Central Government launched Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) in 1996-97 (subsumed under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) from 2015-2016 onwards) for providing financial assistance to States as per extant guidelines with an objective of expediting the implementation of ongoing major, medium projects including Extension, Renovation and Modernization (ERM) of old Major & Medium Irrigation Projects. *****
