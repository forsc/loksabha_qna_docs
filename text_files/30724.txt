ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (d): Health is a state subject. Such information is not maintained centrally.  However, Department of Health & Family Welfare provides technical and financial support to the States/UTs under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), as part of National Health Mission (NHM), based on the proposals received from the States/UTs and subject to the resource envelope. As per AERB report, presently in 77 Government institutions including Government Medical Colleges, Linear Accelerator device is installed. The Central Government is implementing Strengthening of Tertiary Care of Cancer Scheme in order to enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer. 19 State Cancer Institutes (SCIs) and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres (TCCCs) have been approved so far under the said scheme. The financial assistance under the scheme is utilised for procurement of radiotherapy equipment, diagnostic equipment, surgical equipment, enhancement of indoor patient facility for cancer and such other purposes relevant for diagnosis, treatment and care of cancer. There is also focus on Oncology in its various aspects in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojna (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar (Haryana) and second campus of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata are also steps in the same direction.
