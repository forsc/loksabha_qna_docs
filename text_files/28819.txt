                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) to (c):   The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA), 2005, is an Act to provide for the enhancement of livelihood security of the household in rural areas of the country by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. States/UTs-wise number of households having Job cards is given at Annexure-I.  As per section 6(1) of Mahatma Gandhi NREGA 2005 (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA), the Central Government may, by notification, specify the wage rate for unskilled work for its beneficiaries. Accordingly, the Ministry of Rural Development notifies Mahatma Gandhi NREGA wage rate every year for States/UTs. The wage rate is made applicable from 1st April of each financial year.  The State/UT wise wage rates for unskilled workers under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA for the Financial Year 2021-22, are at Annexure-II. As per the Para 17 of Schedule-I of the Act, “The State Government shall link the wages, without any gender bias, with the quantity of work done and it shall be paid according to the rural schedule of rates fixed after time and motion studies for different types of work and different seasons and revised periodically”. This is being inbuilt into the design of the scheme and being scrupulously observed. (d):      State/UT-wise details of Central fund released under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA in last three financial years and current financial year 2021-22 (as on 25.11.2021) is given at Annexure-III. Direct wage payments to the accounts of beneficiaries are being made through National Electronic Fund management System (NeFMS) using DBT protocol. To monitor the progress of payment made to wage seekers, a payment dashboard has been development. Also regular review with Stakeholders (Banks, PFMS, and States) is taking place.Further, in order to monitor the timely payment of wages, this Ministry reviews the progress of States, via Labour Budget Meeting, Labour Budget Revision Meeting, Mid-Term Review Meeting and other interactions with the States/UTs.
