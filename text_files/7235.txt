(b) No Sir, the Government has not notified a complete ban on the use of polythene bags, however, Plastic Waste Management (PWM) Rules, 2016 have been notified for environmentally sound management of plastic waste and to prevent plastic pollution in the country. The Rules prohibit use of plastic bags, plastic sheet or like with thickness less than 50 micron. The Rules also prohibit use of carry bags made of recycled plastic or products made of recycled plastic for storing, carrying, dispensing or packaging ready to eat or drink food stuff. Further, sachets using plastic material are prohibited for storing, packing or selling gutkha, tobacco and pan masala. The State/UTs Governments through their own notifications have imposed ban on the use of plastic bags and other single-use items which are prone to litter within their respective jurisdiction. 22 States/UTs have issued notifications/orders imposing complete ban on plastic carry bags. 7 States/UTs have also imposed partial restriction/prohibition of plastic carry bags or other Single-use plastic products. Rest of the States/UTs have not imposed any additional restrictions on plastic bags expect the thickness criteria of 50 micron as per the PWM Rules 2016.(c) to (e) As per provision ‘12’ of PWM Rules, 2016, 21 States/UTs have imposed fine, issued notices and closure directions to the defaulters and seized materials in their respective States/UTs.
