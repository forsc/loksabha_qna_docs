                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a):	The details of mills closed since 2014 and which are presently in closed status, State wise is given below:S.No.	Closed Mills	State	Year of closure1	Khardah	West Bengal	26-12-152	Jai Jute	West Bengal	10-01-173	Kanoria	West Bengal	11-01-174	Kinnision	West Bengal	31-08-165	India 	West Bengal	12-12-156	Gondalpara	West Bengal	29-09-157	Howrah	West Bengal	24-07-158	Weaverly	West Bengal	30-01-209	Eastcoast	Andhra Pradesh	31-05-1410	Aruna	Andhra Pradesh	02-11-1511	Bobbili	Andhra Pradesh	03-08-1512	Sri Bajrang	Andhra Pradesh	04-07-1513	RBHM	Bihar	08-01-1614	J.K Jute	Uttar Pradesh	08-03-1415	Rameswara	Bihar	17-10-15(b) & (c):	Most of the Jute Mills are under Private Management. As closing and reopening of jute mills is a cyclic process which depends on various factors of production such as low productivity, trade unionism, raw material supply, fall in demand etc. therefore, no specific Committee has been appointed. However, the Government takes up any issue related to statutory dues brought to its notice with the Labour Departments of State Government and concerned jute mills. Moreover, Office of Jute Commissioner ensures a minimum of 100% of food grains and a minimum of 20% of sugar to be compulsorily packed in jute sacking as mandated by Government to ensure consistent demand for jute mills. Also, Government had imposed the Anti-dumping duty on 5th January, 2017 to protect the interests of Indian Jute Industry and the persons engaged in the industry. This resulted in creating an additional demand of 2 lakh Metric Tonnes in the domestic market for the jute industry, which led to the reopening of more than 10 Jute Twine Mills located in Andhra Pradesh, benefitting 20,000 workmen directly and indirectly.****
