ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) Forest Survey of India, Dehradun, an organization under the Ministry carries out the assessment of forest cover of the country biennially and the findings are published in India State of Forest Report (ISFR). As per the latest ISFR 2019, a total of 4,07,750 square kilometre (km2) of forest is categorized under dense forest which includes Very Dense Forest (VDF) with canopy density greater than 70% and Moderately Dense Forest (MDF) with canopy density greater than 40% and less than 70%.(b) The details of dense forest cover during last five years, as per ISFRs:(area in km2)ISFR	VDF	MDF	Total Dense Forest2015	85,904	3,15,374	4,01,2782017	98,158	3,08,318	4,06,4762019	99,278	3,08,472	4,07,750(c)& (d)  11,144 km2 area assessed as VDF, MDF and open forest in ISFR-2017, has become non-forest area as per ISFR 2019.
