ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c): Department of Land Resources (DoLR), Ministry of Rural Development implements a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, Watershed Development Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (WDC-PMKSY) for development of rainfed / degraded lands. However, there is no specific scheme being implemented by DoLR for allocating funds for agricultural development in drought prone areas of States / Union Territories (UTs).DoLR has sanctioned, 8214 watershed development projects covering an area of about 39.07 million hectare  in 28 States (except Goa)  [now 27 States and UTs of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh) during the period 2009-10 to 2014-15 under the erstwhile Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP).  During the year 2018, 1832 projects (345 uninitiated and 1487 in preparatory stage) were transferred to various States for implementation from the Budget of the concerned States.  Thereafter, DoLR is implementing 6382 projects.  IWMP was amalgamated as the Watershed Development Component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (WDC-PMKSY) in 2015-16. Keeping in view the focus of the Government on completion of all the ongoing projects, no new projects under WDC-PMKSY have been sanctioned since 2015-16. 	The State-wise details of funds released during the last three years and the current year as Central share to States under WDC-PMKSY is at Annexure. The central share is determined by taking into account various parameters such as, Annual Action Plan, unspent balance with States / UTs, utilization capacity, number of ongoing projects etc.
