                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(DR. VIRENDRA KUMAR)(a): In exercise of the powers available under Section 7-A of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act), vide Notification S.O. No. 389(E) dated 29.05.1989, the Central Government has constituted the National Fund for Control of Drug Abuse (NFCDA). Subsequently, the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (National Fund for Control of Drug Abuse) Rules, 2006 were notified on 24thMarch, 2006 and amended on 31.08.2006, 02.04.2009 and 19.08.2009. The broad parameters of funding, scope, procedure, evaluation and monitoring mechanism for managing the funds of NFCDA have already been prescribed in the NDPS (NFCDA) Rules, 2006 itself. However, for the benefit of the organizations intending to avail assistance under the NFCDA to carry out their activities in the field of controlling drug abuse, and also with the view of making the implementation of NFCDA more transparent, it was felt appropriate to outline the guidelines for effective implementation of the provisions of NDPS (NFCDA) Rules, 2006.  The funds can be utilized to meet the expenditure incurred in connection with the measures taken for: (i) Combating illicit traffic in narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances or controlled substances; (ii) Controlling the abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances;(iii) Identifying, treating, rehabilitating addicts; (iv) Preventing drug abuse; (v) Educating public against drug abuse; and (vi) Supplying drugs to addicts where such supply is a medical necessity. This is as per the information provided by Department of Revenue who are administering this National Fund.(b): There is no such activities and projects launched and conducted in the State of Rajasthan via the National Fund to Control Drug Abuse by the Department of Revenue.(c): Department of Revenue does not allocate any fund under NFCDA directly to State Government/other institutions for establishment of rehabilitation centers for the victims of drug abuse.  However, in case, if any State Government/Central Government/Any other institutions seek financial assistance under NFCDA, the same is to be examined in the Department of Revenue and placed before Governing Body of NFCDA and such amount is sanctioned to them on the basis of the recommendation of the Governing Body and with the approval of the Competent Authority.(d): Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment implements the scheme of National Action Plan for Drug Demand Reduction under which financial assistance is provided to Integrated Rehabilitation centres for Addicts (IRCAs) and Outreach and Drop in Centres (ODICs). The details of  ODICs and IRCAs running in the State of Rajasthan is placed at Annexure-I.***** Annexure-IDetails of ODICs in RajasthanS.No.	District Name	Name Of NGO 1	BARAN	MANAV JANSEVA SANSTHAN 2	DAUSA	Mahaveer Bal ShikshaAnd vikash Samiti 3	GANGANAGAR	TAPOVAN NASHA MUKTI AVAM PUNARWAS SANSTHAN 4	JAIPUR	NIRASHRIT MAHILA BAL VIKAS GRAMODHYOG SHIKSHA SAMITI 5	JAISALMER	SHUBHDEEP GROUP SEVA SANSTHAN 6	KOTA	Navodaya bal vidhyalaya samiti 7	SAWAI MADHOPUR	Rajfoundation sansthan Details of IRCAs in RajasthanS.No	District Name	Name of NGO 1	BARAN	VINAYAK RESEARCH AND WELFARE  SOCIETY KOTA 2	BARMER	SHUBHDEEP GROUPSEVA  SANSTHAN 3	BHARATPUR	NIRASHRIT MAHILA BAL VIKASGRAMODHYOG SHIKSHA SAMITI 4	BIKANER	DANTOUR VIKAS SARVAJANIKPUNYARTH TRUST 5	BUNDI	AMRAPALI PRASHIKSHAN SANSTHAN 6	DAUSA	Rajfoundation sansthan 7	DUNGARPUR	muskan sansthan 8	GANGANAGAR	J.R.
