ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): A statement is laid on the table of House.STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 374, REGARDING "REGULAR FLIGHTS FOR AGARTALA SECTOR" TO BE ANSWERED ON 18.07.2019; ; (a): No, Sir.;;  (b): With repeal of Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation was deregulated. Airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type, free to select whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate. Government has laid down Route Dispersal Guidelines with a view to achieve better air transport services for different regions of the country. It is, however, up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability. As such, the airlines are free to operate anywhere in the country subject to compliance of Route Dispersal Guidelines issued by Government.; ; However, Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN scheme on 21-10-2016 to facilitate/stimulate regional air connectivity and making air travel affordable to the masses. Promoting affordability of regional air connectivity is envisioned under RCS - UDAN by supporting airline operators through (i) concessions by Central Government, State Governments and airport operators to reduce the cost of airline operations on regional routes and (ii) financial support (Viability Gap Funding) to meet the gap,if any, between the cost of airline operations and expected revenues on regional routes. RCS - UDAN is demand driven and development of regional air connectivity routes depends on the market forces wherein airlines undertake assessment of demand and supply required on a particular route and participate in the bidding held from time to time.In the third round of bidding bidding under RCS-UDAN, Agartala-Aizawl-Agartala was awarded to M/s Indigo. ; (c): The expected date for physical completion of the work of new airport terminal building coming up at Agartala is 31st December, 2019 and likely date of commissioning for start of operations from new airport terminal building is 31st March 2020, as the same requires full scale trials of  Heating, Ventilation and Air-conditioning (HVAC) System, Conveyor Belt etc. apart from approval from Directorate General of Civil Aviation, Bureau of Civil Aviation Security and shifting of airlines hardware / software systems etc. to new location.
