ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) Total number of 46,13,91,168 PANs have been allotted as on 30.06.2019. State-wise list of PAN holders as on 30.06.2019 is given at Annexure-1. Further, there are around 30,618 PAN-TIN facilitation centres all over India. State-wise list of PAN/TIN facilitation centres as on 30.06.2019 is given at ‘Annexure-2’. (b) & (c): PAN application forms (Form-49A and Form-49AA) filed by the applicants  are being received by the PAN facility provider agencies along with  mandatory certified documents of Proof of Identity (POI), Proof of Address (POA) and Proof of Date of Birth (PoDB) as prescribed in Rule 114 of Income Tax Rules, 1962(‘IT Rules’).	Further, as provided in the PAN application forms, the applicants are also required to make a declaration that what is stated in the application is true to the best of his/her information and belief.         The application along with documents prescribed for allotment of PAN under sub-rule (4) of rule 114 of IT rules are received physically at the facilitation centres of either of two authorized PAN facility Service Providers (SP) situated all over India in urban, semi urban and rural places. The information filled in Form 49A/49AA is verified with the documents enclosed, by the SP. In case, if any discrepancy is observed in the particulars filled in Form 49A/49AA vis-a-vis the documents enclosed, a deficiency letter is issued by the SP to the applicant and application is further processed only after resolution of such deficiency.        For online PAN allotment process through Aadhaar based e-KYC mode, the Aadhaar data as per UIDAI is transferred to PAN data after verification through OTP sent on mobile number of the applicant available with UIDAI. For other online modes, the applicant himself has to submit scanned copy of the prescribed documents directly on the website of the SPs and also submit the relevant information.        As such appropriate checks and balances are incorporated in the system for validation of data submitted by the applicant, extraction of primary data from the Aadhaar data base and online submission of particulars and documents by the applicants so as to overcome any bonafide omission and acceptance of any wrong information.(d): As per sub-section (5) of section 139A of the Income-tax Act,1961 read with Rule 114B of IT rules, a person is required to quote Permanent Account Number  in respect of 18 specified transactions mentioned at Rule 114B.  In the absence of PAN, a declaration in Form 60 is required to be made. The monetary limits for such specified transactions are different for each transaction ranging from rupees fifty thousand, one lakh, two lakhs to ten lakhs. The said specified transactions and its monetary limits were notified by the Central Government through Income-tax (22nd Amendment) Rules, 2015 vide Notification dated 30.12.2015 with effect from 01.01.2016. Further, there are no new changes made in the said prescribed monetary limit recently. Therefore, the question of complaints regarding new regulations of compulsory quoting of PAN of transactions of rupees one lakh and more does not arise.(e) Does not arise in view of reply above.
