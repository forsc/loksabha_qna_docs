ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI) (a) to (d)	4/6 lane widening from Karnataka/Kerala Border to Kerala/Tamil Nadu Border of NH-66  as part of Economic Corridor component under Bharatmala Pariyojana has been taken up with 45m Right of Way (RoW). Earlier, the widening was taken up to existing highway at Cheppad location and the building of St. George Orthodox Church was not affected. However, on the opposite side, another church (The Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, Catholicate of the East) was getting affected. People objected over the widening & went to Hon’ble High court of Kerala. The Hon’ble High court on 16.01.2019 ordered to take up the matter with Government of Kerala.  	Based on the direction of Hon’ble High Court, design consultant suggested revised widening proposal which is concentric, and leading to reduction in LA cost. However, in the revised alignment, a portion of St. George Church is getting affected. The revised alignment has also been consented by Government of Kerala and approved by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). The process of Land Acquisition along the revised alignment has been initiated, Land acquisition notification under section 3(D) of NH Act has also been published vide S.O. No. 4822 (E) dated 31.12.21 and  further, action under section 3G & 3H of NH Act has been initiated.*****
