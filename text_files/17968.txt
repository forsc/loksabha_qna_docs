ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a)	to (e):No, Sir. Presently there is no such proposal. In a meeting taken by the Cabinet Secretary on the issue recently, the representative of the Election Commission of India (ECI) informed that a few State Election Commissions are already using the Electoral Roll prepared by the ECI for their Local Body elections. A decision was taken to persuade the remaining States to co-opt the Electoral Roll prepared by the ECI for their Local Body elections on the grounds of national interest in saving time, effort and expenditure, reducing duplication of work and confusion amongst voters.*******
