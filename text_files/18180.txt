There are 43 stations in Bihar and 44 Stations in Uttar Pradesh for which forecasts are issued for taking proper mitigation measures by respective State Governments. The State-wise details are given in Annexure-II(c)  Flood Forecasts are evaluated on the following criteria-Level Forecast: If the forecasted level is within +/-0.15 m of the actual level attained at the time of forecast, then the forecast is taken as correct.Inflow Forecast: If the forecasted inflow is within +/- 20% of the actual inflows attained in the reservoir the forecast is taken as correct.The overall accuracy of Flood Forecasts issued by CWC during the last 5 years is 94%, details are given in Annexure –III.*****ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.2052 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 22.09.2020 REGARDING “FLOOD MANAGEMENT”State-wise central assistance released to States/UTs under Flood Management and Border Areas Programme (FMBAP) during last three yearsRs in croresS.
