NIF scouts, supports and spawns grassroots innovations developed by individuals and local communities. It works towards wider diffusion of innovations by generating material or non-material incentives for them and others involved in the value chain. NIF facilitates in-situ incubation as a result of which an innovation which is rooted in addressing an unmet need “locally”, is comprehended, value added, improved and eventually socially and commercially disseminated, so as to address the underlying needs in totality. (b)     With the objective of disseminating knowledge about useful grassroots innovations and outstanding traditional knowledge across the country, NIF undertakes a number of efforts to create awareness by on-farm/ field demonstrations, introducing innovations in different areas, by organizing societal outreach programs, through booklets and leaflets, participating in exhibitions, and also through social media. NIF has built an Innovation Portal (www.innovation.nif.org.in) which is home to about 1.15 lakh innovations scouted from common people of the country, covering Engineering, Agriculture, Veterinary and Human Health and a resource for students, entrepreneurs, MSMEs, Technology Business Incubators (TBIs) and common people engaged in a variety of occupations. Some of the promising activities of knowledge dissemination by NIF are as follows: - (i)      NIF has successfully added thousands of grassroots innovations entries to its database from the country through its Biennial National Grassroots Innovation and Outstanding Traditional Knowledge Awards competition during last 3 years. Through the Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam IGNITE Awards of NIF, submissions from school students have been received from all States and Union Territories of the country in lakhs during last 3 years.  (ii)     NIF has been implementing INSPIRE Awards – MANAK (Million Minds Augmenting National Aspiration and Knowledge) along with Department of Science and Technology, Government of India and during last three Financial Years, ever since the scheme was revamped and aligned with Start-up India plan, a total of 15,93,324 students have participated and 1,76,204 students amongst them have been supported financially for developing prototypes of their ideas and innovations. A total of 242 workshops, 683 District level exhibitions, 89 State level exhibitions and 1 National level exhibition involving students, teachers and experts have been organized so far.(iii)    More than 1300 sanitary napkin making units across 27 states in India and in seven countries have been installed with the help of “low cost sanitary napkin machine” technology recognized by NIF in the year 2009.(iv)    More than 1200 Pochampally saree weaver families have benefited from “Laxmi Asu Making Machine”. This technology was recognized by NIF in 2009.(v)     Cotton stripping machine was widely disseminated in the state of Gujarat amongst people who had to pluck cotton from cotton bolls, which was a drudgery prone task traditionally undertaken manually.(vi)    NIF facilitated transplantation of about 20,000 saplings of low chilling variety HRMN 99 apple at over 1500 farmers'' field and 25 organizations in 30 states/UTs. (vii)   NIF has facilitated the diffusion of development of improved crop varieties of paddy, wheat, pigeon pea, mustard, carrot, apple, mango, brinjal, cauliflower, onion, pepper, cardamom etc.by more than 50 farmers and value added herbal formulations for the pest management in various crops involving a network of over 10,000 farmers from 30 States/Union Territories. (viii)  NIF facilitated introduction of grassroots innovations at Correctional homes in Gurgaon, Dasna, Ahmedabad and Dharamshala wherein prison inmates leverage these technologies so as to generate livelihood.(ix)    NIF developed a grassroots innovator series of 13 episodes covering innovators from different parts of the country which have been accorded wider publicity through various social media platforms, on the DD Science channel and India Science portal. (c)     There is no major specific project undertaken by NIF during the last three years.
