As per the State Government a specific AES ward at Shrikrishna Medical College & Hospital (SKMCH), Muzaffarpur with capacity of around 200 beds has been set up to deal with the cases. Glucometers have been provided to PHCs. 10 ambulances have already been provided and 20 more were under deployment.  Training has been imparted to the doctors and nurses from State Health Department of Bihar to deal with AES cases effectively. Roster for healthcare personnel has been prepared for deployment during peak hours. Anganwadi workers and ASHAs have been mobilized to educate people in villages regarding steps to be taken to prevent malnutrition in children.
