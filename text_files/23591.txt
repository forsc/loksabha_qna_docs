                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION                            (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	& (b) To consider continuation of Centrally Sponsored Schemes(CSS) and Central Sector (CS) schemes/ programes in the 15th Finance Commission cycle, the Department of Expenditure (DoE), in Jan’2019, decided undertaking evaluation of Central Sector (CS) and Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS). Development Monitoring & Evaluation Office (DMEO), NITI Aayog has conducted evaluations of 28 Umbrella Centrally Sponsored Schemes (UCSS), comprising around 125 CSS schemes. These schemes have been evaluated under 10 packages namely:  i) Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries, ii) Women and Child Development, iii) Human Resource Development iv) Urban Transformation v) Rural Development vi) Drinking Water and Sanitation vii) Health viii) Jobs and Skills ix) Water Resources, Environment and Forest; and x) Social Inclusion Law & Order and Justice Delivery.  (c)	& (d) The progress of scheme and fund utilization is kept in view while deciding fund allocations by the Ministry of Finance. The respective Ministry/Department facilitates the implementation of scheme, releases the fund to the States/implementing agency, time to time and are expected to monitor that the funds are utilized in efficient and effective way. (e) While the programme implementing Ministries/Departments are primarily responsible to monitor the implementation of their programmes and for taking corrective steps to ensure that the programme benefits reach the targeted population, the NITI Aayog helps them in the following ways:•	By bringing findings of the evaluation studies to the knowledge of the programme implementing Ministries/Departments for taking corrective measures;•	NITI Aayog facilitates monitoring of the progress in the implementation of programmes/schemes through Output-Outcome Management framework (OOMF) for CS/CSS Schemes of the Government of India. NITI Aayog has also developed a dashboard for this purpose which is accessed online by the Departments/Ministries for updating the progress of their progammes.                                            *****
