Eventual goal of the campaign was that the plastic waste is not dumped on land or into water but is recycled in environmentally sound manner. The campaign has achieved its near-term goal of creating awareness on the menace of plastic pollution.As reported by States, about 13,829 tonnes of plastic waste was collected and sent for environmentally sound recycling/disposal and about 1.23 lakh awareness /shramdaan activities were undertaken all over the country. The local bodies and States have set up systems emerged out of campaign for collection and safe disposal of such waste.As per the provisions of Rules,there is a prohibition for use of plastic bags, plastic sheet or like with thickness less than 50 microns.
