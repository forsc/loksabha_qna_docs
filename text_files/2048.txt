                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (e): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1865 BY SHRI GOPAL CHINNAYA SHETTY TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 03.07.2019 REGARDING PENDING RAIL PROJECTS (a): Proposals/suggestions/representations, both formal and informal regarding Railway projects are received from State Governments, Ministries of Central Government, Elected representatives, organizations/rail users etc. by Railways at various levels including Railway Board, Zonal Railways, Division Office etc. As receipt of such proposals/suggestions is a continuous and dynamic process, centralized compendium of such requests is not maintained.  Survey for new lines, gauge conversion of Meter Gauge lines to Broad Gauge and feasibility study etc. is a continuous and ongoing process of Indian Railways and is done based on demands raised by State Governments, Central Ministries, Members of Parliament, other public representatives and Railways’ own requirement.(b): At present 491 Railway projects including 189 New Lines, 55 Gauge Conversion and 247 Doubling Projects are in different stages of execution/planning/sanction. The total length of these projects is 48860.64 km costing `6.476 Lakh Crore.During the last three years and current year, Railways have taken up surveys for 272 nos. of railway projects (New Line, Gauge Conversion & Doubling works) for a total length of 26954 kms.(c): The expenditure on above mentioned 491 projects upto March, 2019 has been `1.43 Lakh Crore. However, the details of funds spent on each project, allotment of funds and expenditure are made available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in  and are also available in works, machinery & rolling stock programmes (pink book) which are available on the website of Indian Railways.Contd..2/--:  2  :-(d) & (e): The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions  of working agencies/contractors etc. and all these factors affect the completion cost of the project, which is finally worked out at the completion stage.In the overall interest of the Nation and to ensure that project are completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, divisional level, zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues that are obstructing the progress of projects.To ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects.        For important project, capacity enhancement projects, last mile connectivity etc. institutional financing has been done by arranging loan from M/s Life Insurance Corporation of India Limited for `1.5 lakh crore, which has increased Railways’ capacity for committed fund provision for essential projects.*****
