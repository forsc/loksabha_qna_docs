ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE  (DR. BHAGWAT KISHANRAO KARAD) (a)	to (e):	The Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs (CCEA), in its meeting held on 27.01.2021, accorded ‘in-principle’ approval for 100 % disinvestment of Government of India (GOI) shareholding in Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL) (also called Visakhapatnam Steel Plant or Vizag Steel) alongwith RINL’s stake in its Subsidiaries/Joint Ventures through strategic disinvestment by way of privatisation. The NITI Aayog along with other concerned Ministries/Departments of Government of India were consulted while taking the decision for strategic disinvestment of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL). Further, the Government had introduced New Public Sector Enterprise (PSE) Policy for Atmanirbhar Bharat which has been notified on 4th February, 2021 and is applicable to Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs), Public Sector Banks (PSBs) and Public Sector Insurance Companies (PSICs). As per this policy, existing Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) have been broadly classified under Strategic and Non-strategic Sectors. It has also been laid down that in strategic sectors, only a bare minimum presence of the existing PSEs at Holding Company level will be retained under Government control. The remaining enterprises in strategic sector will be considered for privatisation or merger or subsidiarization with another CPSEs or for closure. PSEs in the non-strategic sectors shall be considered for privatisation, where feasible, otherwise such enterprises shall be considered for closure. Steel manufacturing falls in the non-strategic sector. The decision of the Government to privatize Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL) is in line with the New PSE Policy.
