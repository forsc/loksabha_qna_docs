ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND POWER (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a)&(b) In the Independence Day speech on August 15, 2021, Hon’ble Prime Minister announced the launch of National Hydrogen Mission. The draft National Green Hydrogen Mission document is under inter-ministerial consultations. The proposed Mission is aimed at scaling up production and utilization of Green Hydrogen in multiple sectors including for hydrogen fuelled mobility applications. Further, Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has notified the following enabling regulatory provisions with respect to hydrogen fuelled vehicles: specifications for Hydrogen for Internal Combustion Engine vide G.S.R. 889(E) dated 16.09.2016; 18% blend of Hydrogen with CNG (HCNG) as an automotive fuel vide GSR 585(E) dated 25.09.2020; and norms regarding hydrogen fuel cell vehicles vide GSR 579(E) dated 23.09.2020.(c) Two hydrogen refuelling stations have been set up in India so far under Research and Development projects supported by the MNRE. One refuelling station installed in the campus of the National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE), Gwal Pahari, Gurugram, Haryana comprises a 5 Nm3/h (normal cubic meter per hour) capacity alkaline electrolyser. The other hydrogen refuelling station is installed at R&D Centre, Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. in Faridabad, Haryana and comprises of a 30 Nm3/hr Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyser. Both stations have been installed for R&D and demonstration purposes and the Hydrogen produced is not sold.(d) As mentioned in reply to parts (a) and (b) above, the proposed Mission aims to scale up production and utilization of Green Hydrogen in different sectors, including mobility. This is likely to lead to installation of additional hydrogen refuelling stations in the country.*****
