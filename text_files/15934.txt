ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b) A recent report titled “World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency” published in journal ‘Bioscience’ highlighted climate change and suggested six broad policy measures. The report in question is not a United Nations study and the Government does not agree to many of its conclusions.(c) Climate change is a global phenomenon and requires the cooperation of all nations based on the principles of ‘Equity’ and ‘Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities’. India is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), its Kyoto Protocol (KP) and the Paris Agreement (PA). The ambitious Paris Agreement has mechanisms like global stocktake and ratcheting up action every 5 years to address climate change and avoid adverse consequences. For addressing the challenge of climate change, India adheres to the paramountcy of the UNFCCC processes. It has proactively contributed to multilateral efforts to combat climate change and continues to do so while undertaking its own independent, enhanced initiatives in climate mitigation and adaptation besides meeting all its commitments under the UNFCCC, its KP and PA. Independent studies rate India’s efforts highly and compliant with the requirements under PA. India has achieved its pre-2020 goal of 20-25% reduction in emission intensity by 2020. It is also on track to meet PA Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030 from 2005 level; to achieve about 40 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030 with the help of transfer of technology and low-cost international finance and to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.******
