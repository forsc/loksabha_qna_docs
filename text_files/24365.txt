                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TRIBAL AFFAIRS(SMT. RENUKA SINGH SARUTA) :a.	The details of the schools for tribal children have been established/being run across the country under following schemes of this Ministry:-i.	Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS): Ministry of Tribal Affairs has been setting up EMRSs since 1997-98 for imparting quality education to tribal children in their own environment in the remote areas across the country. An EMRS has the capacity of accommodating 480 students. As per the budget announcement 2018-19, every block having 50% or more ST population and at least 20,000 ST population is to have an EMRS by 2022 and total number of schools is scheduled to become 740. The list of schools sanctioned under the scheme for the last three years and current year is at Annexure.ii.	Grant-in-aid to Voluntary Organizations working for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes: The prime objective of the scheme is to enhance the reach of welfare schemes of Government and fill the gaps in service deficient tribal areas, in the sectors such as education and health, through the efforts of voluntary organizations, and to provide favourable environment for socio-economic upliftment and overall development of the Scheduled Tribes (STs). Funds are generally provided to the extent of 90% by the Government. The voluntary organization is expected to bear the remaining 10% balance from its own resources.iii.	Scheme of Strengthening Education among ST Girls in Low Literacy Districts: The primary objective of this scheme is promotion of education among tribal girls in the identified low literacy districts of the country. The Scheme has been revised with effect from 01.04.2008. Now it is being implemented in 54 identified low literacy districts where ST Population is 25% or more and ST female literacy rate is below 35% as per 2001 census.  The Scheme aims to bridge the gap in literacy levels between the general female population and tribal women and is meant exclusively for ST Girls.  The educational complexes are established in rural areas of identified districts and have classes I to V with a provision for upgradation up to class XII, provided there is sufficient accommodation for classrooms, hostel, a kitchen, gardening and for sports facilities.iv.	Scheme of Ashram Schools in Tribal Sub-Plan Area: The objective of the scheme is to provide residential schools for STs in an environment conducive to learning to increase the literacy rate among the tribal students and to bring them at par with other population of the country.  The scheme has been revised with effect from the financial year 2008-09. Under the revised scheme, State Governments are eligible for 100% central share for construction of all Girls’ Ashram Schools and also for construction of Boys’ Ashram Schools in naxal affected areas (identified by Ministry of Home Affairs from time to time).b.	No such report has been received in this Ministry. Annexure  as mentioned in the reply to part (a) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Qs. No. 158 for 19.07.2021 asked by Shrimati Pratima Mondal regarding "Schools for Tribal People".
