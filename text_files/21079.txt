Under this scheme, an amount of Rs. 13728.12 crore has been provided to the states and an area of 53.73 lakh ha has been covered under Micro Irrigation in the country till date. With a view to providing impetus to the Micro Irrigation systems and to enhance the water use efficiency in agriculture sector, a Micro Irrigation Fund (MIF) with corpus of Rs. 5000 Crore was created with NABARD during 2018-19. The major objective of the Fund is to facilitate the States in mobilizing the resources to provide top up/ additional incentives to farmers for incentivising micro irrigation beyond the assistance available under PMKSY-PDMC. States may also access MIF exclusively for innovative integrated projects depending on State specific requirements. Government of India provides 3% interest subvention on loans extended to State Governments under MIF.   Under the MIF, the projects for Rs. 3970.17 Crore have been approved for loan to the States of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, West Bengal, Punjab & Uttarakhand till now to facilitate for bringing 12.81lakh ha under micro-irrigation.Further, to strengthen and expand the adoption of micro-irrigation systems by the farmers in the country, an announcement in Budget- 2021 has been made to enhance  the corpus of MIF to Rs. 10000 crore. *****
