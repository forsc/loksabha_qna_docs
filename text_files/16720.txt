THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI  PIYUSH GOYAL)North East Industrial and Investment Promotion Policy (NEIIPP), 2007 came in to effect from 01.04.2007 and remained in force upto 31.03.2017. All industrial units registered under the scheme which commenced commercial production within the stipulated 10 years period are eligible for incentives for a period of 10 years from the date of commercial production. At present claims are being received only in respect of those industrial units which are yet to complete the 10 years period post commercial production and hence there is a decreasing requirement of funds under NEIIPP, 2007 after 2019-20. The disbursement of Subsidy to the industrial units over the last five years under NEIIPP, 2007 is as under:<pre>F.Y.	2015-16	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21(till 31.08.2020)Subsidy Disbursed (? in crore)	200.00	170.00	782.99	528.00	583.52	16.94 </pre>*****
