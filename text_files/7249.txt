HARSH VARDHAN)(a) to (e):  A statement is laid on the Table of the HouseSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 90* FOR 22ND NOVEMBER, 2019(a)    No such advisory has been issued by World Health Organisation (WHO) to the Government of India and the same has been confirmed from WHO country office in India by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). (b)    No. The Nationwide Milk Safety and Quality Survey conducted by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) in 2018 revealed that only 7% (456 out of total 6,432 samples) had contaminants (antibiotics, pesticides and aflatoxin M1) that make milk unsafe for consumption. Further, only 12 out of a total of 6,432 samples had adulterants that affect the safety of milk. These 12 samples include 6 samples adulterated with hydrogen peroxide, 3 samples adulterated with detergents,                      2 samples adulterated with urea and one sample was found to have neutralizers. (c) & (d) No such Committee has been constituted by the Government.  (e): In order to ensure the availability of safe food products including milk to the consumers and for keeping a check on adulteration, Food Safety Commissioners of States/UTs have been advised from time to time to keep a strict vigil by intensifying surveillance during festive seasons when demand of milk and milk products  increase; by maintaining strict vigil on milk chilling units;  and by  regularly drawing food samples from all sources viz. manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers and to take strict action against the offenders under the provisions of FSS Act, 2006. They have also been advised to draw milk samples, both from processing plants as well as raw milk, from all major cities and towns with focus on the areas where non-compliance was observed during the survey. Regular surveillance, monitoring and inspection are being carried out by the Officials of Food Safety Departments of the respective States/UTs to check compliance of the provisions laid down under Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and the rules and regulations made thereunder. In cases where samples are found to be non-conforming to the prescribed norms and standards, penal action is initiated against the defaulting FBOs as per the provisions of the penal provisions under the Act.  *****
