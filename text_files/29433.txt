                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI  R.K. SINGH)(a) & (b) :	The coal stocks available with the linkage based 136 power plants monitored on a daily basis in Central Electricity Authority (CEA) were 28.9 MT (sufficient for 15 days) as on 31.03.2021, which got increased to 31.1 MT (sufficient for 17 days) as on 16th June, 2021. However, with increased demand, some interruption in supply of coal by coal companies mainly due to heavy rains and increase in the prices of the imported coal, the coal stocks at the power plants got depleted to 7.2 MT (sufficient for 4 days) as on 8th October, 2021. Subsequently, with the concerted efforts of Ministry of Power (MoP), Ministry of Coal (MoC), Ministry of Railways, CEA and Coal India Limited (CIL), the coal stocks have started increasing and have now reached 18.958 MT (sufficient for 9.5 days) as on 26th November, 2021. (c) :		Various steps that have been taken to alleviate the coal shortage and to meet the demand in the country are as follows:i.

Ministry of Power has also constituted a Core Management Team (CMT) with members from MoP, Railways, CEA, CIL, NTPC, DVC and POSOCO to ensure close monitoring of coal stocks at thermal power plants (TPPs) and operational decisions are being taken in CMT to augment supply of sufficient quantity of coal to the TPPs.iii.	Further, based on the decision of the Government, CIL has offered about 5.2 Million Tonnes additional coal from its various subsidiaries to State/Central Gencos for lifting through Rail Cum Road (RCR)/ Road mode.iv.
