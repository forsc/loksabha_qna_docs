ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (e): Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)-UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) scheme on 21-10-2016 to facilitate / stimulate regional air connectivity and making air travel affordable to the masses. Promoting affordability of regional air connectivity is envisioned under RCS by supporting airline operators through (i) concessions by Central Government, State Governments and airport operators to reduce the cost of airline operations on regional routes and (ii) financial support (Viability Gap Funding) to meet the gap,if any, between the cost of airline operations and expected revenues on regional routes. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit proposals at the time of bidding under RCS from time to time.;With repeal of the Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian airline industry was deregulated. Airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type, free to select whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate. Further, Government has laid down Route Dispersal Guidelines (RDGs) with a view to achieve better air transport services of different regions of the country. It is therefore, up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and commercial viability. As such, the airlines are free to operate anywhere in the country subject to compliance of RDGs issued by Government.;;Sixteen (16) number of unserved/underserved airports of Uttar Pradesh have been identified under RCS-UDAN version 1.0, 2.0 & 3.0 are as under :1. Agra2. Aligarh3. Prayagraj4. Azamgarh5. Bareilly6. Chitrakoot7. Faizabad8. Ghazipur9. Jhansi10. Kanpur (Chakeri)11. Kushinagar12. Meerut13. Moradabad14. Muirpur (Korba)15. Saharanpur16. Shravasti;RCS flights operation at Agra, Prayagraj & Kanpur (Chakeri) have commenced. MoU was signed for development of Agra, Prayagraj, Kanpur, Bareilly, Meerut, Moradabad, Faizabad & Kushinagar with State Government of Uttar Pradesh. Prayagraj airport has been completed and commissioned. Airports at Agra & Kanpur are being developed further. New Terminal Building at Gorakhpur Airport has been Inaugurated. New Civil Enclave at Hindon has been inaugurated.Bilaspur airport has been developed by State Government of Chhattisgarh and is ready for operationalization of flights under RCS-UDAN. No valid bid received so far. If any valid bid is received in future round of RCS-UDAN, same shall be considered as per scheme document.
