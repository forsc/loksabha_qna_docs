                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) to (e): Ministry of Education has taken several measures to minimise learning gaps due to pandemic in all parts of the country. A comprehensive initiative called PM eVIDYA has been taken which unifies all efforts related to digital/online/on-air education to enable multi-mode access to education. The initiative includes the following components: ?	DIKSHA the nation’s digital infrastructure for providing quality e-content for school education in states/UTs: and QR coded Energized Textbooks for all grades (one nation, one digital platform).?	One earmarked Swayam Prabha TV channel per class from 1 to 12 (one class, one channel). ? 	Extensive use of Radio, Community radio and CBSE Podcast- Shiksha Vani. ? 	Special e-content for visually and hearing impaired developed on Digitally Accessible Information System (DAISY) and in sign language on NIOS website/ YouTube .Further, an Alternate Academic Calendar has been prepared for providing learning solutions for grade 1 to 12 and ‘Students’ Learning Enhancement Guidelines prepared by NCERT suggest models for the following three types of scenarios to ensure that no child is deprived of reach of education:a)	Learning Enhancement during COVID-19 for students without digital devices;b)	Learning Enhancement during COVID-19 for students with limited accessibility to digital devices &c)	Learning Enhancement during COVID-19 for students with digital devices.Also, PRAGYATA guidelines were issued to States/UTs to facilitate continued education through various modes. The guidelines inter-alia includes situations where internet connectivity is not available or available with very less bandwidth where resources are shared through various platforms like television, radio etc. that do not depend on internet.Where the digital facility (mobile device/ DTH television) is not available, Ministry of Education has taken many initiatives like Community Radio Stations and a podcast called Shiksha Vani of CBSE, Textbooks, worksheet supplied to residence of learners, Handbook on 21st Century Skills and community/mohalla classes. Innovation Funds under Samagra Shiksha are used to set up mobile schools, virtual studios, virtual classrooms in schools, pre-loaded tablets etc., in various states and UTs in remote/rural areas where online classes are difficult. Further, in order to provide continuous professional development opportunities to the teachers at the elementary level, this Department launched the NISHTHA online training programme using DIKSHA platform in October 2020. NISHTHA online for elementary level covered 18 modules in 11 languages, including use of ICT in teaching-learning. A comprehensive learning recovery plan (LRP) has been issued on 01.02.2022 to support States/UTs under Samagra Shiksha to provide a multipronged & holistic approach to ensure that children received suitable support. Under this, support is provided to States/UTs for various interventions including Learning Enhancement Programme (LEP), Teacher Resource Package (TRP), Oral Reading Fluency Study (ORF), ICT facility to Block Resource Centers (BRCs), Strengthening of Clusters Resource Centers (CRCs), etc.Under the Bharat Net programme, the CSC e-Governance Services India Ltd. (CSC-SPV) of MeitY has been assigned the task of providing Fibre to the Home (FTTH) connectivity to the Government Institutions, including schools.Samagra Shiksha is an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education. Under the Information & Communication Technology (ICT) component of the Scheme, there is a provision to impart computer literacy and computer enabled learning to children, by developing and deploying curriculum based interactive multimedia, digital books, virtual labs etc. across the country. It supports establishment of smart classrooms, and ICT labs in schools, including support for hardware, educational software and e-content for teaching. It envisages covering all Government/Government-aided schools with classes VI to XII. Government accords high priority to promotion of smart classrooms in schools all over the country including Kendriya Vidyalayas and Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas. In the Kendriya Vidyalayas and Navodaya Vidyalayas, Smart class systems (e-classrooms) facilities have been set up in the form of desktop / Tablet based system, interactive board displays, etc.*****
