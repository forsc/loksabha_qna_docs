                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) The proposal of Mekedatu Balancing Reservoir cum Drinking Water Project submitted by Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Limited, Government of Karnataka to Ministry of Environment and Forests & Climate Change (MoEF&CC) was considered during 25th Meeting of the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) for River Valley and Hydroelectric Projects held on 19.07.2019. The EAC deferred the project inter-alia stating that there were representations received from the Tamil Nadu State Government requesting not to grant ToR (Terms of Reference) to the present proposal. The EAC opined that an amicable solution be arrived at between the two states and thereafter the matter may be put up for reconsideration for grant of ToR.As the inter-state issue is involved, Terms of Reference (ToR) has not been accorded yet to this proposal by MoEF&CC.(b) As per information made available by the Government of Karnataka vide its letter dated 30.11.2021 it is informed that State of Tamil Nadu has taken up execution of Cauvery-South Vellar-Vaigai-Gundar Link (CVG Link) Canal project to divert surplus water from Kattalai barrage (Mayanur barrage) across Cauvery river. However, the Government of Karnataka has also mentioned that Tamil Nadu did not disclose either the  construction  of  Mayanur  or  Kattalai  barrage in 2014 across Cauvery river or the undertaking of CVG Contd…P/2//2//link for execution for transfer of surplus water of Cauvery through the instant link. Further, Government of Karnataka has informed that Karnataka has not received so far any project reports from Tamil Nadu in this regard. The Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) was notified on 1 June, 2018, subsequent to the Supreme Court’s order in this regard to give effect to the decision of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal as modified by the Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its order dated the 16th February, 2018.    (c) The Government of Tamil Nadu vide letter dated 30.11.2021 has informed that the Kattalai barrage at Mayanur was constructed instead of the old structure and is a diversion structure with practically no storage, for improved regulation, involving no additional ayacut/utilization.The Feasibility Report (FR) of Mekedatu Balancing Reservoir cum Drinking Water Project was submitted to Central Water Commission (CWC) by Government of Karnataka for according "in-principle" clearance for preparation of Detailed Project Report (DPR) of the project. The Screening Committee of Central Water Commission in its meeting held on 24.10.2018 accorded “in-principle” clearance for preparation of DPR by project authority (Government of Karnataka) subject to certain conditions including that: “As the main objective of this scheme as stated in the FR is to implement the Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunal(CWDT) Award as modified by the Hon''ble Supreme Court, acceptance of Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) would be a pre-requisite for consideration of the DPR by the Advisory Committee of MoWR, RD & GR”. Subsequently, the DPR of Mekedatu Balancing Reservoir cum Drinking Water Project was submitted by Government of Karnataka to Central Water Commission (CWC) in January 2019 and copies of DPR were forwarded to Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA). Further, as per the DPR submitted in January 2019 to Central Water Commission (CWC), the project inter-alia envisages meeting drinking water requirement of Bengaluru Metropolitan Region to the extent of 4.75 TMC and its adjoining area, power generation of 400 MW and to regulate the required quantum of water to Tamil Nadu on a monthly basis (in a normal year) as per the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal award, as modified by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India vide its Judgment dated 16.02.2018.According to the decision of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal, as modified by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India on 16.02.2018, the allocation of Cauvery water to Karnataka is 284.75 TMC.Discussion on the DPR of the Mekedatu Balancing Reservoir cum Drinking Water Project project was included as an agenda item during various meetings of Cauvery Water Management Authority. However, discussion on this issue could not take place due to lack consensus among party States on this agenda item.*****
