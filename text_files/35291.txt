ANSWER




                                                                               THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE                 MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                          (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a) to (e): With the objective of managing rapid urbanization effectively and ensuring that cities achieve their full potential, Government of India initiated a comprehensive approach to urban development with a three-tiered structure of programs in the year 2015. Programs like the Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U & SBM-U 2.0), Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM), Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT & AMRUT 2.0), Smart Cities Mission (SCM), Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY) and Urban Transport have been launched. Government of India launched SCM on 25 June 2015.  100 cities (including 2 cities i.e., Karnal & Faridabad in Haryana) have been selected for development as Smart Cities.  As per SCM Guidelines, Central Government will provide financial support to the extent of       ? 48,000 crore over five years i.e., on an average ? 100 crore per city per year. The focus of SCM is on sustainable and inclusive development and the idea is to look at developing compact areas, creating replicable models which will act as lighthouses to other aspiring cities through work on four pillars of comprehensive development — institutional, physical, social, and economic infrastructure.SCM is based on a two-pronged strategy – Area Based Development (ABD) and Pan City Development. Strategic components of ABD are city improvement (retrofitting), city renewal (redevelopment) and city extension (Greenfield development). Pan-city initiatives include projects that deploy smart solutions on a city-wide scale. Smart Cities, including Karnal and Faridabad in Haryana, are adopting Digital Technologies, traditional, modern and ultra-modern strategies that are based on ‘Smart Cities principles’ in development of their Smart Cities Projects. As apprised by Karnal and Faridabad Smart Cities, in alignment with the above strategies, they have implemented projects including, inter alia, Integrated Command and Control Centres, Intelligent Traffic Management Systems, city surveillance, Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR), Red Light Violation Detection (RLVD), water logging management, environmental sensors, use of drone technology, smart roads, and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects.                                         *****
