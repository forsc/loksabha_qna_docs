(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	Paddy stubble burning is mainly practiced in Indo-Gangetic plains of the States of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to clear the fields for Rabi crop sowing. The farmers are resorting to paddy straw burning because of very short time window between the harvesting of paddy crop and the sowing of next crop.Contd…..2/-- 2 -To address air pollution and to subsidize machinery required for in-situ management of crop residue, a Central Sector Scheme on ‘Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi’ for the period from 2018-19 to 2019-20 is being implemented with the total outgo from the Central funds of Rs. 1151.80 crores.During the year 2018-19 and 2019-20, the funds as under have been released under the aforementioned scheme:State/Agency	Funds Released (Rs. in Crores)	2018-19	2019-20Punjab	269.38	273.80Haryana	137.84	192.06Uttar Pradesh	148.60	105.28NCT of Delhi	0	4.52ICAR and other Central Agencies	28.51	18.48Total	584.33594.14Out of these funds, the State Governments during 2018-19 have supplied more than 56290 machines to the individual farmers and Custom Hiring Centres on subsidy for in-situ management of crop residue. During 2019-20, more than 32808 machines have been supplied so far. The State Governments and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) have also undertaken Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities on a massive scale for creating awareness among farmers.(c) & (d):	The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare under the Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) is already extending financial support to the State Governments for providing subsidy (@ 40% of the cost of machine) for purchase of balers and rakes which are used for straw collection in the form of bales. The Government of Punjab has provided subsidy to Farmers / Farmer Groups for purchase of 188 Balers & 171 Rakes.  The Government of Haryana also provided subsidy on 84 Balers and Rakes.(e):	In compliance to the directions of Supreme Court vide order dated 06.11.2019, the Government of Punjab has brought out a scheme for providing compensation @ Rs. 100/- per quintal to those small and marginal farmers who are cultivating non-basmati paddy and are managing the paddy residue by in-situ method without burning. The Government of Haryana also brought out the scheme to provide Rs. 1000/- per acre operational charges for crop residue management for in-situ and ex-situ purposes. The Government of Haryana will also give Rs. 100 per quintal incentive to those farmers who have sold their paddy after 06.11.2019 and till 15.11.2019 and have not burnt the crop residue.(f):	The Government is promoting establishment of Custom Hiring Centres to provide machines and equipments to the small and marginal farmers on reasonable rent basis. A mobile app-based aggregator platform ‘CHC Farm Machinery’ which facilitates hiring and renting of farm machinery from and by the Custom Hiring Centres/owners of the farm machinery has also been launched in public domain which encompasses a fair and transparent rental process while focusing on quality, dependability and timely delivery of the services.********.
