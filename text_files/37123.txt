                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SUSHRI PRATIMA BHOUMIK)(a) to (c) Relief to the disabled is a State subject by virtue of Entry 9 of State List of the Constitution of India. Further, Education is in the concurrent list of the constitution and majority of the schools are under the domain of respective States/UTs. This Ministry has not done any assessment with respect to requirement of trained teachers for teaching children with disabilities. However, the Central Government has set-up the Rehabilitation Council of India (RCI) with a view to regulate education and training in the field of rehabilitation, including special education of persons with disabilities (PwDs). RCI has informed that 1,35,643 special educators serving in disability sector are registered, as on 24.03.2022, in the Central Rehabilitation Register maintained by it.(d) This Ministry has not issued any guidelines regarding teacher to student ratio for teaching children with disabilities. However, the Ministry implements Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS) to provide grant-in-aid to NGOs/voluntary organisations for running various projects including special schools, under which the ratio of teachers to beneficiary for different categories of persons with disabilities is as follows:1:8 for Intellectual Disability and children with speech and hearing disability;1:8 to 1:2 for severe cases of children with multiple disabilities; and1:15 to 1:8 for children with visual disability.(e) Rehabilitation Council of India has informed that at primary and middle level, the trained teachers for persons with disabilities are considered at par with other general teachers.(f) The Central Government enacted the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, which came into force on 19.04.2017. Section 17 of the said Act, inter-alia, mandates the appropriate Government and local authorities to train and employ teachers, including teachers with disability who are qualified in sign language and Braille and also teachers who are trained in teaching children with intellectual disability. It also mandates to train professionals and staff to support inclusive education at all levels of school education. The Department of School Education & Literacy, Ministry of Education has requested all States/UTs to avail the services of special trained teachers as itinerant teachers as per the Samagra Shiksha, within the school block (cluster schools) until sufficient number of special teachers becomes available for general schools and special schools to optimize the resource persons. The Department of School Education & Literacy has also informed that under their National Initiative for School Heads'' and Teachers'' Holistic Advancement (NISHTHA) training programme, 642180 general teachers were trained on inclusive education for children with special needs, whereas 662944 general teachers were trained under the said program during the year 2019-20.*****
