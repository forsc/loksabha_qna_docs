                                                        MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a) to (c):A statement is laid on the Table of the House.***STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (A) TO (C) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 487 FOR ANSWER ON 26.07.2019 REGARDING ‘SEA EROSION’ RAISED BY SHRI K. MURALEEDHARAN.(a) & (b) Yes Sir. The Government is committed in taking proactive steps in combating sea erosion and protection of India’s coastal areas and coastal communities. Some of the important actions are:•	Under the Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project (ICZMP) undertaken by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, the hazard line for the entire coast of the country has been delineated. The hazard line is indicative of the shoreline changes, including the sea level rise due to climate change and is a projection of impact due to sea level rise, and shoreline changes over a long period of time viz. over 100 years. This line is required to be used by the agencies concerned in the Coastal States as a tool for Disaster Management for the coastal environment, including planning of adaptive and mitigation measures. The hazard line is featured in the new Coastal Zone Management Plans of the coastal States / Union territories approved by the Ministry. The Coastal Zone Notification, 2019 issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change also prohibits ports and harbours in high eroding stretches of the coast. The coastal regulations however permit setting up of erosion control measures in the coast.•	In addition, under the ICZMP, shoreline management plans are being prepared for five coastal stretches viz. Gulf of Kachchh in Gujarat; Gopalpur to Chilka and Paradip to Dhamra coast in Odisha; and Digha to Sankarpur coast and Sagar Island in West Bengal.•	A national strategy for coastal protection along with guidelines for coastal protection measures have been framed for all Coastal States and Union Territories by the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change.(c)	There are in total 11 Groynes in the Gujarat coast, 45 in Kerala, 1 in Maharashtra, 16 in Andhra Pradesh, 89 in Tamil Nadu, and 45 in West Bengal.   ****
