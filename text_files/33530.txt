(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c): The State Government is primarily responsible for managing and undertaking necessary relief measures in the wake of natural calamities, including hailstorm. Government of India supplements the efforts of State Governments with financial assistance.  In the eventuality of notified calamities, State Governments are empowered to undertake necessary relief measures from State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), which is readily available with the State. For calamity of severe nature, additional financial assistance, over and above SDRF, is considered from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), in accordance with items and norms of assistance, upon receipt of Memorandum from the State Government. IMCT visits the State for assessment of the calamity situation and requirement of financial assistance from NDRF. Taking into account the recommendations of the IMCT and the recommendations of the Sub-Committee of National Executive Committee (SC-NEC) thereon, the Government of India approves assistance from NDRF.*****
