ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a):	Cotton is primarily an agricultural produce. Post harvesting of Cotton and having reached to the Ginning and Pressing factories, the processed Cotton becomes industrial raw material for the Textile Mills. Farmer sells seed cotton to Ginning & Pressing factories and his role ends there. Ginning & Pressing is a separate entity in textile value chain and is well established in the country. Textile value chain is divided into different segments i.e., Ginning & Pressing, Spinning, Fabric production (weaving/ knitting), chemical processing, garmenting. Value addition takes place in each stages of textile value chain. Each segment of textile value chain is well established in the country. However, some composite mills in the country have combined spinning, fabric production, chemical processing facilities but the bulk of industry is segmented.  (b) & (c): There is no such proposal.***
