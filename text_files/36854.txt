                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE(a) to (d): As per inputs received from Reserve Bank of India (RBI), State-/ Union Territories-wise data is not maintained by it. However, bank-wise details of operating profit and net profit/loss of Public Sector Banks (PSBs), for FY 2018-19 to FY 2020-21 and for the first nine-months of FY 2021-22 are at Annexure-I.As per RBI data, aggregate gross advances of PSBs increased from Rs. 18,19,074 crore as on 31.3.2008 to Rs. 52,15,920 crore as on 31.3.2014.  As per RBI inputs, aggressive lending practices during this period along with wilful default / loan frauds / corruption in some cases, economic slowdown etc. were observed to be primary reasons for the spurt in the stressed assets. Asset Quality Review (AQR) initiated in 2015 for clean and fully provisioned bank balance-sheets revealed high incidence of non-performing assets (NPAs). As a result of AQR and subsequent transparent recognition by banks, stressed accounts were reclassified as NPAs and expected losses on stressed loans, not provided for earlier under flexibility given to restructured loans, were provided for. Further, all such schemes for restructuring stressed loans were withdrawn in the financial year (FY) 2017-18. Primarily as a result of transparent recognition of stressed assets as NPAs, as per RBI data on global operations, gross NPAs of PSBs rose from Rs. 2,16,739 crore as on 31.3.2014 to Rs. 8,95,601 crore as on 31.3.2018, and as a result of Government’s strategy of recognition, resolution, recapitalisation and reforms, have since declined to Rs. 5,59,081 crore as on 31.12.2021.Throughout this period, PSBs continued to post aggregate operating profits of Rs. 1,37,151 crore, Rs. 1,58,994 crore, Rs. 1,55,603 crore, Rs. 1,49,819 crore, Rs. 1,74,640 crore, 1,97,376 crore, 1,47,686 crore, in the financial year 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20, 2020-21 and the first nine-months of 2021-22, respectively. However, primarily due to provisions on account of NPAs, some PSBs reported net losses. Further, PSBs have now returned to profitability, with all PSBs reporting net profit in the first nine-months of FY 2021-22.Bank-wise and state-wise details of frauds on the basis of occurrence are at Annexure-II and Annexure-III, respectively.Further, RBI has issued Master Directions for classification and reporting of frauds by commercial banks and select financial institutions (FIs), to direct the focus of banks on the aspects relating to prevention, early detection, prompt reporting to RBI and the investigating agencies, and timely initiation of the staff accountability proceedings. Also, RBI has provided an illustrative list of some early warning signals (EWS) to detect fraudulent activity in an account.In addition to this, several measures have also been taken to help deter fraudsters/defaulters include, inter-alia, the following—(1)	An online searchable database of frauds reported by banks, in the form of Central Fraud Registry, has been set up to enable timely identification, control and mitigation of fraud risk and carrying out due diligence during the credit sanction process.(2)	Governments framework for large value frauds in PSBs mandates:(i)	Examination be initiated for wilful default immediately upon reporting fraud to RBI;(ii)	Report on the borrower be sought from the Central Economic Intelligence Bureau in case an account turns NPA.(3)	Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, 2018 has been enacted to provide for attachment of property of a fugitive economic offender, confiscation of such offender’s property and disentitlement of the offender from defending any civil claim.(4)	PSBs have been advised to— (i)	obtain certified copy of the passport of the promoters/directors and other authorised signatories of companies availing loan facilities of more than Rs. 50 crore;(ii)	decide on publishing photographs of wilful defaulters, in terms of the instructions of RBI and as per their Board-approved policy; and (iii)	strictly ensure rotational transfer of officials/employees.(5)	Heads of PSBs have been empowered to issue requests for issue of Look-Out Circulars. *** Annexure-ILok Sabha unstarred question no. 4112, to be answered on 28th March 2022Bank-wise details of net profit/loss of Public Sector Banks (PSBs)Bank/Bank Group Name	Operating Profit (April to Date)	Net Profit/Loss (April to Date)	31.3.19	31.3.20	31.3.21	31.12.21	31.3.19	31.3.20	31.3.21	31.12.21Allahabad Bank	2,767	3,089	*	*	-8,334	-5,396	*	*Andhra Bank	5,039	5,185	*	*	-2,786	-1,250	*	*Bank of Baroda	13,487	19,691	20,630	16,754	434	546	829	5,494Bank of India	8,092	11,519	10,872	7,523	-5,547	-2,957	2,160	2,798Bank of Maharashtra	2,198	2,847	3,958	3,700	-4,784	389	550	796Canara Bank	10,591	9,517	20,009	16,887	347	-2,236	2,558	4,012Central Bank of India	3,126	4,344	4,630	3,826	-5,641	-1,121	-888	735Corporation Bank	3,894	3,802	*	*	-6,333	-2,392	*	*Dena Bank	198	*	*	*	-6,339	*	*	*Indian Bank	4,881	6,498	11,396	9,979	322	753	3,005	2,961Indian Overseas Bank	5,034	3,534	5,896	4,149	-3,766	-8,527	834	1,157Oriental Bank of Commerce	3,754	2,985	*	*	55	-2,252	*	*Punjab and Sind Bank	1,397	1,097	771	1,013	-543	-991	-2,733	693Punjab National Bank	12,995	14,739	22,980	15,497	-9,975	336	2,022	3,255Syndicate Bank	2,819	3,473	*	*	-2,588	-3,602	*	*UCO Bank	2,760	4,836	5,421	3,848	-4,321	-2,437	167	618Union Bank of India	7,521	9,181	19,259	16,353	-2,947	-2,898	2,906	3,793United Bank of India	1,412	171	*	*	-2,316	-6,395	*	*Vijaya Bank	2,419	*	*	*	-2,434	*	*	*State Bank of India	55,436	68,133	71,554	48,157	862	14,488	20,410	22,562*Since amalgamatedSource: Reserve Bank of India*** Annexure-IILok Sabha unstarred question no. 4112, to be answered on 28th March 2022Bank-wise details of frauds on the basis of occurrence during the period from FY 2018-19 to FY 2020-21Bank Name	Number of frauds based on date of occurrenceAllahabad Bank	83Andhra Bank	41Bank of Baroda	378Bank of India	274Bank of Maharashtra	435Canara Bank	259Central Bank of India	2,299Corporation Bank	136Dena Bank	3IDBI Bank Limited	747Indian Bank	517Indian Overseas Bank	552Oriental Bank of Commerce	349Punjab And Sind Bank	211Punjab National Bank	1,040State Bank of India	14,431Syndicate Bank	278UCO Bank	487Union Bank of India	1,184United Bank of India	117Vijaya Bank	2Source: Reserve Bank of India*** Annexure-IIILok Sabha unstarred question no. 4112, to be answered on 28th March 2022State-wise details of frauds on the basis of occurrence during the period from FY 2018-19 to FY 2020-21Name of the state	Number of FraudsAndaman & Nicobar Islands	32Andhra Pradesh	1995Arunachal Pradesh	108Assam	1258Bihar	2241Chandigarh	775Chhattisgarh	877Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu	151Goa	610Gujarat	9900Haryana	23208Himachal Pradesh	623Jammu & Kashmir	306Jharkhand	926Karnataka	11878Kerala	2539Ladakh	16Madhya Pradesh	2984Maharashtra	83032Manipur	50Meghalaya	65Mizoram	24Nagaland	76New Delhi	22343Odisha	1449Puducherry	106Punjab	3411Rajasthan	3962Sikkim	54Tamil Nadu	20328Telangana	6386Tripura	211Uttar Pradesh	14841Uttarakhand	670West Bengal	4580Source: Reserve Bank of India***
