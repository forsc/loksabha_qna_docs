ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a)	& (b) The literacy data in the country is collected through decennial census operation conducted by Registrar General of India. The last Census was held in 2011. As per Census 2011, the literacy rate in the country, in the age group of 7 and above, is 72.98 per cent. A statement indicating State/UT, rural/urban and gender-wise literacy population and literacy rates in the country, in the age group of 7 and above, as per Census 2011 is at Annexure-I. Various factors viz. poverty, gender and social inequities, etc. are impeding literacy in the country.(c) The National education Policy 2020 envisages that the school curricula and pedagogy will aim for holistic development of learners by equipping them with the key 21st century skills and reduction in curricular content to enhance essential learning and critical thinking. The policy emphasises integration between vocational and academic streams in all schools and higher education Institutions in a phased manner. As per the policy, vocational education will start in school from the 6th grade and will include internship.  (d) The Department has launched the Samagra Shiksha –an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education, including rural areas, supporting States & UTs in implementation of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE), 2009. Preference in the interventions is given to Educationally Backward Blocks (EBBs), LWE affected districts, Special Focus Districts (SFDs), Border areas and the Aspirational Districts. A statement indicating details of State/UT-wise central share released under Samagra Shiksha for the years 2018-19 to 2020-21 is at Annexure-II. *****
