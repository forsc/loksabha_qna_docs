ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	Yes, National Agricultural Research System under the aegis of Indian Council of Agricultural Research has developed more than 5700 varieties of different field and horticultural crops since 1969. During 2014 till January 2021, total 1575 varieties of 70 field crops have been developed which include 770 of cereals, 235 of oilseeds, 236 of pulses, 170 of fibre crops, 104 of forage crops, 52 of sugarcane and 8 of other crops. In addition, 288 varieties of horticultural crops have also been released and notified. These varieties are released at central and state levels after multilocation trials over years in different agroclimatic conditions of the country.	(c)	Total 262 abiotic stress tolerant varieties of different crops have been developed to check the problems emerging due to global environmental changes which include Flood/ Water submergence tolerant varieties (41), Drought/moisture stress/water stress tolerant varieties (158), Salinity/Alkalinity/ Sodic soils tolerant varieties (31), Heat stress/high temperature tolerant varieties (25) and Cold/Frost/ winter chilling tolerant field crop varieties (7) (Annexure I).(d)	In addition to development of climate resilient varieties, demonstrations of climate resilient technologies is being taken up in 151 climatically vulnerable districts and 446 villages. The efforts of National Innovations on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) led to making of 26 villages as residue burning free villages adjoining the NICRA villages, in the states of Punjab and Haryana. Village level institutional mechanisms such as Village Level Climate Risk Management Committees (VCRMC), custom hiring centres are created for managing infrastructure created and to improve the timeliness of operations during the limited window periods of moisture availability in rainfed areas and to promote small farm mechanization for adoption of climate resilient practices. In the last nine years, 16958 training programs were conducted throughout the country under NICRA project to educate stakeholders on various aspects of climate change and resilient technologies, covering 514816 different stakeholders including farmers so as to enable wider adoption of climate resilient technologies and increase in yields. As per latest Assessment Report 5 of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on risk assessment, 109 districts are considered to very high risk and 201 districts as high risk. Developed agricultural contingency plans for 650 districts to address extreme weather conditions besides issuing agro advisories twice in a week.	*******
