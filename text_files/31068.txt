ANSWER




                                                        a) and (b):  Government of India has taken strategic steps and initiatives to broaden and deepen the electronics manufacturing sector in the country and make India global electronics manufacturing hub. Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) notified Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC) scheme in October, 2012 to provide support for the creation of world-class infrastructure along with common facilities and amenities for attracting investments in the electronics sector. Under Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC) scheme, Nineteen (19) Greenfield Electronics Manufacturing Clusters and Three (3) Common Facility Centres (CFCs) accorded approval in Fifteen (15) states across the country.These projects include Two (2) Common Facility Centres (CFCs) in State of Maharashtra which are targeted to serve the requirement of Common Testing Facilities for electronics manufacturers in and around the Pune and Aurangabad region in the State. The details of these EMCs/CFCs are enclosed at Annexure-I.  Based on further requirement for strengthening of infrastructure for creation of robust electronics manufacturing ecosystem in the country, MeitY introduced Modified Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC 2.0) Scheme on 1st April, 2020. Its objective is to provide infrastructure support for attracting major electronics manufacturers along with their supply chain to set up their production facility in the country through such clusters. Under EMC/ EMC 2.0 scheme, no application for establishment of Electronics Manufacturing Cluster in the State of Maharashtra has been received so far. (c) and (d):  Maharashtra has emerged as one of the major preferred destinations for electronics manufacturing and has witnessed substantial growth in the electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM)  Sector. The State is sharing about 18% of total electronics manufacturing production in the country. 77 companies have established their operations in the State and taking benefits from Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS), Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) and Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme of Government of India. List of such companies approved under MSIPS, SPECS and PLI is enclosed at Annexure-II, III & IV. To boost the electronics manufacturing production and generate employment, the State has amended its Electronics Policy, 2016 to extend the benefits upto 2023 and has linked it with the new SPECS and PLI Schemes of the Govt. of India. ********Annexure-IS.No. 	State 	Location 	Area (Acres) 	Implementing Agency 	Financial Outlay (Rs. in crore)					Project Cost 	Grant-in-aid 1	Andhra Pradesh	Sri City,  Satyavedu Mandal, Chittor District	94	Sri City EMC Pvt..
