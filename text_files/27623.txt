ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (d): Department of School Education and Literacy (DoSEL), Ministry of Education is implementing the scheme of Samagra Shiksha under which, inter-alia, state specific projects under equity are emphasized for enhancing access, retention and quality for girls by promoting enrolment drives, retention and motivation camps, gender sensitization modules etc. Financial Support is provided under state specific projects as per the allocation of flexi fund under quality to the States and UTs. Subject to viable proposals received from the respective State and UTs, among others, Incinerators, Sanitary Pad Vending Machines, Life Skills and Awareness programmes etc., for varied interventions are approved under state specific projects for equity.State/UT-wise list of funds approved for Incinerator, Sanitary Pad Vending Machines and Sanitary Pad & Vending & Incinerator Machine under state specific projects for Equity is at Annexure-I and State/UT-wise list of funds approved for various programmes other than Incinerator and Sanitary Pad Vending Machine under State Specific Projects for Equity under Samagra Shiksha is at Annexure-II.All States and UTs have been requested to take necessary steps to create awareness amongst adolescent girls in schools about safe usage and benefits of Sanitary Napkins which would further help in increasing retention and reducing drop-out of adolescent girls in schools. Further, it is also communicated that subsidized sanitary napkins are available at the Jan Aushadi Kendras set up by the Ministry of Chemical and Fertilisers, Government of India and States are free to explore the possibility of convergence with Jan Aushadhi Kendras in the matter.As menstrual hygiene management is an integral part of the Swachh Bharat Mission Guidelines, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has issued Menstrual Hygiene Management Guideline to support all adolescent girls and women which outlines what needs to be done by School Head teachers, teachers and others.******
