However, due to their current poor financial condition, BSNL and MTNL have not been able to timely pay rent and electricity bills for the telephone exchanges/mobile towers.  As a result, the telephone services get affected sometimes to some extent.BSNL and MTNL have further informed that there is no pending complaint of Hon’ble Members of Parliament (MPs).(b)	The Government has approved the revival plan of BSNL and MTNL on 23.10.2019.  With implementation of these revival measures, the financial condition of BSNL and MTNL will improve and they are committed to provide better services to their subscribers including Hon’ble MPs. ************
