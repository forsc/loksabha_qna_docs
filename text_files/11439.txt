ANSWER




(a):Yes Sir. The proposal to establish NIPER in Madurai district of Tamil Nadu was approved in principle by the Government. Subsequently, in the Budget Speech 2015-16, it was announced to set up NIPERs in the states of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan & Maharashtra. (b) to (d): The State Government of Tamil Nadu has allotted 100 acres of land in Madurai District for setting up of NIPER. A consolidated proposal for setting up and equipping the six existing NIPERs and four newly proposed NIPERs at Madurai (Tamil Nadu) and in the states of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra was considered by the Expenditure Finance Committee (EFC) in the Ministry of Finance on 26.03.2018. While the Committee recommended continuation and strengthening of the six existing NIPERs during the period 2017-18 to 2019-20, but it deferred setting up of the proposed four new NIPERs at Madurai and in the States of Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra. The Committee further recommended that the matter may be reviewed in the year 2020 during the Fifteenth Finance Commission period (2020-25). The Department would accordingly approach the Ministry of Finance   seeking funds for setting up of deferred NIPERs, including that at Madurai, Tamil Nadu.*******
