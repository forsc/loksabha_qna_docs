ANSWER




                                                                              THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE                 MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                     (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a) 	Central Government Employees Welfare Housing Organisation (CGEWHO) has undertaken 37 housing projects since its inception, out of which 34 housing projects have been completed.(b) to (d) Complaints have been received from some allottees of  Chennai Phase-II project about damaged roofs and seepage. CGEWHO carries out repair work on such complaints subject to consent of owner of upper floor flat. Since the reported defects are repaired by CGEWHO, the question of compensation to the allotees does not arise.   (e) & (f) CGEWHO has not completed the final costing of Chennai Phase-II projects as some car parkings earmarked for Chennai Ph II beneficiaries are yet to be sold. Besides, Court cases have been filed in Principal District Munsif, Poonamallee, Chennai by Kendriya Vihar-II Apartment Owners’ Welfare Association. The final cost can be worked out only on settlement of the above issues.                                        *****
