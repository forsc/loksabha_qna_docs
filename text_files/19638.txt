ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b) Opening of new Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) is a continuous process. KVs are opened primarily to cater to the educational needs of the wards of transferable Central Government Employees including Defence & Para-Military personnel, Central Autonomous Bodies, Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and Central Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) by providing a common programme of education. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations and committing resources for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities for opening of new KVs have to compete with other proposals under the “Challenge Method”.  	Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) has informed that 5 KVs, namely, No.1 Chakeri Kanpur, No. 2 Chakeri Kanpur, No. 3 Chakeri Kanpur, IIT Kanpur & Mati Akbarpur are functioning in Akbarpur Parliamentary Constituency of Uttar Pradesh. (c)	KVS has informed that during last year and the current year total 10 requests have been received from the State Government of Uttar Pradesh/Members of Parliament for setting up of new KVs in the State of Uttar Pradesh. As explained in reply to part (a) above, proposals sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations and committing resources for setting up a new KV are only considered. Out of the 10 requests received, only one proposal for opening of a new KV at Bijnore was received from the State Government of Uttar Pradesh. Certain discrepancies / inadequacies were noticed in the proposal, which have been brought to the notice of district Administration Bijnore, Uttar Pradesh for necessary rectification.(d)	There are already 21 KVs functioning in the Bundelkhand Region.*****
