ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a): 	As per the National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP) of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the estimated number of deaths due to cancer reported during the last five years, State/UT wise is at Annexure. Separate estimates for men, women and children are not available from NCRP. (b):	 As per Globocan-2018, the estimated Age Adjusted mortality rate for India (61.4 per 100,000) is lower than many other countries. The highest Age Adjusted mortality rate is seen in Mangolia (170.2 per 100,000) and the Age Adjusted mortality rate in USA (developed country) is (91.0 per 100,000) in both sexes.(c):	 Public health and hospitals is a State subject. The Central Government however supplements the efforts of the State Governments by providing technical and financial support. National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) is being implemented under National Health Mission (NHM), with focus on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, health promotion & awareness generation, early diagnosis, management and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. For Cancer, the focus is on three cancers namely breast, cervical and oral. To tackle the challenge of Non Communicable Diseases (NCD), including cancer, 599 NCD Clinics at District level and 3,274 NCD Clinics at Community Health Centre level have been set up under the programme.  Population level initiative for prevention, control and screening for common NCDs (diabetes, hypertension and common cancers viz. oral, breast and cervical cancer) has also been rolled out under the National Health Mission (NHM) in over 215 districts. Screening of common NCDs including three common cancers i.e. oral, breast and cervical is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres. Several measures have been taken to discourage the use of tobacco products, which is one of the key risk factors of Cancer. Other initiatives like promoting healthy lifestyles through healthy eating and regular physical activity are also being undertaken.To enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer, the Central Government is implementing Strengthening of Tertiary Care for Cancer Scheme, under which setting up of 18 State Cancer Institutes and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres have been approved.  Further, Oncology is also one of the focus areas in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar in Haryana and second campus of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata are also steps in the same direction. Treatment of various cancers is also available under Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY).
