Distribution of the relief, as per Government of India’s approved items & norms of expenditure from SDRF, to the affected people on the ground, is the responsibility of the State Government concerned.(d) to (f):	National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (NCRMP), a World Bank assisted centrally sponsored scheme, is under implementation in the eight coastal States in two phases.

Seven Cyclone warning Centers and the Cyclone Warning Division, centrally located at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) Head Quarters, New Delhi, covers the east & west coasts. Multi-purpose cyclone shelters and early warning systems created under NCRMP have proved to be of great help during recent cyclones. The measures taken by the Central and State Governments have significantly improved the disaster management practices, preparedness, prevention and response mechanisms resulting in significant reduction in casualties during natural calamities, including cyclones, in the country. Further, strengthening of the disaster management is a continuing and evolving process of governance. *******
