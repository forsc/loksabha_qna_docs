ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)		Yes Sir, the management of plastic waste in the country has been increased exponentially in past few years. Therefore, the Government in suppression of the earlier Plastic Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2011 has notified the revised Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. (b)	The Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016 defines the norms for compostable plastic. The Rules prohibit the use of plastic bags with thickness less than 50 microns. However, the provision of thickness is not applicable to carry bags made up of compostable plastic. Further, the carry bags made from compostable plastics has to conform to the Indian Standard: IS 17088:2008 titled as Specifications for Compostable Plastics. (c)	The Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 has stipulated criteria and actions to be taken for solid waste management in hilly areas and prescribes avoiding the construction of landfills on the hills.  However, a suitable land should be identified in the plain areas below the hills,  within 25 kilometers, for setting up sanitary landfill. (d) and (e)	The indiscriminate use of plasticis causing several problems including littering, chocking of drains, marine pollution etc. Therefore, the Rules prescribes that the generators of waste have to take steps to minimize generation of plastic waste, not to litter the plastic waste, ensure segregated storage of waste at source and handover segregated waste to local bodies or agencies authorised by the local bodies. The rules also mandate the responsibilities of local bodies, gram panchayats, waste generators, retailers and street vendors to manage plastic waste. The rules mandate the producers, importers and brand owners to work out modalities for waste collection system based on the principle of Extended Producer Responsibility.*****
