ANSWER




(a)        Under PMKVY, there are various provisions for monitoring of TC as well as candidates. The life cycle of training process of candidates (enrolment – training – assessment – certification - placement) is tracked or monitored on real-time basis through the Skill India Portal (SIP) which is linked with Aadhaar enabled biometric attendance. TCs are being monitored effectively through various methodologies such as self-audit reporting, call validations, surprise visits, etc. Appraisal of the on-going schemes and consequent improvements is an ongoing process and PMKVY Monitoring Committee reviews and formulate framework on the critical cases related to monitoring issues of the stakeholders. Further, in order to improve the monitoring under PMKVY, District Skill Committee (DSC) is being involved and entrusted with the monitoring under PMKVY 3.0. DSC acts as an on-ground monitoring agency for conducting inspection of TCs. Under PMKVY, Short Term Training (STT) is linked to placement, while Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) does not mandate placements as it recognizes the existing skills of candidate. Under the STT-PMKVY, placement is linked with payout to training providers. The last tranche, i.e., 30 percent of total payout is disbursed to training providers only on ensuring placement of the candidates. Also, Rozgar Melas are organised with the support of Sector Skill Councils, training providers and implementing agencies to directly link the candidates with the potential employers. (b)        Yes, Sir. PMKVY 2.0 was evaluated by NITI Aayog in October 2020 under jobs and skills sector. The impact evaluation study draws inference of the scheme level contribution to the larger jobs and skills sector along with clear reflection of following strength and outcome achieved during implementation:•	The training provided under the scheme is relevant to the employers and they prefer candidates trained under PMKVY compared to untrained candidates.•	52 percent of the candidates who were placed in full time/part time employment and had completed training under the RPL component received higher salary or felt that they will get higher salary compared to their peers who have no certification.•	About 94 percent of the employers surveyed reported they would hire more candidates trained under the scheme.•	About 67 percent and 18 per cent of the employers surveyed reported that the overall experience with respect to the recruitment process was good and very good, respectively. Further, third-party impact evaluation of the scheme PMKVY 2.0 (2016-20) was conducted by Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA). The impact evaluation study draws following inference: •	The maximum percentage of beneficiaries (70.5 percent) received placement in their desired skill sector.•	To ensure that high standards of quality are maintained by PMKVY Training Centres, NSDC and empanelled inspection agencies use various yardsticks. These involve validations, surprise visits, and monitoring through the Skill India Portal (SIP) (erstwhile Skills Development Management System (SDMS)). These standards are intensified using the latest technologies.•	As an impact of the scheme, 118.2 percent change in monthly wages of beneficiary trainees has been recognized. Avg. monthly remuneration/wages of surveyed beneficiaries increases from ? 8,422.64 to ? 17,871.26 post completion of training under PMKVY 2016-20. (c)        Above reply (b) may be referred to.
