                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI) (a to d) Data on nutrition indicators is captured under the various surveys commissioned by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The prevalence of malnutrition among women as per NFHS-3 and 4 are at Annexure-I. The prevalence of underweight, wasting and stunting observed in children as reported under the last five surveys, State/UT-wise including Odisha, is at Annexure-II.      Prevalence and causes of malnutrition vary from place to place across rural and urban areas. During Covid-19, door-to-door delivery of THR to beneficiaries was undertaken by anganwadi workers.     Government has taken measures to strengthen nutritional content, delivery, outreach and outcomes with focus on developing practices that nurture health, wellness and immunity to disease and malnutrition. Steps have also been taken to improve nutritional quality and testing, strengthen delivery and leverage technology to improve governance. Government has advised States/UTs to ensure that the quality of supplementary nutrition conforms to prescribed standards laid down under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and regulations made thereunder. States/UTs have also been advised to promote use of AYUSH systems for prevention of malnutrition and related diseases. A programme to support development of Poshan Vatikas at Anganwadi centers to meet dietary diversity gap leveraging traditional knowledge in nutritional practices has also been taken up. (e & f)  States/UTs have also been advised to launch a drive for identification of SAM children for referral to hospitals (if required) and AYUSH Centers in accordance with the detailed action plan approved by the District Nutrition Committee.*******  Annexure-IStatement referred to in reply of Lok Sabha Un-Starred Question No. 2850 due for answer on 12.03.2021, raised by Shrimati Aparajita
