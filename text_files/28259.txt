Further, PSL guidelines also prescribe a target of 15% of ANBC or CEOBE for lending to Weaker Sections, which, inter-alia, includesSMFs and SCs/STs.The RRBs have surpassed the prescribed target of lending to the SMFs & Weaker Sections during the years 2018-2019 to 2020-21, with the details as below:  (Amount in ?

Besides, additional 3% incentive is given to the farmers for prompt repayment of the loan, thereby reducing the effective rate of interest to 4%. ?

A new scheme for KCC to Animal husbandry and Fisheries farmers has also been introduced through Banks, including RRBs, to meet their working capital requirement.  The benefits of KCC along with interest subvention have been extended to Animal Husbandry and Fisheries farmers.?	The requirement of ''no dues’ certificate has also been dispensed with in respect of small loans up to Rs.50,000 availed by small and marginal farmers, share-croppers and the like and, instead, only a self-declaration from the borrower is required.?

NABARD extends refinance at concessional rate of interest to RRBs for supplementing their resources for short-term and long-term lending. Refinance is expected to increase ground level credit and boost capital formation in agriculture.  ?
