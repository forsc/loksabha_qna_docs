RAMESH TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 27.11.2019 REGARDING DIVISIONAL RAILWAY MANAGERS(a)	Guidelines governing short-listing and posting of Divisional Railway Managers (DRMs) were notified vide Ministry of Railways’ communication No. E(O)III/2016/PL/02 dated 16.08.2016. A copy of the guidelines is appended.(b)	Exigencies, by their very nature, are unforeseen and cannot be anticipated. Therefore, it is not feasible to define the principles for exercise of discretion.  Moreover, exercise of such discretion is subject to approval of Minister of Railways. (c)&(d) Public interest, in the context of decision of Government, means the furtherance of welfare of general public and society at large, as against the interest of an individual.  The guidelines do not specifically include age relaxation.	 (e)	No relaxation has been granted under Clause 15 after the policy guidelines have been notified on 16.08.2016.  ***** APPENDIX REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. 125 BY SHRI T.R.V.S. RAMESH TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 27.11.2019 REGARDING DIVISIONAL RAILWAY MANAGERSNo: E(O)III-2016/PL/02 				New Delhi, dt. 16.08.2016GUIDELINES FOR SHORTLISTING AND POSTING OF DIVISIONAL RAILWAY MANAGERS (DRMs) IN THE INDIAN RAILWAYSIn supersession of the existing policy guidelines on the above subject, the following guidelines for short listing and posting of Divisional Railway Managers (DRMs), total 68 in number, in the Indian Railways have been approved by the competent authority.1.	Officers belonging to the following eight (08) Group ''A'' Railway Services will be considered for short listing for the posts of DRMs:-a) Indian Railway Service of Engineers (IRSE);b) Indian Railway Traffic Service (IRTS);c) Indian Railway Service of Mechanical Engineers (IRSME);d) Indian Railway Service of Electrical Engineers (IRSEE);e) Indian Railway Service of Signal Engineers (IRSSE);f) Indian Railway Accounts Service (IRAS);g) Indian Railway Stores Service (IRSS) ; &h) Indian Railway Personnel Service (IRPS).2.	The posts of Divisional Railway Managers (DRMs) are in Senior Administrative (SA) Grade (Pay Band-4, Rs. 37,600 - 67,000/- with Grade Pay of Rs. 10,000/-), as revised from time to time. Posting as DRM is not a promotion but a posting in the same grade, i.e., SA Grade, without conferring any additional pecuniary benefit. Officers are shortlisted for posting as DRMs, on recognition of the fact that the task is arduous in nature and that DRM is the overall in-charge of the Division dealing with all aspects of Railway operations. Upon completion of their term as DRMs, the Officers are brought back to the same SA Grade.3.	Railway Services which are directly involved in train operations will hold more slots of DRMs in relation to Services not directly involved in train operations. However, at one time the officers of one Service would occupy minimum two (02) posts and not more than fourteen (14) posts of DRMs. The existing 68 posts of DRMs shall be divided amongst the 08 Group'' A'' Railway Services as under.-Service 								No. of postsIndian Railway Service of Engineers (IRSE)				14Indian Railway Traffic Service (IRTS)					14Indian Railway Service of Mechanical Engineers (IRSME)	14Indian Railway Service of Electrical Engineers (IRSEE)		10Indian Railway Service of Signal Engineers (IRSSE)		06Indian Railway Accounts Service (IRAS)				04Indian Railway Stores Service (IRSS)					04Indian Railway Personnel Service (IRPS) 				023.1	Depending upon exigencies, some readjustment of posts amongst different services could be done by Chairman, Railway Board, with the approval of Hon''ble Minister of Railways.4.	Service-wise short listing shall be done in the order of seniority in the ratio of 1.5 times the number of vacancies occurring in the panel year for that particular Service. The short listing would be done by a Committee comprising of Chairman, Railway Board, Member, Railway Board of the Service for which short listing is being done, Member (Staff) and Secretary, Department of Personnel and Training. In case of IRPS for which Member (Staff) is the Board Member concerned, another Board Member shall be nominated by Chairman, Railway Board.5.	Officers being considered for short listing as DRMs should be less than 52 years of age as on 1st July of the year for which the short list is being made. A short listed officer can be posted as DRM within the period of currency of the short list, even if at the point of his actual posting as DRM, he has crossed the age of 52 years. Once short listed for a particular year, officers will be posted to vacancies earmarked for their Service arising in that year, strictly in the order of their seniority in their respective cadre.6.	Officers to be posted as DRMs should have been assessed at least as ''Very Good+'' in their ACRs/APARs. They should have been assessed as ''Outstanding'' at least twice during the preceding 05 (five) years and should have a minimum of 02 (two) clearances for posting as DRM, including one clearance in the latest ACR/APAR or should have a minimum of 03 (three) clearances including 1 (one) in the latest 02 (two) ACRs/APARs.7.	The Short Lists of DRMs will cater to the requirement of DRMs arising during the period of 1st of July of a particular year to 30th June of the following year, irrespective of the date of approval of the Short List. In other words, the currency/validity of a particular Short List will not begin from the date of its approval, but will be valid for the requirements from 1st of July to 30th of June. In case the requirements up to 30th June are not filled, such requirements will only be filled from the same Short List which has been made for such requirements, even after 30th June.8.	In order to meet any sudden/unforeseen requirement of DRM from any Service/s, which cannot be met from the existing Short List, the competent authority may decide to prepare a Supplementary Short List by following the same procedure.9.	If an officer is not short listed for the post of DRM in a particular panel year on account of his/her not coming within the zone of consideration or having below bench mark APAR grading, he/she shall be considered for short listing in the subsequent panel year(s), provided he/she continues to fulfill the prescribed eligibility criteria.10.	At the time of inclusion in the Short List as well as at the time of actual posting as DRM, officers should be clear from Vigilance angle. Since the post of DRMs are sensitive posts, officers who are not clear from Vigilance angle will not be considered for short-listing and posting as DRM.11.	Officers who refuse posting as DRMs will not be considered for DRM''s posting for a period of two years from the date of refusal.12.	Only such officers who fulfill all the above mentioned eligibility conditions as on 1st of July of the year in which the Short List is prepared shall be considered for posting as DRM. Once the Short List has been prepared and approved by the competent authority, no officer shall be considered for short listing/posting as DRM even if he happens to fulfill the eligibility conditions at a later point of time.13.	Restoration of seniority because of any reason shall not bestow a right to be shortlisted as DRM, if not meeting the criteria as on 1st July of the year for which Short List is prepared.14.	The normal tenure of DRMs will be around 2-3 years. There may be cases where an officer shortlisted for the post of DRM is due for promotion to HA Grade when his turn comes for posting as DRM. There may also be cases where an officer, after posting as DRM, becomes due for promotion to HA Grade in his cadre. In such cases, the following procedure will be applied:(a) No officer will be posted as DRM in HAG, nor the post of DRM will be operated in HAG.(b) After posting as DRM, if his/her turn comes for promotion to HAG, and the officer decides to return to his/her cadre for availing promotion to HAG without completing minimum 15 months'' tenure as DRM, his tenure as DRM will not qualify for consideration for the post of GM (OL).(c) In case he/she continues as DRM till completion of the minimum tenure, his/her seniority in HAG will remain unaffected.15.	Notwithstanding anything contained in these policy guidelines, the competent authority may make relaxation to one or more of the aforesaid conditions in a suitable case, keeping in view the administrative requirements and public interest after recording the reasons in writing.16.	For the purpose of interpretation/application of the above mentioned Guidelines, the decision of the Ministry of Railways shall be final.17.	These Guidelines will come into force from the panel year 2016-17.Sd/-( R.K.Verma )Secretary, Railway Board****
