ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (d) The Government has notified Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. For proper regulation and sound recycling of plastic waste, provisions have been made for registration of all plastic recyclers with respective State/UT Pollution Control Boards/Committees. Every Urban Local body has been made responsible for setting up of infrastructure for collection, segregation and processing, including recycling and disposal of plastic waste. Further, the rules mandate the producers, importers and brand owners to work out modalities for waste collection system based on the principle of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). The primary responsibility for collection of used multi-layered plastic sachets or pouches or packaging is fixed on the producers, importers and brand owners who introduce the products in the market.  They need to establish a system for collecting back the plastic waste generated due to their products. The producers, importers and brand owners have now initiated steps to set up material recovery facilities by their own or through the Producers Responsibility Organizations (PRO)for collection of plastic waste including PVC and are tying up with the registered recyclers for the recycling of plastic waste. This EPR mechanism has created additional source of income for recyclers.*****
