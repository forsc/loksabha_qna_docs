The following action has also been taken by Government to enhance the production of the coal in the country which is given below:i.Launch of Commercial Auction: Auction of commercial mining on revenue sharing mechanism from 5 coal bearing states (Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha and Chhattisgarh) was launched on 18.06.2020. During this round of auction, 20 coal mines with aggregate peak capacity of 59 MTPA were successfully auctioned.   Second Tranche of auction for commercial mining was launched by Ministry of Coal on 25.03.2021. In the second Tranche, a total of 67coal mines/blocks were offered.  Further to cater to the demand of the coking coal consumers, 6 coking coal mines have been put on offer. The cumulative PRC for the fully explored mines on offer has been estimated at 150 MTPA.ii.Concept of Rolling Auction: In order to expedite the process for conducting auction and to carry out more rounds of auction in a year, a mechanism of rolling auctions of coal mines has been planned.  Under this mechanism, upon completion of the electronic auction process of a tranche (i.e. approximately 3-4 months from the launch of auction process), the next tranche of auction would be launched for following mines:a. Mines where no bid or only single bid was received in the previous tranche of auction (except for those mines where Ministry of Coal decides to go for second attempt of auction)b. New mines, if any, identified by Ministry of Coaliii.Engagement of PMU: Project Management Unit (PMU) has been engaged by Ministry of Coal for handholding of coal block allottees for obtaining various approvals /clearances for early operationalisation of coal mines allocated under CMSP Act, 2015.-3-iv.Launch of Single Window Clearance: The Union government has launched Single Window Clearance portal for the coal sector to speed up the operationalisation of coal mines. It is an unified platform that facilitates grant of clearances and approvals required for starting a coal mine in India. v. The MMDR Act has been amended in March, 2021 which, inter alia, allows all captive mines to sell up to 50% of the minerals produced during the year after meeting the requirement of attached plant.vi.  Coal India Ltd. has envisaged a coal production programme of one Billion Tonne from CIL mines by the year 2023-24. This will help in reducing imports and will also protect the capital of the country. CIL has taken the following steps to achieve the target of augmentation of coal production capacity:1.	Implementing on-going projects in time bound manner to achieve targeted production as per schedule.2.	Introduction of Surface Miners in Open Cast (OC) mines to improve operational efficiency and cater to environmental needs.3.	Introduction of Mass Production Technology in underground coal mines.4.	15 Projects identified with a Capacity of about 160 MTPA (Million Tonnes per Annum) to be operated by Mine Developer cum Operator mode.5.	Capacity addition through special dispensation in Environment Clearance under clause 7(ii) of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 20066.	CIL has taken steps to upgrade the mechanized coal transportation and loading system under ''First Mile Connectivity'' projects..***ANNEXURE-IPIT HEAD ROM PRICE OF NON-COKING COAL APPLICABLE FOR EASTERN COALFIELDS LIMITED, BHARAT COKING COAL LIMITED, CENTRAL COALFIELDS LIMITED, NORTHERN COALFIELDS LIMITED, MAHANADI COALFIELDS LIMITED, SOUTH EASTERN COALFIELDS LIMITED AND NORTH EASTERN COALFIELDS.Grade 	GCV	Run of mine price for Non-Coking coal		Power Utilities (including IPPs), Fertilizer &Defence sector	Sectors other than Power Utilities (including IPPs) Fertilizer &Defence	(kcal/kg)	(Rs./Te)	(Rs./Te)G1 	Exceeding 7000	*	*G2	Exceeding 6700 and not exceeding 7000	3288	3288G3	Exceeding 6400 and not exceeding 6700	3144	3144G4	Exceeding 6100 and not exceeding 6400	3000	3000G5	Exceeding 5800 and not exceeding 6100	2737	2737G6	Exceeding 5500 and not exceeding 5800	2317	2524G7	Exceeding 5200 and not exceeding 5500	1926	2311G8	Exceeding 4900 and not exceeding 5200	1465	1757G9	Exceeding 4600 and not exceeding 4900	1140	1368G10	Exceeding 4300 and not exceeding 4600	1024	1228G11	Exceeding 4000 and not exceeding 4300	955	1145G12	Exceeding 3700 and not exceeding 4000	886	1063G13	Exceeding 3400 and not exceeding 3700	817	980G14	Exceeding 3100 and not exceeding 3400	748	897G15	Exceeding 2800 and not exceeding 3100	590	708G16	Exceeding 2500 and not exceeding 2800	504	604G17	Exceeding 2200 and not exceeding 2500	447	536*    For GCV exceeding 7000 Kcal/Kg, the price shall be increased by Rs. 100/- per tonne over and above the price applicable for GCV band exceeding 6700 but not exceeding 7000 Kcal/Kg, for increase in GCV by every 100 Kcal/Kg or part thereof.An additional amount of Rs. 450 per tonne (as per existing practice) to be charged over and above the notified price in respect of the coal produced from Rajmahal mine of Eastern Coalfields Limited.
