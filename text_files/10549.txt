ANSWER




MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a)	& (b): There are 32 State Waqf Boards (SWBs) functioning in India in different States. As per provisions of Section 32 of the Waqf Act 1995 as amended, general superintendence of all waqf properties in a State is vested with the SWBs and the Waqf Board is empowered to manage these waqf properties. Hence, the details of waqf properties are not maintained by Central Government. However, as per the information available on  dedicated online portal called WAMSI (Waqf Assets Management System of India), so far 6,00,723 immovable waqf properties have been registered on the portal. The number of SWBs and the SWB wise details of waqf properties is given at Annexure-I.(c)	& (d): As per information received from Central Waqf Council (CWC), the annual income from statutory contribution collected by SWBs under section 72 of the Waqf Act, 1995 as amended during the last five years is given at Annexure-II. Further, the Ministry does not maintain the information of the schemes implemented through Waqf Board for welfare of the Muslim community. However, this Ministry is implementing two schemes namely i) Qaumi Waqf Board Taraqqiati Scheme (QWBTS) and ii) Shahari Waqf Sampatti Vikas Yojana (SWSVY) through CWC. Under the scheme, financial assistance is released to CWC who provide the same to SWBs for deployment of manpower, computerization & digitization of records of waqf properties, GIS Mapping on waqf properties, and for disbursement of interest free loan to Waqf Institutions/Waqf Boards for taking up economically viable buildings on the urban waqf land such as commercial complexes, marriage halls, hospitals, cold storages etc.*******
