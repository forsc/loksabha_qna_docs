ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) to (c): The objectives of the Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) are mainly to provide good quality modern education including a strong component of culture, inculcation of values, awareness of the environment, adventure activities and physical education to the talented children predominantly from the rural areas without regard to their family''s socio-economic condition. These objectives have by and large been achieved as is evident from the demand for admission and academic performance of the students of the JNVs in 2021.As on date, there are 650 functional JNVs in the country. State/UT/ District-wise details including Chhattisgarh are annexed.(d) & (e): The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country. All the districts of the States/UTs (as on 31st May, 2014) which have accepted the scheme have been covered, including Mungeli in theState of Chhattisgarh. Opening of new JNVs is a continuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government/UT administration to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of the permanent building and making available required temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV depends on the availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority.*****
