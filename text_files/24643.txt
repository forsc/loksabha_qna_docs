ANSWER




                                                                     THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS				(SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)	(a) to (c): Land and Colonization are State subjects. This Ministry through various programmatic interventions supplements the efforts of State/Union Territory (UT) Governments for providing houses to eligible urban beneficiaries of the country. Under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana–Urban [PMAY-U], identification of eligible beneficiaries and implementation of projects are done by the State/UT Governments concerned through their implementing agencies (Municipalities/ Urban Local Bodies, etc.). Any public grievance/ representation/ complaint received in the Ministry regarding selection of beneficiaries or irregularities under the scheme is, therefore, forwarded to State/UT Governments concerned for necessary investigation/ action. Further, as informed by Ministry of Rural Development, implementing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G), a VIP reference regarding allocation of houses to ineligible beneficiaries in the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) and outside GTA regions in Darjeeling Lok Sabha Constituency of West Bengal, was received and got enquired through an institutional National Level Monitor (NLM). As per the report furnished by the NLM, no irregularity in allocation of houses under PMAY-G in these regions was observed during their inspection.                    *****
