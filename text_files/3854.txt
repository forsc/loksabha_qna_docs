ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (FINANCE)(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a)  to (d): The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a directive vide circular DPSS.CO.OD.No 2785 / 06.08.005/2017-18, dated April 06, 2018 on ‘Storage of Payment System Data’,  advising all system providers to ensure that the entire data relating to payment systems operated by them is stored in a system only in India, within a period of six months. It further provided that for the foreign leg of the transaction, if any, the data can also be stored in the foreign country, if required.   RBI, vide FAQs issued on June 26, 2019 have clarified that for cross border transaction data, consisting of a foreign component and a domestic component, a copy of the domestic component may also be stored abroad, if required.  In case the processing is done abroad, the data should be deleted from systems abroad and brought back to India not later than 24 hours from payment processing or 1 business day, whichever is earlier. However, there is no change in the data localization norms issued by RBI on April 06, 2018 on ‘Storage of Payment System Data’.The directions are applicable to all authorised / approved payment system providers, banks operating in India and also in respect of transactions through system participants, service providers, intermediaries, payment gateways, third party vendors and other entities in the payments ecosystem, who are retained or engaged by the authorised / approved entities for providing payment services. The responsibility to ensure compliance with the provisions of these directions would be on the authorised / approved PSOs.
