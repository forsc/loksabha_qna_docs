ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) & (d):	    Section 451 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) provides for custody and disposal of property pending enquiry or trial. In cases where the property is subject to speedy and natural decay, the Court may, after recording such evidence as it thinks necessary, order it to be sold or otherwise disposed of. Further section 459 of CrPC provides for power  to  Magistrate  to  order  sale of perishable property, if the person --2--L.S.US.Q.NO. 2493 FOR 09.07.2019entitled to the possession of such property is unknown or absent and the property is subject to speedy and natural decay, or if the Magistrate to whom its seizure is reported is of opinion that its sale would be for the benefit of the owner, or that the value of such property is less than five hundred rupees. While ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State Subjects, ‘Criminal Laws and Criminal Procedure’ are in the Concurrent list under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. State Governments are primarily responsible for implementation of Criminal laws and are also competent to make amendments in the CrPC, as per their needs. *****
