ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): Expansion/Upgradation of airport is a continuous process and is undertaken by Airports Authority of India (AAI) from time to time depending on the availability of land, commercial viability, socio-economic considerations, traffic demand / willingness of airlines to operate to/from such airports. AAI has undertaken construction of new International terminal building at Agartala airport at a cost of Rs. 438.28 Crore. Further, on the request of State Government of Tripura, AAI has prepared a plan for the extension of runway at Agartala Airport to make it suitable for code ''D'' type of aircraft. As per the plan prepared by AAI, a right of way on 52 acres of land is required in Bangladesh Territory, as the land immediately after the airport boundary falls within Bangladesh. However, no formal request in this regard has been made to Government of Bangladesh so far.;(c): Does not arise in view of the above.
