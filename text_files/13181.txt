Tobacco Board is also extending support to FCV tobacco farmers under various extension and developmental schemes implemented by it to improve yield and quality of FCV tobacco. Tobacco Board also conducts e-auctions for sale of FCV tobacco on the designated auction platforms of Tobacco Board.Contd…2/--2-(b)  & (c):	The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) is implementing Crop Diversification Programme (CDP), an ongoing sub-scheme of Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) to encourage tobacco growing farmers to shift to alternative crops/cropping system w.e.f. 2015-16. Tobacco growing states namely Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal implemented the programme. However, Department of Agriculture, State Government of Maharashtra has not implemented the scheme due to negligible area under tobacco in the state. An amount of Rs. 667.00 lakh as Central Share has been allocated to implementing states during 2019-20 for implementation of the programme on 60:40 sharing basis between Government of India and State Governments.As a policy, Tobacco Board under Ministry of Commerce and Industry is not granting registration to new growers and not issuing any licenses for construction of new barns creating additional curing infrastructure and not expanding FCV tobacco cultivation to new areas and thereby restricting horizontal expansion of tobacco.(d):	  The tobacco area in the country has reduced from 4.67 lakh hectares (during 2014-15) to 3.96 lakh hectares (during 2017-18).

For motivating the farmers, states may also organize study tours / exposure visits and campaigns etc. for highlighting harmful effects of tobacco and long term benefits of alternative crops. Government of India also provide flexibility to the states for state specific needs/priorities under RKVY. (f):	DAC&FW is not implementing any scheme for promotion of tobacco cultivation.
