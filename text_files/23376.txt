ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????      (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):     The Government announces Minimum Support Price (MSP) for 22 mandated crops, including maize, on the basis of recommendations of Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP) after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned and other relevant factors. Government has fixed MSP of maize at Rs. 1850/- per quintal for 2020-21 season.            Cost of production is one of the important factors in the determination of MSPs. While recommending its price policy, the CACP considers all costs in a comprehensive manner. The estimates of cost of cultivation/cost of production are made available to CACP through the Central Sector Scheme “Comprehensive Scheme for Studying the Cost of Cultivation of Principal Crops”. The data on cost of cultivation are collected with the help of State Agricultural Universities/Institutions located in various States. (c) to (e):    As per the extant guidelines for allocation, distribution and disposal of coarse grains procured by state agencies/ Food Corporation of India (FCI), the State Governments are allowed to procure coarse grains including maize from the farmers at MSP under the central pool with the prior approval of Government of India on the detailed procurement plan prepared by the State Governments in consultation with FCI. The whole quantity is distributed under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) and Other Welfare Schemes (OWS) in the State/UT. For Bihar, no valid procurement plan has been received in the last three years for procurement of coarse grain. Procurement of Maize by State Agencies/FCI since 2017-18 is given below:                                                                               (As on 08.03.2021)Year	Procurement (in MT)2017-18	477942018-19	121032019-20 	1151382020-21	198829                                                          **********
