ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) & (b): During cotton season 2014-15, some irregularities took place in Cotton purchase in the state of Andhra Pradesh. Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) Limited undertook massive procurement operation under Minimum Support Price (MSP) and procured 86.97 lakh bales, out of which about 63% (i.e.54.47 lakh bales) were procured in the State of Andhra Pradesh & Telengana. Since, the procurement operation was the biggest ever in the State of Andhra Pradesh & Telengana, some lapses in identification of cotton farmers were noticed. (c):  	To overcome such type of situation, Government of India had requested all major cotton producing states to devise procedure so that the officials from State Agriculture Department, District Collectors and Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) official may ensure that only bonafide cotton farmers sell their produce to Nodal Agencies without any involvement of Commission Agents or middlemen or traders so as to ensure that the benefit of  MSP is received by cotton farmers only and not by anyone else. Thereafter, digital identification of farmers by State Government has been introduced in the State of Andhra Pradesh. Since then, there has been no complaint. ***
