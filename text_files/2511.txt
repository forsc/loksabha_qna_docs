ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OFSTATEFOR FINANCEAND CORPORATE AFFAIRS				                (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)????? ??? ????????? ????????????? ??? ????? ?????? 				       (???? ?????? ???? ?????)(a): Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has indicated that as per Memorandum of Settlement (Assam Accord), “Central Government will render full assistance to the State Government in their efforts to reopen Ashok Paper Mill”.(b) State Government of Assam has taken following measures to revive the Ashok Paper Mill (Assam) Limited (APM), Jogighopa:I. The APM was leased out to M/s Sanghi Textile Ltd. (STL), Hyderabad for a period of 25 years w.e.f 01.04.1995 with the financial support of Rs. 8.97 crore but the STL failed to continue production activities due to lack of expertise management in running paper mill and other reasons and abandoned the mill on 07.04.1999. APM was leased out to M/s North East Paper & Industries Ltd. (NEPIL) w.e.f. 02.08.2000 with a financial support of Rs. 2.97 crore. The NEIPL also failed to show the desired results....2/--2-II. After failure of two attempts made for revival of the Mill through private parties, State Government of Assam proposed to revive the Mill through M/s Hindustan Paper Corporation Ltd. (HPC), a Government of India undertaking. After detailed discussions during several meetings, it was decided that the feasibility of developing viable alternative industries at the site of APM utilizing other locally available raw materials such as coconut or jute will be explored. Further, a Detail Project Report (DPR) for “APM Integrated Economic Zone and Cluster Package” was prepared and floated in local and national English dailies in 2018. But, no response was received from any party. However, discussions are still going on with few investors who have shown interest in the paper mill.III. Meanwhile, the Central Government released an amount of Rs. 44.45 crore to the Ashok Paper Mill, Assam on 10.02.2016 as One Time Settlement and clearing other loan liabilities in pursuance of Hon’ble Gauhati High Court Order dated 27.11.2014.IV. As Jogighopa is strategically located and the land of APM has not been used since last almost 40 years, State Government of Assam also proposed to develop a Multi Model Logistic Park/Hub (MMLP) at APM in 2018 and approved to provide 200acre of land out of APM’s total 2200 Bigha land for the project. However, in view of the Assam Accord clause, Paper Mill land area of approx. 60 Bigha land is not included in the 200 acre of land proposed for MMLP. This will not only create ample employment opportunities in the lower Assam but will change the entire economy in the State.*********
