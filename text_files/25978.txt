ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS (SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) & (b)     The Scheme was to provide the Cashless Insurance and support for ambulances and cranes. After the passage of Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, the Cashless Insurance has become a mandatory provision under the law. The scheme related to National Highway Accident Relief Service Scheme (NHARSS) has been discontinued beyond 31st March, 2017.   (c)  & (d)    As of now no such proposal is under consideration with the Ministry. Nonetheless, as a part   of incident management under operation and maintenance of the NH stretches, assistance   in case of emergency/accident on National Highways is extended through ambulances   so that victim can be transported to the nearest appropriate hospital/medical   facility run by State Govt./Private Entities.  NHAI has recently   signed contract agreements for supply, operation and maintenance of 126   AIS-125 compliant Basic Life Support ambulances across NHs in the country.*****
