ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c):    No letters to the effect that some private hospitals empanelled under CGHS may stop providing cashless treatment facility have been received so far. However, there are reports in the media in this regard.  Private empanelled hospitals provide cashless services to pensioners as well as to serving employees in case of emergency. Claims of cashless services are settled by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare under the Pensions and Other Retirement Benefits (PORB) Budget Head. At times, payments to the hospitals get delayed on account of fund availability under the said Budget Head. In such situations, immediate steps are taken to allot more funds under the Head so as to ensure expeditious clearance of hospital bills. At the central level, rigorous monitoring is also done for clearance of hospital bills.(d):     No such complaints have been received in the Ministry. Suitable action is, however, taken against hospitals empanelled under CGHS in case of violations of terms and conditions of empanelment.………………
