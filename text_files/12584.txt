ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b): The district-wise active job card holders and the job card holders who were engaged 100 days per annum in the financial years 2017-18 and 2018-19 under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS), 2005 in Assam are at Annexure - I. Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is a demand driven wage employment programme. It provides livelihood security i.e., fall back option for livelihood for the rural households when no better employment opportunity is available. The demand for work is influenced by various factors such as rain-fall, availability of alternative and remunerative employment opportunities outside Mahatma Gandhi NREGS etc.(c): Fund release to the States/UTs is a continuous and dynamic process and Central Government is committed to making funds available keeping in view the demand for work. The Ministry releases funds to States/UTs periodically in two tranches with each tranche consisting of one or more instalments based on agreed to Labour Budget (Persondays), opening balance, pace of utilization of funds, pending liabilities of the previous year, if any, overall performance and submission of requisite documents. The Ministry has issued Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) on timely payment process for direct payment into the account of beneficiaries. States/ UTs have been advised to generate pay orders in time. This has resulted in considerable improvement in the status of timely generation of pay order leading to improvement in actual time taken to credit wages in the workers account. During the current Financial Year 2019-20 (as on 07.02.2020), around 96.5% pay orders have been generated within 15 days from the date of closure of the Muster Roll in Assam. (d) & (e): Yes, Sir. The details of assets created and geo-tagging of assets under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS in Assam, as on 6th February 2020 are at Annexure – II.
