ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TOURISM (INDEPENDENT CHARGE)(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a):	RBI has given 3 months moratorium on both principal and interest payments of term loans till 31st May 2020 and extended it till 31st August 2020. Extension of moratorium beyond August 2020 is one of the requests of the prominent stakeholders and Ministry of Tourism has taken up the same with the concerned Ministries/Departments at the highest level.  The Ministry is also pursuing issues like relief from regulatory compliances, penal provisions for delays in dues, excise fees, electricity duty and property tax with State Governments and Union Territory Administrations. (b):	Stamp duty is a State subject. The imposition/exemption of it is decided by the State/UT Government as per the priorities of an industry/sector in its economy. However, the Ministry of Tourism recognizes the need to develop the capacity of India’s MICE industry to meet its future infrastructure needs. To enable India to pitch for larger MICE events, the Ministry has extended benefits like financial assistance under Market Development Assistance (MDA) to the industry stakeholders, establishment of India Convention Promotion Bureau (ICPB), introduction of E-Conference visa for foreign visitors, regular promotional media campaign in Domestic as well as international markets, financial assistance under Market Development Assistance to the active members of India Conventions Promotion Bureau (ICPB) in bidding the international conferences etc.(c):	Reviving domestic tourism is the topmost priority of the Ministry of Tourism. Dekho Apna Desh Campaign is undertaken through Webinars, social media and other digital platforms. The main focus is to rebuild the trust of the domestic & international travellers in terms of India being the safe destination to travel in post-Covid scenario.The Ministry in consultation with State governments and Stakeholders is working on creating content of destinations, including weekend, rural and heritage tourism destinations, as short inter-state and intra-state itineraries to be promoted through the Incredible India website and other Social Media platforms to create demand for domestic tourism. ********
