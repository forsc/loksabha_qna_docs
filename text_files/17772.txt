                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) & (b) The Government of Jammu and Kashmir has reported that in view of the constitutional changes effected by the Parliament with regard to the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir in August, 2019, various measures were taken to maintain public order which included preventive detention of certain persons. As on 11.09.2020, 223 persons are under detention.(c) & (d)   The telecom/internet services  are regulated under the  Indian Telegraph -2/…-2-LS.US.Q.NO.1405 FOR 20.09.2020Act, 1885 and the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017. The restrictions are imposed in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State and for maintaining public order, as provided under section 5 (2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.The internet services are already available in Kashmir on fixed line (without any speed related restrictions) as well as Mobile Data services (at 2G speed) since 24.01.2020. Restrictions on accessing Social media sites were also lifted on 04.03.2020. Further, from 16.08.2020, high speed mobile data services too have been commenced in the districts of Ganderbal and Udhampur.The regulation of internet has been undertaken, for limited duration, with orders being issued from time to time, after due assessment, in accordance with the law and with strict adherence to the principles laid down and directions contained in the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. (e) & (f)  The businesses have had access to internet through fixed line connectivity without any speed restrictions. Prior to that, internet kiosks were opened in large numbers across the Valley. However, due to the pandemic, economic activities have been impacted to some extent.The 2G mobile internet speed is not an impediment in covid control measures including dissemination of information to the general public as well as health workers.   Also,   e-learning   apps   and    education /e-learning   websites  of   the -3/…-3-LS.US.Q.NO.1405 FOR 20.09.2020Government are accessible over 2G internet for downloading e-books and other study material. The restriction on high speed mobile internet services has not been an impediment in the administration of justice; the Courts have taken special measures to conduct their proceedings during the pandemic by providing video links/URLs to the lawyers and the litigants.*****
