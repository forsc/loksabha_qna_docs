ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) & (b): 	No, Sir. However, an Empowered Body has been set up to monitor and review the progress of the recommendations of the Doubling of Farmers Income (DFI) Report which reviews the progress in this regard periodically. (c):	The income of agricultural households in the country is estimated by National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) through the ‘Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Households’ conducted from time to time. As per the results of latest such Survey conducted in 2013, all India average monthly income per agricultural household from various sources is estimated to be Rs. 6426. Since the last survey on income of agricultural households was conducted in 2013, the extent of increase in income during the last three years is not known.Contd…2/--2-(d):	The Government is providing employment under various welfare schemes/programmes being implemented by the Government which, among others, aim to benefit landless farmers. These include D/o Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, Rastriya Krishi Vikash Yojana, National Food Security Mission, Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture, Sub-Mission on Agriculture Extension and other Ministries’ schemes such as under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), Atal Pension Yojana (APY), etc. (e):	The number of Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) that have been created are given in the annexures. Since the FPOs promoted last year are in formative stages, it is too early to assess their impact in an increase in income for the involved farmers.
