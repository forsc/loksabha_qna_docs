                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR.BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) & (b): Yes Sir, World Blood Donor Day (WBDD) was observed on 14th June, 2021. The theme of World Blood Donor Day 2021 was “Give Blood and keep the world beating” Directorate General of Health Services issued communications including a guidance note to all State Blood Transfusion Councils (SBTCs) for observance of WBDD 2021 through conduction of blood donation camps and awareness generation activities for promoting the cause of Voluntary Blood Donation (VBD) through a multi-media approach and in partnership with all stakeholders; while maintaining compliance to the social distancing and other norms as per the COVID-19 advisories issued from time to time (Annexure-I). Following this, throughout the country Blood Donation Camps and other IEC activities were organized.(c):		No, there is no reported shortage of Blood in the country due to second wave of COVID-19 in the country. Though the collection of blood has reduced during this year as compared to the previous years before the COVID times, there has also been an equivalent reduction in demand for blood due to deferred elective surgeries and non-urgent clinical conditions needing blood transfusion. During January to June 2021, a total of 49.83 lac units of Blood were collected across the country. State-wise data is enclosed Annexure-II. Special provisions were made with the support of Ministry of Home Affairs to facilitate the unhindered movement of blood donors, blood mobile and blood transportation vans.	Blood Donor Appointment Letters and permission letters were issued for facilitating the movement of blood donors and mobile teams for blood collection. (d): 	Steps have been taken to engage with different Government Departments, voluntary organizations like Indian Red Cross Society, blood donor associations, professional associations and other stakeholders for creating opportunities to donate and raise public awareness on the need for safe blood donation in the country. The Government supports various activities like conducting blood donation camps, observance of events on VBD days and motivating youth groups in coordination with agencies like Nehru Yuva Kendra Sansthan, National Service Scheme, Red Ribbon Clubs in various Universities and Colleges, etc. The Government has also made a provision of four special casual leaves per year that can be availed by Central Government employees for donating blood.(e) & (f):  The policy of the Government is to have at least one blood bank in each district. Public Health, being a State subject, it is the primary responsibility of the State Governments to ensure the establishment of blood banks as per their need. However, support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their healthcare system including strengthening existing blood banks / establishing new blood banks based on the proposals submitted by the States through National Health Mission.There are a total of 3500 licensed blood banks located in different states of the country (Annexure-III), however there are 63 districts in the country not having blood banks at the moment (Annexure-IV).  	However, even in these districts, need for blood and blood components are met through the blood banks in neighbouring districts.
