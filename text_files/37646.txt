                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI BHAGWANTH KHUBA)(a):	IFFCO has developed nanotechnology based Nano Urea (Liquid) fertilizer, which has been provisionally included in Fertilizer Control Order (FCO)-1985, based on the preliminary experimental trials undertaken in several ICAR research institutes /state agricultural Universities. Nano-urea spray on different crops gave comparable yields to those obtained under fully recommended Doses of fertilizers with 50% savings in top dressed urea.(b) & (c) For reducing the use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture, Government has been promoting organic farming through dedicated schemes of Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and Mission Organic Value Chain Development in North East Region (MOVCDNER) since 2015-16. Both the schemes provide end to end support to organic farmers from organic production to certification and marketing including post harvest management support like processing, packaging, storage etc. PKVY is implemented in all the States across the country to promote organic farming in cluster mode, in which, farmers are provided financial assistance of Rs 50000/ha for 3 years out of which, Rs. 31000/ ha / 3 years is provided directly to farmers through DBT for organic inputs such as seeds, bio fertilisers, bio-pesticides, organic manure, compost/vermi-compost, botanical extracts etc. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________MOVCDNER is implemented in all the North Eastern States for promotion of certified organic production, in which, organic farmers are supported to develop their value chain from organic production to processing and marketing etc. through FPO formation. Under the scheme a sum of Rs. 46,575/ha for 3years are provided for creation of FPO, support to farmers for organic inputs, quality seeds/ planting material and training, hand holding and certification. Apart from that financial support is also provided as subsidy to FPOs and private entrepreneurs @ 75% and 50% respectively for setting up of post harvest infrastructure such as integrated processing unit, integrated packhouse, cold chain component and small processing unit as per the requirement of value chain. 	Government has also   been implementing Bhartiya Prakritik Krishi Padhati (BPKP) as a sub scheme of Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) since 2020-21 for the promotion of traditional/ natural indigenous practices by utilization of agricultural waste and animal dung. The scheme mainly emphasizes on exclusion of all synthetic chemical inputs and promotes on-farm biomass recycling with major stress on biomass mulching; use of cow dung-urine formulations and other plant-based preparations. Under BPKP, financial assistance of Rs 12200/ha for 3 years is provided for cluster formation, capacity building and continuous handholding by trained personnel, certification and residue analysis. As of now, an area of 4.09 lakh ha has been covered in 8 states.                                        ********
