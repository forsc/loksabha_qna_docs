                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (f):  Rationalisation of time table is an ongoing process on Indian Railways (IR) and to this end, IR has embarked upon the zero based time tabling initiative, which, inter-alia, includes scheduling of trains based on scientific principles, ensuring adequate corridor blocks for maintenance, increasing throughput by providing freight corridors, improving punctuality, improving utilization of Rolling Stock and providing convenient and efficient services to the passengers. The initiative, inter-alia, includes rationalization of stoppages and trains taking into account the demand, utility for the passengers and commercial viability. However, at present, no decision has been taken to cancel 500 trains or 6000 stoppages. Besides, to contain the spread of COVID-19 Pandemic, Indian Railways have discontinued all regular time tabled passenger carrying trains w.e.f. 23rd March, 2020, and presently, only special trains, with limited stoppages, are being operated by Indian Railways, keeping in view the concerns and suggestions of the State Governments.*****
