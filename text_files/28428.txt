During the financial year 2014-15, an amount of Rs. 100.00 crore was allocated under VKY. Out of the total budgetary allocation, an amount of Rs. 10.00 Crores were provided to each of the ten States having Schedule V areas as gap filling for carrying out activities commensurating the objective of the Scheme.  During the financial year 2015-16, the gamut of the Scheme was extended to cover all the States having tribal population. Out of the total budgetary allocation to the tune of Rs. 200.00 Crore, funds were released to 21 States against their proposed activities. No fund could be allocated / released to the remaining six States viz. Manipur, Meghalaya, Goa, Uttarakhand, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh due to want of perspective plan and utilization certificate. In 2016-17, token provision of Rs. 1.00 crore was released to State Government of Rajasthan.  Since 2016-17, separate allocation of funds under VKY has been discontinued and it has been envisaged that the fund requirement under the VKY strategy will be fulfilled out of the TSP [now called as Schedule Tribe Component(STC) at central level] funds, which caters to sectoral development including support for education, health, power, roads, sanitation, water supply, livelihood etc. Further, as part of rationalization of Schemes, convergence of schemes / interventions of Ministry of Tribal Affairs has been effected, including the following, as an Umbrella Programme of Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana: (i) Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups.(ii) Minimum Support Price for Minor Forest Produce.(iii) Tribal Festivals, Research Information and Mass Education(iv) Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS)The State-wise details of funds released and utilization thereof reported by the State Governments including Government of Tamil Nadu under the scheme of Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana and its component schemes is at Annexure.
