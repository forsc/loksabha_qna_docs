                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)	To tackle the problem of mounting electronic waste generated due to discarding of electronic equipment by the consumers, Ministry has notified E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016 which were further amended in 2018. The Rules are effective from 01-10-2016 and have the following specific objectives:?	Extended Responsibility to producers to manage a system of E-waste collection, storage, transportation and environmentally sound dismantling and recycling through EPR Authorization (EPRA).?	To promote and encourage establishment of an efficient e-waste collection mechanism. ?	To promote environmentally safe and sound recycling through authorized dismantlers and recyclers of e-waste.?	To minimize illegal recycling / recovery operations.?	Reduce hazardous substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE).The management of e-waste in the Country is regulated under the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016. Under the said Rules, the responsibility of disposal of e-waste in a scientific and environmentally sound manner has been assigned to Producers of notified Electrical & Electronic Equipment (EEE) as listed in Schedule – I of the said rules under the principle of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). Under EPR regime producers of EEE, have given annual e-waste collection and recycling targets based on the generation from the previously sold EEE or based on sales of EEE as the case may be.As on date, 1982 Producers have been granted EPR Authorization. CPCB has also registered 74 Producers Responsibility Organizations (PROs) as on date.

Accordingly, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has estimated the generation of e-waste at the national level on the basis of sales data of 21 types of notified Electrical & Electronic Equipment (EEE) from Financial Year (FY) 2017-2018. The estimated generation of e-waste during FY 2017-2018, FY 2018-2019 & FY 2019-2020 is given below:Financial Year	Estimated Generation in Tonnes2017-18	7,08,445.002018-19	7,71,215.002019-20	10,14,961.21(c) & (d)	Under the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016, provisions have been made for environmentally sound management of e-waste which includes environmentally sound recycling. Environmentally sound recycling leads to recovery of precious and semi-precious metals such as silver, gold, platinum, palladium and plastics, iron, glass, aluminum, and copper. The total quantity of E-Waste collected and processed (dismantled and recycled) during the last three FY is given below:Financial Year	Total Quantity of E-WasteCollected, Dismantled & Recycled in Tonnes2017-18	69,414.02018-19	1,64,663.02019-20	2,24,041.0There is no study till date to estimate the amount of the elements which could be extracted from the e-waste generated annually. *****
