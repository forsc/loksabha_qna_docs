The details of  Total Goitre Rate (TGR) based on  initial surveys and subsequent re-surveys are annexed.b)	The target under NIDDCP is to bring the prevalence of IDDs to below 5% in the country and to ensure 100% consumption of adequately iodated salt (>15ppm) at the household level.c)	National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme (NIDDCP) is being implemented in the entire country. For effective implementation of the programme, financial assistance is provided to all States/UTs for establishment of State/UT Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Cell and IDD Monitoring Laboratory, conducting district IDD Surveys/ Resurveys, health education and publicity to create awareness about IDD, promoting consumption of adequately iodated salt and monitoring of Iodine content of salt through salt testing kit at the Household/Community level.The significant achievements under NIDDCP are :-•	Over the years, the Total Goiter Rate (TGR) in the entire country has reduced significantly. •	The production and supply of Iodized salt in the country during 2020-21 is 78.58 Lakh Tonnes and 75.66 Lakh Tonnes respectively.•	For effective implementation of National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme, 34 States/UTs have established Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Cells and Iodine Deficiency Disorders monitoring laboratories in their State Health Directorate.•	Consumption of Iodated salt at household level has increased to 93% as per NFHS - 4 (2015-16) from 76% in NFHS 3 (2005-06) conducted by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.   •	The Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) (2016 - 2018) indicated that there was adequate level of Iodine intake which is essential to prevent Iodine Deficiency Disorders including Hypothyroidism.d).
