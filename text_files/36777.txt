The  film  is  accessible  on  Youtube  in  English, Hindi  and  regional  languages. It has also been uploaded on the website of Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Academics and National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT).    Department of School Education and Literacy (DoSEL), Ministry of Education has developed Guidelines on School Safety and Security of children studying in Government, Government-aided and Private Schools. The guidelines are advisory in nature and have been circulated to all States/UTs/autonomous bodies of DoSEL and stakeholder ministries. These guidelines inter-alia includes suggestive approach to integrating learning about school safety in the education of children wherein there is provision of safety inspection as teaching-learning activity/group activity in a classroom for older children which includes socio-emotional safety. Further, these guidelines also have the provisions of “Periodic Safety inspection of school” under which the School/School Management have been advised to arrange to carry out thorough inspection of the school at least once in a quarter, during school hours. This quarterly inspection of schools, inter-alia, ensures compliance of the psychosocial safety and support, using the comprehensive checklist given in the guidelines, which includes points related to orientation of students on personal safety, e.g., the difference between ‘safe touch’ and ‘unsafe touch’.
