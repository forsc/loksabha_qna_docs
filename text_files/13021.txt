ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c): As per Section 7 of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA), unemployment allowance is payable in case an applicant is not provided employment within 15 days of receipt of his application seeking employment or from the date on which employment has been sought in case of an advance application, whichever is later.  The Section also provide that no such rate shall be less than one-fourth of the wage rate for the first thirty days during the financial year and not less than once-half of the wage rated for the remaining period of the financial year. As per provision of the Act, the unemployment allowance is to be paid by the States. As per information uploaded by the States in Management Information System (MIS), Rs. 0.12 lakh has been paid as unemployment allowance in the FY 2019-20 (as on 02.03.2020) by the State Governments to Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) workers. (d) to (f): Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is a demand driven wage employment programme. It provides livelihood security i.e., fall back option for livelihood for the rural households when no better employment opportunity is available. The demand for work is influenced by various factors such as rain-fall, availability of alternative and remunerative employment opportunities outside Mahatma Gandhi NREGS etc.  During the last three years, the number of households provided with 100 days of employment, State-UT wise is at Annexure. (g): Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is a demand driven wage employment programme.  Fund release to States/UTs under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is a continuous and dynamic process and Central Government is committed to making funds available keeping in view the demand for work. The Ministry seeks additional fund for Mahatma Gandhi NREGS as and when required for meeting the demand for work on the ground. In the Financial Year 2019-20, the budget provision at Budget Estimate (BE) stage was Rs.60,000 crore.  Due to increase in demand, the Ministry requested for additional budget allocation. The budget provision has now been enhanced to Rs.71001.81 crore at the Revised Estimate (RE) stage.
