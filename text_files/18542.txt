                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (e): Information regarding estimated incidence of cancer cases and estimated mortality of cancer cases is based on the National Cancer Registry Programme Report (NCRP) of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The latest report of NCRP is for the year 2020, which is based on data for the period 2012-16, as compared to earlier report of 2016, which was based on data for the period 2012-14. Also, the year 2020 report is based on an increased coverage in terms of more number of Population Based Cancer Registries (PBCRs) and expansion of some existing PBCRs. As a result of above changes, the annual figures of estimated incidence and mortality of cancer cases in the country have undergone revision as compared to previous report of NCRP of 2016 and the revised year-wise figures are as under: Year	2017	2018	2019Estimated incidence of cancer cases	12,92,534	13,25,232	13,58,415Estimated Mortality of cancer cases	7,15,010	7,33,139	7,51,517As per the ICMR’s “National Cancer Registry Programme Report, 2020”, the projected number of incidence of cancer cases is 15.7 lakhs for the year 2025 in the country.Cancer is a multifactorial disease, the risk factors of which interalia, include use of tobacco products, ageing population, sedentary life styles, unhealthy diet and obesity.Public Health and Hospitals is a State subject. The Central Government, however, supplements the efforts of the State Governments in preventing and controlling cancer and in providing affordable and accessible care. The Government is implementing National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), with focus on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, health promotion & awareness generation, early diagnosis, management and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. To tackle the challenge of Non Communicable Diseases (NCD), including cancer, 637 NCD Clinics at District level and 4,472 NCD Clinics at Community Health Centre level have been set up under NPCDCS.  Government is also implementing Population level initiative for prevention, control and screening for common NCDs (diabetes, hypertension and common cancers viz. oral, breast and cervical cancer). Screening of common NCDs including three common cancers i.e. oral, breast and cervical is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres. Awareness campaigns on common risk factors for NCDs, including cancer, and promotion of healthy lifestyle are carried out through electronic and social media. Camps for awareness generation and screening for common NCDs are also organized at Pragati Maidan, New Delhi, during the India International Trade Fair. ICMR-National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research (NICPR), Noida, has launched www.cancerindia.org with the theme “India Against Cancer”, a portal that provides information on the leading cancers in India with a major focus on awareness, prevention and treatment of these cancers. Several measures have been taken to discourage the use of tobacco products, which is one of the key risk factors of Cancer, besides initiative to promote healthy lifestyles through healthy eating and regular physical activity. To enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer, the Central Government is implementing Strengthening of Tertiary Care for Cancer Scheme, under which setting up of 19 State Cancer Institutes and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres have been approved. Further, Oncology is also one of the focus areas in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar in Haryana and strengthening of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, are also steps in the same direction. Cancer is diagnosed and treated at various levels in the health care system. In Government hospitals, treatment is either free or highly subsidized. Treatment of cancers is also available under Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY). Besides this, Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment (AMRIT) Deendayal outlets have been opened at 210 Institutions/Hospitals with an objective to make available Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease drugs and implants at discounted prices to the patients. Under the umbrella scheme of Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi (RAN), financial assistance is provided to families living below threshold poverty line for their treatment, including treatment of cancer, in Government hospitals.
