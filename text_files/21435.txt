ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES & PENSIONS AND PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (Dr. JITENDRA SINGH):    (a)	Yes, Sir.(b)	Crisis Management Group (CMG), Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) keep getting alerts/intimation very frequently regarding fraudulent transactions involving certain material labelled as ‘Rice-puller’, ‘Anti-radiation pack’, etc. Fraudsters trap innocent businessmen and others and convince them that the material is radioactive and has magical powers to increase the fortune. The fraudsters show manipulated documents purported to be from BARC/DAE etc. to convince the clients about authenticity of the material and cheat the innocent people. Many a times, the victims approach the local police who send the material to BARC to check for radioactivity and in all cases the material is found to be devoid of radioactivity.(c)	The information about fraudsters selling such material with dubious names of ''Anti-radiation pack'', and ‘Rice-puller’, etc., claiming to be certified by BARC/DAE is addressed in all the Public Awareness Programmes conducted by DAE and participants are requested to bring into the notice of law enforcement agencies of such incidences.  This information is also provided to the participants of the various training programmes conducted for security and response agencies on ‘response to radiation emergencies’. A press release has been released recently through PIB to warn public about such fraudulent activities.                                             *****
