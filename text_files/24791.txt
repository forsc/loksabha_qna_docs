ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (f):	Clause 1.5 of the Indian Medical Council (Professional   Conduct, Etiquette   and   Ethics) Regulations, 2002 prescribes that every physician should prescribe drugs with generic names legibly and preferably in capital letters and he/she shall ensure that there is a rational prescription and use of drug. Further, the erstwhile Medical Council of India (MCI) had issued Circulars dated 2.11.2012, 18.01.2013 and 21.04.2017 vide which all the Registered Medical Practitioners were directed to comply with the aforesaid provisions.  The National Medical Commission Act, 2019 empowers Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB) of the Commission or the appropriate State Medical Councils to take disciplinary action against a doctor  for  violation  of  the  provision  of  the aforesaid   Regulations.   As and when complaints are received against the violation of code of ethics for doctors, such complaints are referred by EMRB (previously by erstwhile MCI) to the concerned State Medical Councils where the doctors/medical practitioners are registered. The Ethics and Medical Registration Board (EMRB) is the Appellate Authority in the matter. The details of number of complaints received by the Government/MCI for not prescribing drugs with generic name by the Doctors across the country is not maintained centrally. States  have  been  advised  to  ensure  prescription  of  generic  drugs  and conduct  regular  prescription  audits  in  public  health  facilities.  Practice  of prescription  audit  is  one  of  the  prerequisites  for  getting  certified  under  the National Quality Assurance Standards(NQAS). Further, under National Health Mission (NHM), support is provided for provision of essential generic drugs free of cost in public health facilities.
