In the last two years alone, the following reforms in the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy have been undertaken across sectors such as Coal Mining, Contract Manufacturing, Digital Media, Single Brand Retail Trading, Intermediaries or Insurance Intermediaries, Civil Aviation, Defence and Insurance: (i)   To liberalize and simplify FDI policy for providing Ease of doing business and attract investments, vide Press Note 4 (2019) dated 18.09.2019, following FDI Policy reforms have been undertaken:a)	100% FDI under automatic route have been permitted for coal mining activities including associated processing infrastructure that includes coal washery, crushing, coal handling, separation (magnetic and non-magnetic). Earlier, 100% FDI under automatic route was permitted in coal mining for captive consumption only.b)	Under the Manufacturing sector, in order to provide clarity on contract manufacturing, it has been decided to allow 100% FDI under automatic route in contract manufacturing and FDI is now permitted under automatic route in contract manufacturing through a legally tenable contract.c)	Local sourcing norms have been eased for FDI in Single Brand Retail Trading (SBRT) and all procurements made from India by SBRT entity shall be counted towards local sourcing, irrespective of whether goods procured are sold in India or exported.

However, there was no specific provision pertaining to digital media. In order to address this gap, 26% FDI has been permitted under government route for uploading/ streaming of News & Current Affairs through Digital Media.

Further, in the event of the transfer of ownership of any existing or future FDI in an entity in India, directly or indirectly, resulting in the beneficial ownership falling within the restriction/purview of the said policy amendment, such subsequent change in beneficial ownership will also require Government approval. (v)   Defence Sector: The FDI policy amendments, notified vide Press Note 4 (2020 series) dated 17.09.2020, have been carried out to realize the vision of an Aatmanirbhar Bharat. Now, FDI in defense sector is allowed up to 74% through automatic route (from earlier 49%) for companies seeking new industrial licenses.
