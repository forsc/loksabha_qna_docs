ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)	Grant of Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by the World Health Organization (WHO) is a technical process which is undertaken by independent experts appointed by the WHO. The process involves submission of necessary data by the concerned vaccine manufacturing company and its analysis and evaluation by the said experts. Bharat Biotech International Limited applied for the WHO’s EUL for COVAXIN in July 2021. COVAXIN was granted EUL by the WHO on 03 November 2021 after the WHO’s expert body so recommended. (c)	There is no multilaterally agreed upon requirement of vaccination for travel purposes. International travel can also be undertaken with negative RT-PCR and quarantine related health protocols to a large number of countries. Further, different countries have different requirements for travel, including nature of passports, type of visas, purpose of travel, duration of stay etc. These are sovereign decisions of foreign countries. Travels including by VIPs are in accordance with the prescribed protocols of the countries concerned. ***
