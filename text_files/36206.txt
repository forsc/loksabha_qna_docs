ANSWER




(a)	to (c): Some cases have been reported of attempted unauthorized access to the authentication system using a gummy finger of an authorized operator/personnel.In all such cases FIR have been lodged for unauthorized authentication cases. UIDAI has a strong and rigorous process of identifying such types of cases and ensuring that these are reported to the concerned Law Enforcement Agencies for necessary action.The data, as available with NPCI, for the frauds reported to it by member banks for the past 3 years is as follows:FY	Unique Customer Count	Transaction Count	Amount (Lacs)FY-19-20	497	1370	94FY-20-21	1200	3755	268FY21-22	2391	8739	648Grand Total	4088	13864	1010 (d):UIDAI uses various methods/audits/advocacy to ensure that Aadhaar system is robust and highly secure. The security of its entire authentication system is reviewed from time to time. *******
