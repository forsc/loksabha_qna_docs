(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d) :	The Government constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee in April, 2016 to examine issues relating to “Doubling of Farmers Income” and recommend strategies to achieve the same.  The Committee submitted its Report to the Government in September, 2018 containing the strategy for doubling of farmers’ income.  After acceptance of the DFI Committee recommendations, the Government has constituted an ‘Empowered Body’ to review and monitor the progress.  		Agriculture, being a State subject the State Governments take appropriate measures for development of agriculture in the State.  However, Government of India supplements the efforts of States through appropriate policy measures and budgetary support and various schemes/programmes.  The various schemes/programmes of the Government of India are meant for the welfare of farmers by increasing production, remunerative returns and income support to farmers. 	The Government has adopted several developmental programmes, schemes, reforms and policies that focus on higher incomes for the farmers.  All these policies & programmes are being supported by higher budgetary allocation, non-budgetary financial resources by way of creating Corpus Funds and supplementary income transfers under PM-KISAN.  The latest major intervention includes the ‘Atma Nirbhar Bharat – Agriculture package’ which includes comprehensive markets reforms and creation of ‘Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF)’ worth Rs. 1 lakh crore. In 2021-22 budget announcements, Micro Irrigation Fund has been doubled to Rs 10000 crores and Institutional Credit has been increased to Rs 16.50 lakh crores. (e)    The different mediums being adopted for imparting  training for promoting various Government schemes for  the welfare of farmers and bringing awareness to them  at district, panchayat and village level  are Farmers Training, Demonstrations, Exposure Visits, Kisan Melas, Exhibitions, Mobilization of Farmers Groups and organizing Farm Schools,  Focused Publicity Campaigns, Kisan Call Centres, Agri-Clinics and Agri-Business Centres of entrepreneurs,  Kisan SMS Portal, Kisan Suvidha mobile, Webinar etc.   (f)	 As per NSSO, the growth rate of agriculture & allied sector during 2017-18, 2018-19 & 2019-20 is 6.6%, 2.6% & 4.3% respectively and the growth rate in 2020-21 for first three quarters are 3.3%, 3.0%, 3.9% respectively.*******
