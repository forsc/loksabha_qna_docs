RBI Circular dated 18.04.2017 had also directed the Banks to review the Telecom sector in light of stressed financial condition. Consequently, an Inter-Ministerial Group (IMG) was constituted on 16.05.2017 with following terms of reference:(i)	To examine systemic issues affecting viability and repayment capacity in telecom sector and furnish recommendations for resolution of stressed assets,(ii)	Policy reforms and strategic interventions for Telecom sector.The Inter-Ministerial Group submitted its report on 31.08.2017. As per the IMG Report, the total debt of the telecom industry was Rs 7.88 lakh crore.Outstanding debt Liabilities of telecom operators(Rs. in Crore)<pre>Particulars	Telecom Service Providers	Tower Companies	TotalIndian Debt	159675	18049	177724Foreign Debt	83918		83918Total Bank/ FI Debt	243593	18049	261642Bank Guarantees	50000		50000Deferred Spectrum Liabilities of DoT	295864		295864Other Third party Liabilities	175464	4763	180227Total Outside Liabilities	764922	22812	787734</pre>The key Recommendations of IMG, inter alia, are as follows:(i)	Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) may be given a one-time opportunity to opt for higher number of installments (16) instead of the then permitted 10 installments.(ii)	DoT may issue appropriate clarification that only the gain or pro?t arising from trade of spectrum shall constitute as part of revenue for the purpose of calculation of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR).(iii)	One-year MCLR of SBI may be adopted with effect from the date of its introduction by RBI i.e. April 01, 2016 in place of PLR.Action taken by DoT on the IMG Report is as given below:(i)	TSPs have been given one-time opportunity to opt for higher number of installments (maximum 16 installments) instead of currently permitted 10 installments.(ii)	One-year MCLR of SBI has been adopted with effect from the date of its introduction by RBI i.e. April 01, 2016 in place of PLR.There is no evidence to suggest that 4G Speed provided by telecom companies has any linkage with the financial stress faced by the telecom companies.(f)	BSNL has already started 4G services in its licensed service areas (LSAs) by using existing spectrum of 2100 MHz band, and, 5921 numbers of 4G BTSs have been commissioned so far.  MTNL is yet to launch 4G services in both of its LSAs. BSNL and MTNL have requested DoT to grant additional spectrum with government support for providing 4G services. The above said requests have been included in the revival plan of BSNL and MTNL.
