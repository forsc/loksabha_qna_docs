ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES & PENSIONS AND PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR.JITENDRA SINGH):    (a)	There is presently no proposal to decommission any nuclear power plant. The eventual decommissioning of the nuclear power plants will be carried out in accordance with the safety guides of the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) on decommissioning.(b)	Yes, Sir.  A decommissioning levy (presently 2 Paise per Unit of electricity sold) is being collected and deposited into a decommissioning fund to finance the decommissioning activities of nuclear power plants in future.(c)	No, Sir.  The design of nuclear power plants is inherently robust and they can be operated beyond their initial economic life based on systemic life assessment studies & undertaking necessary life extension measures. Following these measures, the life of the plants is extended in accordance with the approval of the regulatory authority, AERB. This has been the international practice and the same is adopted in India.	*****
