                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a)	to (d) :	Justice V.S. Malimath Committee on Reforms of the Criminal Justice System was constituted by the Government of India, in November 2000 to consider measures for revamping the Criminal Justice System. The Committee gave its report in March 2003 containing 158 recommendations  on various aspects of criminal justice system in the country. A Committee under the Chairmanship of Prof. N.R. Madhava Menon was constituted on 3.05.2006 to draft a National Policy Paper on Criminal Justice System in the country which submitted a draft National Policy on Criminal Justice in July, 2007. -2/...-2-LS.US.Q.NO.3562 FOR 10.12.2019Further, the Department–related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs, in its 146th Report dated 23.06.2010, had recommended that there is a need for a comprehensive review of the Criminal Justice System of the country. Earlier the Parliamentary Standing Committee in its 111th and 128th Reports had also stressed upon the need to reform and rationalize the criminal law of the country by introducing a comprehensive legislation in Parliament rather than bringing about piece meal amendments. Accordingly, the Law Commission of India  through the Ministry of Law & Justice was requested to examine and give a comprehensive report covering all aspects of criminal law so that comprehensive amendments can be made in the various laws viz. Indian Penal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Evidence Act, etc. While requesting the Law Commission of India  for a comprehensive review, it was specifically requested to take into account the recommendations of Malimath Committee and Madhava Menon Committee. The Law Commission vide their letter dated 11.12.14 had intimated that they have identified certain focus areas and formed sub–groups to deliberate on such areas.
