The Blockchain integration will help track all details of consignments, right from vineyards to the end customers. The system will keep a record of all the processes involved, which can be traced by international customers at the end of the chain to validate the authenticity and quality of grapes.This would also ensure a secured, scalable and cost-effective interface for all the stakeholders in the exports value chain.*****
