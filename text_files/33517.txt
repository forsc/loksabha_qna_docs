(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b): The primary responsibility for disaster management rests with the State Governments.  The State Governments provide financial relief to the affected people in the wake of notified disasters, including flood, from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), already placed at their disposal. However, in the event of disaster of a severe nature, additional financial assistance is extended from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), as per the laid down procedure, which includes an assessment based on the visit of an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT). The financial assistance under SDRF/NDRF in the wake of notified natural disasters is given by way of relief and not for compensation of loss as suffered/claimed.The Government of India has not received any request from the State Government of Jharkhand for financial assistance from NDRF for floods/heavy rains during 2021-22. However, the State Government of Jharkhand has been allocated Rs.605.60 crore (Rs. 454.40 crore as central share & Rs151.20 crore as state share) under SDRF for 2021-22. The entire central share of SDRF has been released to the State of Jharkhand.(c): No, Sir.(d): Does not arise.*****
