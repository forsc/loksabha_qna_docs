                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		 	  (SHRI NARENDRA  SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (c):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 338   DUE FOR REPLY ON 17TH  MARCH, 2020.(a) & (b):    The PM-KISAN Scheme has been successfully implemented across the country. So far, as on 11.3.2020, financial benefit under the scheme has been released to 8,69,79,391 beneficiaries. However, these exclude about 69 lakh farmers of West Bengal as Government of West Bengal has not yet decided to join the scheme. The entire responsibility of identification of eligible beneficiary farmer families and uploading their correct details on the PM-KISAN portal rests with the concerned State/UT Governments. The State Governments have been continuously requested and vigorously pursued for expeditious registration and uploading of data of beneficiaries, in mission mode and by organizing camps. Meeting is held weekly through Video Conferencing with State Governments and other concerned stakeholders so as to remove any handicaps coming in the way of smooth and seamless implementation of the scheme. The target of Government is to achieve 100% saturation by enrolling every eligible farmer family of the country. To achieve this, the States/UTs have been asked to conduct various saturation drives. On the advice of the Union Government, the States have been organizing publicity/awareness camps to ensure expeditious registration of beneficiaries. Further, to achieve 100% saturation, a special facility has been provided to the farmers in the PM-Kisan portal, namely, ‘Farmers Corner’. Through this facility, the farmers can also do their self-registration through the Farmers Corner. Farmers can also edit their names in PM-Kisan database as per their Aadhaar card  through the Farmers Corner. Farmers can also know the status of their payment through the Farmers Corner. Village-wise details of beneficiaries are also available on the Farmers Corner. The Common Service Centres (CSCs) have also been authorized to do    registration of the farmers for the Scheme Contd…2/--2-upon payment of minimal fees. The above facilities on Farmers Corner are also available through CSCs. A special Mobile APP has also been launched on 24th February, 2020 on the 1st anniversary of completion of one year of successful implementation of scheme. The APP provides the facilities available through Farmers Corner.Government of West Bengal has also been repeatedly requested to join the scheme so as to enable the farmers of the State to avail the benefits of the Scheme.(c):	 Financial benefits under the Scheme are transferred from the PM-KISAN budgetary Head of Account of Government directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiary farmers. Every such transaction is secured and validated by a host of agencies involved in the process, namely, the concerned State / UT Government,  National Informatics Centre (NIC), Public Finance Management System (PFMS), National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI), Sponsored Banks of the State Governments in each State/UT for PM-KISAN and destination banks having accounts of the beneficiaries. The success of every transaction is confirmed by the destination banks through NPCI.****
