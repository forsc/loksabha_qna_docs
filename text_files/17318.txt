ANSWER




                                                        (a) whether there has been any improvement in the health of rivers especially the Ganga river during Lockdown and if so, the details thereof; (b) whether the Government has devised any strategy to prevent pollution in rivers during and after Unlock and if so, the details thereof; (c) whether the sewerage water, synthetic contaminants, commercial industrial chemical water pollutants drains actively dump into the river system especially in Ganga and Yamuna and if so, the details thereof along with the data for last six years; (d) the steps initiated by the Government to prevent river pollution and the funds sanctioned and utilized for the purpose; and (e) whether health of the Ganga river has improved under National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) and if so, the details thereof along with the expenditure incurred?THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI  & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a): Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) have informed that based on water quality monitoring of river Ganga being carried out for pre as well as lockdown period and studies conducted by them, State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) and other agencies to assess the impact of lockdown on the water quality of river Ganga and its tributaries, it has been observed that no definite trend exists in different water quality parameters observed for various stretches of river Ganga and its tributaries. However, varying degrees of improvement in a few water quality parameters have been observed as per CPCB and SPCB reports which may be attributed to various factors such as increased availability of fresh water due to rainfall in the river catchment, no industrial effluent discharge and reduced human activity such as restriction on bathing, ritual disposal, restricted tourism, solid waste, mass washing of clothes etc. (b): The strategy during lockdown has been to ensure that all the sewage treatment plants continue to function without any interruption as sewage generation and its contribution to pollution remained constant even though pollution due to industrial effluent and solid waste generation at ghats got controlled due to restrictionsduring the lockdown. Guidelines were issued to follow all safety precautions while continuing the operation of STPs. The various interventions for abatement of pollutions of rivers have been continued. Some of them are given below:•	Financial assistance is being provided to States for setting up of sewage infrastructure and other pollution abatement activities under Namami Gange and National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) of ministry of Jal Shakti as well as AMRUT & Smart Cities Mission of Ministry of housing & Urban Affairs.•	State Government have formulated river action plans to restore water quality of polluted river stretchesfor intercepting, diverting and treatment of municipal wastewater from urban centres.•	Regulation of industrial Pollution is implemented through various provisions of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 under Consent mechanism by the respective State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) and Pollution Control Committees (PCC).•	The Online Continuous Effluent Monitoring Systems (OCEMS) are installed by 17- categories of industries and Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) being established on industrial units in the country through the directives issued by CPCB for getting real time information on the effluent quality and non-complying units were identified and actions were taken against these units.(c): Provision of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 does not permit discharge of untreated effluent or waste into the environment. In view of non-availability of adequate infrastructure and improper management, presently, untreated sewage and polluting waste is reaching river bodies.Under the Namami Gange Programme, CPCB under “Pollution, Inventorization, Assessment & Surveillance (PIAS)”Project has identified priority drains responsible for carrying sewage, industrial wastes and agriculture run-off etc into river Ganga.  These drains are being monitored on half yearly-basis.  Out of a total of 151 priority drains, flows from 145 drains will be covered through their interception and diversion or sewer network for treatment through 113 sewerage projects taken on main stem of Ganga under Namami Gange Programme for creation of 2171 MLD capacity.  As per the latest monitoring carried out during 2019 (post-monsoon, 2019), the available status of flow and organic load (BOD load) discharging into river Ganga is mentioned in Annexure-I.  Similarly, 1270 MLD of treatment capacity has been created under the YAP Phase – I & II projects on river Yamuna in States of Haryana, Delhi & Uttar Pradesh for its conservation.  Besides. Government of India / NMCG has sanctioned 24 projects in Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh under Namami Gange Programme to abate pollution load to river Yamuna which will create 1310.6 MLD STP capacity and rehabilitate 528.18 MLD STP capacity.  Two projects have been completed in Sonipat and Panipat creating STP capacity of total 70 MLD and rehabilitation of 75 MLD STPs.As per CPCB data, sewage generation in Delhi is 4420 MLD whereas, total sewage treatment capacity developed is 3104 MLD and capacity utilization is 2753 MLD, thereby leading to untreated sewage discharge of 1667 MLD into river Yamuna. Therefore, it can be stated that discharge of untreated and partially treated sewage along the river & industrial wastewater discharges through 23 drains are the main sources of pollution of river Yamuna in Delhi. Water quality of drains for the period 2015-2020 is attached as Annexure-II.(d) & (e): Cleaning of river is a continuous process and Government of India is supplementing the efforts of the State Governments in addressing the challenges of pollution of rivers by providing financial and technical assistance. Assistance is provided to State Governments for abatement of pollution in identified stretches of various rivers (excluding river Ganga and its tributaries) under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) on cost sharing basis between the Central & State Governments for taking up various pollution abatement works relating to interception & diversion of raw sewage, construction of sewerage systems, setting up of sewage treatment plants, low cost sanitation, river front/bathing ghat development, etc. The NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches of 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country with a sanctioned cost of Rs. 5870.54 crore. A Central share of Rs. 2530.63 crore has been released to the State Governments for implementation of various pollution abatement schemes Sewage treatment capacity of 2522.03 million litres per day (mid) has been created under the programme.Under the Namami Gange, for conservation and pollution abatement of the River Ganga and its tributaries, a total of 315 projects have been sanctioned at a cost of Rs 28,854 Crore. The projects are sanctioned for various activities such as sewerage infrastructure, industrial pollution abatement, Ghats & Crematoria, River Front Development, River Surface Cleaning, Institutional Development, Biodiversity Conservation, Afforestation, Rural Sanitation etc.  132 projects have been completed, including 54 sewerage infrastructure projects till July, 2020. Under sewerage projects 668.70 MLD sewage treatment capacity has been added and 120 MLD treatment capacity rehabilitated. An expenditure of Rs.9370.09 crore has been incurred by NMCG through various implementing agencies since its inception in 2011-12 for various project activities.As a result of multi sectoral interventions, the improving trend in water quality of river Ganga has been observed based on various parameters for measuring water quality viz. Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Faecal Coliform (FC) which have shown improvements during 2020- Jan to April (Median) as compared to 2014 (Median) for 51 locations as detailed below: -•	DO (Median) has improved at 49 locations (51 locations compared)•	BOD (Median) has been improved at 42 locations (51 locations compared)•	FC (Median) has been improved at 27 locations (43 locations compared)An improvement in terms of BOD compliance has also been observed in 2020 as compared to 2014 in the following stretch/locations.•	After confluence(A/c) Song (Raiwala) to Haridwar Down Stream (D/s), Uttarakhand•	Narora, Kannauj D/s, Up Stream (U/s) Kanpur, Prayagraj (Rasoolabad), Kadaghat (Prayagraj) and Prayagraj D/s (Sangam), UP•	Nabadwip and Diamond Harbour, West Bengal******                                                          Annexure-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (C) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 777 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 17.09.2020 REGARDING “IMPROVEMENT IN HEALTH OF RIVERS”Status of Year-wise flow and BOD load discharging ino river Ganga State	2016	2018	2019	Active/ Priority Drains	Post Monsoon	Active/ Priority Drains	Pre Monsoon	Post Monsoon	Active/ Priority Drains	Pre Monsoon	Post Monsoon		Flow(MLD)	BOD Load (TPD)		Flow(MLD)	BOD Load (TPD)	Flow(MLD)	BOD Load (TPD)		Flow(MLD)	BOD Load (TPD)	Flow(MLD)	BOD Load (TPD)UttarakhandPhase-I Segment-A(Gangotri to Haridwar D/S)	12	132.77	7.11	14	403.21	23.19	435.86	8.32	17	139.03	7.55	189.09	0.95Uttar PradeshPhase-I Segment-B (Haridwar D/S to Kanpur D/S to Unnao)	30	701.00	70.19	30	578.81	55.08	859.21	42.73	32	547.54	25.62	810.03	31.67Uttar PradeshPhase-II (UnnaoD/S to UP Border)	29	1226.32	63.13	26	1125.73	66.44	782.88	42.21	25	568.34	33.04	1462.86	51.22BiharPhase-III (UP Border to Jharkhand)	22	636.18	27.36	21	1087.18	39.47	984.99	40.55	19	793.67	27.11	808.06	40.41JharkhandPhase-III (UP Border to Jharkhand)	2	30.68	3.00	02	42.56	2.48	41.35	2.45	02	16.09	0.74	16.45	0.14West Bengal Phase-IV (Jharkhand Border to BayOf Bengal)	59	6419.14	190.41	58	7375.02	241.17	7615.85	212.45	56	7894.57	342.90	8275.38	195.75TOTAL	154	9146.09	361.20	151	10,612.51	427.83	10,720.14	348.71	151	9959.24	436.96	11561.87	320.14MLD: Millilitre per Day       TPD: Tonne per Day Annexure IIANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (C) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 777 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 17.09.2020 REGARDING “IMPROVEMENT IN HEALTH OF RIVERS”Water Quality data of drains discharging into River Yamuna in Delhi (Year 2020)Sl.
