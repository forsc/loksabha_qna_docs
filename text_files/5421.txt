ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)  (a):	The Ministry of Food Processing Industries is closely monitoring the financial and physical progresses of the constituent component schemes of the PMKSY for optimum utilization of funds allocated under PMKSY and creation of different infrastructural/logistic/processing/preservation facilities to be created under the Scheme for promotion of food processing industries.  However, no assessment has since been made on the impact of PMKSY as the implementation period of PMKSY is 2016-20.   (b):	The Ministry has developed an electronic platform in tune with India’s Digital India programme to make all processes related to submission of proposals under various schemes and release of grants-in-aid simple, easy and transparent through Scheme Management System. The system facilitates online submission of application, document uploading and its status tracking on real time basis.  At any stage when the status of proposal gets changed, the system generates automated email alerts and forwards it to concerned stakeholder’s email account.  The system also provides facilities for queries and reports for monitoring and decision making.  The application is hosted on Government of India Cloud Servers to provide fast access of information to stakeholders on 24X7 basis.  There is, thus, hardly any human interface in the whole processes of submission of application and release in grants-in-aid to beneficiaries of the Schemes of PMKSY. Further, the Ministry has created a Dashboard to review Ministry’s schemes through their key performance indicators namely number of ongoing projects, pendency at different levels, delays at various levels, and the like.  The dashboard provides at-a-glance views of key performance indicators of all the schemes included in the scope of Scheme Management System.(c):	In addition to implementation of various Central Sector Schemes under PRADHAN MANTRI KISAN SAMPADA YOJANA (PMKSY) for overall promotion and development of food processing sector in the country and to  attract investment create employment opportunities in the sector,  Government has taken a number of policy initiatives/measures/steps to attract investment in the sector to generate employment like permitting 100% FDI through automatic route in manufacturing of food products and 100% FDI under Government approval route for trading, including through ecommerce, in respect of food products produced and/or manufactured in India, Creation of a special fund of ? 2000 crores in National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) to provide affordable credit to food processing industries, classification of food & agro-based processing units and cold chain infrastructure as agricultural activity for Priority Sector Lending (PSL), lower Goods & Services Tax (GST) rates for majority of food products, 100% exemption of income tax on profit for new food processing units, 100 percent income tax exemption from profit derived by FPOs having annual turnover up to Rs.100 crore for activities such as post-harvest value addition to agriculture,  100% deduction of expenditure incurred on investment on establishment and operation of cold chain/warehousing facility for storage of agricultural produce, concessional import duty for plant and machinery under project imports benefit scheme, import duty exemption on import of raw material under advance authorization scheme.  (d):	The Ministry of Food Processing Industries has separate budget of its own.  A total allocation of Rs.2192.73 crore has been made for food processing during 2016-17 to 2018-19.  The year-wise allocation of funds and expenditure is as follows: ( ? in Crore)Year	Allocation 	Expenditure2016-17	688.56	677.162017-18	633.84	605.582018-19   	870.33	591.38 *****
