ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(Smt. Annpurna Devi)(a) & (b): The category-wise, State-wise details of Universities, Deemed Universities and other Universities, as available on All India Survey on Higher Education website, are at Annexure. From the above details, it can be seen that the number of universities have increased from 760 in 2014-15 to 1043 in 2019-20, thus marking an increase of more than 37% over the period. (c): Considering that autonomy is pivotal to promoting and institutionalizing excellence in higher education, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has notified the UGC (Categorization of Universities (only) for Grant of Graded Autonomy) Regulations, 2018.(d) to (f): The Higher Educational Institutions under the administrative control of the Ministry of Education are regulated by the UGC, All India Council for Technical Education and Council of Architecture. The National Education Policy (NEP), 2020 envisions that the ProfessionalCouncils, such as the Indian Council for Agricultural Research, Veterinary Council of India, National Council for Vocational Education and Training etc., will act as Professional Standard Setting Bodies. The NEP, 2020 further envisions a common, single point regulator for the higher education sector including teacher education and excluding medical and legal education, thus eliminating the duplication and disjunction of regulatory efforts by the multiple regulatory agencies that exist at the current time.******
