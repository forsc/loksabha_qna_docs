KISHAN REDDY)(a) to (e):	Identification and development of tourism sites is primarily the responsibility of State Governments/ Union Territory (UT) Administrations. However, the Ministry of Tourism, under its schemes of Swadesh Darshan, National Mission on Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual, Heritage Augmentation Drive Scheme (PRASHAD) and Assistance to Central Agencies provides financial assistance to State Governments/ UT Administrations/ Central Agencies for development of tourism infrastructure in the country including Uttar Pradesh. Sanctioning of projects under the schemes is a continuous process. The projects are identified for development in consultation with the State Governments/ UT Administrations/Central Agencies and are sanctioned subject to availability of funds, submission of suitable detailed project reports, their adherence to relevant scheme guidelines and utilization of funds released earlier. The Ministry of Tourism has sanctioned 9 projects under Swadesh Darshan scheme, 6 projects under PRASHAD scheme and 3 projects under ‘Assistance to Central Agencies for Tourism Infrastructure Development Scheme’ in Uttar Pradesh, however no project in Farukhabad district of Uttar Pradesh is under consideration in the Ministry of Tourism.********
