                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (e): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. 118 BY SHRI PRAJWAL REVANNA TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 09.02.2022 REGARDING RAILWAY PROJECTS IN KARNATAKA (a) to (c): Railway projects are sanctioned and taken up Zonal Railway-wise and not State-wise as the Indian Railways’ projects may span across State boundaries. However, as on 01.04.2021, 35 Projects        (21 New Line and 14 Doubling), costing `53,918 crore for 4,568 Km length falling fully/partly in Karnataka are under different stage of planning/approval/execution, Out of which 1248 Km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of  `15,537 crore has been incurred upto March 21. Out of these, 14 projects (12 New line and 02 doubling) have been taken up on cost sharing basis with Government of Karnataka. Details of cost sharing project in Karnataka is appended. Railway Projects in Karnataka are covered by South Western Railway (SWR), Central Railway (CR), Southern Railway (SR) and South Central Railway (SCR). Railway Zone-wise details of all ongoing Railway projects including cost, expenditure and outlay are made available in public domain on Indian Railways website i.e.  www.indianrailways.gov.in > Ministry of Railways >Railway Board >About Indian Railways >Railway Board Directorates >Finance (Budget) >Rail Budget/Pink Book (Year)> Railway wise Works Machinery and Rolling Stock Programme.Since 2014, there is substantial increase in budget outlay for infrastructure projects and safety works and commensurate commissioning. Average annual Budget allocation for Infrastructure and safety works, falling fully/ partly in State of  Karnataka,  during  2014-19 has been enhanced to `2,702 crore  per  year  from  `835 crore  per  year  during  2009-14,  which  is 224% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14.  For financial year 2019-20 budget allocation of `3,386 crore (306% more than average annual allocation of 2009-14) and for financial year 2020-21 `4,220 crore (405% more than average annual budget allocation of 2009-14) has been provided for these works. For financial year 2021-22, highest ever budget outlay of `4,297 crore (original budget outlay `4,204 crore and additional `93 crore) has been provided for these works, which is 415% more than average annual budget outlay of 2009-14. During 2014-21, 1,162 Km sections (281 Km of New line and 881 Km of Doubling) falling fully/partly in the State of Karnataka have been commissioned at an average rate 166 km per year, which is 47% more than commissioning during 2009-14 (113 Km/Yr).	The completion of any Railway project(s) depends on various factors like deposition of cost share by cost sharing authority in cost sharing project(s), quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project(s) site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions etc.  All these factors affect the completion time of the project(s). As such, confirmed completion time of project(s) cannot be ascertained at this stage. Nevertheless, every effort is being made to execute the project(s) expeditiously. (d) and (e):	Kadur –Chikmagalur-Sakleshpur (93 Km) via Belur was included in Budget     1996-97.  Subsequently Government of Karnataka has agreed to share the cost of the new line on a 50:50 basis from Kadur-Chikmagalur and Chikmagalur –Sakleshpur on 50:50 and land free of cost. The section between Kadur –Chikmagalur (45 km) section was commissioned during 2014.	Government of Karnataka vide their letter dated 17.01.2019 has requested to drop the section between Belur-Sakleshpur and proposed to sanction Belur-Hassan new line in lieu of it.  Government of Karnataka has also agreed for land free of cost and 50% construction cost of the proposed Belur – Hassan New line section. Accordingly, Belur – Hassan new line has been sanctioned.  	Land acquisition and forestry clearance in Chikmangalur – Belur has been taken up.  So far, 157.12 acre out of total required 324.36 acre land has been acquired and Stage – I approval of forestry clearance of 2.67 acre land has been received and Stage-II approval has been taken up.  	Final Location Survey (FLS) for preparation of Detailed Project Report (DPR) for Hassan – Belur section is in progress.*****
