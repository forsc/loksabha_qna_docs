(c) & (d)	A proposal was received for establishment of a High Altitude Training Centre in Munnar and the same was not realised, as SAI has recently undertaken the restructuring of its Sports Promotional Schemes and taking into account various factors including financial constraints, it has been decided to focus on the existing centres in priority sports disciplines. *****
