ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                              (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) to (d): Average vehicular speed in cities is dependent on the availability of public transport network against the growth in private vehicle density apart from the quality of road infrastructure and traffic management.  Urban Transport, which is an integral part of urban development, is a State subject. As such, the initiatives including planning and execution of urban transport systems as mentioned above are taken up by the State Governments/Union Territories/Urban Local Bodies.  However, 73 cities under the Smart Cities Mission are implementing Integrated Command and Control Centres (ICCC).  ICCCs include solutions for Integrated Traffic Management System, Adaptive Traffic Signaling System, and Red Light Violation Detection System, which improve mobility in the city.  These systems use technology which include inter alia motion detection, video surveillance, Internet of Things (IOT) devices, sensors and data analytics.                            *****
