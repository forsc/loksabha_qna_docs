                                                        MINISTEROF STATEFOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (f) Rural water supply is a State subject. Government of India supplements the efforts of States/ UTsby providing financial and technical assistance through the centrally sponsored scheme Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM)which aims at providing potable waterto every rural household with Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC) at service level of 55 litre per capita per day (lpcd) by 2024.While allocating the fund under JJM to States/ UTs, 10% weightage has been given to the population residing in habitations affected by chemical contaminants including Arsenic and Iron.States have also been advised to ensure potable water in quality affected habitations especially with Arsenic and Fluoride contaminants on priority while implementing schemes under the JJM. As planning and implementation of piped water supply scheme based on a safe water source will take time, as a purely interim measure, installation of Community Water Purification Plants (CWPPs) may be taken up to provide 8-10 lpcd potable water to meet drinking and cooking need of every household residing in such villages/ habitations.In March 2016, with the recommendation of NITI Aayog, an amount of ?1,000 Crore was released to various Arsenic & Fluoride affected States for installation of community water purification plants and commissioning of piped water supply schemes. Further, in March 2017, National Water Quality Sub-Mission (NWQSM) was launched as a part of National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), which has now been subsumed under JalJeevan Mission, to provide safe drinking water to 27,544 Arsenic/ Fluoride affected rural habitations in the country.The state-wise number of community water purification plants installed is at Annexure-I.State-wise details of fund released and expenditure incurred under NWQSM and ‘With recommendation of NITI Aayog’ is at Annexure-II.*****
