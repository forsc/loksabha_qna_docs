(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Per Drop More Crop component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY-PDMC) from 2015-16 in all the States of the country which focuses on enhancing water use efficiency at farm level through Micro Irrigation systems viz. Drip and Sprinkler irrigation systems and creation of water storages for supplementing micro-irrigation. Under this scheme, an amount of Rs. 13728.12 crore has been provided to the states and an area of 53.73 lakh ha has been covered under Micro Irrigation in the country till date.Recent evaluation studies has indicated that Micro-Irrigation scheme has been quite effective in terms of ensuring benefits for farmers e.g. higher productivity; reduction in labour cost, water consumption, power utilization, fertilizer use etc. With a view to providing impetus to the Micro Irrigation systems and to enhance the water use efficiency in agriculture sector, a Micro Irrigation Fund (MIF) with corpus of Rs. 5000 Crore was created with NABARD during 2018-19. The major objective of the Fund is to facilitate the States in mobilizing the resources to provide top up/ additional incentives to farmers for incentivising micro irrigation beyond the assistance available under PMKSY-PDMC. States may also access MIF exclusively for innovative integrated projects depending on State specific requirements.Contd…..2/-- 2 -	Under the MIF, the projects from States of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, West Bengal, Punjab & Uttarakhand has been approved for Rs. 3970.17 Crore of loan to facilitate for bringing 12.81 lakh ha under micro-irrigation. Details of State-wise Projects sanctioned so far are annexed. In addition, the project proposals from state of West Bengal and Rajasthan are received for availing MIF.  Further, to strengthen and expand the adoption of micro-irrigation systems by the farmers in the country, an announcement in Budget- 2021 has been made to enhance  the corpus of MIF to Rs. 10000 crore.
