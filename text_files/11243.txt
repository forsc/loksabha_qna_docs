Exchanges have confirmed that they have not received any complaint for non-compliance pertaining to appointment of women directors by listed entities during last three years including the current year.(e): To monitor the compliance, SEBI had issued a circular dated May 3, 2018 (revised on January 22, 2020) which empowers the stock exchanges to levy the fine of Rs. 5000 per day on listed companies for non-compliance with the requirement of SEBI Regulations pertaining to the composition of the Board including failure to appoint a woman director. Accordingly, Stock Exchanges have imposed fines on the listed entities that have not appointed a woman director on their board. Non-payment of such fines will lead to freezing of promoter shareholding. If the non-compliance persists for two consecutive quarters, it will also lead to suspension and initiation of process of compulsory delisting of the non-compliant listed entities.                                                    *****
