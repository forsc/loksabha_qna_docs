At present, Phase-II of FAME India Scheme is being implemented for a period of 5 years w.e.f. 01st April, 2019 with a total budgetary support of Rs. 10,000 crores.

In addition, creation of charging infrastructure is also supported to address range anxiety among users of electric vehicles.Further, following steps have been taken by the Government for adoption of electric vehicles in the country:i.	The demand incentive for electric two wheelers has been increased to Rs. 15,000/KWh from Rs. 10,000/KWh with an increase in cap from 20% to 40% of the cost of vehicle from 11th June, 2021, thus enabling cost of Electric two wheelers at par with that of ICE two wheeler vehicles.-2-ii.	The Government on 12th May, 2021 approved a Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for manufacturing of Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) in the country in order to bring down prices of battery in the country.

The incentive amount is INR 10,000 per kWh of battery capacity for e-3W and e-4W segments, and INR 20,000 per kWh for buses.  The maximum incentive is also capped at 40% of the ex-showroom price for e-buses and 20% for e-3W and e-4W segments.  Further, w.e.f. 11th  June, 2021, demand incentive for e-2W is increased to Rs. 15,000/KWh from Rs. 10,000/KWh with a cap of 40% cost of vehicles.
