                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (SHRI MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a) to (e) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 172* FOR 30TH JULY, 2021(a) to (e) Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yogna (PMSSY) aims to establish All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in all the States in the Country in a phased manner.  Setting up of 22 AIIMS has been sanctioned so far under the Scheme.  Six of the sanctioned AIIMS at Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Jodhpur, Patna, Raipur and Rishikesh are fully functional.  Status in respect of remaining 16, including funds released during the last five years and the current year is at Annexure.	The envisioned facilities at each new AIIMS inter alia include a 960 or 750 bedded hospital (610 beds in case of AIIMS, Raebareli), facilities for teaching in Under Graduate (UG) and Post Graduate (PG) Medical Education and Nursing, 18 Specialty and 17 Super Specialty Departments.	In Maharashtra, One AIIMS at Nagpur has already been sanctioned.  Apart from 22 new AIIMS, which have been sanctioned under PMSSY since its inception, proposals for setting up AIIMS at other places have also been received.  AIIMS are being set up in various parts of the country keeping in view gaps in tertiary healthcare infrastructure in different parts of the country.
