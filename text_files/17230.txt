This is a Central Sector scheme.The scheme provide an insurance cover of Rs. 50 lakh to healthcare providers, including community health workers, who may have to be in direct contact and care of COVID-19 patients and who may be at risk of being impacted by this. It will also include accidental loss of life on account of contracting COVID-19. The insurance provided under this scheme would be over and above any other insurance cover being availed of by the beneficiary.Details of number of persons seeking relief under the “Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Insurance Package” is maintained at national level. The same is placed at Annexure.
