                                                        (a) to (c)  The Indian merchandise trade carried on Indian and foreign vessels during 2017-18 is as under:<pre>Year	Quantity carried on Indian vessels (in thousand MT)	% share	Quantity carried on Foreign vessels (in thousand MT)	% share	Total quantity (in thousand MT)2017-18	69708	7.1%	905834	92.9%	975542                                                         </pre>The growth of Indian fleet has been affected primarily due to lack of long term bankable cargo contracts, higher cost of capital, relatively higher tax incidence and overall global slowdown of shipping industry. (d) Various measures have been taken in recent years to make the shipping industry more attractive and competitive.  These are reduction in GST from 18% to 5% on bunker fuel used in Indian flag vessels; providing cargo support to  Indian shipping industry through Right of First Refusal (RoFR) and policy of Free On Board (FOB) import is being followed for government owned controlled cargoes; allowing shipping enterprises based in India to acquire ships abroad and flag them in the country of their convenience; removal of licensing requirement for chartering of foreign registered ships by citizens of India; encouraging coastal movement of agriculture and other commodities, fertilizer,   EXIM Transshipment Containers and Empty containers etc.                                                ********
