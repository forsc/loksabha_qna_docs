In fact, Government of India has been supplying vaccines free of cost to the States/UTs for administration to prioritized beneficiaries as recommended by NEGVAC. Advance visibility of these allocations i.e. the total doses of vaccine that would be available to a State/UT, is provided to States/UTs 15 days in advance so as to enable States/UTs to plan for acceleration of vaccination coverage while being cognizant of the available vaccines.(d) The Government of India allocates vaccines to States/UTs based on criteria such as pro-rata target population, the progress of vaccination in the State/UT and vaccine wastage.(e) As per the latest Supply Order, Government of India is purchasing Covishield (exclusive of taxes), @ Rs. 205 per dose and Covaxin @ Rs 215 per dose. There is only a marginal difference in the purchase price of the two vaccines for Government of India.(f) The Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Ministry of Science & Technology, is implementing a scheme ‘Mission COVID Suraksha- the Indian COVID-19 Vaccine Development Mission’. Under the Mission, facility augmentation for production of Covaxin is being supported whereby Bharat Biotech and 3 Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) including Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation Ltd, Mumbai; Indian Immunologicals Limited (IIL), Hyderabad; Bharat Immunologicals Biologicals Limited (BIBCOL), Bulandshahr; are being supported.Additionally, technology transfer of Covaxin production to Consortium of partners including Hester Biosciences and OmniBRx Biotechnologies Pvt. Ltd., led by, Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC), Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of Gujarat, is being facilitated by the Department of Biotechnology.
