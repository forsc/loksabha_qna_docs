ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (e): Construction of New/Greenfield airports is not covered under the provision of Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik). Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has approved the proposal on 06 March, 2017 for revival of existing unserved / underserved airports / airstrips of the State Governments, Airports Authority of India and Civil Enclaves at an estimated cost of Rs. 4500 Crore. However, the revival of these unserved/underserved airports is ''demand driven'', depending upon firm commitment from airline operators as well as from the State Government for providing various concessions. ;;Under RCS-UDAN version 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0, 106 airports/waterdromes (76 Unserved, 20 Underserved and 10 waterdromes) and 31 heliports have been awarded. List of such airports/waterdromes and heliports are at Annexure A and B respectively. Out of these, 39 RCS - UDAN Airports (16 underserved & 23 unserved) have been revived/developed for operationalization of RCS flights. The list of these airports is at Annexure C.
