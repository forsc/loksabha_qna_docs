                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF JAL SHAKTI(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) and (b) 	The Government had launched Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) [SBM(G)] with effect from 2nd October, 2014 with the aim to attain Open Defecation Free (ODF) India by 2nd October, 2019 by providing access to toilet facilities to all rural households in the country. SBM(G) is a demand driven Scheme, hence no fixed targets to build/construct toilets could be set.  As per the data reported by the States/UTs on the online Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) maintained by Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation, 10.15 crore individual household latrines (IHHLs) have been constructed under SBM(G), and all the 5,99,963 villages have declared themselves ODF.  The salient features of SBM(G) are:(i)	Emphasis on behaviour change including interpersonal communication; strengthening implementation and delivery mechanisms down to Gram Panchayat level(ii)	Flexibility to States in designing delivery mechanisms taking into account their local culture, practices, sensibilities and demands(iii)	Greater emphasis on capacity building, especially in community approaches and programme management - training of KRCs (Key resource Centres) and involvement of Collectors to provide leadership at the district level(iv)	Programme being run as a citizens’ movement with cooperation of all sections of society including NGOs, corporates, youth etc.(c) 	Funds amounting to Rs.65,892 crore have been spent by the Government of India under SBM(G) since 2014-15. (d) to (f)   Private participation is encouraged through donations made to Swachh Bharat Kosh for construction/reconstruction of toilets in schools and households.  Swachh Bharat Kosh has been set up under the Ministry of Finance to facilitate channelization of philanthropic contributions and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds to achieve the objective of Swachh Bharat.  The details of the donations made towards Swachh Bharat Kosh are not maintained company-wise.
