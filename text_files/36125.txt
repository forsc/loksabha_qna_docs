ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND POWER (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) to (d) Under Off-grid & Decentralized Solar PV Applications Programme Ph-II, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy was providing financial support for installation of solar powered mini-grids in rural areas of the country. Under the programme, solar mini/micro grids of 2299.2 kWp aggregated capacity were installed in 73 villages of the country. State-wise details are given below: State	No. of Solar micro-grids installed	Aggregated Capacity (kWp)Jharkhand	9	210.4Uttar Pradesh	64	2088.8Total	73	2299.2The Ph-II of the Programme was under implementation till 31.3.2017 and considering that Government targeted to electrify all villages in the country under Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) Scheme, the financial support to solar micro-grid was discontinued under Off-grid & Decentralized Solar PV Applications Programme Ph-III. On 28 April, 2018 all the inhabited census villages in the country were declared electrified and under the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana - Saubhagya scheme, as on 31.03.2021 all the States had reported 100% electrification of all the willing un-electrified households identified before 31.03.2019. The households which were earlier not willing to take electricity connections, but later showed willingness, are currently being electrified under Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) Scheme. Considering the above, no separate panel has been instituted or policy framework issued for electrification through solar powered mini grids. (e)&(f) While scaling up the PM-KUSUM Scheme in November, 2020, Government has introduced feeder level solarisation (FLS) as a new variant for solarisation of the existing grid connected agriculture pumps. The FLS guidelines were issued in December, 2020. Based on demand received from the States, a total of 9.25 lakh grid connected agriculture pumps have been sanctioned under the FLS, which are at different stages of implementation by the respective state implementing agencies.*****
