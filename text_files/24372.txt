ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS                                   (SHRI MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a) & (b):  No, Sir. The cost of both patented and generic chemotherapeutics is significantly less in India as compared to most other countries, and efforts to improve affordability have been made.  (c) & (d): The treatment of cancer is multi-modal, incorporating mainly radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery depending on the site and stage of the disease. The rest of cases receive treatment directed towards palliation of symptoms or supportive care. Seventy per cent of all cases, who are treated with curative intent, receive chemotherapy, either primarily or prior to or adjunct to radiation or surgery. Similarly, forty per cent of palliative treatment comprise of chemotherapy. As such, the expenditure incurred by the cancer patients is not just on anti-cancer medicines, but on various treatment procedures. Chemotherapy forms a part of treatment for nearly sixty per cent of cancer patients, often being administered as an adjunct to definitive surgery or radiotherapy.  (e) & (f): National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) under the aegis of the Department of Pharmaceuticals has fixed the ceiling prices of 86 anti-cancer scheduled formulations under the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM), 2015. Further, the NPPA vide order S.O. 1041(E) dated 27th February, 2019 has put a cap on Trade Margins of 42 select non-scheduled anti-cancer medicines under ‘Trade Margin Rationalisation’ Approach. By this approach, the MRP of 526 brands of these medicines have been reduced by up to 90%. This move has resulted in an estimated annual savings of around Rs. 984 cr. to the patients. The details of prices fixed by NPPA are available on the website of the NPPA, i.e., www.nppaindia.nic.in. *****
