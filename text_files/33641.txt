Further, pursuant to the guidelines issued by the NHRC, every death in custody, police or judicial, natural or otherwise, is to be reported to the Commission within 24 hours of its occurrence. The Commission also issued guidelines for video filming of post-mortem and circulated model autopsy form to rule out any negligence/foul play or torture in cases of custodial deaths.
