ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (d)   The Forest Survey of India (FSI), Dehradun, an organization under the Ministry carries  out the assessment of forest cover of the country biennially since 1987 and the findings are published in India State of Forest Report (ISFR). The forest cover assessment is a wall-to-wall mapping exercise based on remote sensing supported by intensive ground verification and field data from National Forest Inventory.As per ISFR 2019, the total forest and tree cover of the country is 8,07,276 square kilometers which is 24.56 % of the geographical area of the country. There is an  increase of 13,209 square kilometer of forest and tree cover at the national level in the ISFR-2019 as compared to the ISFR-2015.   Over the last three decades, FSI has regularly improved methodology for forest cover mapping. Up to the year 1999, the forest cover mapping used to be done largely by visual interpretation method. In the year 2001, a complete switch-over to the digital interpretation based approach was adopted. In the ISFR-2019, significant improvements in methodology of satellite data interpretation for forest cover mapping has been undertaken. However, at present, there is no proposal to conduct survey of forest resources and forest area with the help of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).*********
