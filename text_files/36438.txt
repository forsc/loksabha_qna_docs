ANSWER




                                                        The MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE (SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a) to (d): The primary responsibility of development of infrastructure facilities for judiciary rests with the State Governments. To augment the resources of the State Governments, the Union Government has been implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for Development of Infrastructure Facilities for Judiciary by providing financial assistance to State Governments / UTs in the prescribed fund sharing pattern between Centre and States. The Scheme is being implemented since 1993-94. It covers the construction of court buildings and residential accommodations for Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Judiciary. As on date a sum of Rs. 8758.71 crore has been released under the Scheme so far since its inception, out of which Rs. 5314.40 crore (60.68 %) has been released since 2014-15.  The Scheme has been extended from 2021-22 to 2025-26 with a budgetary outlay of Rs. 9000 crore including Central share of Rs. 5307.00 crore. Besides the construction of Court Halls and Residential Quarters, the Scheme now also covers the construction of Lawyers’ Halls, Digital Computer Rooms and Toilet Complexes in the District and Subordinate Courts.For monitoring the status of the projects under the scheme, three broad monitoring mechanisms have been provided viz. High Court Level Monitoring Committee at State level, Central Level Monitoring Committee in the Department of Justice which are required to meet every six months and Nyaya Vikas Online monitoring system.  For online monitoring of construction projects, a web portal and mobile app named “Nyaya Vikas” was launched in 2018. Geotagging of projects using Nyaya Vikas mobile application has helped better monitoring of the judicial infrastructure projects. The new version of the Mobile App was launched in April 2020 and is more user friendly and runs on iOS phones as well as Android systems. As per information made available by the High Courts against sanctioned strength of 24521 and working strength of 19341 Judicial Officers, 20,812 Court Halls and 18,338 Residential Units are available in the District and Subordinate Courts as on 22.03.2022. Moreover, 2767 Court Halls and 1651 Residential Units are under construction. Of these, 2060 Court Halls and 944 Residential Units were constructed during last three years. The detail of funds released during the last three years is as below:(Rs. in crore)Year	Funds released2018-19	650.002019-20	982.002020-21	593.00********
