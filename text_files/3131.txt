ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS [SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (e)	Government is of the view that the end of the conflict in Sri Lanka provided a unique opportunity to pursue a lasting political settlement, acceptable to all communities in Sri Lanka, including Tamils. We have emphasised to the Sri Lankan Government on the need to take forward the process of broader dialogue with all parties and show concrete movement towards a meaningful devolution of powers, including the implementation of the 13th Amendment. 	Government of India remains engaged with government, political parties and the people of Sri Lanka to take forward the process of national reconciliation and to arrive at a solution that meets the aspirations of the Tamil community for equality, justice, peace and dignity. India has consistently called upon Sri Lanka to fulfill its commitments on addressing the issues related to protecting the interest of Tamils in Sri Lanka.***
