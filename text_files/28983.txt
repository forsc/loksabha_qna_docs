ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) & (b): In the year 2020, the Reassessment Committee of ICAR-IIOPR has conducted a study to assess the potential area of Oilpalm cultivation in the country including North-Eastern States and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. As per the report of Reassessment Committee,  a total 22 States have been identified with 27.99 lakh ha as having a  potential area for Oil Palm cultivation in India. Contd…2/--2-The Reassessment Committee of ICAR-IIOPR, 2020 identified land suitable for oil palm cultivation under irrigated and rainfed condition keeping the various parameters such as Remote Sensing (RS), Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Under irrigated condition, ground water level, rainfall (annual), minimum temperature, Double/Triple cropped areas were taken as key parameters. In case of rainfed category, the five parameters viz; rainfall, minimum temperature, elevation, slope, soil depth, and length of continuous dry period were identified to delineate potential regions.  (c):       Under rainfed conditions, oil palm requires around 1800 mm of rainfall at the rate of 150 mm per month. Even under irrigated conditions, rainfall is considered as an important parameter with 7% weightage since it contributes water supply in lieu of ground water at least during rainy period. As per ICAR-IIOPR,  rainfall suitability classes have been categorized as >1000 mm (highly suitable), 601–1000 (moderately suitable) and <600 mm (Not suitable) based on the IMD rainfall data collected from historical normal (1950-2000) and minimum temperature data of ICAR-CRIDA for the period 1969-2000.	The annual average rainfall recorded in last 5 years in different States is given at Annexure-I. (d):     Under NMEO-OP,  the Government has introduced the concept of a viability price for the price of Fresh Fruit Bunches which shall be the assured returns to the farmers based on a transparent and rational formula.
