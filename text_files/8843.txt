ANSWER




                                                         MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a): 	In wake of ongoing crisis in sugar sector during sugar season 2018-19, vide order S.O. 2347 dated 07.06.2018, the sugar mills were directed to hold such quantity of sugar at the end of each month as prescribed by Central Government. Accordingly, Central Government fixes stockholding limits for every month. These stockholding limits provide level playing field to all the mills, prevent over supply of sugar in domestic market, thereby maintaining demand-supply balance and help in arresting the slide in sugar prices.  (b) & (c): 	Yes.  The monthly limit of sugar sale for each mill is determined based on a very well defined and uniform criteria.  As such, providing any special dispensation to mills in Tamil Nadu does not appear feasible, in the present circumstances.****
