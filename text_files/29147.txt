                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b): 	Yes Sir. It was informed that the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) provides for coverage of upto 75% of the rural and 50% of the urban population, at the all India level, for receiving highly subsidized foodgrains. Corresponding to this coverage, State/UT-wise percentage coverage was determined by the then Planning Commission (Now NITI Aayog), using 68th round of NSSO Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (2011-12). Further, Section 9 of the NFSA provides that the percentage coverage under the Targeted Public Distribution System in rural and urban areas for each State shall be determined by the Central Government and the total number of persons to be covered in the State shall be calculated on the basis of the population estimates as per the census of which the relevant figures have been published. Therefore, any revision in the coverage under the NFSA shall be possible only after the relevant data of next population Census is published. As the criteria for determination of State/UT-wise coverage is uniformly applicable for all the States/UTs, it is not possible to revise the coverage of a particular State/UTs. (c) & (d): 	Yes Sir. Food Corporation of India procures, distributes and stores rice in only two category that is "Rice Grade A & Rice Common" based on length and breadth ratio as per specifications communicated by Department of Food & Public Distribution.*****
