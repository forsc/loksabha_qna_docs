ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER FOR MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ANDMINISTRY OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a)	To demarcate the earthquake prone zones, Bureau of Indian Standards [IS-1893 (Part-1): 2002], based on scientific inputs like past intensity records and ground motions from a number of agencies, has grouped the country into four seismic zones viz. Zone-II, III, IV and V. Of these, Zone V is the most seismically active region, while zone II is the least. The State-wise details of earthquake prone regions in the country on the basis of seismic zonation map is provided below:Zone V 	Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rann of Kutch in Gujarat, part of North Bihar and Andaman & Nicobar islands.Zone IV	remaining parts of Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, Union Territory of Delhi, Sikkim,  northern part of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal, parts of Gujarat and small portions of Maharashtra near the west coast and Rajasthan.Zone III	Kerala, Goa, Lakshadweep islands, remaining parts of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and West Bengal, parts of Punjab, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhatisgarh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamilnadu and Karnataka.Zone II	Parts of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, Parts of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala.The number of earthquakes that occurred in the country during the last three years (July 16 to June 19), State/UT-wise are given in Annexure I.(b)	& (c) 	Studies by the scientists show that the main cause of earthquakes in Indian regions are due to Indian plate motion towards northeast direction at a rate of about 52 mm/year and its collision with Eurasian plate in the north and with Sunda plate in the east. The relative convergence of 14-20 mm/year in the Himalaya causes strain accumulation, which is released episodically during the earthquakes. The strain accumulation is faster in the collision plate boundaries as compared to the stable continent regions. Based on the studies related to the strain accumulation and crustal deformation, the occurrences of major earthquakes in Himalayan regions are suspected by scientists. Ministry of Earth Sciences has given many projects to various institutes in the country to study the earthquake processes. (d)  	As a part of its mandate, National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) laid down the National Policy on Disaster Management (NPDM) in 2009 which is applicable for all disasters including earthquake. It portrays a paradigm shift from erstwhile ‘Response-Centric’ approach to the holistic management of disasters with emphasis on Prevention, Preparedness and Mitigation. Other details are enclosed at Annexure II.
