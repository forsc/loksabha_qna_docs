ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) & (b) Command Area Development & Water Management (CADWM) scheme was started as a centrally sponsored scheme in the year 1974-75 with the objective to bridge the gap between irrigation potential created and utilized. Subsequently, from 2015-16 onwards, the scheme has been brought under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY). With the new scheme of prioritized Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Sinchayee Yojana (AIBP) projects approved in July 2016, central assistance under CADWM has been restricted to these prioritized projects only. Thus, 88 projects (including 1 project for non-structural intervention) have been included under PMKSY-CADWM, targeting additional culturable command area (CCA) of 45 lakh hectares, for the total estimated cost of Rs 18,736 crore with targeted central assistance (CA) of Rs.8,236 crore.However, none of the above projects has its command in Misrikh Parliamentary constituency of Uttar Pradesh.(c)  The details of the central fund allocated, and expenditure incurred (including central assistance released under the scheme) during each of the last three years, State-wise, is given at Annexure-I & II, respectively. However, CADWM scheme is not individual beneficiary oriented, due to which information on number of beneficiaries is not available. ***** ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY OF PART (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.†1900 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 09/12/2021 REGARDING “WORK UNDER CADWM”.Central Assistance ReleasedSr. No.	Name of the State/ UT	Central Assistance released(Rs. in crore)		2018-19	2019-20	2020-21	Total1	Andhra Pradesh	69.18	0.00	0.00	69.182	Assam	3.55	0.00	4.00	7.553	Bihar	14.42	0.00	0.00	14.424	Chhattisgarh	9.93	0.00	0.00	9.935	Goa	0.00	0.00	3.84	3.846	Gujarat	347.04	0.00	0.00	347.047	Jammu & Kashmir	1.70	0.00	1.87	3.578	Jharkhand	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.009	Karnataka	13.49	3.79	11.34	28.6210	Kerala	0.00	0.00	2.69	2.6911	Madhya Pradesh	70.91	0.00	43.32	114.2312	Maharashtra	25.79	0.00	46.23	72.0213	Manipur	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.0014	Odisha	3.65	0.00	34.47	38.1215	Punjab	0.00	0.00	18.08	18.0816	Rajasthan	7.43	10.22	31.26	48.9117	Telangana	26.12	0.00	0.00	26.1218	Uttar Pradesh	0.00	150	6.00	156.00Total	593.21	164.01	203.10	960.32 ANNEXURE-IIANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY OF PART (c) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.†1900 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 09/12/2021 REGARDING “WORK UNDER CADWM” .Expenditure IncurredSr. No.	Name of the State/ UT	Expenditure incurred(Rs. in crore)		2018-19	2019-20	2020-21	Total1	Andhra Pradesh	0.00	0.00	0.92	0.922	Assam	13.20	5.89	11.75	30.843	Bihar	17.55	10.38	12.69	40.624	Chhattisgarh	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.005	Goa	9.09	10.96	4.31	24.366	Gujarat	861.68	60.69	25.29	947.667	Jammu & Kashmir	3.35	0.00	3.16	6.508	Jharkhand	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.009	Karnataka	40.29	17.78	17.38	75.4510	Kerala	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.0011	Madhya Pradesh	120.51	53.41	40.11	214.0412	Maharashtra	116.75	66.93	87.16	270.8413	Manipur	0.00	0.00	15.82	15.8214	Odisha	109.37	62.74	23.46	195.5715	Punjab	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.0016	Rajasthan	14.85	22.17	21.90	58.9217	Telangana	0.00	5.22	0.00	5.2218	Uttar Pradesh	0.00	0.00	0.47	0.47Total	1306.64	316.17	264.42	1,887.23*****
