ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a): Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), the regulatory authority for civil aviation security in the country, has issued an Aviation Security (AVSEC) Circular dated 08.04.2019 according to which, body scanners shall be installed at all airports at Pre-embarkation security check points in a phased manner, replacing all Door Frame Metal Detectors (DFMDs) but not hand held scanners. ;Of the passengers cleared by the body scanner system, 10% shall be randomly searched. The physical search will include a pat down search. Also, any person who refuses to go through body scanners shall be subjected to the pat down search invariably. At least, one set of DFMD shall be maintained for screening of passengers with medical conditions. ;(b): The issue of privacy of passengers has been taken into consideration by the Technical Committee of BCAS at the time of framing the technical requirements. As per the technical specifications, the Body Scanner System shall provide automatic detection over the skin with image free solution using a generic mannequin. Threats shall be graphically presented on the generic mannequin so that security staff can tell the location of these objects for targeted search. However, if a person/lady with medical conditions expresses concerns, he/she may request a physical search in lieu of a search using detection systems such as Hand Held Metal Detector (HHMD), Walk Through Metal Detector (WTMD) or body scanners. In such a case, private screening is arranged. ;(c): BCAS has fixed timeline effective from 08.04.2019 as one year for implementation of Body Scanner System at hypersensitive and sensitive airports and two years for other airports.
