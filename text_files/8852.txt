ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) & (b): 	Incidents of kidnapping of women and adolescent girls and their trafficking to gulf countries on a large scale have not come to the notice of the Government of India. Occasionally, reports from Indian Missions abroad indicate that some Indian women seek overseas employment, particularly in Gulf countries,  without  obtaining  Emigration  Clearance  (EC)  as   per   provisions   of --2--LS.US.Q.NO. 2317 FOR 03.12.2019Emigration Act, 1983. Such women become vulnerable to various employment related problems. (c) to (e): As and when, Indian Missions/Posts receive such complaints from women workers in distress, the Missions take immediate action to redress their grievances with Foreign Employers, Labour Department/Local Government Authorities. The Ministry of External Affairs has already put in place various measures to safeguard and regulate emigration of Indian women workers, holding Emigration Check Required (ECR) passports, for overseas employment in ECR countries including Gulf countries. Furthermore, to address the issue of cross-border trafficking, the Ministry of Home Affairs has taken the following steps: (i) India has signed bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for Prevention of Human Trafficking with United Arab Emirates, Bangladesh and Cambodia. The MoUs aim to enhance bilateral cooperation on the issue of prevention, rescue, recovery and repatriation related to human trafficking, especially women and children. --3--LS.US.Q.NO. 2317 FOR 03.12.2019(ii) India has ratified the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organized Crime (UNCTOC) in 2011 and its Protocols namely (a) Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children and (b) Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air. (iii) MHA has issued various advisories to the States and UTs from time to time on preventing and combating human trafficking. These advisories are available at MHA’s website: www.mha.gov.in. *****
