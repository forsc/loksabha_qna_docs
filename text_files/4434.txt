JITENDRA SINGH)(a) to (c):  A number of steps have been taken in the recent years to streamline and strengthen the pension sanctioning and payment system. Department of Pension & Pensioners’ Welfare launched Bhavishya – an online tracking system for pension sanction and payment. By keeping track of the progress as well as close monitoring   of each pension case, it introduces transparency and accountability into the system thereby plugging delays. This system is at present being successfully implemented in the main Secretariat of 93 Ministries/Departments including 791 Attached Offices. The following measures have been taken by various departments/ agencies to strengthen the redressal system in respect of pension related grievances:1)	Department of Pension & Pensioners’ Welfare (DoPPW) w.r.t. Central Government Civil Pensioners: •	CPENGRAMS is a Centralized Web-enabled Pension Grievance Redress and Monitoring System which was started in 2007 for speedy redressal and effective monitoring of pension related grievances of pensioners. •	It has the following facilities: -?	Registration of pension grievances available 24*7 basis?	Forwarding of reminders to the concerned Ministries/Departments ?	Enquiry on status of registered grievance?

This has led to faster processing of payment of pension and clerical errors have been reduced.•	Web Responsive Pensioners’ Service (WRPS) is an IT initiative of CPAO for the pensioners which provides various services including pension payment information for last 24 months, online pension process tracking & online grievance registration and redressal with facility to track the status of grievance. 3)	Controller General of Defence Accounts (CGDA) w.r.t. Defence Pensioners:•	A dedicated Call centre in PCDA(P), Allahabad has been established with Toll free number 1800-180-5325 where ex-servicemen can get their queries resolved over the phone.•	Pension enquiry system named Project “Suvigya” is available on the Internet which enables pensioner to check their entitlements.•	In order to expedite redressal of grievance of Defence Pensioners, DPDOs hold Defence Pension Adalats on last working day of each month.•	Implementation of digitally signed e-PPOs for all categories of Pensioners which eliminates the time taken for dispatch and possibility of loss in transit.4)	Department of Telecommunication w.r.t  Telecom Pensioners:•	Toll Free Number (18004250089) is available during working hours for lodging grievances.•	Quarterly Pension Adalat is conducted for all Telecom pensioners in Kerala and the same is publicized widely to reach all Telecom pensioners.•	Grievances raised in CPGRAMS Portal are addressed within 30 days.5)	Department of Posts w.r.t Postal pensioners:•	Pension disbursement has been automated which obviates the possibility of any grievances.•	The pensioners may approach at Post Office level, Division/Regional Office/PMG/CPMG level and Postal Directorate level to solve their problems. •	Pension Adalats are also being organized time to time at circle/state level for redressal of grievances of pensioners.Contd.P.-3/--3-6)	Ministry of Rural Development w.r.t. National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP):•	National Social Assistance Programme(NSAP) is a social welfare/ social security scheme, implemented in rural as well as urban areas of the Country. The schemes of NSAP are only applicable to the persons belonging to Below Poverty Line(BPL) households. The identification of beneficiaries, sanction and disbursement of pensions are made  by the States/UTs.  The NSAP Guidelines provides for setting up of grievance redressal system at the Gram / Intermediate Panchayat / District / Municipality levels, and designate an officer of appropriate seniority to whom the grievances can be addressed along with the timelines for dealing with grievances under intimation to the complainant.
