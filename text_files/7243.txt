National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bangalore, Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi and Lokopriya Gopinath Bordoloi Regional Institute of Mental Health, Tezpur, Assam. With a view to further increase mental healthcare facilities in the country, Department of Psychiatry has been set up in each of the 6 newly established All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and similar provision has been made in the upcoming 15 new AIIMS. Similarly, many other Central as well as State Government hospitals also have Psychiatry Departments.
