ANSWER




(a)       As per recently conducted National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-V (2019-21), 57 percent of the women (15-49 years) are estimated to be anaemic. (b)       Yes, Sir. The Ministry of Women and Child Development implements Centrally Sponsored Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) w.e.f. 01.01.2017. As on 22.11.2021, maternity benefits of ?9420.58 crores (including Central and State share) have been disbursed amongst more than 2.17 crores eligible beneficiaries under PMMVY since inception of the scheme. The State/UT-wise details of number of beneficiaries enrolled, number of beneficiaries paid maternity benefits and total amount disbursed under PMMVY are at Annexure-I. The Ministry of Women and Child Development does not maintain Constituency-wise data of beneficiaries under PMMVY. However, District-wise, number of beneficiaries enrolled and total amount disbursed since inception of the scheme and till 22.11.2021 in respect of Uttar Pradesh is at Annexure-II.  (c)       Yes, Sir. Disbursement of maternity benefits of ?5,000/- to the eligible beneficiaries under PMMVY has been continuing since inception of the scheme including the period of COVID-19 pandemic.  The eligible beneficiaries receive cash incentive totalling to ?5,000/- directly in their Bank/Post Office accounts linked to their Aadhaar numbers in Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode in three installments. (d)       The funds are released to the States/UTs on the basis of indicative targets and utilisation of released funds. The year-wise and State/UT-wise details of funds sanctioned/ released under PMMVY and utilisation reported by States/UTs, including for the North Eastern Region, are at Annexure-III. (e)       The State/UT-wise, including North Eastern Region, number of beneficiaries enrolled since inception of the scheme and till 22.11.2021 is at Annexure-I. (f)        The PMMVY is reviewed periodically through video conferences, meetings and workshops with States/UTs for its successful implementation. The operational difficulties faced by the States/UTs in implementation of the scheme, as and when reported, are addressed through mutual/technical discussions and handholding. The Ministry also celebrates ‘Matru Vandana Saptah’ every year to intensify implementation of the scheme and create a healthy competition amongst States/UTs. States/UTs undertake various IEC and Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) activities such as, prabhat pheri, nukkad natak, newspaper advertisement, airing radio jingles, selfie campaign, door to door campaign, community programmes at field functionary levels etc to expedite implementation of PMMVY.****** Annexure-IStatement referred to in reply to part (b) and (e) of the Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 942 for answer on 03.12.2021 raised by Shri Malook Nagar, Shri Benny Behanan, Shri Arun Kumar Sagar, Shri Ashok Kumar Rawat, Shri K.
