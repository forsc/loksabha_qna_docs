ANSWER




                                                        Minister of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Jyotiraditya M. Scindia)(a) to (c): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.; Statement referred in the reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 29 for 03.02.2022 regarding "Flight from Bhavnagar to Delhi";;  (a) to (c): Yes, Sir, the flight operated from Bhavnagar to Delhi by scheduled domestic airline namely M/s SpiceJet has been discontinued effective 30.11.2021. However, the same airline is operating a connecting flight on the route Bhavnagar-Delhi via Mumbai effective 01.12.2021. Further, after repeal of the Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation market has been deregulated. Consequently, airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type for selecting whatever markets and network they wish to operate across the country. Thus, it is up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and their commercial viability, in compliance with the extant relevant guidelines in this regard.
