ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b)Yes, there was a considerable decline in the total traffic, containers traffic and other than containers traffic in March, April, May, June, July and August, 2020 as compared to the corresponding months in 2019.  COVID 19 impact at Major Ports started from March 2020.  The details of loss in terms of traffic (container and other than container) due to COVID 19 impact on ports are annexed. However, the recovery has started since June 20.(c)	Ministry of Shipping has issued necessary directions from time to time  to all ports to put in place a screening, detection and quarantine system for disembarking Seafarer or cruise passengers, to obtain self-declaration from arriving crews/passengers, to install thermal scanners and procure Personal Protection Equipment(PPE) readiness, N-95 masks, create awareness among the travelers at Ports and Port officials. Further, Major ports under the administrative control of Ministry of Shipping have taken several steps like formation of SoP for disease surveillance/Vessel and crew/passenger management, thermal scanning while moving outside port prohibited area, isolation wards at port hospitals.  Further, various advisories/circulars were issued to provide relief to the trade in terms of non-charging of  demurrage and other penalties/charges. Various technological/digital inductions were expedited to maintain smooth functioning without human interference viz, E-invoice, E-payment, E-DO and E-BoL at PCS1x.AnnexureDetails of loss in terms of traffic(container and other than container) due to COVID 19 impact on ports<pre>Period	Total Traffic during month	Containers Traffic	Traffic Other than Container 	(In 000 Tonnes)	% Var. w.r.t. prev. year	Tonnage(000 Tonnes)	% Var. w.r.t. prev. year	TEUs(In 000)	% Var. w.r.t. prev. year	(In 000 Tonnes)	% Var. w.r.t. prev. yearJanuary’20	61344	1.79	12913	3.84	860	2.14	48431	1.25January’19	60268		12435		842		47833	February’20	57233	4.58	11791	1.24	802	1.01	45442	5.48February’19	54729		11647		794		43082	March’20	61120	-5.25	12006	-10.46	790	-12.51	49114	-3.89March’19	64510		13408		903		51102	April’20	47422	-21.08	8306	-33.79	542	-36.98	39116	-17.72April’19	60086		12545		860		47541	May’20	45399	-23.25	8497	-34.08	563	-35.58	36902	-20.23May’19	59151		12890		874		46261	June’20	49053	-14.64	9549	-22.19	640	-23.63	39504	-12.59June’19	57466		12272		838		45194	July’20	51454	-13.23	11464	-13.02	751	-15.24	39990	-13.29July’19	59300		13180		886		46120	August’20	51611	-10.23	11460	-8.79	762	-13.80	40151	-10.63August’19	57494		12565		884		44929                                                                     </pre>	                                                      *****
