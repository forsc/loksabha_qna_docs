ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (g)  Ministry of Tribal Affairs through its programmes of Special Central Assistance (SCA) to Tribal Sub Scheme (TSS) and Grants under Article 275 (1) of the Constitution of India provides block grants to State Governments to address need of critical gaps as an additive to main vehicle i.e. Tribal Sub Plan. However, the identification of gaps in States is the responsibility of the concerned State Government and every State formulates a comprehensive perspective Plan taking into consideration all available resources of funding to serve as a road map for implementation. This perspective Plan is customized into doable Annual Action Plans and thus the Annual Plan documents are prepared taking into account the fund available under State Plan, Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes in respect of the State.   Funds are released against the approved activities and are utilized for economic development of ITDP, ITDA, MADA, Clusters and dispersed tribal population. These agencies function under overall control of the State Governments. Respective State Government earmarks financial assistance to ITDAs for implementation of various programmes/ interventions. Details of welfare measures taken up by ITDA/ ITDP/ MADA/ Clusters etc. are not centrally maintained in the Ministry.  Under both the schemes mentioned above, 100% grant is provided by the Ministry to the concerned State Governments. Funds are released to State Governments based on the projects approved by Project Appraisal Committee (PAC) and submission of required documents by State Governments such as Utilization Certificate (UC), Physical progress report etc. Details of item/district-wise and block wise development are maintained at State level. However, the details of fund released and utilization reported by the State of Madhya Pradesh under Article 275(1) and SCA to TSS during the last three years is as under:(Rs. in lakh) Year	Article 275(1) of the Constitution	SCA to TSS	Fund released	UC received	Fund released	UC received2017-18	22399.48	20219.00	22828.70	18572.212018-19	24635.30	13142.13	16968.97	12604.002019-20	44938.92	19280.22	13415.25	8617.10 (h)  Utilization of funds and submissions of UC thereof by the concerned state is a continuous process as per pace of implementation of the project.  However, this Ministry adjusts the amount of outstanding UC with the amount being released to the State and adjusted amount is released only after submission of UC by the concerned State Governments.  *****
