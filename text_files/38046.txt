ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation has considered/examined the Dr. Mihir Shah Committee report of 2016. Based on the report submitted by Dr. Mihir Shah Committee, various Committees, including that of Indian Institute of Management, Ahmadabad and a high level group comprising Chairman, Central Water Commission (CWC) and Chairman, Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), have been constituted.(b) & (c) Water being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation and efficient management of water resources are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments. In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Central Government provides technical and financial assistance to them through various schemes and programmes.As per the National Commission on Integrated Water Resources Development (NCIWRD) Report-1999, water requirement of the country for high demand scenario for the year 2050 is 1,180 BCM.As per the study titled “Reassessment of Water Availability in India using Space Inputs, 2019”, the average annual water resources availability in the country is assessed as 1,999.20 BCM. It is estimated that owing to topographic, hydrological and other constraints, the utilizable water is 1,126 BCM which comprises 690 BCM of surface water and 436 BCM of replenishable ground water.The Government of India formulated a National Perspective Plan (NPP) of Interlinking of Rivers (ILR) for transferring water from surplus basins to deficit basins/areas in 1980. National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component and 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports/ Detailed Project Reports under Inter-linking of Rivers Project. However, river interlinking projects are largely dependent on consensus on water sharing between participating States. Government of India, in partnership with States, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) to make provision of potable tap water supply to every rural household of the country at the service level of 55 litre per capita per day by 2024.Government of India has launched AMRUT 2.0 on 1st October, 2021 for a period of 5 years (FY 2021- 22 to 2025-26), with the objective of providing universal coverage of water supply through functional household tap connections in all statutory towns in the country. AMRUT 2.0 focuses on making cities water secure through recycle/reuse of treated sewage, rejuvenation of water bodies and water conservation. Hon’ble Prime Minister launched the “Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain” (JSA:CTR) with the theme “Catch the Rain - Where it Falls When it Falls” on 22nd March 2021, the World Water Day, to cover all the blocks of all districts (rural as well as urban areas) across the country during 22nd March, 2021 to 30th November, 2021 - the pre-monsoon and monsoon period. JSA:CTR campaign had five focused interventions- (1) rainwater harvesting & water conservation (2) enumerating, geo-tagging & making inventory of all water bodies; preparation of scientific plans for water conservation (3) setting up Jal Shakti Kendras in all districts (4) intensive afforestation and (5) awareness generation. Jal Shakti Abhiyan for 2022 has been launched by Hon''ble President of India on 29th March, 2022. During 2016-17, ninety-nine (99) on-going major/medium irrigation projects in the country having balance estimated cost of Rs.77,595 crore under PMKSY-Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) have been prioritised, in consultation with States, for completion in phases. The Command Area Development & Water Management (CADWM) Programme has been brought under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) – Har Khet Ko Pani from 2015-16 onwards. The main objective of taking up CAD works is to enhance utilization of irrigation potential created, and improve agriculture production on a sustainable basis through Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM). Implementation of PMKSY-AIBP and CAD&WM during 2021-26 has been approved by the Government of India with the central assistance of Rs. 23,918 crore.  Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare is implementing "Per Drop More Crop" component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) which is operational from 2015-16 in the India. The PMKSY- "Per Drop More Crop" mainly focuses on water use efficiency at farm level through micro irrigation (drip and sprinkler irrigation system). ‘Sahi Fasal’ campaign was launched by National Water Mission (NWM) on 14.11.2019 to nudge farmers in the water stressed areas to grow crops which use water very efficiently, are economically remunerative, are healthy and nutritious, suited to the agro-climatic-hydro characteristics of the area, and are environment friendly. Government of India is implementing Atal Bhujal Yojana, a central sector scheme, in 8,774 gram panchayats of 81 districts of seven States namely Haryana, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The focus of the scheme is on community participation and demand side intervention for sustainable ground water management in identified water stressed areas. National Aquifer Mapping and Management program (NAQUIM) is being implemented by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) as part of Ground Water Management and Regulation (GWM&R) scheme, a central sector scheme. NAQUIM envisages mapping of aquifers (water bearing formations), their characterization and development of Aquifer Management Plans to facilitate sustainable management of groundwater resources in the country. NAQUIM outputs are shared with States/UTs for suitable interventions. (d) The Ministry of Jal Shakti has been formed by the Government of India by integrating the erstwhile Ministry of Water Resources River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation and the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, with an aim to integrate water resources management under one umbrella so that the issues relating to water are dealt with in a holistic manner. *****
