In the latest Doing Business Report (DBR), 2020 released by the World Bank on 24th October, 2019, India stands at 63rd position out of 190 countries, registering a jump of 14 places from its last year’s rank. The details are at Annexure. Under Ease of Doing Business initiative, business processes are made simpler through which informal sectors are formalized. These efforts attract investments from other countries which in turn lead to more jobs in the country. (e): 	India’s rank in the indicators Paying Taxes, Starting a Business, Registering Property and Enforcing Contracts need further improvement. Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is closely working with the concerned Ministries/Departments and Governments of Maharashtra and NCT of Delhi to implement the reforms and improve the ranking in these indicators.(f): 	The Union Government has been working in unison with the Governments of Maharashtra and NCT of Delhi in implementing the reforms and improve the rankings. The reform measures to be implemented in all the sectors related to the Govt. of Maharashtra and NCT of Delhi has been shared with them. The response has been forthcoming which can be seen from the fact that India recorded highest improvement (67 rank) in 3 years by any large country since 2011. India has also been recognized in top ten countries with most reforms undertaken for 3 consecutive years under Doing Business 2020.(g) & (h): 	Yes, Sir. DPIIT has, in coordination with Central Ministries/Departments and Governments of States/UTs, taken several steps to improve regulatory environment in India during last three years with an aim to bring India within top 50 ranks. Several business regulatory processes have been streamlined across the business lifecycle. As a result of the efforts made by the Government, India has improved its rank from 77th in DBR, 2019 to 63rd in DBR, 2020, with an improvement of 14 ranks during the last year.*******
