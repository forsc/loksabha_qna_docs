M/o RT&H and its implementing agencies have initiated action to take up measures for resolution of stuck projects within the framework of these guiding principles. (c) to (f) As per Policy Guidelines: The term “Stuck Project” as used, means a project undertaken by the MoRTH through NHAI, NHIDCL or State PWD (i.e. the “Authority”) where the work has stopped due to(i) inability of the Contractor/Concessionaire to continue with the execution of the project on account of proceedings initiated against it before the NCLT under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 or under Section 241(2) of the Companies Act, 2013; or (ii) default (consecutive or simultaneous) on account of both the parties i.e. the NHAI/NHIDCL/State PWD and the Contractor/Concessionaire. Process for revival of stuck projects has been initiated. However, there is no case settled so far.  *****
