                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) :		No Sir, there is no increase in the cost of power generation due to loss/wastage of electricity during Transmission and Distribution (T&D), as Transmission and Distribution are downstream of Generation in the power sector value chain.(b) :		The 5 year details of Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses of electricity in the country, Company and State-wise are enclosed as Annexure.(c) :		There are several reasons for Aggregate and Commercial losses, which include Overloaded Lines/Transformers etc., use of equipment like lines/transformers having high technical losses by design, Low Power Factor, Low HT/LT Ratio, lengthy lines, faulty Meters(Slow/Not working), power theft, billing inefficiencies, collection Issues like inadequate modes/ inconvenient collection timings etc.(d) :		The responsibility for reduction of AT&C losses in the Distribution network rests with the State Power Departments/Utilities. However, Government of India has launched various schemes such as Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), National Electricity Fund(NEF) and Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY) to enable States to improve their Distribution infrastructure systems so that energy loss including those due to pilferage are reduced. Under IPDS/DDUGJY schemes, central funding is being provided for strengthening of sub-transmission and distribution networks in the urban & rural areas and metering of distribution transformers/feeders/ consumers for reduction of AT&C losses. Funds have also been sanctioned under IPDS for Under Ground (UG) cabling and Aerial Bunched (AB) cables, Smart Metering & IT enablement of Distribution Infrastructure for improvements in billing & collection as well as for reduction of pilferage.(e) :		The Government and various Public Sector undertakings have taken several measures to encourage research and development in the Power Sector; which include NTPC Ltd. assigning 1% of its Profit after Tax(PAT) for R&D, POWERGRID Ltd. (PGCIL) successfully establishing a 1200 kV UHVAC National Test Station at Bina and commissioning 1200kV single and double circuit transmission line sections along with associated 1200 kV bays as a pilot project; and, development of POWERGRID Advanced Research & Technology Centre (PARTec).  On the Distribution Sector front, POWERGRID has developed Smart Grid Knowledge Center which aims to bring awareness on the applications of Smart Grid technologies and its demonstration. The Central Power and Research Institute (CPRI) promotes applied research leading to technology development in the power sector through R&D under National Perspective Plan(NPP); Research Scheme on Power (RSoP); and, In-House R&D (IHRD).                                            ************
