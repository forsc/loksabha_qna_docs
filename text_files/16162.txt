Direct TaxesThe process of easing of tax rules is a continuous process. Some of the recent measures taken for simplification of Income Tax Act, 1961 are as under:(A) 	The Income-tax Act, 1961 (the Act) provides for several exemptions and deductions from the total income which is chargeable to income-tax. In this regard, in order to simplify the tax regime and lower the rates of taxes, it is the stated policy of the Government to remove deductions and exemptions while simultaneously rationalizing the tax rates. It may be noted that the erstwhile Finance Minister while presenting the Union budget for financial year (FY) 2015-16 stated that the deductions and incentives given to corporate taxpayers under the Act will be phased out over four years while simultaneously reducing the tax rates Further, the Finance Act, 2016, inter-alia, provided a sunset date for the existing profit linked deductions under the various provisions of the Act. Hence, the stated policy of the Government is to phase out exemptions and deductions while simultaneously reducing tax rates.(ii)      In relation to the above, the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019 (TLAA), inter-alia, amended the Act by inserting new section 115BAA to the Act which provides an option to the existing domestic companies to pay tax at rate of 22% subject to certain conditions including that they do not avail of any specified incentives or deductions.  Further, the TLAA also inserted section 115BAB to the Act which provides an option to new manufacturing domestic companies, set up on or after 01.10.2019 engaged in the manufacture or production of article or thing or research or distribution in relation thereto and which commence manufacturing or production by 31.03.2023, to pay tax at a reduced rate of 15 % subject to certain conditions including that they do not avail of any specified incentives or deductions. The companies opting for the concessional tax regime will also not be required to pay Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT).(B)	In addition to the above provisions, Finance Bill, 2020 (the Bill), inter-alia, proposes several measures for simplification of the provisions of the Act as under:(i)     In order to simplify the taxation regime for individuals and Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), the Bill proposes to amend the Act to provide an option to individuals and HUF to opt for a simplified tax structure under which such person can pay tax at lower rates if they do not avail specified exemptions/deductions.(ii)      In order to help small and medium enterprises, the Bill proposes to raise the turnover threshold for compulsory tax audit from existing Rs. 1 crore to Rs. 5 crore in case where cash receipt is not more than 5% of total receipt and cash payment is not more than 5% of total payments.
