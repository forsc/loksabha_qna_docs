                                                                   THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                    (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a)	to (c): ‘Land’ and ‘Colonization’ are State subjects. Therefore, the respective States/Union Territories (UTs) addresses the housing needs of their population. However, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, under the  vision  of  ‘Housing for All’,  is  supplementing   the efforts of States/ UTs by providing Central Assistance under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U), for construction of houses for all eligible families/ beneficiaries since 25.06.2015. Eligible beneficiaries can avail the benefit of PMAY-U through four verticals, i.e. Beneficiary-led Construction or enhancement (BLC); Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP); ‘In-Situ’ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) and Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS). Under PMAY-U, States/ UTs prepare project proposals based on the housing requirements in urban areas taking into account the resources available with them and submit such proposals to this Ministry for release of admissible Central Assistance. Completion of projects generally takes 12-18 months under BLC vertical and 24-36 months under AHP vertical of the Scheme.  Accordingly, based on the proposals received under different components of PMAY-U, 115.48lakh houses have been sanctioned so far. Of the sanctioned houses, 95.13 lakh houses have been grounded for construction; of which 56.33 lakh houses have been completed and 51.72 lakh houses have been occupied by the identified beneficiaries; State/ UT-wise details of which along with details of Central Assistance approved, released and utilized under BLC, AHP, ISSR and CLSS components of PMAY-U are at Annexure I,II,III and IV. All States/ UTs have been advised to complete construction of all houses and allot them as pertime frame stipulated in respective Detailed Project Reports (DPRs). ******
