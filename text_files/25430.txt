So far, the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan for nation-wide portability National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013 ration cards empowering all NFSA beneficiaries, particularly migrant beneficiaries, to lift  their entitled quota of subsidised foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) of choice in the country by using their same existing ration card with biometric authentication on an electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) device, is enabled in 33 States/UTs, covering almost 86.7% NFSA population (about 69 Crore NFSA beneficiaries) in the country. Delhi being the latest to enable the same from July 2021. Further, regular follow up has been done with 3 remaining States/UT of Assam, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal to enable the ONORC plan for the benefit of migrant NFSA beneficiaries.(b) & (c): 	Under NFSA, the coverage of eligible beneficiaries/ households is delinked from the erstwhile poverty estimates and has been linked to population estimates. Accordingly, it provides coverage for maximum of 81.35 Crore persons, nearly two-third of the country population as per census of 2011, to receive the benefit of highly subsidised foodgrains. Further, NFSA is operated in joint responsibilities of the Central and State/UT Governments, wherein inter-alia the operational responsibilities for the identification of eligible beneficiaries/ households, issuance of ration cards to them as per own norms and procedures rests with the respective State/UT governments. ***
