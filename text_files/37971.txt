ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(DR. SUBHAS SARKAR)(a) to (c) National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 unequivocally endorses and envisions a substantial increase in public investment in education both by the Central Government and all State Governments. It states that the Centre and States work together to increase the public investment in Education sector to reach 6% of GDP at the earliest. Accordingly, Ministry has written to all its implementing agencies, regulatory bodies, State/UT Governments, other stakeholder Ministries/Departments, etc for taking steps for implementation of NEP 2020. As per the latest figures of Analysis of Budgeted Expenditure on Education, there has been a significant increase of 53% and 59.3% in Public Expenditure on Education incurred by States/UTs and Centre respectively in 2019-20 compared to 2015-16. The increase is seen in Centre and almost all the States during the period 2015-16 to 2019-20. The Centre and State-wise Expenditure for the five years i.e. from 2015-16 to 2019-20 is available at https://www.education.gov.in/en/parl_ques.(d)	& (e) The major objective of the Education Sector is the holistic development for students including cognitive capabilities, literacy and creative potential, for which primary resource is the human resource, i.e. Teacher.  The Education Sector is powered and driven by the teachers, professors etc.  The National Education Policy 2020 also recognizes the teacher as the centre of the fundamental reform in the education system and envisages re-establishing and empowered teachers, at all levels, as the most respected and essential members of our society, because they truly shape our next generation of students. So allocation on salaries is naturally expected in education sector.  The details of Total Budget Allocation and Expenditure in respect of the Budget Head Grants-in-aid-General (OH-31) and Grants-in-aid-Salaries (OH-36) is given in the table below: <pre>(Rs. In Crores)Details of Budget Allocation and Expenditure-Ministry of EducationFinancial year	Total Budget Allocation	Expenditure under Grant-in-aid-General and Grant-in-aid-salaries2016-17	72394.00	60013.162017-18	79685.95	64783.512018-19	85010.29	68295.212019-20	94853.64	77319.312020-21	99311.52	75342.382021-22*	93224.31	69786.21*Actuals as on 31.03.2022</pre>It may be seen that the percentage of Expenditure under Grants-in-aid-General and Grants-in-aid-Salaries is showing decreasing trend.The Budget allocations of State Governments for education may also contain the component of salary and administrative expenses.  The details of funds spent on committed liabilities such as salary etc., of the State Governments in the Education Sector is not maintained in the Department.******
