ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (c) India has attached a high priority and is committed to universal, non-discriminatory and verifiable nuclear disarmament. India believes that this goal can be achieved through a step-by-step process underwritten by a global and non-discriminatory multilateral framework. In this regard, India has supported commencement of negotiations on a Comprehensive Nuclear Weapons Convention in the Conference on Disarmament. India did not participate in the negotiations of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons because of its concerns regarding the impact of the Treaty on the existing disarmament machinery, in particular, the Conference on Disarmament, which is the world’s sole multilateral disarmament negotiation forum, working on the basis on consensus. India also believes that this Treaty will not contribute in realisation of the goal of nuclear disarmament. India will not, therefore, be a party to the Treaty and shall not be bound by any of the obligations that may arise from it.***
