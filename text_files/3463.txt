                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a), (d) & (e)  The State Governments are primarily responsible for taking immediate measures in the wake of all natural calamities. The Government of India provides assistance to the State Governments through financial and logistic support. The State Governments have ready availability of funds in the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) for taking immediate measures in the wake of all natural calamities, including drought.   Additional assistance over and above SDRF, is considered from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), for natural calamities of severe nature, in accordance with an established procedure and on submission of a Memorandum for Central assistance by the affected State. Financial assistance from SDRF and NDRF in the wake of natural calamities is for immediate relief only and not by way of compensation for the loss suffered.Moreover, the Water Resources Projects are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priority. In order to supplement their efforts, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments on their request. Contd…P/2//2//During 2016-17, ninety-nine (99) on-going Major/Medium irrigation projects under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) - Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) have been prioritized in consultation with States, for completion in phases along with their Command Area Development & Water Management (CADWM) works. Out of the 99 prioritized projects, 59 projects are benefitting/partially benefitting the drought prone areas and hence are contributing in drought mitigation. Out of 59 prioritised projects, as mentioned above, 14 projects are from Maharashtra under PMKSY – AIBP. In addition to above, a Special Package for completion of Irrigation Projects to address agrarian distress in Vidarbha, Marathwada and other chronically drought prone areas of Rest of Maharashtra has been approved during 2018-19.The Krishna-Marathwada Irrigation Project is not under PMKSY. The State Government of Maharashtra has informed that Administrative approval to the Krishna-Marathwada Irrigation Project was accorded by Government of Maharashtra in August, 2007and the actual work started in the month of May, 2008.The Government of Maharashtra has informed that the budget allocation to Krishna-Marathwada Irrigation Project along with the Krishna-Bhima Stabilization for 2019-20 is Rs. 500 cr. The project is planned for completion in next four years as per availability of funds to the project. (b)   The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component and 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). Under the NPP, four priority links have also been identified for preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) under the Peninsular Rivers Component viz; Ken-Betwa link project (KBLP), Damanganga-Pinjal link project, Par-Tapi-Narmada link project and Godavari-Cauvery link project. The DPRs in respect of Ken-Betwa link project, Damanganga-Pinjal link project and Par-Tapi-Narmada link project have been prepared and sent to concerned States. The Draft DPR of Godavari-Cauvery link project has been completed and circulated to party States.(c)	   Central Water Commission (CWC) is monitoring live storage status of 91 reservoirs of the country on weekly basis and issues weekly bulletin. In Maharashtra there are seventeen (17) reservoirs under CWC monitoring. There is one Bhima/Ujjani reservoir under CWC monitoring of 91 Major reservoirs. This project benefits the districts of Solapur and Osmanabad in Maharashtra State. As per Reservoir Storage Bulletin dated 04.07.2019, the total live storage available in Bhima reservoir is 0.000 BCM which is 0% of total live storage capacity of the reservoir. The storage during corresponding period of last year was 0% and average storage of last ten years during corresponding period was 4% of live storage capacity of the reservoir.*****
