                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a)	to (b) Yes Sir. The Hon’ble Supreme Court passed seven directives on police reforms vide its Order dated 22.09.2006 in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 310 of 1996 filed by Shri Prakash Singh & Others vs. Union of India & Others. One of the directions was to separate investigating police from law & order police, starting with towns/ urban areas having population of ten lakhs or more, and gradually extending to smaller towns/ urban areas also. (c) to (d) “Police” is a State subject falling in List-II (State List) of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India and it is, therefore, the responsibility of the State Governments/UT Administrations to bring in the requisite reforms in the functioning of the Police. The directives of the Hon’ble Supreme Court were meant for the State Governments/UT Administrations and the same were forwarded to them for implementation.*****
