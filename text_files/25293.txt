                                                        MINISTER OF TOURISM 			               (SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) and (b):		Promotion and development of Tourism, including eco- tourism places, is primarily undertaken by the State Governments/ Union Territory Administrations.  However, the Ministry of Tourism provides financial assistance under Swadesh Darshan Scheme for development of tourism related infrastructure and facilities in the country, including Chhattisgarh. Recognizing the potential for the development of Eco tourism in the country, the Ministry of Tourism has identified “Eco Circuit” as one of the 15 thematic circuits under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme. The projects under the Swadesh Darshan scheme are identified for development in consultation with the State Government/Union Territory Administrations and are sanctioned subject to availability of funds, submission of suitable detailed project reports, adherence to scheme guidelines and utilization of funds released earlier. Submission of project proposal by the State Government and its sanctioning is a continuous process. No proposal has been received by the Ministry of Tourism from the State Government of Chhattisgarh for development under Eco Tourism. The details of the projects sanctioned under Eco Circuit theme of Swadesh Darshan Scheme in the country are given at Annexure.*******
