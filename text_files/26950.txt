After completing various formalities with State Government/Statutory Authorities, regarding the consent for sharing of cost, closure of LCs and feasibility etc., proposals mutually agreed for construction of ROBs/RUBs in lieu of LCs are further processed for inclusion in Railway Works Programme, which is a continuous process. The State-wise details of valid demands received from various State Govt. since 2018 to June, 2021, along with their status are appended.(d) & (e):  There is LC No. 6 at km. 7.033 near Santragachi station yard.  As per last census, Train Vehicle Unit (TVU) at this LC is more than 1 lakh and is eligible for construction of ROB/RUB on cost sharing basis.  Work for construction of ROB in lieu of  LC No. 6 was sanctioned in 2016-17 but the same was dropped as the State Govt. was unable to provide land for approaches.  At present, Railway has no plan for construction of underpass/flyover near Santragachi Railway station in lieu of  this LC.*****
