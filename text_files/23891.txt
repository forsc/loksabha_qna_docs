                                                        THE MINISER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                                  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a): 	The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has launched a scheme for Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHCs) as a sub-scheme of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana- Urban (PMAY-U) Mission to provide dignified living to urban migrants/poor including homeless persons and homeless families living in cities.(b): 	In order to ensure that the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model does not make these housing complexes unaffordable for those with low income and those facing livelihood loss from the pandemic-induced economic crisis, initial affordable rent of ARHCs will be fixed based on a local survey which will be enhanced biennially by 8%, subject to maximum increase of 20% in aggregate, over a period of 5 years, effective from the date of signing the contract. The same mechanism shall be followed over the entire concession period i.e. 25 years. Further, as per the Operational Guidelines of the scheme, States/Urban Local Bodies (ULBs)/Parastatals shall review the project status and implementation of contract terms on a periodic basis as per requirement and take suitable measures for smooth implementation of scheme.(c):	As per the Operational Guidelines of ARHCs, Concessionaire and Tenants (including institutions) will sign a rent agreement abiding to applicable rules and regulations which can prevent eviction/housing loss to the residents of these complexes. Tenants will abide by the contract terms and vacate premises without any dispute.(d): Beneficiaries for ARHCs will be from Economically Weaker Section (EWS)/Low Income Group (LIG) who are urban migrants/poor. They include labour, urban poor (street vendors, rickshaw pullers, other service providers etc.), industrial workers and migrants working with market/trade associations, educational/health institutions, hospitality sector, long term tourists/visitors, students or any other persons of such category. Preference under this scheme shall be given to persons belonging to Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes/Other Backward Classes, Widows and working Women, Divyang, Minorities, subject to beneficiaries being from EWS/LIG segments as provisioned by the Government.                                                *****
