ANSWER




                                                               MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI) (a) to (e)  Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) have implemented new “Dealership Selection Guidelines” for Retail Outlets (ROs) w.e.f. 24.11.2018. Procedure/Norms/Criteria for allotment of RO dealerships in the country are available at www.petrolpumpdealerchayan.in. Selection of RO dealer is done through public advertisement released by Public Sector OMCs followed by online process of draw of lots from eligible applicants maintaining full transparency and minimum human interference. The applications so received against the advertisement are processed in line with laid down procedures which are available in public domain at www.petrolpumpdealerchayan.in. Hence the selection is purely based on number of responses received and there is no provision for calling for re- advertisement based on number of responses. As on 1.1.2022, Public Sector OMCs have allotted (Letter of Intents issued) 3771 RO dealerships to single applicants from the advertisement released in November/December, 2018.  Establishment of CNG stations is part of development of City Gas Distribution (CGD) Network and the same is carried out by the entities, authorized by Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB), who establish CNG stations based on their approved Minimum Work Plan & techno commercial viability.  ****
