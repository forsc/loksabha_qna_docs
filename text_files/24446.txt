ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)	The State/UT-wise (including Uttar Pradesh) details of total funds allocated, sanctioned and utilized under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) during the last three years and the current year are given in Annexure-I. The funds under PMAY-G Scheme are released by the Ministry directly to the State/UT considering the State/UT as a unit and funds are not released to districts. Thus district-wise data regarding allocation of funds and its utilization is not maintained at the Ministry level.(b)	The State/UT-wise (including Uttar Pradesh) details of targets set and achievements made under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) during the last three years and the current year are given in Annexure-II.(c)	Under PMAY-G, the beneficiaries are identified on the basis of housing deprivation parameters and exclusion criteria prescribed under Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011 and another survey “Awaas+” to identify left out eligible households subject to due verification by Gram Sabha and completion of appellate process thereafter. Accordingly, a total of 1,98,45,466 beneficiaries have been sanctioned houses under the scheme as on 15.07.2021.(d)	During the period of Covid-19 pandemic induced nation-wide lockdown, all construction activities including construction of houses under PMAY-G were also affected. It resulted in retarding the pace of construction of PMAY-G houses. Besides, the delays are also due to cases of unwillingness of beneficiary, migration, death of beneficiaries without legal heir, delay in allotment of land to landless beneficiaries by the States/UTs and General/Assembly/Panchayat elections. The States/UTs have been requested to expedite the completion of houses approved under PMAY-G. Other steps taken including timely allocation of targets to the States/UTs under PMAY-G, provision of adequate funds and promotion of eco-friendly &innovative technologies for house construction, follow up with the States to ensure provision of land to landless beneficiaries in rural areas, expeditious resolution of technical issues faced by the State, advisory to all States/UTs to resume activities under PMAY-G with due Covid-19 protocol, regular review of progress at the level of Secretary/Additional Secretary/Deputy DG, Ministry of Rural Development and separate review of States/UTs with high target, poor performing States/UTs and delayed houses in States/UTs.(e)	In order to achieve the objective of “Housing for All”, the target is to construct 2.95 crore houses under PMAY-G. After following due verification & remand process by Gram Sabha, the number of eligible beneficiaries in SECC data currently stands at 2.12 crore. In order to fill the gap, an exercise was conducted across the country for identifying such households and capturing their details through the mobile application “Awaas+”. A total of 3.57 crore households were uploaded by the States/UTs on this application. The Ministry constituted Expert Committee for analysis of this data and to devise methodology to ensure that only the genuinely deprived beneficiaries avail the benefits of the scheme. On the basis of recommendations of this Committee, the Ministry has already allocated 50,98,883 houses from final Awaas+ list to eligible States/UTs.*****
