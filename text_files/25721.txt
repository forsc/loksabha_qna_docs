During FSP 2016-17 to FSP 2020-21, GSI carried out 14 projects on Lithium and associated elements in Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Meghalaya, Karnataka and Rajasthan.

However, resource of lithium has not yet been augmented by GSI. Further, Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMDER), a constituent unit of Department Atomic Energy (DAE),has undertaken exploration for lithium in potential geological domains in parts of Karnataka and Rajasthan. AMDER has also taken up subsurface exploration in Marlagalla area, Mandya district, Karnataka. Reconnaissance surveys have been also carried out along Saraswati River palaeochannel, in Jodhpur and Barmer districts, Rajasthan for locating lithium mineralisation associated with brine (saline water in salt lakes).   Preliminary surveys on surface and limited subsurface exploration by AMD, have shown presence of Lithium resources of 1,600 tonnes (inferred category) in the pegmatites of Marlagalla – Allapatna area, Mandya district, Karnataka.As per the available records, Lithium bearing minerals are in Part B ‘Atomic Minerals’ of First Schedule to MMDR Act, 1957 and their reserves/resources are not available in National Mineral Inventory.(c) to (f) No, Sir.
