ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a):  Rupsi airport has been identified under 2nd round of bidding under UDAN for operation of UDAN flights between Rupsi & Guwahati. However, the Selected Airline Operator (SAO) withdrew the proposal subsequently. Airport Authority of India (AAI), the implementing agency,  identified RCS routes from Rupsi airport connecting to Guwahati and Kolkata under 4th round of bidding under UDAN. ;;(b): AAI, the implementing agency,  identified RCS routes from  Tezpur airport  in the 2nd round of bidding under UDAN for operation of UDAN flights. Details of the routes awarded under UDAN with fixed wing aircraft/helicopters connecting Tezpur are attached as Annexure-A.;;(c): The Selected Airline Operators (SAOs) under UDAN are obligated to commence RCS flight operations on a RCS-route within a period of six months from the issuance of Letter of Award or within two months from the readiness of airport, whichever is later, unless any extension is granted by the Implementing Agency. However, sometimes there is a delay in operationalizing some routes/discontinuation of the routes, for reasons which include: i) Non-readiness of civil airports/heliports, which may be related to availability of land, development of required infrastructure, compliances related for licencing of airport, etc.ii)	 Delay in obtaining Scheduled Commuter Operators Permit by new entrant Airlines. iii)  Unsustainability of the operation on the awarded routes, leading to discontinuation.
