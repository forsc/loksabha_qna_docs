ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a to c, e & f)	The Government of India continues to take measures for the recognition of Hindi at the United Nations (UN) and to popularize Hindi worldwide. On several occasions, Indian leaders have delivered statements in Hindi at the UN, including Prime Minister’s address at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) sessions in 2014, 2019 and 2020, and former External Affairs Minister’s address at the UNGA sessions in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. In 2018, a Voluntary Financial Contribution Agreement was signed between the UN and the Government of India to promote Hindi within the UN system, for a two-year term. This was extended by another 5 years in 2019 and is currently in force till March 2025. Pursuant to this Agreement, the UN has launched Hindi Social media accounts on  Facebook, Twitter and Instagram as well as a Hindi website of UN News. In addition, the UN broadcasts its programmes on the UN Radio website in Hindi, issues a weekly Hindi news bulletin on Sound Cloud, publishes a UN blog in Hindi and has provided a Hindi extension of UN News mobile app for both Android and iOS. (d)	The procedure for getting Hindi accepted as an Official language of the UN involves adoption of a Resolution with a minimum of two-third majority of the total membership of the UN present and voting in both the Fifth Committee and the UNGA. It also entails additional expenditure, which according to UN rules has to be contributed by all Member States.***
