                                                         MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) & (b): Public Distribution System (PDS) is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and the State/UT Governments, wherein the operational responsibilities within the State/UT rest with the respective State/UT Government. As and when complaints are received in this Department from individuals, organizations as well as through media reports regarding any irregularities in the functioning of the PDS, including leakages & diversion of foodgrains thus not reaching to the intended beneficiaries, etc., they are forwarded to the concerned State/UT Government for inquiry and appropriate action at their end. During the last year 2018 a total of 941 complaints were received in the Department and were forwarded to concerned State/UT for necessary action at their end.Further, to address challenges such as leakage and diversion of foodgrains, inclusion/exclusion errors, fake and bogus ration card, Government is implementing a scheme on “End-to-End Computerisation of Targeted Public Distribution (TPDS) Operations”. The Scheme comprises digitization of ration cards/beneficiary and other databases, online allocation, computerisation of supply-chain management, setting up of transparency portals and grievance redressal mechanisms. Digitization of all ration cards/beneficiaries under NFSA have been completed in all States/UTs and the electronic Point of Sale(ePoS) devices have been installed in about 77% Fair Price Shops(FPSs) out of total 5.34 lakh FPSs across the country.***
