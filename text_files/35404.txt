ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) Drinking water is a State subject. Power to plan, design, formulate, approve, implement, operate and maintain water supply schemes is vested with States. As per the operational guidelines for the implementation of Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), single village schemes (SVS) are to be implemented in villages having adequate groundwater/ spring water/ local or surface water sources which are either of prescribed quality or treatable. Multi Village Schemes (MVS) through bulk water transfer are planned in villages with water quality issues and paucity of surface water sources. Further, in drought-prone and desert areas, where it is not possible to have water supply through conjunctive use, a similar approach to transfer bulk water from long distance are adopted. In States with water-scarce/ areas lying in rain-shadow region with inadequate rainfall, it is necessary to plan for regional water supply schemes covering both urban and rural areas of this region by sourcing water from a perennial surface source.The States have to judiciously plan works under MVS, keeping in view the availability of resources and future operation & maintenance expenditure.(b) The number of rural households in the country for which provision for tap water supply has been made, as on 11.3.2022, along with the number of remaining rural households, State/UT-wise, is annexed.(c) The State Government of Madhya Pradesh has informed that works under JJM have been started in Ratlam, Jhabua and Alirajpur districts and rural households in these districts are to be provided tap water supply by 2024.It has further informed that the fluoride affected habitations in Ratlam, and Alirajpur districts have been covered through supply of safe drinking water and there are no fluoride affected areas in Jhabua district.*****
