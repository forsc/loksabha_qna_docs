                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a)  to (c)   Rivers in the country are polluted due to discharge of untreated and partially treated sewage from cities/towns and industrial effluents in their respective catchments, problems in operation and maintenance of sewage/effluent treatment plants, lack of dilution and other non-point sources of pollution.  State/Union Territory (UT) wise details of sewage generation from urban areas and corresponding sewage treatment capacities available are given at Annexure.Cleaning/rejuvenation of rivers is an ongoing activity. It is the responsibility of the States/UTs, Local Bodies and Industrial Units to ensure required treatment of sewage and industrial effluents in sewage treatment plants (STPs)/effluent treatment plants (ETPs) to the prescribed norms before discharging into river and other water bodies, coastal waters or land to prevent and control of pollution therein. For conservation of rivers, this Ministry has been supplementing efforts of the States/UTs by providing financial and technical assistance for abatement of pollution in identified stretches of rivers in the country through the Central Sector Scheme of Namami Gange for Ganga and its tributaries and the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) for other rivers. Setting up of STPs is one of the important components of these programmes. NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches on 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country with the project sanctioned cost of Rs.5961.75 crore, and inter-alia, a sewage treatment capacity of 2677 million litres per day (mld) has been created. Under the Namami Gange programme, a total of 353 projects, including 157 projects for sewage treatment of 4952 mld and sewer network of 5212 kms, have been sanctioned at a cost of Rs.30458 crore. Contd…P/2//2//Under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) programmeof Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, 883 sewerage & septage management projects amounting to Rs.34,081 crore have been taken up, of which 370 projects costingRs.8,258 crore have been completedso far.Under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban) 2.0 launched in October, 2021, Rs.15883 crore has been allocated to States/UTs for wastewater/used water management, including setting up of STPs and FSTPs (fecal sludge treatment plants).As per the Provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution), Act 1974, industrial units are required to install effluent treatment plants (ETPs) and treat their effluents to comply with stipulated environmental standards before discharging into river and water bodies. Accordingly, CPCB, State Pollution Control Boards/Pollution Control Committees monitor industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under provisions of these Acts.Besides, in compliance of the orders of National Green Tribunal (NGT) in Original Application No.673/2018 regarding rejuvenation of polluted river stretches in the country, States/UTs are required to implement approved action plans, including installation of wastewater treatment plants, for restoration of the polluted stretches in their jurisdiction as identified by CPCB and published in their report of 2018, within the stipulated timelines. As per the orders of NGT, regular review on implementation of action plans is undertaken in the States/UTs and also at Central level. ***** ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) to (c) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No 1975 to be answered on the 09.12.2021 on ‘Waste Water Treatment’.State/UT-wise details of sewage generation in urban areas and treatment capacity availableStates / UTs	Sewage Generation (in MLD)	Installed Capacity (in MLD)	Number of STPs Installed	Operational Treatment Capacity(in MLD)Andaman & Nicobar Islands	23	0	-	0Andhra Pradesh	2882	833	66	443Arunachal Pradesh	62	0	-	0Assam	809	0	-	0Bihar	2276	10	1	0Chandigarh	188	293	7	271Chhattisgarh	1203	73	3	73Dadra   & Nagar Haveli	67	24	3	24Goa	176	66	11	44Gujarat	5013	3378	70	3358Haryana	1816	1880	153	1880Himachal Pradesh	116	136	78	99Jammu & Kashmir	665	218	24	93Jharkhand	1510	22	2	22Karnataka	4458	2712	140	1922Kerala	4256	120	7	114Lakshadweep	13	0	-	0Madhya Pradesh	3646	1839	126	684Maharashtra	9107	6890	154	6366Manipur	168	0	-	0Meghalaya	112	0	-	0Mizoram	103	10	1	0Nagaland	135	0	-	0NCT of Delhi	3330	2896	38	2715Orissa	1282	378	14	55Pondicherry	161	56	3	56Punjab	1889	1781	119	1601Rajasthan	3185	1086	114	783Sikkim	52	20	6	18Tamil Nadu	6421	1492	63	1492Telangana	2660	901	37	842Tripura	237	8	1	8Uttar Pradesh	8263	3374	107	3224Uttarakhand	627	448	71	345West Bengal	5457	897	50	337Total	72368	31841	1469	26869*****
