ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b) Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) was launched on 25th December, 2000 for providing connectivity by way of an all weather road to the eligible unconnected habitations as per core-network with a population of 500 persons in plain areas. In respect of the North Eastern and hilly states, Desert Areas (as identified in the Desert Development Programme), Tribal (Schedule V) areas and Selected Tribal and Backward Districts (as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs and Planning Commission), the objective is to connect eligible unconnected habitations with a population of 250 persons and above (Census 2001). For Left Wing Extremism (LWE) areas as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs, the unconnected habitations with population 100 and above (as per 2001 Census) are eligible to be covered under PMGSY. As on 20th July 2021, 99% of eligible habitations have been connected.As the programme unfolded, a need was felt for consolidation of the existing rural road network to improve its efficiency not only as a provider of transportation services, but also as a vehicle of social and economic development. Accordingly, PMGSY-II was launched in May, 2013 to envisage consolidation of the existing Rural Road Network to improve its overall efficiency as a provider of transportation services for people, goods and services. A total of 50,000 km road length has been targeted for upgradation under PMGSY-II. As on 20th July 2021, 89% road length has been constructed out of 49,903.68 km sanctioned.Road Connectivity Project for Left Wing Extremism Affected Areas (RCPLWEA) was launched in the year 2016 with an aim to improve the road connectivity in 44 worst affected LWE districts and some adjoining districts in 9 States, viz. Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh. The scheme has twin objectives of enabling smooth and seamless anti-LWE operations by the security forces and also ensuring socio-economic development of the area. As on 20th July 2021, 9,267.70 km road length has been sanctioned and 4,125.52 km length has been constructed.The Government approved PMGSY-III in July, 2019 for consolidation of 1,25,000 Km Through Routes and Major Rural Links connecting habitations, inter-alia to Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs), Higher Secondary Schools and Hospitals. The timeline for completion of PMGSY-III is March, 2025. As on 20th July 2021, 62,968.34 km road length has been sanctioned and 13,692.71 km has been constructed.The timeline for completion of PMGSY-I & II was March 2019 and March 2020 respectively. However, some works remain to be completed particularly in North East and Himalayan States due to tough terrain, adverse weather conditions and shorter working season. Progress of works also got impacted due to COVID-19. Despite the above, the programme was able to achieve the pace of construction @ 100km/ day during the year 2020-21. Also an expenditure of Rs. 23,933 Crore (including state share) was incurred during the same period which is the highest expenditure incurred in any year since inception of the scheme. PMGSY-I & II are now targeted for completion by March 2022. The initial timeline for completion of RCPLWEA was March, 2020. However, progress got slowed down due to forest clearance issues in many states. Also, the targeted length was increased. RCPLWEA is now targeted for completion by March, 2023.The progress of implementation of rural roads under PMGSY is regularly reviewed by way of Regional Review Meetings (RRMs), Performance Review Committee (PRC) meetings, Pre- Empowered/Empowered Committee meetings with the States. At district level, the District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee (DISHA) headed by a Member of Parliament (LS) monitors implementation of various schemes of Government of India including PMGSY. In addition to this, special review meetings are also held by Secretary/ Additional Secretary/ Joint Secretary, Ministry of Rural Development with Chief Secretaries/ Principal Secretaries and other concerned officers of the States.Since inception till 20th July, 2021, a total of 7,67,784 km road length has been sanctioned under all the interventions/ verticals of PMGSY, against which 6,70,065 km road length has been completed.The state-wise and vertical-wise details of sanctioned and completed works are given at Annexure-I.*******
