ANSWER




MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a)	: As per provisions of Section 32 of the Waqf Act 1995 as amended, general superintendence of all waqf properties in a State is vested with the State Waqf Board (SWB) and the Waqf Board is empowered to manage these waqf properties. Hence, the details of waqf properties are not maintained by Central Government. However, a dedicated online portal called WAMSI (Waqf Assets Management System of India) has been developed by the Ministry. So far 6,00,723 immovable waqf properties have been registered on the portal. (b)	: As per the available information with Central Waqf Council (CWC) received from various SWBs, State wise position of number of waqf properties facing encroachment is given at Annexure.(c): The Ministry of Minority Affairs implements Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK) earlier known as Multi-sectoral Development Programme (MsDP), a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, in identified Minority Concentration Areas (MCA) of the country with the objective to develop socio-economic assets and basic amenities in these areas. Under MsDP, projects could be proposed by States/UTs only on Government land.   However, the restructured PMJVK implemented w.e.f 2018-19, inter-alia provides for construction of projects under the PMJVK scheme on land of waqf or similar land from other notified Minority Communities. The types of projects sanctioned under PMJVK    inter alia include educational institutions like Degree Colleges, Residential Schools, New School Buildings, Student Hostels, Additional Class Rooms, Laboratory Rooms in Schools, Computer Rooms, Libraries, Smart Classrooms, etc. as proposed by the State Govts/UT Administrations.*******
