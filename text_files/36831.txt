ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE(SHRI PANKAJ CHAUDHARY) (a) & (b)  In general, a person resident in India to whom any amount of foreign exchange is due or has accrued is duty bound to take all reasonable steps to realise and repatriate such foreign exchange to India, save as otherwise provided under the regulations made thereunder, or with the general or special permission of the Reserve Bank. However, Section 6(4) of Foreign Exchange Management Act, (FEMA), 1999 permits a person resident in India to hold, own, transfer or invest in foreign currency, foreign security or any immovable property situated outside India if such currency, security or property was acquired, held or owned by such person when he was resident outside India or inherited from a person who was resident outside India. Foreign Exchange Management (Realisation, repatriation and surrender of foreign exchange) Regulations, 2015 prescribe the manner of repatriation and timeline for surrender of foreign exchange.
