Besides, Ministry of Tribal Affairs recognises the fact that education is an absolute requirement for holistic development of Scheduled Tribes and has been a core focus area.

Ministry of Tribal Affairs has introduced a scheme of Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRSs) to impart quality education exclusively to ST children with an objective to provide quality middle and high–level education to Scheduled Tribes (ST) students in remote areas in order to enable them to avail of reservation in high and professional educational courses and get jobs in Government, Public and Private sectors.  Realizing the importance of the EMRS, in the budget announcement 2018-19, it was decided that every block having 50% ST population and at least 20,000 ST population shall have an Eklavya Model Residential (EMRS) by 2022.
