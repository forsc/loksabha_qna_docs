                                                        ANSWER    MINISTER OF FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(SHRI PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a)	to (c):	A Statement is placed on the Table of the House.***** Statement referred to in reply to the Lok Sabha Starred Question No *217 put in by Shri Brijendra Singh, Member of Parliament for answer on 3rd August, 2021 regarding IUU Fishing.(a)	Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing remains one of the threats to marine ecosystems due to its potential to undermine national and regional efforts to manage fisheries sustainably as well as endeavours to conserve marine biodiversity. Presence of unregistered boats in Indian waters can be a potential threat to national maritime security.(b)	The regulatory framework such as Maritime Zones of India (Regulation of fishing by foreign vessels) Act, 1981 and the Marine Fishing Regulation Acts of all maritime states/union territories exists to prevent certain forms of IUU fishing by foreign vessels and Indian vessels respectively. (c)	The ‘Declaration for Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture’ has been adopted by the Committee on Fisheries (COFI) of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) at its 34th meeting in February, 2021 celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. Several elements of ‘Declaration for Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture’ are already covered in the National Policy on Marine Fisheries, 2017 notified on 28th April, 2017. *****
