ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)  (a):  The Government has not conducted any study/survey on the effect of climate change agreements on coal industry in India. The sectorial emissions are studied and covered in the Biennial Updated Report (BUR) prepared by Government of India that also include emissions from the coal sector. As per India’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), thrust is there to reduce the fossil fuel use and promote renewable energy resources with the objective to limit carbon emission intensity.  (b) & (c):    Coal being the most reliable and cheap source of electricity, remains the prime mover for the country. However, in order to reduce carbon emission intensity, Government has an ambitious plan to implement renewable energy schemes. For sustainable development of coal sector, policy initiatives have been taken for implementation of clean coal technologies like Coal Bed Methane/Coal Mine Methane and Coal Gasification. ****
