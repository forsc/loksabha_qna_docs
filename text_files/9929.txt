ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a)		Yes Sir.  The number of taxpayers under income-tax has been consistently increasing 		during the last five years, as under:  S.No.	Assessment Year	Total number of Taxpayers (in Crores)1	2014-15	5.702	2015-16	6.143	2016-17	6.924	2017-18	7.435	2018-19	8.46 A "Taxpayer" is a person who either has filed a return of income for the relevant Assessment Year or in whose case tax has been deducted at source in the relevant Financial Year but the taxpayer has not filed the return of income.State-wise details of number of taxpayers for the last 5 years are enclosed as Annexure-A. Contd…2/--: 2 :-(b) & (c) 	Yes Sir. Cases of phishing emails purporting to be from Income Tax Department and 		trying to fraudulently obtain sensitive personal and financial information have been 		reported by some taxpayers. To make the taxpayers aware that the Income Tax Department 		does not seek any confidential or financial information of the taxpayer over email and to 		alert taxpayers about the dangers of phishing emails, the following steps have been taken:		(i)	Publication of advisory in national website of Income-Tax Department informing 			taxpayers that Department does not request personal information, PIN, password 			or similar access information through e-mail. Accordingly, the taxpayers should 			not reply to, open attachments or click on links in any such email and forward such 			emails to Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-in), which is a 			Government of India agency mandated to fight against such threats.		(ii)	Implementation of best practices such as SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM 			(Domain Keys Identified Mail) and DMARC (Domain-based Message 		Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) for its email domains. Use of these 		protocols enable the e-mail receiver domains such as Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail etc. 				to determine whether or not a received e-mail is actually from the defined sender 		such as the Department and block phishing emails from reaching the taxpayer.		(iii)	Creation of a tab titled ‘Reminders/Campaigns’ on the e-Filing Portal to inform 		taxpayers about all emails and SMSs sent by Department.  		(iv)	Issue of Press Release of Ministry of Finance dated 05-February-2016, prescribing 			certain 	simple checks to be performed if a taxpayer receives an email purporting to 			be from the Income Tax Department to verify its authenticity. (d)		State-wise details of direct taxes collected under different Major Heads are enclosed as 		Annexure-B. *****  Annexure-ASTATE-WISE DETAILS OF NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS FOR THE LAST 5 YEARS(in
