                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)No Sir.(b)Question does not arise. (c), (d) & (e)	Government is aware of felling of such endangered trees from parts of the country including Kerala. Legality of felling of such endangered trees is decided by State Governments/ Union Territory Administrations. Protection and management of forests and tree resources is primarily the responsibility of State Governments/Union Territory Administrations. There are strong legal frameworks for protection and management of forest resources in the country which include Indian Forest Act, 1927, Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Besides several States have their own State Forest Acts and Tree Preservation Acts and Rules, etc. The State Governments /UT Administrations take appropriate action to protect forests and regulate felling of trees in accordance with the provisions made under these Acts/ Rules. *****
