ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	to  (c)	For the purpose of definition, plastic which is commonly used for packaging, carrying or dispensing commodities and includes items intended to be used only once for the same purpose before they are discarded can be termed as ‘Single Use Plastic’.The Government has notified Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. The Rules prohibits the use of carry bag made of virgin or recycled plastic less than fifty microns in thickness. Sachets made of plastic material for storing, packing or selling gutkha, tobacco and pan masala is also prohibited.Further, considering the high environmental cost associated with the use of single-use plastic, particularly the adverse effect on soil, water bodies and on marine environment, Hon’ble Prime Minister has announced India’s pledge to phase out Single-use plastic by 2022. Many States/UTs through their own notifications have also imposed partial or complete prohibition on the use of plastic carry bags/single use plastic. 23 States and 9 UTs have issued notifications/orders introducing regulations pertaining to complete ban on plastic carry bags and/or other single-use plastic items.(d) to (f)	The Government has notified Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016. TheseRules mandate the producers and the brand owners to work out modalities for waste collection systems based on the principle of Extended Producers Responsibility (EPR). Producers, importers and brand owners of various items, including Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCGs), who introduce such products in the marketneed to establish a system for collection of used multi-layered plastic sachets, pouches or packaging,. Establishments are not directly incentivized for not using plastics, however, the producers, importers and brand owners are switching towards alternate packaging to reduce the EPR cost.Food Safety and Standard Authority of India (FSSAI) is mandated for laying down science based standards for articles of food and to regulate their manufacture, storage, distribution, sale and import to ensure availability of safe and wholesome food for human consumption. In this context, FSSAI has notified the Food Safety and Standards (Packaging) Regulations, 2018 which prescribe different packaging materials including plastics, used for the packaging of food articles and the food safety aspects from packaging perspective. The Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016 defines the norms for compostable plastic as an ecologically sustainable and green alternative to plastics. The Rules prohibit the use of plastic bags with thickness less than 50 microns. However, the provision of thickness is not applicable to carry bags made up of compostable plastic. The carry bags made from compostable plastics have to conform to the Indian Standard: IS 17088:2008 titled as Specifications for Compostable Plastics. While CPCB analyses information available on the subject of bio-degradable/compostable plastics, a committee has been constituted by Central Institute of Plastics Engineering & Technology (CIPET) with respect to research and development for Compostable/Biodegradable Technology on Plastic.  *****
