ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE (IC) OF THE MINISTRY OF YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS AND ADDITIONAL CHARGE OF MINISTER OF STATE (IC) OF THE MINISTRY OF AYURVEDA,YOGA & NATUROPATHY, UNANI, SIDDHA AND HOMOEOPATHY(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a) & (b):	Public Health and Hospitals being a State subject, the primary responsibility of strengthening public healthcare system lies with the respective State/ UT Government. However, under National Health Mission (NHM) scheme being implemented by MOH&FW, technical and financial support is provided to States/UTs for strengthening their healthcare systems on the basis of proposals received from States/ UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs).  Under NHM, mainstreaming of AYUSH has been taken up by allocating AYUSH services in 7,785 Primary Health Centre(PHCs), 2,748 Community Health Centre (CHCs), 496 District Hospital (DHs), 4,022 health facilities above Sub Centre (SC) but below block level and 371 health facilities other than CHC at or above block level but below district level. Wherever mainstreaming has been implemented, the AYUSH practitioners are not authorized to prescribe allopathic medicines.	There is no such proposal to make it mandatory for AYUSH doctors to take one year bridge course for prescribing allopathic medicines.
