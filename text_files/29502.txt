(b)       The ASEEM Portal is to provide a platform that matches supply of skilled workforce with the market demand, thereby facilitating better livelihood opportunities for youth including migrants and availability of ready skilled manpower to employers. At present, there is around 10 lakh migrant’s data/profile are available on ASEEM.  (c)        ASEEM as such consists of three IT based AI (artificial intelligence) driven interfaces for stakeholder interactions:i)          A job application for individuals with access to hyper local jobs using machine learning and automated match based on persona.ii)         A demand and campaign management system for employers to forecast the current and future demand.iii)        A management dashboard for analytics and insights.
