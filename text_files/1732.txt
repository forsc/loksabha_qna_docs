ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):	No, Sir. It is not true. However, at the initial stage of implementation of the Scheme the details of farmers uploaded by the States / UTs were processed for payment by the Public Finance Management System (PFMS) on their DBT portal. While the payments were being processed for crediting in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries it was noticed that in some cases there was a mismatch in the names of the beneficiaries as provided by the State Governments and the names as given in the details of the corresponding bank account numbers. The States were asked to verify this discrepancy. On the request of the States, Stop Payment instructions were given to the National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) for 269605 farmers. The system could stop credit of these beneficiaries, except for 119743 beneficiaries whose accounts had already been credited. The NPCI and banks returned the money of those beneficiaries also on account of Stop Payment instructions. The State-wise details of cases of reversal of transactions in respect of these 119743 farmers is annexed at Annexure. The procedure for release of payment to beneficiaries was suitably modified after the initial period and stringent pre-verification procedures were formalized. The States’ Stop Payment requests due to mismatch in the names is taken in advance so that payment is released only to the beneficiaries whose data matches correctly with the bank account details. Therefore, the possibility of re-occurrence has been eliminated.
