                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES AND PENSIONS AND MINISTER OF STATE IN THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a) & (b):   Yes sir. ‘The Right to Information (Term of Office, Salaries, Allowances and Other Terms and Conditions of Service of Chief Information Commissioner, Information Commissioners in the Central Information Commission, State Chief Information Commissioner and State Information Commissioners in the State Information Commission) Rules, 2019’ is at Annexure I.(c) & (d):  ‘The Right to Information (Term of Office, Salaries, Allowances and Other Terms and Conditions of Service of Chief Information Commissioner, Information Commissioners in the Central Information Commission, State Chief Information Commissioner and State Information Commissioners in the State Information Commission) Rules, 2019’ were made in pursuance of The RTI (Amendment) Act, 2019. These Rules do not in any way affect the citizens’ Right to Information or obligations of Public Authorities and Public Information Officers given in Chapter II of the RTI Act inter-alia. The powers and functions of the Information Commissions stay undiluted as the relevant provisions under Chapter V of the Act remain unaltered. Nor are the independence and autonomy of these institutions affected in any way. The rules are of administrative nature and pertain to the internal administration of the concerned organization. They do not involve any social or additional financial implications which may have necessitated pre-legislative consultations outside the Government. The Department of Legal Affairs and Legislative Department have been duly consulted.*****
