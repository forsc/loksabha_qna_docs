                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) and (b) Government has issued notification no. GSR 190(E) dated 15.03.2021 which provides for Motor Vehicles (Registration and Functions of Vehicle Scrapping Facility) Rules, 2021 for establishment of Registered Vehicles Scrapping Facility (RVSF). The transactions between RVSF and Vehicle owners are market based and not determined by the Govt. Hence, Ministry does not have any data on this.  (c) and (d) Government has issued notification no. GSR 191 (E) dated 15.03.2021 for waiver of registration fee on vehicle registered against submission of Certificate of Deposit and GSR Notification 220 (E) dated 26.03.2021 for concession in  motor vehicle taxes for  vehicle registered against submission of "Certificate of Deposit". These provisions act as incentives for owning a new vehicle in lieu of the older vehicle.*****
