Since these advertisement are the only source of revenue for this free to air media,  AROI raised certain demands for FM radio industry seeking financial assistance in the form of waiver of one year license fee, waiver of tower rentals and other charges, waiver of spectrum fees, Zero or 5% GST, restoration of Government advertisements to normal levels, full waiver of minimum guarantee of 2.5% of Non-Refundable One Time Entry Fee (NOTEF) till end of license period and two-year extension in terms of license period, etc. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, Government deferred the payment of license fee of Quarter-1 FY 2020-21 up to 15th July 2020 for private FM Radio broadcasters. Government on 15th June 2020 intimated the FM Radio industry that in terms of provisions of FM Phase-III policy guidelines, there is no provision in the FM Radio Policy Guidelines, 2011 to grant any waiver in either the annual or the quarterly fee, which is due to the Government.  It is also not possible to modify the annual fee formula.  The other demands of the Radio Industry were also taken up with the concerned Ministries of the Government. Further, the private FM broadcasters were also apprised of the special economic and comprehensive package announced by the Government called Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan of more than Rs.20 lakh crore equivalent to 10% of India’s GDP, in the fight against COVID-19. ******
