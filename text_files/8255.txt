                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT                                                  (SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a)	to (d) :The Government has initiated the process to setup and strengthen Anti-Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs) in districts and Women Help Desks (WHDs) in Police Stations in States and UTs.The Empowered Committeeof officers (EC)forNirbhaya Fund in the Ministry has appraised and recommended these projects at a cost of Rs. 100.00 crore each.  As per National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data of crime upto the year 2017 released so far,the instances of human trafficking in the State of West Bengal including the districts ofDarjeeling, Kalimpong, Alipurduars, Jalpaiguri and North Dinajpur in the last five year are as under:Years	2013	2014	2015	2016	2017No. of cases	-	1096	1255	3579	357In the NCRB report for the year 2013, though State-wise data is not available, a total of 3940 incidents of the crime of human trafficking for the entire country are reported. Further, district wise data is not available in the NCRB reports for the year 2014 to 2017.(e)	& (f) ‘Police’ is a State subject under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and as such prevention of the crime of human trafficking and crime against children is the responsibility of State Governments. However, the Government of India has been supplementing the efforts of the State Governments by providing financial assistance to States for setting up Anti Human Trafficking Units, and by providing financial assistance to the States and Judicial Academies in States to hold ‘Judicial Colloquiums’ and conferences to sensitize police officials, judicial officers and prosecutors about various provisions of law relevant to trafficking and their role in curbing trafficking. Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has also issued various advisories to the States and UTs from time to time on preventing and combating human trafficking. These advisories are available at MHA’s website www.mha.gov.in. Through the National Investigation Agency (Amendment) Act, 2019, the Schedule of NIA Act, 2008 has been amended and National Investigation Agency has been empowered to investigate the cases committed under Sections 370 and 370A of Indian Penal Code relating to Human Trafficking.  *****
