                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a): As on 3rd February 2021, total number of cases reported due to COVID-19 in the country stands at 1,07,77,284, which is second highest in absolute numbers after United States of America. Although high in absolute terms, India has managed to restrict the morbidity to 7801 cases per million population, which is far lower than other similarly affected countries.6 States [Kerala (43.37%), Maharashtra (26.76%), Karnataka (3.71%), West Bengal (3.31%), Uttar Pradesh (3.13%) and Tamil Nadu (2.82%)] account for 83% of all active cases in the country.(b): State/UT wise details of total, active, recovered cases and deaths due to COVID-19 is at Annexure.(c): Since the reported peak in mid-September 2020, India is witnessing a sustained decline in the number of cases reported daily. However, resurgence of COVID-19 cases has been reported from a number of countries in Europe and Americas, therefore continuous monitoring of the evolving situation is being undertaken at all level, to pick up on the earliest signs of resurgence and issue necessary existing SOPs/Advisories accordingly. Further, the Government of India continues to focus on intensive risk communication to limit viral transmission by advocating adherence to COVID appropriate behaviors (wearing of mask/face covers; physical distancing and hand hygiene). Additionally, Government of India has rolled out COVID-19 vaccination since 16th January 2021. As on 3rd February 2021, a total of 41,38,918 persons have been vaccinated against COVID-19.(d): A surveillance system has been put in place to identify new UK variant of COVID 19 among those with travel history to UK from 23 December 2020. Till 01st February 2021, 147 travelers and their contacts have been tested positive for UK strain in India. At present there is no evidence to suggest that current vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) will fail to protect against COVID-19 variants reported from United Kingdom.
