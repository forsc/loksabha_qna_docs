                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c) A statement is laid on the table of the House.Statement referred in reply to Part (a) to (c) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 147 regarding "Bathinda-Delhi-Bathinda Flights" to be answered on 11.02.2021.  ; (a) Yes, Sir. Prior to COVID-19 lockdown, scheduled flights were operating at 105 airports and at present scheduled flights are operating at 99 airports i.e. at 94% of the destinations vis-a-vis pre-COVID operations. The list of airports where scheduled flights operated during pre-COVID and where scheduled flights are being operated at present, is at Annexure.; (b)  Pre-COVID, Alliance Air (subsidiary of Air India) was operating three flights per week on Bathinda-Delhi-Bathinda sector under RCS-UDAN Scheme. Post resumption of scheduled domestic flight operations in a calibrated manner with effect from 25.05.2020, Bathinda airport is available for flight operations. However, at present no scheduled airline is operating on Bathinda-Delhi-Bathinda route.; (c) At present, Alliance Air is unable to operate flights on Bathinda-Delhi-Bathinda route as 3 years VGF support under RCS-UDAN was applicable only upto April, 2020 and the route is no more commercially viable due to limited passenger and low yields on this route in absence of subsidy support.
