ANSWER




                                                        (a): COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the need for effective utilization of healthcare workers globally. Health being a State subject, it is for the respective State Governments to assess requirement of healthcare professionals and take appropriate steps to meet the demand in public health facilities. However, under National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to the States/UTs to strength their health care systems, including support of engagement of human resources. (b):  No. (c) & (d): No. However, as per Indian Nursing Council (INC) records, there are around 32.63 lakh nursing personnel registered in the country. Moreover, there are around 5085 Nursing Institutions in the country producing about 3.35 lakh nursing personnel annually.  Adequate numbers of vaccinators and other vaccination team members have been trained for COVID-19 vaccination.
