It is often operated out of home rather than a purpose-built facility, with very little investment in Plant and Machinery. As per the 4th Handloom Census (2019-20), 35.23 lakh handloom workers are engaged in weaving and allied activities across the country. Schemes under Handloom Sector are implemented on the basis of proposals received from the State Governments and in close coordination with the State Governments.  The year-wise outflow of funds depends on the number of viable proposals for release of funds under the various schemes. This leads to variations in the annual figures. The Office of the Development Commissioner for Handlooms makes all efforts in close coordination with the State Governments and Weavers’ Service Centres through regular correspondence, interaction and by holding meetings for optimum utilization of funds allocated for various schemes.Government of India supports the sector by providing backward linkages i.e. supply of subsidized yarn, subsidized looms and accessories, design support, product development, skill up-gradation trainings and forward linkages i.e. Marketing platform to handloom organization and weavers to sell their products to the consumers through various national and international marketing events.
