ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a):     Dr. Ambedkar Foundation implements  schemes for the Welfare of Schedule Castes (SCs) and  Schedule Tribes (STs) only. The physical   and financial achievement in respect of these Schemes during the last three   years is attached as Annexure. No Scheme is being implemented  for the Welfare of the Other Backward   Classes (OBCs).(b):  Yes Sir. Following measures have been taken to popularise the Schemes being implemented by Dr. Ambedkar Foundation   among the targeted groups:  1.	The Foundation has involved Dr Ambedkar Chairs to spread  awareness about the Schemes at regional basis through seminars, symposia etc.2.	Schemes   have been converted into FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) format to  share with the public through   the Website.3.	Communicating with the District Authorities from time to time to disseminate information among the masses.4.	Publicity   through print/electronic media from time to time.(c) & (d):  Difficulties arise in the form of delays in processing of schemes as recommendations for verification from various designated authorities across the country are required to be obtained before approvals can be given. This involves reminders and pursuasions with the District Authorities. Various   steps have been taken for effective implementation of the schemes i.e. formalities   simplified and beneficiary-friendly, National Institute for Smart Government (NISG) has been engaged to study the process flow, design, develop and   maintain a bilingual website for content management and for online processing   of the applications, all the payments in respect of Welfare Schemes are being   remitted through RTGS/NEFT to the beneficiaries directly.****
