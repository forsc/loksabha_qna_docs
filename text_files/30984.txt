STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF THE STARRED QUESTION NO.243 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 15.12.2021 IN THE LOK SABHA.(a):	Yes, Sir. With a view to augment the ethanol production capacity in the country to achieve blending targets, the Government has notified Ethanol Interest Subvention Scheme(s) in year 2018 and 2019 for extending financial assistance to project proponents for setting up of new molasses based distilleries/expansion of existing molasses based distilleries against the loans availed by project proponents from banks/financial institutions. Thereafter, the Government in January’2021 has notified a modified Ethanol Interest Subvention Scheme for setting up of new grain based distilleries / molasses based distilleries / dual feed distilleries and expansion of existing distilleries. Under the schemes, Government is extending financial assistance in the form of interest subvention @ 6% per annum or 50% of rate of interest charged by banks/financial institutions whichever is lower for five years including one year moratorium.(b):	Under the schemes, loan amount of about Rs. 8643 crore has been sanctioned by the banks/financial institutions to 132 projects; out of which Rs. 4173 crore has been disbursed to 93 projects, as on 19.11.2021. A statement showing the State/Union Territory-wise number of projects to which loans have been sanctioned and disbursed including in the State of Maharashtra are given at Annexure I & II respectively.(c):	Under the schemes, in-principle approvals have been issued to 1028 project proponents. A list showing State/Union Territory-wise number of project proponents to whom in-principle approvals were issued is at Annexure III.(d):	So far, 93 project proponents have been benefitted as loans have been disbursed to them. A statement showing number of project proponents to whom loans have been disbursed State-wise/Union Territory-wise including in the State of Maharashtra is at Annexure II. A large number of farmers around these ethanol projects would be benefitted as they would be getting better and timely price for their produce.******ANNEXURE IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (b) OF THE STARRED QUESTION NO.243 FOR ANSWER ON 15.12.2021 IN THE LOK SABHA.State/UT-wise details of project proponents to whom loans have been sanctionedSI.
