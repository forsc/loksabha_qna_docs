(a) to (c) 	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.  Statement in reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 159* for reply on 2nd March 2020 regarding “Schemes for Youth and Women”.Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is implementing the following schemes for entrepreneurship development of youth and women, as under:1.  	Pradhan Mantri Yuva Udyamita Vikas Abhiyan (PM-YUVA) 	MSDE is implementing a pilot scheme, PM YUVA towards creating an enabling ecosystem through entrepreneurship education, training, advocacy and easy access to entrepreneurship network. The scheme focuses on students/trainees and alumni coming out from skilling ecosystem {i.e. Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs), Polytechnics, Pradhan Mantri Kuashal Kendras (PMKKs) and Jan Sikshan Sansthans (JSS)}. The scheme is being implemented in 10 States and 2 Union Territories {viz. i.e. Uttar Pradesh (6 districts), Uttarakhand (4 districts), Bihar (10 districts), West Bengal (12 districts), Assam (11 districts), Meghalaya (2 districts), Maharashtra (5 districts), Tamil Nadu (17 districts), Telangana (8 districts), Kerala (4 districts), Delhi (1 district) and Puducherry (1 district)}. The project envisages creation of 600 new and 1000 scale-up enterprises.    2.

Presently, this pilot programme is being implemented in the North Eastern Region (Assam, Meghalaya and Manipur), Rajasthan and Telangana where 147 women have been given incubation and acceleration support as part of its first cohorts. 3.
