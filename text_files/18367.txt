                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE, MINISTER OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY AND MINISTER OF EARTH SCIENCES (DR HARSH VARDHAN)???????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????, ??????? ?? ???????????? ??????  ???  ?????? ??????? ??????  (?? ???? ?????) (a)       Yes, Sir. The Government of India, is aware about the significant strength of science students in Bihar having knowledge and potential and encouraging it suitably through its schemes and programs.In order to attract young talent towards pursuing scientific career, the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India is implementing ‘Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE)’, an umbrella scheme to communicate excitement of creative pursuit of science to students. The scheme also aims to build the required critical human resource pool for strengthening and expanding the Research & Development (R&D) base.Under this umbrella, INSPIRE Awards MANAK (Million Minds Augmenting National Aspiration and Knowledge) attracts talented school students at an early age of 10-15 years studying in Class 6-10 to pursue science. One lakh ideas from these students are eligible for INSPIRE Award of Rs. 10000/-each. In last three years, 801 students from Bihar were given INSPIRE Awards MANAK, which reflects the innovation and creative potential of school students from Bihar.Another component under INSPIRE, Scholarship for Higher Education (SHE) aims to encourage meritorious students to study basic and natural sciences in Bachelor in Science (B.Sc) and Masters in Science (M.Sc) through attractive scholarship and mentor-ship opportunities. Selection under SHE is based on performance (top 1%) in Class XII examinations of State/Central School Examination Boards and in selected national level competitive examinations like IIT-JEE, etc. During 2019-20, 229 students from Bihar received SHE scholarship, which reflects the merit potential of science students from Bihar.During 27th National Children Science Congress (NCSC), 2019 organized by National Council for Science and Technology Communication (NCSTC), DST at Kerala, 30 school students from Bihar participated to exhibit their creativity and innovativeness and particularly their ability to solve societal problems experienced locally, using the method of science.Under State Science and Technology Programme (SSTP) of DST, Bihar Council of Science and Technology (BCST) supported, 500 projects of under graduate students under its Student Project Programme (SPP) in 2019-20 to encourage their efforts in science and technology.In order to encourage students for career development in the area of Biotechnology, Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India, is supporting Postgraduate Teaching Program to ensure high standard of teaching and to generate critical mass of trained manpower in country. A total of 72 courses are being supported under this programme across the country and one M.Sc. course in Agriculture Biotechnology is being supported at Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, Pusa, Samastipur (Bihar). 84 students were supported in last 5 years at Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, Pusa, Samastipur. Apart from this, DBT is also providing fellowships to biotechnology students for pursuing doctoral research in universities and / or research institutions in the country. 23 students were supported in last 5 years under DBT-JRF Program in Bihar.Under DBT Star College Scheme, envisaged for encouraging more students to take up higher education in science, 3 colleges from Bihar are being supported i.e. a) Patna Women''s College b) Patna Science College and c) Anugrah Narayan College, Patna.In addition to above, Government of Bihar has taken several initiatives to nurture the knowledge and potential of science students of Bihar such as establishment of Engineering College, Polytechnic, facilitating proposal to set up Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) and School of Planning and Architecture. BCST has submitted several proposals to Department of Biotechnology (DBT) under Skill Vigyan Programme (SVP).(b) & (c):  Presently, the Government does not propose to set up a Technology Development Centre in Bihar as there is no such scheme.**************
