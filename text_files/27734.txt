KISHAN REDDY)(a) & (b):	The Government of India has announced various fiscal and regulatory relief measures to support the tourism sector from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The details of the same are given at Annexure. (c) & (d):	The Ministry of Tourism has put in place the Scheme of “Capacity Building for Service Providers” (CBSP) to provide education, training and certification to the tourism service providers at every level. The main objectives of this scheme are to train and up-grade manpower at every strata of service and to provide professional expertise to the local populace as well as to create employable capacity in the tourism sector both in urban and rural areas. Presently the programmes being conducted under the CBSP Scheme are Hunar Se Rozgar Tak (HSRT), Skill Testing & Certification (ST&C) for existing service providers, Tourism Adventure and Escort Courses, Linguistic Tourist Facilitators (LTF), Sensitization Programme/ Tourism Awareness Programme (for existing service providers) and entrepreneurship Programme.Besides the above, the Ministry has launched destination based capacity building programme so that tourism service providers can take the courses without having to travel to far off cities where the institutes are usually located and in turn ensuring that the sector is no longer serviced by untrained hands.*********
