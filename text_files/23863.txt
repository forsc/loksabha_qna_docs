                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b)  The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component and 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). Under the Himalayan Component of National Perspective Plan (NPP), the Kosi-Ghaghra link project has been identified for diversion of 7482 MCM of waters from the proposed Chatra barrage to the Ghaghra (Karnali) river envisaging irrigation benefits to un-irrigated areas of various districts of Bihar including Darbhanga district. NWDA has completed the pre-feasibility report of the link project. The inter-linking of rivers project will provide major benefits, including irrigation, apart from the incidental benefits of flood control.*****
