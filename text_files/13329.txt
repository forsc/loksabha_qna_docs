ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) and (b): Krishnapatnam-Venkatachalam double line with electrification has been completed and commissioned.  The work of Kakinada-Pithapuram new line was included in the Budget 1999-2000 subject to requisite approvals. The work could not be taken forward due to lack of operational and financial justification. Subsequently, it was decided to re-examine the project. Since a long time had elapsed and ground situation and development activities must have taken place during the intervening period, updation of cost, traffic projections and the work of confirmation of feasibility of earlier chosen alignment has been taken up. Further consideration of the proposal is possible once updated results are firmed up. (c) and (d) Bhadrachalam-Kovvuru project was included  in Budget 2012-13. Project was sanctioned on 50:50 cost sharing basis with Govt. of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. On the request of Government of Telangana, alignment of the Project has been revised. Project further got delayed on account of final decision on cost sharing arrangement with state government of Telangana. Completion of Railway project depends on many factors as land acquisitions, statutory clearances from various authorities, shifting of utilities, law and order situation in the project area, orders of Hon’ble Courts etc. Hence, no confirmed time frame can be fixed for completion of project.*****
