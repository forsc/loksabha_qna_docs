The CCPA can issue directions to the concerned trader or manufacturer or endorser or advertiser or publisher, as the case may be, to discontinue such advertisement or to modify the same. The Consumer Protection Act, 2019 also provides for imposition of penalty by the CCPA on a manufacturer or endorser or publisher and imprisonment and penalty by a competent court on any manufacturer or service provider, who is found responsible for a false or misleading advertisement.        CCPA has issued show cause notices to various companies for misleading claims regarding boosting immunity, 99.9% protection against bacteria, covid-19 virus protection etc. The companies resorting to such claims are also asked to furnish test reports supporting such claims.        An advisory has also been issued to industry associations highlighting the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act and to impress upon their members to cease from making false claims about effectiveness against corona virus which are not supported by competent and duly authorized scientific advice.*****
