                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, was launched during the year 2015-16. The components under PMKSY are Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP); Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP) consisting of Command Area Development and Water Management, Surface Minor Irrigation & Repair, Renovation and Restoration of Water Bodies, & Ground Water Development;  Watershed Development (WDC), & Per Drop More Crop (PDMC). The said scheme was initially till December, 2019, however Ministry of Finance has extended the scheme till 31st March 2021. Extension, along with enhanced coverage, has been proposed for the various components of the PMKSY, for the five year period beyond March, 2021. However, continuation of ongoing projects under PMKSY Schemes beyond March, 2021, and inclusion of new projects under this scheme, depends upon the format and scale of the extended scheme, and availability of funds.(b)  Status of implementation of projects in Kerala State under the various components of PMKSY, is as under: (i) Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP)  		Of ninety-nine (99) on-going Major/Medium irrigation projects prioritized under PMKSY-AIBP being implemented by Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation,  two projects from Kerala State, namely Karappuzha and Muvattupuzha Irrigation Projects, are under implementation. The details of these projects are as under: Contd…P/2//2// Sl. No.	Name of the project	Districts benefited	Ultimate Irrigation Potential (hectare)	Irrigation potential created upto 03/2020 (hectare)	Estimated cost (Rs. In crore)	Expenditure till March, 2020 (Rs. In crore)1.	Muvattupuzha Irrigation Project 	Idukki, Ernakulam& Kottayam 	30.72	28.77	351.6	31.142.	Karapuzha Irrigation Project	Wayanand	7.36	1.62	64.752	0.32However, the above projects have so far not availed any Central Assistance since 2016, after inclusion under PMKSY- AIBP. (ii) Har Khet Ko PaniOne of the two projects under AIBP, namely Muvattupuzha Irrigation Project, is also included under CADWM. Central assistance amounting to Rs. 2.69 crore has been released to the State under CADWM program during 2020-21, and 600 ha of cultivable command area (CCA) have been developed, out of targeted CCA of 18,480 ha. Further, no project from Kerala is presently under implementation under other components of HKKP. (iii) Watershed Development 	Department of Land Revenue, Ministry of Rural Development, Govt. of India, has during the period 2009-10 to 2014-15, sanctioned 83 projects under Integrated Watershed Management Programme from Kerala. The projects cover an area of 4.23 lakh hectare, in various districts of Kerala, including Alappuzha. Rs.158.07 crore has been released as Central Assistance. Further, as informed by Govt. of Kerala, since 2014-15 to December, 2020, about 32,000 water harvesting structures have been created / rejuvenated under Water Development component of PMKSY. Further, an additional area of about 30,000 hectare has been brought under protective irrigation under PMKSY, benefiting 1.84 lakh farmers. (iv) Per Drop More Crop (PDMC)  So far from 2015-16 till date, Central Assistance of Rs.42.53 crore has been released to Kerala under PDMC component of PMKSY, covering an area of 2,777 hectare.(c) Water being a State subject, it is for the State Government concerned to formulate and implement water resources projects in their State, as per their priority. The role of Central Government is limited to providing technical support and financial assistance under its existing schemes, as per the guidelines of the scheme. It is for the Government of Kerala to plan projects in the various districts including Alapuzzah, and seek central assistance for them under different components of PMKSY, as and when it is extended, in line with the format of the extended version of PMKSY. *****
