                                                        MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (e)Prices of petrol and diesel have been made market-determined by the Government with effect from 26.06.2010 and 19.10.2014 respectively. Since then, the Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) take appropriate decision on pricing of petrol and diesel in line with international product prices and other market conditions. The Government continues to modulate the effective price to consumer for Subsidized Domestic LPG and retail selling price of PDS Kerosene. The prices of petroleum products are linked to the price of respective products in the international market. Oil Marketing Companies take a decision on retail selling price after considering various aspects including international productprices, exchange rate, tax structure, inland freight and other cost elements.The weightage of petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene in the WPI index is 1.60%, 3.10%, 0.64% and 0.19% respectively.With an aim to reduce the prices of petrol and diesel and give relief to the consumers, the Central Government reduced the Central Excise duty on petrol and diesel by ` 2 per litre with effect from 4th October, 2017. The Central Government further reduced the Central Excise duty on petrol and diesel by ` 1.50 per litre with effect from 5th October, 2018 and Public Sector OMCs also reduced ` 1.00 per litre to reduce the overall price of petrol and diesel. The Central Government also requested the State Governments to make a reduction of ` 2.50 per litre in VAT imposed by them on petrol and diesel. Accordingly, 18 State Governments and 1 Union Territory have reduced VAT on petrol and diesel.x-x-x-x-x
