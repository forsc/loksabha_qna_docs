ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance(a) to (e) With a view to increase banking penetration, promote financial inclusion and to provide at least one bank account per household across the country, a National Mission on Financial Inclusion (FI) known as Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) was announced on 15th August, 2014. In order to give impetus to financial inclusion initiatives of the Government, PMJDY scheme was extended beyond 14.08.2018 with the focus on opening of accounts shifting from “every household” to “every unbanked adult”. The scheme was made more attractive with upward revision in (i) OD limit from Rs.5,000 to Rs.10,000 and (ii) accident insurance cover on RuPay card holders from Rs.1 lakh to Rs.2 lakh. PMJDY has been successful in increasing banking penetration and to promote financial inclusion across the country.As informed by banks, as on 23.03.2022, approx. 45 crore Jan-Dhan accounts have been opened with deposit balance of over Rs.1.63 lakh crore. The details of the number of bank accounts opened under PMJDY till 31st January, 2022, State-wise and bank-wise are at Annexure-1 and Annexure-2 respectively.A Jan Dhan Aadhar Mobile (JAM) pipeline has been laid for linking of Jan-Dhan account with mobile number and Aadhar. This infrastructure pipeline is providing the necessary backbone for easing DBT flows, adoption of social security /pension schemes, facilitating credit flows, promoting digital payments, etc. These steps have provided the much-needed support for accelerating the pace towards achieving a digitalised, financially included and insured society. Further, Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) benefits under different Government schemes are also credited to eligible beneficiaries in their Jan-Dhan accounts.Access to credit facility for small entrepreneurs is another important intervention under the ongoing financial inclusion initiatives in the country. As a part of this process, the Government is implementing following credit-linked schemes in the country: i.	Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY):The scheme provide access to institutional finance to micro/small business units up to Rs.10 lakh for income generating activities such as manufacturing, trading, services, activities allied to agriculture etc. As on 18.03.2022, 34.28 crore loans amounting to Rs. 18.52 lakh crore have been sanctioned since inception of the Scheme.ii.	Stand Up India Scheme (SUPI): The scheme aims to promote entrepreneurship among people from Schedule caste/Schedule tribe and woman. The Scheme facilitates bank loans between Rs.10 lakh and Rs.1 crore to at least one Scheduled Caste/ Scheduled Tribe borrower and at least one-Woman borrower per bank branch of Scheduled Commercial Banks for setting up greenfield enterprises in trading, manufacturing and services sector. As on 25.03.2022, 1.34 lakh loans amounting to Rs. 30,274 crores have been sanctioned since inception of the Scheme.*****
