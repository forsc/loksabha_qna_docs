Deen Dayal Upadhyay station was connected to Howrah by 45 pairs of train services, Dehri-on-Sone was connected to Ranchi by 10 pairs of train services and Ara was connected to Sasaram by 07 pairs of train services.  Since, November-2021, Mail/Express trains are being operated with regular number.  As per rationalized time table,   the said sectors are respectively being served by 40, 06 and 05 pairs of train services.  Besides, trains are being restored in a phased manner.
