ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (e): A statement is laid on the table of the House.Statement in reply to part (a) to (e) of Lok Sabha Starred Q.No.264 for 11.07.2019 regarding "Sale of Air India" tabled by Shri Sanjay Sadashiv Rao Mandlik, M.P and Shri Bidyut Baran Mahato, M.P.  (a) & (b): Yes, Sir. The Government is committed to the strategic disinvestment of Air India. NITI Aayog in its recommendations, on Strategic Disinvestment of the Central Public Sector Enterprises in May 12, 2017 had given the rationale for the disinvestment of Air India and has referred to the fragile finances of the company, among various other reasons. Further, NITI Aayog in its report on Air India has stated that further financial support in a mature and competitive aviation market would not be the best use of scarce financial resources of the Government.  The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), in its meeting held on 28.06.2017, had given an in-principle approval for considering strategic disinvestment of Air India and its five subsidiaries.  After no bid was received for strategic disinvestment of Air India by the last date i.e 31.05.2018, the Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM) in its meeting held on 18.06.2018, had, inter-alia, decided the following:; i) in the meantime all near medium term efforts should be made to capture operational efficiency and to improve performance of Air India, ; ii) the non-core land and building assets, that have already been identified should be monetized, iii) the assets could be shifted to Air India Assets Holding Limited so as to retire the debt of Air India and ; iv) the services of extant advisers should be used to carry out above mentioned activities. ; ; Government  has also directed Air India Limited to get financials of Air India and its subsidiaries finalized. Further, an AISAM with new members on its re-constitution will finalise the parameters for disinvestment of Air India. (c): Air India possesses 30 un-utilised tracts of land, details of which are at Annexure.  (d) & (e): The Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs (CCEA) had approved Turn Around Plan (TAP) and Financial Restructure Plan (FRP) of Air India on 12th April 2012 which, inter-alia, includes the monetization of Real Estate Assets in Air India to the tune of Rs.5000 crore over a 10 years period with the annual target of Rs.500 crore from the financial year 2013 onward.  Air India has planned to monetize its unutilised/surplus immovable real estate assets. Till date, Air India has realized an amount of Rs.534.65 crore through sale of its non-core assets in various cities in India and abroad. Air India has also realized a rental income of Rs.314 crore approx. Further, amount of revenue likely to be generated from monetisation of land/properties depends on the bid process and subject to No Objection Certificates (NOCs) from concerned authorities.   Further, even as the Government is committed to the disinvestment of Air India, the Government has approved a Revival Plan of Air India with financial support which focusses on building a competitive and profitable airline Group. The  financial support, inter-alia, includes a cash support of Rs. 3975 crore to Air India, transfer of debt amounting to Rs. 29464 crore from Air India Limited to Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) i.e Air India Assets Holding Limited (AIAHL), providing Government guarantee of Rs. 7600 crore to Air India Limited and Rs. 1300 crore to SPV to meet the interest for Q3/Q4 of Financial Year 2018-19 on the debt transferred to the SPV. Also the entire debt on the SPV debt would be serviced by the Government from Financial Year 2019-20 for which Rs. 2600 crore has been provided.    The Revival Plan of Air India also focuses on the financial and operational efficiencies so that substantial increase in revenue or cost saving can be achieved. Also, as decided in the meeting taken by Finance Minister on 07.09.2018, operational and financial performance parameters and milestones were fixed by the Government and are regularly reviewed via review meetings held under the chairmanship of Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation.
