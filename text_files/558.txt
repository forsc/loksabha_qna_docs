                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	 As per the Third Advance Estimate for the year 2018-19, the production of major foodgrains including rice, cereals and pulses are given as under:Crops	Production (in million tonnes)Rice	115.63Wheat	101.20Maize	27.82Total Cereals	260.15Tur	3.50Gram	10.09Urad	3.21Moong	2.37Total Pulses	23.22Total Foodgrains	283.37Contd…2/- -2-(b): 	As per the Advance Release Calendar of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, the first advance estimate of Gross Value Addition (GVA) of the Agriculture Sector in a financial year (April-March) is normally released during January. Therefore, it is too early to arrive at an assessment of rate of growth of the Agriculture Sector during the current year i.e. 2019-20.(c):	 In an agricultural year (July-June), the First Advance Estimate on production of major agricultural crops is normally released during September. Therefore, it is too early to arrive at an assessment of foodgrain output during the kharif season for the year 2019-20. As per the Third Advance Estimate, kharif foodgrain production in the country during 2018-19 is estimated at a record of 142.75 million tonnes.(d): 	In order to increase production and productivity of foodgrains including pulses, Government has been implementing various schemes viz. National Food Security Mission (NFSM), Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India (BGREI), Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme, Neem Coated Urea, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY), National Agriculture Market Scheme (e-NAM), Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), Interest Subvention Scheme etc. 	The Government is aiming to reorient the agriculture sector policies by focusing on income centric approaches rather than pure production centric approach. Also, giving a major boost for the farmers’ income, Government has substantially increased Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for all mandated crops assuring a minimum return of 50% over all-India weighted average cost of production.Recently, the Government has started the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme to provide income support to all farmer families across the country, subject to certain exclusions relating to higher income groups. The scheme provides a payment of Rs.6000/- per year to the farmers’ families to enable them to take care of expenses related to agriculture and allied activities as well as domestic needs. ********
