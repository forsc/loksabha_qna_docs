ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) Due to the growth in the aviation industry and induction of new type of aircraft in the fleet by the airlines, there is a shortage of type rated Pilot-in-command in the country. However, sufficient numbers of Indian co-pilots are available and employed with airlines. These co -pilots do not possess the training and experience as mandated by the safety regulator to become Pilot-in- command. To cover the shortage of type rated Pilots-in- command, validation of foreign pilots is done as per rule 45 of Aircraft Rules, 1937. The foreign pilots are phased out by the airlines once the co-pilots inducted by them gain the mandated requirements for being designated as Pilot-in-command after undergoing requisite training. ;Further, to overcome the shortage of pilots, all the Schedule and Non-Schedule airlines have been advised to develop pilot training programmes in order to reduce the dependency on foreign pilots. Accordingly, airlines train their pilots to upgrade them as Pilot-in- command to reduce the dependency on foreign pilots.;(b) & (c) No Sir. No such welfare scheme has been introduced by this Ministry.
