(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a) & (b):  Government has been promoting organic/natural farming through dedicated schemes namely  Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and Mission Organic Value Chain Development in North East Region (MOVCDNER).  Farmers are provided financial assistance  of Rs 31000/ ha / 3 years  under  PKVY and  Rs 32500/ ha/ 3years under MOVCDNER for organic inputs such as seeds, bio-fertilisers, bio-pesticides, organic manure, compost/ vermi-compost, botanical extracts etc.  In addition to above, support is also provided for group/ Farmers Producers Organization (FPO) formation, training, certification, value addition and marketing of their organic produce.  Organic cultivation on either side of River Ganga under National Mission of Clean Ganga(NMCG) , natural farming, large area certification and support for individual farmers have also been introduced under PKVY to increase  area under organic farming. Bhartiya Prakritik Krishi Padhati (BPKP), a sub scheme of Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) since 2020-21  is promoted for  traditional indigenous practices .The scheme mainly emphasises on exclusion of all synthetic chemical inputs and promotes on-farm biomass recycling with major stress on biomass mulching, use of cow dung-urine formulations and  plant based preparations.Under BPKP, financial assistance of Rs 12200/ha for 3 years is provided for cluster formation, capacity building and continuous handholding by trained personnel, certification and residue analysis. Further, Government has taken initiatives for carrying out research for  improvement of organic farming in the country through Indian Council of Agricultural Research(ICAR). ICAR through Indian Institute of Farming Systems Research, Modipuram operates a research scheme of All India Network Programme on Organic Farming (AI-NPOF) with 20 co-operating centers covering 16 states involving 11 State Agricultural Universities, 8 ICAR institutes/centres and 1 deemed to be/special heritage university. Following are the outcome of the research of   AI-NPOF:?	Scientific package of practices for organic production of crops in cropping systems have been developed for 51 cropping systems suitable for 12 states. ?	One acre Integrated Organic Farming System (IOFS) models suitable for marginal farmers have been established in Gujarat, Kerala, Meghalaya, Rajasthan, Sikkim and Tamil Nadu which provides scope to generate quality inputs required for organic farming within the farm, thus reducing the cost of production.?	The best performing varieties under organic management for different crops suitable to 12 states have been identified. ?	Traditional varieties have been evaluated and identified for promotion under organic farming and alongside indigenous technical knowledge on organic farming have also been collected and are being validated in 4 States namely Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. (c) to (e):	The State-wise details of total number of farmers adopting organic farming is given  at Annexure I.The proposed target under PKVY and MOVCDNER schemes during 15th Finance Commission is to bring another 7.35 lac hectare area under organic farming during 2022 to 2023 to 2025-2026. All the clusters under PKVY are proposed to be transformed into FPOs in value chain mode for providing end to end support for production, certification, processing and marketing with a view to increase farmer’s income.
