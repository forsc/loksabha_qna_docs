ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) The Integrated Scheme for School Education- Samagra Shiksha envisages the school as a continuum from Pre-School to Senior Secondary levels. National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has recommended age of entry as 3 years for pre-primary education. The States/UTs wise number of pre-primary sections, including Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, is at Annexure-I.(b) The National Early Childhood Care & Education (ECCE) Curriculum Framework, 2013 confirms to the vision of holistic and integrated development of the child, with focus on care and early learning at each sub-stage of the developmental continuum, to support children''s all-round and holistic development. It also mentions that the pre-school curriculum must address the following interrelated domains of holistic development through an integrated and play-based approach i.e. Sensory and Perceptual Development, Physical, Health and Motor Development, Language Development, Cognitive Development, Development of Creative and Aesthetic Appreciation Personal, Social and Emotional Development.(c) As per the NEP 2020, the learning in the pre-school is focused on playful, art and toy integrated activities, which leads to joyful learning and education of children enrolled at pre-school levels. Based on the overall developmental goals for 3 to 6 years, NCERT has done codification and metrics for learning outcome to be achieved in pre-school education.(Source:https://www.education.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/NIPUN_BHARAT_GUIDELINES_EN.pdf).(d) It is observed from the National Achievement Survey(NAS) 2017 report (as published in February 2019), that students who attended pre-primary schools had higher achievement. In high performing States, 73% students had attended pre-primary schools.(Source: https://ncert.nic.in/pdf/NAS/WithReleaseDate_NPPTL.pdf).*****
