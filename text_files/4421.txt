ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (Independent Charge) of the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region[Dr. Jitendra Singh](a)   	There are 691 ongoing projects worth of Rs.15332.04 crore sanctioned under different schemes of this Ministry viz. Non-lapsable Central Pool of Resources (NLCPR)-State scheme, North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme (NESIDS), Social and Infrastructure Development Fund (SIDF), Special Packages and NEC. These projects are at different stages of implementation.(b)  	The total budgetary allocation under these schemes/packages for last three years is Rs.7432.13 crore.(c)       The projects sanctioned under these schemes are executed by the implementing agencies of the state governments/other Government Agencies. As such cost overruns, if any, due non-completion of projects on time, are borne by the concerned state govt. Completion of infrastructure projects depends on many factors including land acquisition, forest clearance, terrain, reduced working season etc. In addition, inadequate number of offers in the bidding process, in some cases, also leads to delay in implementation.
