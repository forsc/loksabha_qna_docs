ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	The State Government of Karnataka has not submitted any Memorandum seeking financial assistance from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) for drought during Kharif 2019 season. In the eventuality of drought and other natural calamities, the State Governments are empowered to initiate necessary relief measures from State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), which is readily available with them. Additional financial assistance, over and above SDRF, is considered from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) on receipt of relief Memoranda from State Governments and in accordance with extant norms and procedures. The state of water scarcity/drought like situation depends largely upon the intensity and extent of South-West Monsoon, which varies from year to year.(b):	Agriculture is a state subject. However, a detailed advisory has been issued by the Government of India to all States/Union Territories before the onset of monsoon 2019 season for reviewing the States’ preparedness in managing any weather related contingency for mitigating the adverse impacts of an aberrant monsoon. The advisory, iner-alia, include updating the District Agriculture Contingency Plans & promoting cultivation of less water consuming crops by crop diversification. Under the National Food Security Mission (NFSM), NFSM-Pulses, NFSM-Coarse Cereals & NFSM-Nutri Cereals is being implemented in several states.******
