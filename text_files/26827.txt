                                                         MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS & ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (c)	 A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT TO BE LAID ON THE TABLE OF THE LOK SABHA IN RESPECT OF PARTS (a) TO (c) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 235 FOR 4TH AUGUST, 2021 REGARDING “IMPLEMENTATION OF BHARATNET PROJECT”(a)	BharatNet project is being implemented in a phased manner to provide broadband connectivity to all Gram Panchayats (GPs) in the country. As on 09.07.2021, a total number of 1,57,919 Gram Panchayats have been made Service Ready in the country. The scope of BharatNet has been recently extended upto all inhabited villages beyond GPs.The implementation of the project is affected mainly on account of:(i)	GPs are widely dispersed across remote corners of the country, covering difficult terrains (including Hilly/ Rocky) and also difficulty for access in Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas;(ii)	Phase-I of the project began only in the second half of 2014 due to field survey of GPs and pilot testing of the technology model. (iii)	In Phase-I, only one media (i.e. is underground Optical Fibre Cable) has been used to cover GPs, and Right of Way (RoW) issues impacted the implementation.(iv)	Under BharatNet Phase-II, about 65,000 GPs in 8 States are being implemented by the State Government under State-led model. The implementation of the same is not meeting the targeted time-lines and is adversely affecting the completion of the Project. (v)	Since March 2020, pursuant to lockdown and movement restrictions due to COVID-19, the progress of the project has been adversely affected. (b) & (c)	The State/UT-wise details of the planned GPs, Service Ready GPs, and the GPs which are yet to be made Service Ready in the country (including Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha and Rajasthan) under BharatNet project, are given in Annexure-I. As on 09.07.2021, total 195 GPs in the District of Udaipur and 36 GPs in the Parliamentary constituency of  Pali are yet to be made Service Ready under BharatNet project. The targeted date for completion of the BharatNet project in the country is August, 2023.
