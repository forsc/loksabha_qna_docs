                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)  (a)	 to (e):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 51(H)   FOR ANSWER ON 05th FEBRUARY, 2020 REGARDING “BAN ON IMPORT OF CHINESE PRODUCTS”.(a). Import policy for goods is free except when regulated by way of ‘Prohibition’, ‘Restriction’  and ‘Exclusive Trading through State Trading Enterprises(STEs) on the grounds of (i) public morals, (ii) protection of human, animal or plant life and health, (iii) protection of patents and copy rights, (iv) protection of national treasures of artistic, historical and archaeological value, (v) conservation of exhaustible resources, (vi) prevention of trade in fissionable materials, (vii) of traffic in arms, ammunitions and implements of war.  At present, there are more than 550 tariff lines under these three regulated categories which are applicable for all countries. Government from time to time reviews import policy and takes appropriate action as the situation warrants. Since 2008 Government has prohibited import of milk and milk products including chocolate and chocolate products and candies/ confectionery/ food preparations with milk or milk solids as ingredients only from China on the grounds of protecting human health and life. In the recent past, Government has banned import of Polymethyl methacrylate, e-cigarettes, plastic waste, pet flakes made out of used pet bottles and National flag not conforming to Flag Code of India from all countries. Further, Bio-fuels, agarbatti and refined palm oil have been put under restricted list of import from all countries.(b) & (c). The radiation level of mobile handsets is subject to a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) value limit of 1.6 Watt/Kg averaged over a mass of 1 gram of human tissue. All the mobile handset manufacturers, both indigenous and imported, have to provide a self-declaration in respect of SAR value based on certification from internationally accredited labs or accredited by Telecom Engineering Centre (TEC), India to TEC. Such self-declared SAR limits shall be subjected to TEC audit as and when required. This SAR level is applicable to all mobile handset manufactured indigenously as well as imported to India.Compulsory registration under “Electronics and Information Technology Goods (Requirement of Compulsory Registration) Order, 2012” which addresses safety standards is required for 44 notified electronic products including mobile phones. The stock, sale, import, manufacture etc without having valid Registration and Standard Mark of these items is prohibited. The details of cases pertaining to China which failed the prescribed standards of the Order are placed at Annexure. (d) & (e). As per the Foreign Trade Policy, imported goods are subject to domestic laws, rules, orders, regulations, technical specifications, environmental and safety norms and to that extent Indian consumers are protected from low quality/substandard goods. The mandatory BIS/other standards are applicable to imported goods also. Import of food/edible items are subject to FSSAI standards. Import of plant & plant based products are subject to Plant Quarantine measures and sanitary & phyto-sanitary measures. Import of animal & animal based products are subject to sanitary import permits. These provisions apply to Chinese goods also, and have been used from time to time, as indicated above.**** ANNEXUREANNEXURE IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 51 FOR 5TH FEBRUARY 2020 REGARDING “BAN ON IMPORT OF CHINESE PRODUCTS”S.NO.
