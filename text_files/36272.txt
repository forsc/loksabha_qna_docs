                                                        THE MINISTER OF STEEL		   (SHRI RAM CHANDRA PRASAD SINGH)(a)to(e):  The amount under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is allocated and utilised by various Companies in accordance with the broad framework provided by the Government under section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 (‘Act’) and Companies (CSR policy) Rules, 2014, as amended from time to time. The Act, inter-alia, stipulates that companies exceeding the threshold limits, as specified in the Companies Act, 2013, have to allocate at least 2% of their average net profits of the company made during the three immediately preceding financial years for CSR activities. The Board of a company is empowered to plan, decide, execute and monitor CSR activities of the company. Schedule VII of the Companies Act indicates the activities that can be undertaken by the companies, which, inter alia, include Health care, Education and Rural Development Projects, etc. Further, the first proviso to section 135 (5) of the Act provides that the company shall give preference to local areas and the areas around it where it operates.  No funds are received from State Governments under CSR. Year-wise details of CSR amount and expenditure incurred on major CSR activities in various States/UTs by CPSEs under the Ministry of Steel during the last three years, i.e. 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21, are given at Annexure -I. ********
