THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI SOM PARKASH)(a) to (f):	Government of India has been continuously endeavoring to put in place measures for expanding industries in India. The intent has been to enhance industrialization  keeping in mind the national interest and removing policy bottlenecks that have been hindering the investment inflows into the country. However, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) has not currently developed any scheme for setting up of industries specifically for the state of Bihar. Further, since this Department deals with policy matters related to Industries, it does not maintain any centralized data on the number and location of industries set up in a particular state. The matters related to industrialization of a specific state are dealt by that state only as Industries is a state subject. *****
