The Act also has provision of punishment with imprisonment upto three months or fine of up to Rs. 5000/- or both for children or relatives, who abandon senior citizens. All the States/UTs have notified the MWPSC Act, 2007 and have taken consequential steps like appointment of Maintenance officers, Maintenance Tribunals and Appellate Tribunals.(c) & (d): The existing National Policy on Older Persons (NPOP) was announced in 1999 to reaffirm the commitment of the Government to ensure the well being of the older persons.
