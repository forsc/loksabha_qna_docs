(a) whether the demand is being made by trade unions/Government employees to restore the old pension scheme for the Central Government employees as the pension amount is lower and uncertain under the new pension scheme which was implemented in the year 2004;(b) if so, whether the Government is considering the aforesaid demand of the employees; and (c) if so, the details thereof and if not, the reasons therefor?






ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (Finance) (a) Yes, Sir. (b) and (c) Due to rising and unsustainable pension bill, the Government had made a conscious move to shift from the defined benefit, pay-as-you-go pension scheme to defined contribution pension scheme now called as National Pension System (NPS). The transition also helped in freeing the limited resources of the Government for more productive and socio- economic sectoral development.There is no proposal to replace the NPS with old pension scheme in respect of Central Government employees recruited on or after 01.01.2004.******
