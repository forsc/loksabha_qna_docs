                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (e): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF STARRED QUESTION NO.420 BY SHRI ASHOK MAHADEORAO NETE TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 24.03.2021 REGARDING WADSA-GADCHIROLI RAIL NETWORK(a) and (b)  Yes, Sir. Wadsa-Gadchiroli (52.36 km) new rail line project was included in Pink Book 2011-12 at an abstract cost of ?229 crore.  Project is on cost sharing basis,  Government of Maharashtra has to share 50% cost of the project. Anticipated cost of the project is ?1096 crore, so far, an expenditure of ?42.07 crore has been incurred on the project and an outlay of ?11 crore has been proposed for this project for financial year 2021-22. Land acquisition, forestry and Wild Life clearances for the project has been taken up. Project involve  acquisition of 133.73 hectare revenue land and forestry clearance of 71.72 hectare forest land. So far, 13.13 hectare revenue land (Government land) only has been handed over and land acquisition of balance 120.60 hectare (90%) revenue land is pending. In-principal approval of 71.72 hectare land was granted in April 2019 but Stage-II approval and working permission is still awaited. There is an extra ordinary delay in granting forestry clearance for the project. State Forest Department in consultation with  Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and National Tiger Conservation Agency (NTCA) has suggested expensive mitigation measures, due to which  cost of project has increased from ?860.92 crore to ?1096 crore. Since Government of Maharashtra has to share 50% cost of project, therefore, Government of Maharashtra has been requested to confirm sharing of 50% of revised cost of project (Total revised cost ?1096 crore). Confirmation of State Government is awaited. So far Government of Maharashtra has deposited only ?10 Cr towards their share in the project.  Railway projects in Maharashtra are getting delayed on account of pending land acquisition and non deposition of State share in cost sharing project by Government of Maharashtra. Details are below:i.	04 New Line projects of total length 661 km costing ?9305 crore are suffering due to non acquisition of 929 hectare revenue land and forestry clearance of 173 hectare forest land and   01 Gauge Conversion project name Ratlam-Mhow-Akola-Khandwa of total length 496 km costing ?5411 crore is suffering as State Board of Wild Life, Maharashtra is not forwarding Wild Life Clearance proposal of 32 hectare forest land in Melghat Tiger Reserve falling in Amalkhurd-Akot section of the project to National Board of Wild Life (NBWL). Similarly, 12 Doubling projects of total length 2057 km costing ?18511 crore are suffering due to non-acquisition of 424 hectare revenue land and forestry clearance of 53 hectare forest land.ii.	Total ?549 crore is outstanding against Government of Maharashtra in 3 cost sharing new line projects (Ahmednagar-Beed-Parli : ?348 crore, Wardha-Nanded: ?190 crore, Wardha-Gadchiroli: ?10.81 crore).(c) and (d) Railway has completed Wadsa-Yard remodeling work in July, 2017, further work would be taken up only after getting confirmation of State Government of Maharashtra for sharing 50% revised cost of project and after handing over of requisite encumbrance free land to Railways by Government of Maharashtra. (e) The timely completion of Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials offorest department, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions etc. and all these factors affect the completion time of the project. As such, no confirmed time  frame for completion of project can be ascertained at this stage. However, Railway is making all the efforts for expeditious completion of projects.Average annual budget allocation for infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/partly in the State of Maharashtra, during 2014-19 has increased to ?4801 crore  per year from ?1171 crore per year during 2009-14. Thus, an increase of 310% over the average annual budget allocation of  2009-14. For financial year 2021-22 budget outlay of ?7107 crore has been proposed for these projects, which is 507% more than average annual outlay during 2009-14.During  2014-19, 596 Km project length (87 Km New Line, 92 Gauge Conversion and 417 Km Doubling) falling fully/partly in the State of Maharashtra have been commissioned, which is 104% more than total commissioning during 2009-14 (292 km). In 2019-20, 183 km project length (183 km Doubling) falling fully/partly in Maharashtra have been commissioned, which is 213% more than average annual commissioning during 2009-14(58.4 km/year).*****
