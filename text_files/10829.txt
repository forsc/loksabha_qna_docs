ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER FOR MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND MINISTRY OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a)	Yes Sir. India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted normal monsoon during the 2019 monsoon season. The long range forecast for the 2019 southwest monsoon rainfall was issued in 3 stages. The first stage long range forecast issued on 15th April consisted of only forecast for season (June-September) rainfall over the country as a whole. In the second stage (31st May),  forecast for season rainfall over the four broad geographical regions (Northwest India, Central India, South Peninsula and Northeast India) and that for monthly rainfall over the country as a whole for the months of July and August were also issued. In the 3rd stage (1st August), the forecast for the rainfall during the second half of the monsoon season over the country as a whole was issued. Annexure- I gives the summary of the verification of the long-range forecasts issued for the 2019 Southwest monsoon. The first stage forecast for the season (June-September) rainfall over the country as a whole issued in April was 96% of Long Period Average (LPA) with a model error of ± 5% of LPA.  The update issued in May for this forecast was (96% of LPA) with a model error of ± 4% of LPA. Both these forecasts were suggesting the normal category i.e. 96-104 % of LPA. The LPA of the season rainfall over the country as a whole for the period 1951-2000 is 89 cm. Details of long-range rainfall forecasts issued by IMD for the 2019 southwest monsoon season (June- September) and realized rainfall during the season is at Annexure – I .(b)& (c)	Yes Sir. IMD keeps track of forecasts issued by various foreign climate agencies including that of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) as well as Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC). Inferences derived from forecasts from various centres for the 3 months periods of JJA and JAS of 2019 are given in Annexure II. The forecasts for 2019 monsoon season were issued in April/May 2019. The coupled model forecast from JMA indicated below normal precipitation over most parts of the country. Inferences derived from seasonal forecasts from various climate centers for the 2019 southwest monsoon season are at Annexure- II. (d)	Yes Sir, there has been noticeable improvement in the skill of IMD seasonal forecast for the southwest monsoon season rainfall over the country as a whole. The average absolute error (difference between forecast and actual rainfall) during the last 10 years (2010-2019) was 5.62% of LPA compared to the average absolute error of 8.84% of LPA during the previous 10 years (2000-2009).
