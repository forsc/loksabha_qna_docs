ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) &(b)The Government Policy is to ensure more trees are planted than removed under different developmental proposals approved under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. In the last three years 76,72,337 number of trees were removed and plantation of more than 7,87,00,000 trees have been stipulated under compensatory afforestation. The year wise details of trees removed and stipulated for plantation are annexed.The trees are removed only when it is absolutely necessary. As a general policy, more trees are planted than number of trees approved for removal under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. This policy has been contributing to the increase in India’s forest cover. As per the provisions of Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, Government of India accords prior permission for change in land use from forest to non-forest. Such permissions are accorded subject to recommendation of the concerned State/UT Government and for unavoidable developmental projects/purposes. While according such permissions, it is ensured that minimum number of trees are removed which are inevitable. Government’s efforts to plant more trees than removed has also been reflected in the assessments in biennial India State of Forest Reports (ISFR) by Forest Survey of India.The forest and tree cover as reported in ISFR-2019 has increased by 13,209sq km as compared to that of ISFR 2015 assessment.	***
