                                                        THE MINISTER OF MINES, COAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a) & (b): The National Mineral Policy prescribes beneficiation of low grade ores into commercial useable grades for conserving mineral resources of the country. As per Rule 18 of the Mineral Conservation and Development Rules, 2017, beneficiation studies are to be carried out by the lessee, if the sub-grade ore or mineral contains certain recoverable product. The beneficiation investigations are to be carried out from a laboratory accredited by National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration or an International Organization for Standardization laboratory approved by the Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM), a sub-ordinate office under Ministry of Mines, or the Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD), as the case may be.Further, the Mineral Processing Laboratories of IBM have undertaken Research & Development studies on different iron ores of the country viz. low grade & sub-grade ores, fines from dumps, slimes from tailing ponds etc. Suitable process flowsheets have been developed for recovery of iron values from various types of iron ore in India. IBM has also been conducting beneficiation studies on G2 level exploration blocks of iron ore to assess their amenability to beneficiation and upgradability before auctioning, since last six years.(c): No such data is maintained by Ministry of Mines.(d) & (e): Studies have been undertaken on beneficiation of low grade iron ore by IBM and it has been found that beneficiation of 45% iron ore can produce concentrate of 60% iron suitable for sinter & pellet making.(f) & (g): Ministry of Mines has constituted a committee vide O.M. No. 1/6/2021-M.VI dated 27.12.2021 to examine the issues regarding utilization of low and lean grade iron ore resources in the country.*****
