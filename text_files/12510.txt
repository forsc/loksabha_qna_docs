Under the SAGY framework, the development of Gram Panchayats is envisaged through convergence and implementation of existing Government Schemes and Programmes under the administrative control of respective Ministries without allocating additional funds. The guidelines of as many as 23 Central Schemes have been amended or advisories issued to enable priority for the SAGY Gram Panchayats. A compilation of 223 Central Sector/ Centrally Sponsored and 1,806 State Schemes for convergence under SAGY for the benefit of Members of Parliament, District and Village level officials have been prepared and shared with the States/UTs and also uploaded on the scheme portal (saanjhi.gov.in). (c) & (d): The Guidelines of SAGY was released on 11th October, 2014 and are available on the SAGY portal (saanjhi.gov.in).  As per the Guidelines, primarily, the goal was to develop three Adarsh Grams by March 2019 and thereafter, five more (one per year) by 2024 under the guidance of each Hon’ble Member of Parliament.
