ANSWER




 MINISTER OF COAL, MINES & PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) a.       Details of Coal mines auctioned/allocated to various players since January 2015 is given in Annexure enclosed. b.       Out of 124 coal blocks allocated/auctioned since January 2015, 46 coal blocks have got Mine Opening Permission with combined PRC of 165.55 MT.  c.       Auction of coal blocks is a continuous process. Companies may apply as and when  Notice Inviting Tender is published by the Nominated Authority, Ministry of Coal.d.       Subsequent to the assessment of likely demand of coal in the country and consequent demand on CIL as laid out in Vision 2030, CIL has envisaged to enhance its production to 1BT by the year 2024-25 and beyond from current level production of about 600 MT in order to meet the demand of coal indigenously and to eliminate non-essential import of coal in the country.          CIL has already identified all resources required that will contribute to its 1 BT production plan and its related issues/enablers like requirement of EC/FC, land, evacuation constraints etc. CIL is committed to achieve its 1 BT production plan with the active support of MoC and all other stake holders. It is worth to mention here that, CIL shall adhere to its 1 BT coal production plan but the demand scenario shall decide the production/supply in future.       The progress made so far by CIL since April, 20 to February, 22 to achieve 1 billion tonne coal production is as follows:•	49 Projects Reports including Greenfield and expansion projects have been approved by CIL & its subsidiaries to create additional capacity of coal production.•	Environmental Clearance granted for 50 proposals with an incremental capacity of 62.41 Mty.•	Stage-II Forest Clearance granted for 13 proposals involving 2468.24 Ha of forest land.•	5459.86 Ha of land have been possessed.•	6 First Mile Connectivity Projects of CHP / SILO have been commissioned with aggregate capacity of 82 Mty.****
