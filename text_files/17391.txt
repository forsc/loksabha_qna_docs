Scenario 1 (-58% in arrivals in 2020) if travel restrictions lifted in early July.  2.	Scenario 2 (-70% in 2020) based on the same in early September.3.	Scenario 3 (-78% in 2020) based on the same in early December. (c) & (d):	Yes, Sir. As per the UNWTO report (World Tourism barometer) for August/September 2020, Asia and the Pacific was most affected among world regions with 72% less international tourist arrivals in January-June 2020. (e):	No formal study has been instituted for assessment of impact of covid-19 on Tourism sector in 2020-21. However, several rounds of discussions and brainstorming sessions with industry stakeholders indicate massive loss of revenue. In view of the highly unorganized nature of the sector, the impact in numerical terms can only be ascertained in due course.(f):	Does not arise. *******
