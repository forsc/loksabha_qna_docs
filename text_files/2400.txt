ANSWER




MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS (SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a)& (b): Yes, Sir. The Ministry of Minority Affairs (MoMA) is implementing the following scholarship schemes for educational empowerment of six centrally notified Minority communities viz. Jain, Buddhist, Sikh, Zoroastrian (Parsi), Muslim and Christian: (i)	Pre-Matric Scholarship Scheme- The scholarship is provided to minority students studying in class I to X in Government/ recognized Private schools.(ii)	Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme- The scholarship is provided to minority students studying in Class XI to Ph.D level in Government/ recognized Private schools/Colleges/Institutes. (iii)	Merit-cum-Mean based Scholarship Scheme - The scholarship is awarded for pursuing professional and technical courses at under-graduate and post-graduate levels, in institutions recognized by the appropriate authority. In all the above schemes, 30% Scholarships are earmarked for girl students. The detailed scheme guidelines of these schemes are available on the website of Ministry i.e.www.minorityaffairs.gov.in. The government during the last five years has provided 3.18 crores scholarships to students from amongst the six centrally notified Minorities namely, Jain, Buddhist, Sikh, Parsi, Muslim and Christian. Out of these, girls constitute more than 50% of the beneficiaries. During the next five years, the Ministry of Minority Affairs (MoMA) proposes to provide Pre-Matric, Post-Matric and Merit-cum-Means scholarships to five crore economically Weaker-section students from the six centrally notified Minority communities. This will include more than 50% of girl students. The three scholarship schemes are now being implemented through the National Scholarship Portal and since 2015, the scholarships schemes are being implemented under direct benefit transfer (DBT) mode to improve the efficiency and bring transparency by removing duplicity and stopping pilferages.
