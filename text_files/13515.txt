ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (d) Two (02) airlines  M/s Indigo and M/s Go Air are operating Airbus A320 aircraft installed with Pratt & Whitney (P&W) 1100G engines.Four events were encountered on Airbus 320 Neo aircraft fitted with P&W1100 G Engine operated by M/s Indigo during the course of a week during October 2019. DGCA studied the pattern and found that engines with more than 2900 flight hours were involved in the above events and further, in the interest of safety, issued a directive to both Indigo and Go Air on the 28th and 29th October 2019, respectively, wherein both airlines were asked to operate only those aircraft which have at least one modified engine, if the other engine installed on the same aircraft has accumulated more than 2900 flight hours. The directive was complied by both the airlines by 24th November 2019.;In light of more number of events experienced on Indigo fleet, the DGCA issued another directive on 1st November 2019 to M/s Indigo calling for replacement of unmodified engines with modified engines on its entire fleet within 90 days, i.e., by 31st January 2020.;The matter was reviewed by DGCA. About 70% of the total engines of operational fleet of Indigo Airline were found to be modified and all the aircraft had  atleast one modified engine on their wing.;However, in view of the logistical challenges involved in replacing of large number of engines, DGCA has extended the timeline for complete removal of unmodified engine to 31st May 2020.;Go Air has also installed one modified engine in all its aircraft and they have also been asked to replace all the unmodified engines by 31st May 2020.
