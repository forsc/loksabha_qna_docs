                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b) As per the mapping of rivers on India-WRIS portal,  the country is divided into 25 major river basins. Details of major river basins are given at  Annexure–I.The flow in the rivers is dynamic and depend on many parameters such as rainfall, its distribution and intensity in the catchment, catchment characteristics, withdrawals /utilizations of water etc. Central Water Commission carries out hydrological observation on all important / major rivers in the country. Most of major rivers in the country are perennial in nature. (c) to (f)	Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in collaboration with the State Pollution Control Boards is regularly monitoring the water quality of rivers across the country through a network of monitoring stations under the National Water Quality Monitoring Programme. Based on the monitoring results in terms of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) , a key indicator of organic pollution, CPCB have identified 351 polluted stretches on 323 rivers in the country. Details of identified polluted stretches are given at Annexure-II. Rivers in the country are mainly polluted due to discharge of untreated and partially treated sewage from cities/towns and industrial effluents. Non-point sources of pollution like agricultural runoff, runoff from solid waste dump sites, etc. also contribute to pollution of rivers.Various measures are being taken both by Central and State Governments to prevent pollution of rivers.  Central Government assists State Governments and Urban Local bodies through schemes like ‘Namami Gange’, National River Conservation Plan (NRCP), Atal Mission for Rejuvenation, and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), etc. 		 Further, CPCB/State Pollution Control Board and Pollution Control Committees monitor industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under  provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.***** ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) & (b) of Lok
