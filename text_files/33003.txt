                                                    (a) 	whether the Government has undertaken steps to adopt advanced dredging strategies such as maintaining local and regional sediment levels, recharging salt marsh areas with fine grained dredging to meet demand of all dredging activities of the ports and if so, the details thereof; and (b) 	whether the Government proposes to formulate a dredging policy and if so, the details thereof?






ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b) The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways has promulgated in 2021 Dredging Guidelines for Major Ports with Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for undertaking Capital and Maintenance Dredging at Major Ports. Most of the material from dredging is unsuitable for recharging salt marsh areas as they are contaminated. It is uneconomical to use the spoils as the channels are far away from marshy land.                                          *****
