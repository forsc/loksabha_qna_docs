ANSWER




                                                        (a)	to (e): Government of India launched “Vanbandhu Kalyan Yojana (VKY)” during 2014-15 for holistic development of tribal people across the country. The VKY envisages to ensure delivery of goods and services to the tribal population across the country with outcome-oriented approach while striking at the critical gaps through appropriate convergence of resources and institutional mechanism. The scheme of VKY has been discontinued from 2016-17 and it has been envisaged that the fund requirement under the VKY strategy will be fulfilled out of the Tribal Sub Plan (now, Schedule Tribe Component), which caters to sectoral development including support for education, health, power, roads, sanitation, water supply, livelihood etc. by way of specific fund allocation under various schemes / programmes of concerned Central Ministries and the State Governments.
