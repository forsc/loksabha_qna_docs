                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FORMINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYAND EARTH SCIENCES(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)(a)to (b): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT LAID ON THE TABLE OF THE LOK SABHA IN REPLY TO (a) to (b) OF STARRED QUESTION NO. *110 REGARDING “ACCURATE WEATHER FORECAST” TO BE ANSWERED ON, 09 FEBRUARY, 2022(a)	Yes Sir. India Meteorological Department (IMD) follows a seamless forecasting strategy. The long-range forecasts (for the whole season) issued are being followed with extended range forecast issued on every Thursday with a validity period of four weeks. To follow up the extended range forecast, IMD issues short to medium range forecast and warnings at 36 meteorological sub-divisions levels daily four times valid up to next five days with an outlook for subsequent two days. The short to medium range forecast and warning at district and station level are issued by state level Meteorological Centres (MCs)/Regional Meteorological Centres (RMCs) with a validity of next five days and are updated twice a day. The short to medium range forecast is followed by very short range forecast of severe weather up to three hours (nowcast) for all the districts and 1089 cities and towns. These nowcasts are updated every three hours.While issuing the warning, suitable colour code is used to bring out the impact of the severe weather expected and to signal the disaster management authorities about the course of action to be taken with respect to impending disaster weather event.  Green color corresponds to no warning hence no action is needed, yellow color corresponds to be watchful and get updated information, orange color to be alert and be prepared to take action whereas red color signals to take action.IMD is issuing Impact Based Forecast (IBF) which give details of what the weather will do rather than what the weather will be. It contains the details of impacts expected from the severe weather elements and guidelines to general public about do''s and don''ts while getting exposed to severe weather. These guidelines are finalised in collaboration with National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and is already implemented successfully for cyclone, heat wave, thunderstorm and heavy rainfall. Technologies used to provide above forecasts and warnings are provided as Annexure-I.(b)	Though we are not dependent entirely on any foreign entity for weather forecasting, the bilateral and multilateral international agreements with various Government agencies in the field of Earth system science, helps the Ministry to support research proposals, joint observational campaigns, joint development work, exchange of resource personnel and training abroad etc. The details of collaboration in various fields of Meteorological and Climatological Services and the MoU signed by Govt. of India with other countries and foreign government agencies are provided in Annexure-II.
