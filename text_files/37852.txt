                                                                                  THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE                   MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                         (SHRI KAUSHAL KISHORE)(a)& (b):  Land and Colonization are State subjects. Therefore, schemes related to housing for people living in urban area are being implemented by State/ Union Territories (UTs). Data related to housing schemes of States/ UTs is not maintained by this Ministry. However, Ministry of Housing and Urban   Affairs  is  supplementing    the  efforts  of  State/ UTs  by   providing Central Assistance under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban (PMAY-U) since 25.06.2015 for construction of houses for all eligible families/ beneficiaries. Eligible beneficiaries can avail the benefit of PMAY-U through any one of the available four verticals i.e., Beneficiary-led Construction (BLC), Affordable House in Partnership (AHP), In-Situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) and Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) based on their preference. Based on the project proposals submitted by States/ UTs, more than 115 lakh houses have been sanctioned across the country, out of which more than 95 lakh have been grounded and more than 56 lakh have been completed/ delivered to the beneficiaries so far. The Scheme Guidelines are available at https://pmay-urban.gov.in/uploads/guidelines/62381c744c188-Updated-guidelines-of-PMAY-U.pdf. The State-wise details of houses sanctioned, grounded and completed/ delivered under PMAY-U are at Annexure-I. The district-wise details of houses sanctioned, grounded and completed/delivered in the States of West Bengal and Rajasthan under PMAY-U are at Annexure-II.(c): All cities covered under Swachh Bharat Mission - Urban are expected to participate in Swachh Survekshan. No financial incentives are provided by Government of India for participating; it is part of Mission’s monitoring interventions. (d): West Bengal did not take part in Swachh Survekshan 2020 and 2021. The major results of Swachh Survekshan 2021 in Rajasthan are at Annexure-III. e): The details of houses sanctioned under PMAY-U in Bankura, Jaipur and Ajmer are 11,366, 64,965 and 10,090 respectively.                                       ******
