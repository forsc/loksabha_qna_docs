ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SHRI GIRIRAJ SINGH)(a) to (c):   A statement is laid on the Table of the House. Statement in reply to Parts (a) to (c) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 85 for 08.02.2022 (a): 	State/UT-wise details of fund released under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) during the last five financial year and current financial year 2021-22 (as on 01.02.2022) is given at Annexure.   (b) & (c):  Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is a demand driven wage employment programme and funds are released to the States/UTs on the basis of "agreed to" Labour Budget (LB) and performance of the States/UTs during the financial year. The funds release under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is based on the provision of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and guidelines. As per the guidelines, the first installment of the first tranche is released in the first half of April after adjusting unspent balance available with the States and considering the pending liabilities, if any. If the proposal for Second Tranche is submitted after 30th September then the Audit Report and Audited Utilization Certificate of the previous financial year are required. Also, States/UTs have to ensure the compliance of the directives of Central Government regarding procedure for release of funds under the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) and monitoring utilization of the funds released.          Fund release to States/UTs (including Tamil Nadu) is a continuous process and Central Government is committed in making funds available keeping in view the demand for work on the ground. In current financial year 2021-22 (as on 01.02.2022) an amount of Rs. 7,609.95 crore has been released for wage, material & administrative component to the State of Tamil Nadu for the implementation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS. There is no pending liability for wage component for the State of Tamil Nadu as on 01.02.2022. *******
