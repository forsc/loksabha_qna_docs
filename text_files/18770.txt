ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY) (a) to (e) : ''Public Order'' and ''Police'' are State subjects as per the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibilities of maintaining law and order, including investigation, registration/ prosecution of crimes, conviction of accused, protection of life and property etc. rest primarily with -2-L.S.US.Q NO. 93 FOR 02.02.2021  the respective State Governments. Central Government keeps a constant watch on the internal security scenario of the country through its security agencies and responds appropriately to the emergent situation. Among other measures, alerts and advisories are issued to the law enforcement agencies whenever any threat to internal security is perceived. The Central Government also provides Central Armed Police Forces to the States/Union Territories upon request.In so far NCT of Delhi is concerned, Delhi Police has informed that 39 cases have been registered against the farmers protesting the recently passed ‘Farm Laws’ between September to December, 2020 at Delhi border. Delhi Police has also informed that one suicide case has been reported to them during the protest against Farm Laws at the Delhi border.As regards use of tear gas and resorting to Lathi charge against protesting farmers by the Delhi Police, it has been reported by Delhi Police that at Delhi border, large convoys of protesting farmers in tractor trolleys tried to furiously force their way and go past Police barricades to enter Delhi to mark their protest against the recently enacted ‘Farm Laws’. They aggressively resorted to rioting, damage to Government property and used criminal force to  deter public  servants  from the discharge of their duty, thereby  inflicting \-3-L.S.US.Q NO. 93 FOR 02.02.2021injuries to the on-duty police personnel. Moreover, social distancing was not followed by the farmers/protestors and they gathered in large numbers without face masks amid Covid-19 pandemic. The farmers’ actions left the Delhi Police with no option but to use tear gas, water cannons and mild force to control the crowd.*****
