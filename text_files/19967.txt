ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) Yes, an agreement for Electronic Exchange of Customs Data of postal shipments was signed between India Post and United States Postal Service on 24th October, 2020. The agreement shall enable transmission of electronic customs data of international postal items before their physical arrival at the destination. It shall also enable faster Customs clearance of Postal items. (b) The agreement will facilitate faster Customs clearance of Postal Shipments to the United States of America, which will be helpful in faster delivery and is likely to increase the mail volume and revenue of India Post.(c)	The Department of Posts (DoP) has expanded the access for the exporters through postal channel by increasing the number of Foreign Post Offices from 5 in 2017 to 28 notified Foreign Post Offices. In addition, Postal Bill of Exports (PBE) has been introduced and software development for electronic filing of PBE has been undertaken to ensure ease of documentation and customs clearance processes.(d) & (e) Yes, there has been a decrease in the revenue earned by India post due to Covid-19 pandemic. The revenue of DoP from Postal Operations in first three quarters of financial year 2020-21 is about Rs. 2315 Crore against about Rs. 3032 Crore during the same period in 2019-20. In order to increase the revenue, the Department of Posts has already diversified and is providing first mile to last mile solutions i.e., booking, transmission, and delivery of e-commerce products under Speed Post and Parcels. Value additions including pick up for bulk customers, Cash on Delivery, volume discounts, etc. are also being provided. To further leverage the postal network, Parcel Network Optimization Project (PNOP) has been undertaken to increase the parcel handlingcapacity. Under this project, 188 Parcel Hubs and 100 Mechanized Nodal Delivery Centres (NDCs) have been set up across the country. A nation-wide Road Transport Network (RTN) has also been rolled out since April, 2020 on 56 long-haul routes. Besides DoP is providing ‘Book Now Pay Later’ (BNPL) facility to its bulk Customers for easy settlement of accounts.(f)  The other Steps taken to strengthen and boost income of India Post include the following major initiatives:•	Technology induction to improve the quality of service like track & trace of postal articles, Core Banking System (CBS), online premium payment of Postal Life Insurance, use of Mobile Apps to increase the number of transactions as well as revenue.  •	Department has expanded all Post Office Savings Schemes to all Post Offices with the objective of comprehensive financial inclusion and addition in savings bank accounts.•	Provision of Citizen-Centric Services, which also fetch revenue to the Government, through Post Offices including Post Office Passport Seva Kendras, Aadhar Updation and Enrolment Centres, Common Service Centres, providing Digital Life Certificates (Jeevan Praman) etc.•	Doorstep payment of money through Aadhaar enabled Payment System (AePS) of India Post Payments Bank.
