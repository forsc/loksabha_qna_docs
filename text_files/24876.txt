                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a): Under the National COVID Vaccination Program, from 16th January to 30th April 2021, 100% of vaccine doses were procured by Government of India and provided free of cost to State Governments.From 1st May to 20th June 2021, “The Liberalized Pricing and Accelerated National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy” was brought in effect in order to incentivize production by vaccine manufacturers and encourage new COVID-19 vaccines. Under this strategy, States/UTs and private hospitals were allowed to procure COVID-19 vaccine directly from manufacturers. Government of India procured 50% of monthly vaccine production by the domestic manufacturers, the State Government and private hospitals procured remaining 50% doses.  The quantity of doses available for State/UT and private hospitals was worked out on State- wise population of 18 to 44 years on pro-rata basis.The “Revised Guidelines for Implementation of National COVID Vaccination Program” were issued on 8th June 2021, to be effective from 21st June 2021 under which Government of India is procuring 75% of the COVID-19 vaccines produced in the country and providing it free of cost to States/UTs. The States/UTs, in turn, will administer the vaccines free of cost to all citizens as per priority. The domestic vaccine manufacturers have the option to provide 25% of their monthly vaccine production directly to private hospitals.The Guidelines were reviewed and revised keeping in view the experiences gained from 1st May 2021 and the repeated requests received from States. (b): Vaccine doses provided free of cost by Government of India are allocated to States/UTs based on criteria such as pro-rata target population, the progress of vaccination in the State/UT and vaccine wastage.(c): The number of citizens vaccinated with first and second dose of COVID-19 vaccines, State/UT-wise, is placed at Annexure.(d): Government of India has secured COVID-19 vaccines for the eligible beneficiaries as per the availability of vaccines in the country. The export quantity comprised vaccines committed under international agreements by the domestic manufacturer to COVAX and its individual commitments to other countries/organizations and vaccines supplied through “Vaccine Maitri” inititaive.(e): As on date, no foreign COVID-19 vaccine has been purchased or received as donation by Government of India. In view of the dynamic and evolving nature of COVID-19 pandemic it is expected that all beneficiaries aged 18 years and above will be vaccinated by December 2021.(f):  The COVID-19 vaccination is guided by National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) on the basis of concurrent scientific evidence. The prioritization for vaccination has been done with an aim to protect the pandemic response and health system and to have maximum impact on reduction of disease & deaths due to COVID-19. This was later followed by age-based prioritization, which is considered equitable and which has also been the practice globally.
