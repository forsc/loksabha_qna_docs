ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (d) Eklavya Model Residential School (EMRS) was introduced in the year 1997-98 to provide quality upper primary, secondary and senior secondary level education to Scheduled Tribes (ST) students in remote areas to enable them to access the best opportunities in education and to bring them at par with the general population. Initially, it was funded under Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution of India. As per budget announcement 2018-19, every block having 50% or more ST population and at least 20,000 ST persons is to have an EMRS by the year 2022. In terms of the aforesaid budget announcement, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the revamping of the EMRS Scheme. As on 10.09.2020, there are 566 sanctioned schools across the country out of which 285 schools have been made functional. As per Government’s decision, 174 more new EMRSs will be sanctioned upto the year 2022. The approved construction grant for EMRSs is Rs. 20.00 crore per school with an additional 20% for the schools in North East, hilly areas, difficult areas and areas affected by Left Wing Extremism and recurring grant in case of EMRS and EMDBS (Eklavya Model Day Boarding School) is respectively Rs.1.09 lakhs and Rs. 0.85 lakhs per student per annum. Total Budget allocation under the scheme of EMRS during the current year, i.e. 2020-21, is Rs. 1313.23 crore. State-wise allocation is determined based on the actual requirement of basic facilities, upgradation, number of enrolment of students etc. *****
