                                                        THE MINISTER OF STEEL		   (SHRI RAM CHANDRA PRASAD SINGH)(a)&(b): Various representations have been received in the Ministry for reconsideration of the decision on disinvestment of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL). The decision for strategic disinvestment of RINL has been taken in line with New Public Sector Enterprise (PSE) Policy for Atmanirbhar Bharat notified by the Government.   The decision on disinvestment of RINL is not under reconsideration.   Strategic disinvestment of Government of India’s equity will lead to infusion of capital for optimum utilisation, expansion of capacity, infusion of technology and better management practices.  This will result in higher production and productivity and expansion of direct and indirect employment opportunities. (c)&(d): RINL has tied up with NMDC to meet the requirement of Iron ore for steel making.   RINL has requested various State Governments viz. Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh for recommending reservation of iron ore deposit under Section 17A(2A) of MMDR Act 2015 to the Ministry of Mines, Govt. of India.  Ministry of Steel has also requested Government of Odisha for reservation of an Iron ore block in favour of RINL.  ********
