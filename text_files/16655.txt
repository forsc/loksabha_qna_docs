The Ministry also issues convergence guidelines with other Ministries / Departments from time to time for creating more employment opportunities in rural areas. Recently such convergence guidelines have been issued, in the area of water conservation and water management, for promoting Nutri- Garden for individual beneficiaries and community in convergence with State Schemes and National Rural Livelihood Mission, for construction of Gram Panchayat Bhawan in convergence with Ministry of Panchayati Raj and Finance Commission Funds for FY 2020-21, to promote fodder farms with Department of Animal Husbandry and  to promote medicinal plants with Ministry of Ayush. Also for effective planning through technical expertise, involvement of people at grass root level and execution of works, Cluster Facilitation Project (CFP) has been launched in 250 blocks in 117 Aspirational districts and 50 blocks in other backward areas of the country for enhancing absorbing capacity of the Scheme through improvised implementation planning. ****
