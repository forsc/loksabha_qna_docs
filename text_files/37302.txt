The poverty ratios are based on MRP (Mixed Recall Period) consumption distribution. 	 	  3.   All India poverty ratio for the social groups is worked out from the respective NSS distribution of persons and (implicit) all-India poverty line for all population.	 	 	 	 	 	  4.   The poverty ratio  among Scheduled Tribes population at State level may be treated with caution due to small sample size of household based on which the class distribution of persons have been obtained.

Similarly, in urban areas, number of sample households is 18 in Bihar14 in Haryana, 18 in Himachal Pradesh9 in Kerala and 17 in Punjab.
