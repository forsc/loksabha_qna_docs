ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b) 	On 2 October 2019, the UK High Court upheld the claims of India in the 70 years old Hyderabad Funds Case.	The matter relates to the Fund, which currently amounts to nearly 35 million Pound Sterling, that has been lying frozen with the National Westminster Bank, London due to contesting claims by India, Pakistan and the two grandsons of the 7th Nizam of Hyderabad.	The UK High Court has now given the verdict that India, along with the two grandsons of the 7th Nizam of Hyderabad, is entitled to the Fund. 	While giving verdict in the favour of India, the Court rejected Pakistan’s claim that the Fund has been intended as payment for arms shipment or as an outright gift by the then Government of the Nizam of Hyderabad to Pakistan. 	The Court has adjourned the proceedings and fixed a hearing on 19 December 2019 on consequential matters. ***
