                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) to (d) As per the report published by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in March, 2021, sewage generation from urban areas in the country is estimated at 72,368 million litres per day (mld), against which sewage treatment capacity of 31,841 mld was available in class-I cities and class-II (tier-2) towns. The State/ Union Territory (UT)-wise details of sewage generation from urban areas and corresponding sewage treatment capacity available in accordance with the report, are given at Annexure-I. It may be seen that against a generation of 5013 mld of sewage, a treatment capacity of 3378 mld is available in the State of Gujarat. Cleaning/rejuvenation of rivers is an ongoing activity. It is the responsibility of the States/UTs and local bodies to ensure required treatment of sewage and industrial effluents in sewage treatment plant (STPs) and effluent treatment plant (ETPs) to the prescribed norms before discharging into river and other water bodies, coastal waters or land to prevent and control of pollution therein. For conservation of rivers, this Ministry has been supplementing efforts of the States/UTs by providing financial and technical assistance for abatement of pollution in identified stretches of rivers in the country through the Central Sector Scheme of Namami Gange for rivers in Ganga basin and the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) for other rivers. NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches on 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country with the project sanctioned cost of Rs.5961.75 crore, and inter-alia, a sewage treatment capacity of 2677 mld has been created. Under Namami Gange programme, a total of 353 projects, including 157 projects for sewage treatment of 4952 mld and a sewer network of 5212 kms, have been sanctioned at a cost Contd…P/2 //2//of Rs. 30458 crore. As per the city classification of Central Public Health and Environmental Engineering Organisation (CPHEEO), Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs, 39 towns of Tier-2 and below have been covered under the Namami Gange programme for treatment of waste water through STPs, constructed wetland and Faecal Sludge Treatment Plants (FSTPs). In addition, sewerage infrastructure is created under programs like Atal Mission for Rejuvenation & Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and Smart Cities Mission of Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs.Besides, in compliance of the orders of National Green Tribunal (NGT) in Original Application No.673/2018 regarding rejuvenation of polluted river stretches in the country, States/UTs are required to implement approved action plans for restoration of the polluted stretches in their jurisdiction as identified by CPCB and published in their report of 2018, within the stipulated timelines. As per the orders of NGT, regular review on implementation of action plans is undertaken in the States/UTs and also at Central level. Ministry of Jal Shakti is also implementing the scheme for Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of water bodies. Under the scheme of RRR of water bodies, one of the main scope of works is de-silting of tank bed along with other multiple objectives like comprehensive improvement and restoration of water bodies thereby increasing tank storage capacity, ground water recharge, increased availability of drinking water, improvement in agriculture/horticulture productivity, improvement of catchment area of tank commands, etc. In addition, Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEF&CC) is providing financial assistance to the States/UTs under the scheme of National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Ecosystems (NPCA) for conservation of identified lakes and wetlands in the country.The State-wise and year-wise funds released to the State Governments/UTs during last three years under NRCP, Namami Gange programme and NPCA is at Annexure-II.Under Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), Grey Water Management is the key component in villages through community systems such as construction of community soak pits, waste stabilization ponds, constructed wetlands, etc. State/UT- wise details of progress of construction of community systems for grey water management during last three years are at Annexure-III. Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0 was launched on 01.10.2021 with vision of achieving “Garbage Free” status for all cities through sustainable Solid Waste Management and through Sustainable Sanitation and treatment of used water, in all cities with less than 1 lakh population i.e tier-2 and below cities.   *****  ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 718 to be answered on the 02.12.2021 on ‘STPs in Rural Areas’.
