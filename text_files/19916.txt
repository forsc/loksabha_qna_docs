                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(DR. SANJEEV KUMAR BALYAN)(a):Yes, the Government has conducted the latest 20th Livestock Census in 2019. Livestock Census is being conducted in every five years interval and so far 20 Livestock Censuses had been conducted in the country. Moreover, the 20thLivestock Census was the first Livestock Census conducted with the use of mobile technology through tablet computers and further transmitting the data online. (b): The details of number of milch and exotic/crossbred animals during last three censuses in various states is placed at Annexure (Table 1 & Table 2). (c) &(d):There is no decline in the number of milch animals in the country over last two censuses. Moreover, the number of milch animals in 19th Livestock Census (LC) is increased of 3.79% over 18th LC and in case of 20th LC the number of milch animal showing an increase of 8.47% over 19th LC. The state wise % of change in number of milch animals over previous census is given in Annexure (Table 1). Further the number of exotic/crossbred animals has also increased over the period. The state wise % change in the number of exotic/crossbred animals are placed at Annexure (Table 2).(e): The following steps are taken by the Government to increase the number of cattle and to improve their breed in the country.	In order to compliment and supplement the efforts made by the States to increase number of cattle and to improve their breed in the country Government of India has been implementing Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) since December, 2014.  	Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) is one of economically important disease of animals and is globally recognized as the number one priority disease for control and eradication. Brucellosis, an economically important reproductive disease of livestock. National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCAP) for control of Foot & Mouth Disease and Brucellosis (NADCP) is a Central Sector Scheme, with an outlay of Rs 13,343 Cr for five years and was launched by Hon’ble Prime Minister on 11th September, 2019. The programme aims to control FMD and Brucellosis by 2025 with vaccination and eventual eradication of FMD by 2030 through vaccinating all eligible livestock including cattle, buffalo, sheep, goat and pig biannually against Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and vaccinate Female Bovine Calves (4-8 months old) annually against Brucellosis.	Livestock Insurance Scheme under National Livestock Mission (NLM) is to encourage cattle farmers to be engaged in cattle rearing.	To promote scientific knowledge of farmers in various activities such as training, farmers field school, ICT support is being provided under NLM.	For improving genetics, efforts are being made to produce genetically superior bulls through Progeny Testing and Pedigree Selection projects for various Indian cattle and buffalo breeds. Presently 21 projects have been approved under Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM) scheme of the Government of India. These programmes are targeted to produce bulls with better genetic capacity, and for distribution to various frozen semen stations across the country for production of frozen semen doses and are used in Artificial Insemination programmes for faster genetic improvement of cattle and buffaloes.	Recently, Genomic Selection, a technology for early selection of cattle and buffalo breeds is under progress. INDUSCHIP - a genotyping chip for Indian cattle and their crosses and BUFFCHIP for genotyping chip for buffalo breeds have also been prepared by NDDB for implementing genomic selection.	The DAHD has approved a National Bovine Genomic Centre for Indigenous cattle and buffaloes (NBGC-IB) scheme for supporting genomic selection activities under RGM.	Further, modern technologies on Sexed Semen and Embryo Transfer through OPUIVF are also being popularized that will also help fast track genetic progress of dairy animals in the country.	Efforts are also being made to increase the coverage of Artificial Insemination in cattle and buffaloes in the country through National AI Programme, which aims at increasing AI coverage in various states.
