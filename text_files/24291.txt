                                                        (a) & (b):	Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) is the flagship skill training scheme of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE). Under PMKVY 2.0 (2016-2020), a target to train one crore individuals was set. The number of candidates trained is 1.09 crore. Under PMKVY 3.0 (2020-2022), which was launched on 15.01.2021, a target to train 8 lakh individuals has been set. The number of candidates trained so far is 1.2 lakh.(c): MSDE, vide notification dated 5th December 2018, has set up National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET) as an overarching regulatory body for the skill eco-system. It is mandated to regulate the functioning of entities engaged in vocational education and training, both long and short-term, and establish minimum standards for the functioning of such entities.(d): Under PMKVY scheme, various initiatives are taken to ensure better placement outcomes for the trained/ certified candidates. Rojgar Melas are conducted for placement of youth by industry. MSDE has launched Aatmanirbhar Skilled Employees Employer Mapping (ASEEM) portal, which acts as a directory of skilled workforce. The objective is to provide a platform that matches supply of skilled workforce with the market demand, thereby facilitating better livelihood opportunities for youth and availability of ready skilled manpower to employers.
