                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY & DAIRYING:(SHRI PRATAP CHANDRA SARANGI)(a)	to (c) The marine fish landings in India over the years has shown an increasing trend. From a meager 0.53 million tonnes in 1950-51 the landings have increased to 3.85 million tonnes in 2018-19. However, the average marine fish catch during the last few years are showing static trend and ranging between 3.37-3.85 million tones (2011-2019). Fluctuations in landings of certain species such as Mackeral and Sardines have been observed, which is a common phenomenon that can be attributed due to natural factors in tropical environments or increase in fishing pressure. The Government has taken several steps to increase the fish stocks, such as implementation of 61 days uniform ban during monsoon season, ban on destructive fishing methods viz. pair trawling or bull trawling and use of artificial LED lights in fishing, discouraging juvenile fishing, etc. Besides, potential of fishery resources are estimated in regular intervals by committee of experts to ascertain the status of fish stocks and revalidation of potential of fishery resources in the Indian Exclusive economic Zone.   *****
