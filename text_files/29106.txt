                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a): 	Starting with 4 States in August 2019, the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan has been enabled in 34 States/UTs by August 2021 covering about 75 Crore beneficiaries (94.3% NFSA population) in the country. A State/UT wise percentage of NFSA population covered under the ONORC plan is at Annexure-I.......2/--2-(b): 	Up to 1st November 2021, the Aadhaar seeding of more than 93% of about 23.6 Crore National Food Security Act (NFSA) ration cards in the country has been achieved. State/UT wise Aadhaar seeding percentage with ration cards is at Annexure-II.(c): 	Except in Assam and Meghalaya, the Aadhaar seeding of ration cards is either completed or significantly high in other North Eastern States. The activity is slow in Assam and Meghalaya owing to delayed and slow Aadhaar enrolments/generation. (d): 	Under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), the distribution of subsidised foodgrains to eligible ration card holders/ beneficiaries under NFSA can be done even during non-possession of Aadhaar and States/UTs have been advised to ensure that no genuine beneficiary is denied ration on this account. Further, Department had advised all States/UTs to also implement mechanisms for special dispensation of foodgrains to old-age, differently abled and ill beneficiaries who are not in position to visit the FPSs themselves and also do not have any other adult member in the household. It is suggested to States/UTs that foodgrains of such beneficiaries may be delivered to them either by means of home-delivery or through their nominees.(e): 	Non-linking of Aadhaar is not a ground for deletion of ration cards. The Department has extended the timeline given to the States/UTs, under the Notification dated 08/02/2017 (as amended from time to time) issued in exercise of Section-7 of the Aadhaar Act 2016, for completing the Aadhaar seeding of ration cards up to 31st December 2021. All States/UTs have been advised that no genuine beneficiary/household shall be deleted from the list of eligible households and shall not be denied their entitled quota of foodgrains under NFSA for want of Aadhaar number or only on the ground of not possessing an Aadhaar number, failure of biometric authentication due to network/ connectivity/ linking issues or any other technical reasons etc. However, as part of the technology driven PDS reforms due to digitization of ration cards data, de-duplication, permanent migration, deaths, identification of ineligible/duplicate/fake ration cards, etc. the States/UTs have reported the cancellation of about 4.28 Crore such bogus ration cards during the period 2014 to 2021 so far.*****Annexure-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.552 FOR ANSWER ON 01.12.2021 IN THE LOK SABHA.State/UT wise number and percentage of NFSA beneficiaries covered under the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan so far:Sl.
