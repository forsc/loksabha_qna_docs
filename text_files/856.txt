                                                        MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS, LAW & JUSTICE AND ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) to (d)  	The standards for IMT 2020 (International Mobile Telecommunications 2020), also known as 5G technologies in industry,  are being finalized and trials of the technologies are in progress globally.  An inter-ministerial High Level Forum for 5G India 2020 has been constituted.  The Government is creating an enabling framework for the launch of 5G services in India. The 5G Services are expected to be introduced gradually and advance to a full range of services as the ecosystem and demand for services grows. The Department of Telecommunications is also working with telecom service providers/original equipment manufacturers on technological studies.   	 No details on estimated revenues from the auction of 5G spectrum can be derived at this stage as this is subject to reserve price and business plans of the auction participants as and when auction is held.
