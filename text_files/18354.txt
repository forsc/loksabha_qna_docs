The Government takes action in cases where Programme/ Advertising Codes are found to be violated by the private TV channels, including issuance of advisory, warning, running an apology scroll and in extreme cases, directing the channel to be off air for a certain time duration. 	Electronic Media Monitoring Centre (EMMC) periodically reports apparent violation of Programme Code by private TV channels which are considered by the Ministry for appropriate action. *********
