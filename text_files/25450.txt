                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS’ WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ?????? 	   SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):   Herbicide Tolerant (HT) cotton is not approved by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), working under Ministry of Environment and Climate Change. As per media report, cultivation of unapproved Herbicide Tolerant (HT) cotton is reported in some states of the country. This Department has issued several advisories to states for control of sale/production/ storage and further spread of HT Cotton in the state. However, No state has reported risking farmers’ crops by sowing unapproved GM cotton.(b)& (c):   GM crop gives an advantage by reducing the loss to crop, due to the pest infestation and weeds. The numbers of sprays of pesticide are reduced and the input cost on farm labour is also reduced which gives an advantage in enhancing the crop productivity & production. The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), under Ministry of Environment and Climate Change has been established by the Government for evaluating the data for approval of genetically modified crop for commercial release. Bt. Cotton is the only genetically modified (GM) crop approved for commercial cultivation in India by GEAC.*****
