                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????      (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b): The State Government is primarily responsible for providing necessary relief measures in the wake of natural calamities. For undertaking relief measures, funds are available with the State Government in the form of State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). Under SDRF, the Government of India contributes 90% to Hilly States and 75% to other States. The balance 10% for Hilly and 25% for other States is contributed by the respective State Governments. Additional financial assistance, over and above SDRF, is considered from National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) for natural calamities of severe nature and is approved on the basis of Memorandum received from the State Government, in accordance with established procedures.  The assistance approved under SDRF/NDRF norms is provided in the form of relief. On receipt of request from the State Government of Karnataka for additional assistance from NDRF, an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) was constituted by the Ministry of Home Affairs for visiting the flood affected areas of Karnataka, including Belagavi district. The IMCT visited the State during 4-7 September 2021 for an on-the-spot assessment of damages caused by the flood/landslides of 2021. The State Government of Karnataka also submitted a Memorandum to the Ministry of Home Affairs for flood during October-November 2021. The Government has decided to depute the same IMCT for visiting the flood affected areas of Karnataka.The State Government of Karnataka has been allocated Rs.843.20 crore (Rs. 632.80 crore as central share & Rs.210.40 crore as state share) under SDRF for 2021-22. The entire central share of SDRF has been released to the State of Karnataka in advance.*****
