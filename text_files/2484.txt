Out of the existing Central Labour Acts, about 17 are more than 50 years old and a few of them are even 70 years old.  Accordingly, in line with the recommendations of the Second National Commission on Labour, the Ministry has taken steps for drafting four Labour Codes i.e. The Code on Wages; The Code on Industrial Relations, The Code on Occupational Safety, Health & Working Conditions & The Code on Social Security by simplifying, amalgamating and rationalizing the relevant provisions of the existing Central Labour Laws.   The Codes have been drafted after exhaustive consultation with representatives of trade unions, employers’ associations and State Governments.  Besides, the drafts were also placed on the website of the Ministry to seek the comments of all thestakeholders including general public.  The Central Labour Acts which have been subsumed in the proposed Labour Codes will be repealed on their enactment.   Out of the four Labour Codes, The Code on Wages has been approved by the Union Cabinet and the remaining three Codes are at different stages of formulation i.e., drafting, tripartite consultation  inter-ministerial consultation etc. (c):		The Labour Codes address issues relating to wage security, social security, safety, health, working conditions, welfare, dispute and grievance redressal mechanism for workers.  Besides, the framing of Labour Codes, the Government has recently taken several significant initiatives including rolling out ofPradhanMantriShram Yogi Maan-dhan, a pension scheme for unorganized sector workers and 2 others pension schemes have been approved for shopkeepers/retail traders and farmers. For health care, Ayushman Bharat-PradhanMantri Jan ArogyaYojana (AB-PMJAY) provides health coverage up to Rs. 5.00 lakh per family per annum to around 10.74 crore poor, deprived families based on the Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization. *******
