The objectives of National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), being implemented by Central Government under National Health Mission(NHM) for interventions upto the district level, includes awareness generation for Cancer prevention, screening, early detection and referral to an appropriate level institution for treatment. For cancer, the focus is on three cancers namely breast, cervical and oral.	A population level initiative for prevention, control and screening for common Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) i.e. diabetes, hypertension and common cancers viz. oral, breast and cervical cancer, has been rolled out in over 215 districts of the country under NHM, as a part of comprehensive primary healthcare. Screening of common NCDs including three common cancers i.e. oral, breast and cervical is also an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres. Population base screening will not only help in early diagnosis but also generate awareness on risk factors of common NCDs including cancers.	Awareness campaigns on common risk factors for NCDs, including cancer, and promotion of healthy lifestyle are also carried out through electronic and social media. Camps for awareness generation and screening for common NCDs are also organized at Pragati Maidan, New Delhi, during the India International Trade Fair. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research (NICPR), Noida, has launched www.cancerindia.org with the theme “India Against Cancer”, a portal that provides information on the leading cancers in India with a major focus on awareness, prevention and treatment of these cancers. (b): 	Cancer is a multifactorial disease, the risk factors of which inter alia, include ageing population, use of tobacco products, sedentary life styles and unhealthy diet. Tata Memorial Centre has also conducted studies to understand lifestyle and genetic risk factors for common cancer in India. The abdominal obesity is an important factor for breast cancer. Use of smokeless tobacco and alcohol drinking are important causative factors for head and neck cancer. Abdominal obesity and history of gall stone are some of the lifestyle related factors for gall bladder cancer. *****
