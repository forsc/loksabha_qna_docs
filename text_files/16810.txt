                                                        ?????? ?????? (??????? ?????? ?????? ?????)MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (c):	Globally textile industry is facing some stress which is temporary due to disruption caused by Covid-19 pandemic. The trading of silk business has reduced after imposition of lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic, which in turn affected silk weaving, processing and reeling sector and resulted in crash in cocoon prices. There was declining trend in cocoon & raw silk prices during April to July, 2020 period due to several reasons including transport/communication and social mobility issues due to Covid-19 pandemic. The country wide general fall in the consumption of silk has an adverse impact on farmers, reelers, weaver and traders of the silk sector.  However, after unlocking measures there has been a marginal improvement in raw silk & cocoon prices during the month of August, 2020.The normal capacity of the jute mills is to produce 2.80 lakh to 3 lakh bales per month. The last three month orders and supply are given below:Month	Order	Supply by MillsJune 2020	2.75 bales	1.78 balesJuly 2020	3.59 bales	2.48 balesAugust 2020	3.52 bales	2.32 balesThis drop in production activity was temporary due to disruptions caused by Covid-19. From the month of September 2020 onwards, Jute Industry’s supply capacity has been improved substantially and it is expected to its optimum supply capacity shortly. No recession due to lack of orders/ business opportunity has arisen as there is no dearth of orders for supply of B-Twill Jute Bags for packaging of foodgrains etc.To withstand in COVID 19 pandemic, the Government of India has announced a special economic package viz. Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan for boosting economy of the country and making India self-reliant. Relief and credit support measures have been announced for various sectors including MSMEs.The weavers & artisans/karigars can avail benefits of these relief and credit support measures to revive their businesses which have suffered due to lock down necessitated by Covid-19 pandemic. Taking a step towards realizing “Atmanirbhar Bharat”, Handloom Export Promotion Council has endeavoured to virtually connect the Handloom Weavers and exporters from different corners of the country with the International Market.With more than 200 participants from different regions of the country showcasing their products with unique designs and skills, THE INDIAN TEXTILE SOURCING FAIR was organised on 7, 10 and 11th August. The show has already attracted considerable attention of the International Buyers.In order to support the handloom and handicraft sectors and to enable wider market for handloom weavers/artisans/producers, steps have been taken to on-board weavers/artisans on Government e-Market place (GeM) to enable them to sell their products directly to various Government departments and organizations.A social media campaign #Vocal4handmade was launched on the 6thNational Handloom Day by the Government, in partnership with all stakeholders, to promote the handloom legacy of India and to ensure people’s support for the weaving community. The Chief Ministers of all States and UTs have been requested to instruct their State Handloom Corporations/Co-operatives/Agencies to make purchases of the finished inventory available with the handloom weavers/artisans so as to put some ready cash in the hands of the weavers to enable them meet their household needs.To deal with the pandemic crisis, the Government endeavours to provide online marketing opportunities to our weavers and handloom producers.Chaupals/e-Chaupals have been organised in weavers concentrated areas by the Weavers’ Service Centres (WSCs) across the country to create awareness amongst the handloom weavers about the schemes of Government of India and to facilitate themTo promote e-marketing of handloom products, a policy frame work has been designed under which any willing e-commerce platform with good track record can participate in online marketing of handloom products. Accordingly, 23 e-commerce entities have been engaged for on-line marketing of handloom products.The Government has also taken necessary steps to manufacture Automatic Reeling Machine (ARM) package indigenously to produce international grade raw silk, which was imported earlier from China PR. This may help local silk machinery manufacturers to sustain their business.****
