However, to facilitate travelling passengers in running trains to report a crime, First Information Report (FIR) forms are available with TTE, Guard or RPF/GRP train escorting staff.  After filling the Form may be handed over to one of the said officials for registration of the case at the next Police Station irrespective of the jurisdiction for taking cognizance on it.  If the place of occurrence does not fall in their jurisdiction, the case is registered under Zero FIR and transferred to the concerned Government Railway Police Station having jurisdiction.  Further course of action is taken by the Police as per extant legal provisions.Regular coordination is made with the State Police/GRP authorities at all levels for prevention of crime, registration of cases, their investigation and maintenance of law & order in Railway premises as well as on running trains. Following measures are being taken by the Railways in coordination with Government Railway Police to ensure safety and security of passengers including women passengers:-1.	On vulnerable and identified routes/sections, trains are escorted by Railway Protection Force daily in addition to  trains escorted by Government Railway Police of different States daily.2.	Security Help Line number 182 is operational over Indian Railways for security related assistance to passengers in distress.3.
