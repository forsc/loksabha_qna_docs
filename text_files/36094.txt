ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E RMINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b): Yes Sir. Under the Public Distribution System (PDS) reforms, the Department, in collaboration with all State Governments and Union Territories, has made unyielding efforts in the past 7-8 years to modernize and introduce transparency and efficiency in the functioning of the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) in all States/UTs. Through these efforts, all ration cards/beneficiaries data is completely digitized in all States/UTs, online allocation of foodgrains up to all Fair Price Shops (FPSs) in all States/UTs, transparency portals with online grievance redressal facilities and toll-free helplines are implemented in all States/UTs. Supply Chain Management of foodgrains is also computerized in 31 States/UTs including Gujarat. Besides, electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices are also installed in about 5.28 Lakh of total 5.33 Lakh (98.9%) FPSs in the country. Further, technology driven One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan is also enabled in 35 States/UTs so far, including Gujarat. All these PDS reforms have enabled continuous and better delivery of the National Food Security Act (NFSA) foodgrains to the beneficiaries across the country, including those in the rural areas of Gujarat.......2/--2-(c) & (d):	Under NFSA, inter-alia all operational aspects of the TPDS, including the licensing, regulation and monitoring of the Fair Price Shops operations/functioning, issuance of ration cards to beneficiaries and distribution of subsidised foodgrains to them through FPSs are the responsibilities of the respective State/UT Governments. As an institutionalized practice under TPDS, the ration cards issued by the States/UTs are tagged to a nearby FPS in the region/area, which may also include an area covered by a Gram Panchayat, to facilitate the availability and distribution of subsidised foodgrains to beneficiaries in their vicinity. However, with the implementation of technology driven One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan, the NFSA beneficiaries are empowered to lift their quota of foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) of choice anywhere in the country, effectively enabling the FPSs also to distribute foodgrains to any NFSA beneficiary of the country, and not just limited to the beneficiaries in their same region/area or Gram Panchayat.  *****
