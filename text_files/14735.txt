                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a)	According to the NITI Aayog’s September, 2019 Report titled “TRANSFORMING NUTRITION IN INDIA: POSHAN ABHIYAAN”, a substantial number of cases (28% cases of all Aadhaar based payments, i.e. in case of 31.29 lakh payments) are going to different Bank Accounts than what had been provided by the beneficiaries. However, National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) maintains mapping of Aadhaar with a bank account, in case the bank account is seeded with Aadhaar. The Aadhaar based payments are made on the basis of this mapping and NPCI maintains only one Bank name against an Aadhaar number. Accordingly, the payments are transferred to the Bank account of the beneficiary whose data is maintained by NPCI. This is common to all Aadhaar based payments in the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) ecosystem and is not specific to Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY). However, in a few cases of Aadhaar based payment, the amount has been credited to Bank Account wrongly seeded with Aadhaar.(b)	The Ministry has taken up the matter with Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Finance, National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) and Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to make the process of linking Aadhaar simple and provide more information to the account holder on the Aadhaar linkage. This issue is highlighted in all review meetings that Ministry hold with the representatives from aforementioned institutions. The information on process of Aadhaar linking with bank account is also shared with the field functionaries in the regular workshops held at District and State level. The following steps are taken by Ministry for providing the information regarding the beneficiary of the payment -i.	An SMS is sent to the mobile number, registered under PMMVY, of the beneficiary, informing her of the bank name, amount and last four digit of the bank account number in which payment is credited, when the credit information is received from Public Financial Management System (PFMS).ii.	Monthly payment report is available to the Sanctioning Officers on PMMVY-CAS, which has the details of all payments made in a particular month to the beneficiaries along with the details of Bank account (last four digits).iii.	Access is provided to State Nodal Officer to provide the complete bank account number to beneficiary in cases, where the last four digits are insufficient to trace the account.(c)	NITI Aayog in their report has observed that there is need for simplification in documentation and operational rules viz. the rule for completion of 180 days before processing 2nd instalment and mandatory requirement of Birth Certificate for 3rd instalment needs to be rationalized which are unnecessarily causing delays in payments.(d)	On the basis of feedbacks received from States/UTs, the Government has taken initiatives to simplify the documentation required for claiming benefits under the scheme. This includes, allowing the prescription/vaccination card issued by private medical practitioners for the purpose of fulfillment of requirement of ANC and vaccination of the child for easing of documentation for claiming second and third installment of maternity benefit under PMMVY. Further, eligible beneficiary who has undergone one Ante-Natal Check-up (ANC) has been allowed to submit application even before 180 days from the date of LMP. However, the payment will be processed after 180 days from the LMP date. The requirement of birth certificate is intentionally kept to improve the rate of birth registration in the Civil Registration System.An eligible beneficiary can claim maternity benefit under PMMVY within 730 days from the date of LMP. Further, States/UTs organize special camps for enrolment of eligible beneficiaries under PMMVY time to time.(e)	The State-wise and Year-wise details of total number of beneficiaries enrolled under PMMVY, including Kerala, are annexed.*****  AnnexureStatement referred to in reply to part (d) of the Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 3369 for answer on 13.03.2020 raised by Shri M.K.
