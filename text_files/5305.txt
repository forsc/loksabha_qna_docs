In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes such as Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP); and schemes of Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of water bodies etc.Three ongoing irrigation projects namely Champamati, Dhansiri and Borolia in the State of Assam have been prioritized in consultation with the State for completion in phases by December, 2019 under Pradhan Mantri Krishi SinchayeeYojana – Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (PMKSY-AIBP) in 2016-17.These projects were sanctioned prior to March, 2016 with Central Assistance of Rs. 438.639 crore under AIBP scheme. Out of Ultimate Irrigation Potential of about 1.25 lakh hectare targeted by these three projects, irrigation potential of about 0.96 lakh hectare is reported to have been created upto March, 2019.*****
