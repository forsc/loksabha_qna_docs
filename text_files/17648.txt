                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(SHRI PRATAP CHANDRA SARANGI)(a)	Fisheries and aquaculture resources in the country are of varied nature. They exist in the form of marine capture fisheries resources, inland capture fisheries and aquaculture resources. These resources are spread over a range of different ecosystems. Fisheries and aquaculture being the State subject, utilisation of these resources are generally managed by the concerned States and UTs. The natural fisheries resources are available to the public and aquaculture has contributed to the development of the sector. Therefore, the issue of privatization of fisheries resources does not arise.(b)	The new flagship Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) being implemented by the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying envisages enhancing fisheries exports to about Rs.1 lakh crore, and increasing the fish production to 22 million metric tons by 2024-25. (c)	Does not arise. ****
