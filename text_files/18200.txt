ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of USA, under its International Aviation Safety Assessment (IASA) program last conducted a safety audit of India in July 2018 wherein it was pointed out that DGCA does not have sufficient number of Flight Operations Inspectors (FOIs) vis-a-vis the sanctioned strength of 75 FOIs. The audit also pointed out lack of training of technical staff covering flying training and licensing at DGCA. As a corrective action, DGCA filled the vacant positions of FOIs and conducted the training for the technical staff of DGCA. Thereafter, based on the follow-up visit in November 2018, FAA closed the findings and confirmed that India meets relevant requirements for aviation safety under international standards of the Chicago Convention. In an earlier audit conducted in the year 2013, FAA had raised the finding that DGCA does not have sufficient FOIs commensurate to the aviation activity in India and placed India under Category 2. As a corrective action, 75 new positions of FOIs were created in DGCA and recruitment carried out. The recruited FOIs were provided required training. Based on actions taken to create FOI positions, recruit and train the FOIs, FAA after a satisfactory audit restored India''s Category 1 status in April 2015.(b) The sanctioned strength of the FOIs is 75. At present there are 34 FOIs in various categories.;(c) FOIs are engaged in DGCA, on contract basis, and are remunerated from the DGCA Budget.;(d) & (e) FAA does not prescribe any norms for recruiting  FOIs in DGCA. However, a Vacancy circular for filling up of 40 posts of FOI in various categories has been issued vide DGCA''s vacancy circular dated 11.9.2020.
