                                                        (a) & (b) Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) has taken various initiatives to market the products made by the tribal people which include the following: (i) The Ministry provides funds to State and TRIFED for organizing tribal festivals wherein the tribal artists and artisans showcase and sell their products.(ii)  MoTA provides funds to TRIFED and State Governments for marketing of tribal products by empanelling tribal suppliers comprising of individual tribal artisans, tribal SHGs, Organisations/ Agencies/NGOs working with tribals. Total number of suppliers/producers empanelled with TRIFED as on 31.10.2021 is 2915.(iii) TRIFED also organizes Tribal Artisan Mela (TAM) at District/Tehsil level as an exercise to reach tribals located in interior tribal areas and source tribal art and craft directly from them. Through this initiative, Tribal Artisans are invited to an exhibition area where they display their art and craft items.(iv) TRIFED is also engaged in direct sale of tribal products including art & craft items through its network of Tribes India Showrooms, exhibitions, Aadi Mahotsav, online e-commerce portal etc. Apart from the above, Khadi and Village Industries (KVI) ethnic products produced by rural artisans including tribals are unique in nature and have established a niche among its patrons in the domestic as well as overseas market they are natural, pure and environment friendly. The network of Khadi and Village Industry Institutions indeed provides a vide platform for market the products, produced by traditional artisans and craftsmen. It has a fairly wide network of around 8000 “Khadi India” sales outlets across the country including 8 Departmental Sales Outlets and its 17 branches owned by KVIC. The other initiatives taken by the government to promote khadi domestically and internationally is given as under:i.	KVIC organized domestic exhibitions to marketing support of KVI products.ii.	Exclusive Khadi Lounges opened in New Delhi, Mumbai, Jaipur, Bhopal, Goa and Kevadia (Gujarat) to showcase the Khadi and Village Industries products to all International and National tourists.iii.	KVIC arranging product supply/marketing mechanism through GeM portal and online portal to sale of product produce by artisans/craftsmen.iv.	Rehabilitating the women artisans of militancy affected Nagrota of J&K, KVIC started manufacturing centers of Khadi Rumal and the same will be sold through Paytm Mall and other sales outlets.v.	Introduced Social media initiatives handles in Face book, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIN, etc. to promote these products.vi.	An agreement for supply of Tribal Students Uniform Fabric (for 75000 students of 23 Ekalaya Model schools) executed between KVIC and NESTS.(c) & (d) This Ministry has conducted evaluation study for the scheme “Institutional Support for Development and Marketing of Tribal Products/Produce” through Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA) during the year 2019-20. The assessment of challenges being faced by the STs in marketing their products reveals lack of credit linkage, inadequate exposure to new designs, lack of penetration of TRIFED below the level of State capitals, Patenting issues and Lack of funds for scaling- up of products.*****
