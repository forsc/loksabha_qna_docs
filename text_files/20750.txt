                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE; MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MINISTER OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????, ??????? ?? ???????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ??????? ??????(??. ???? ?????)(a) & (b)   Yes Sir, Government has initiated several programmes and schemes to promote people’s participation in R&D. Several new schemes to attract young researchers such as National Post Doctoral Fellowship; Early Career Research Award; Overseas Doctoral Fellowship; and Overseas Post Doctoral Fellowship; and Teacher Associates for Research Excellence have been launched. These schemes have almost doubled the opportunities for young and aspiring researchers for carrying out R&D in their chosen areas of science and engineering. A scheme called Visiting Advanced Joint Research (VAJRA) has been initiated to bring best of global science and scientists to India including Non-Resident Indians. To address gender imbalance, a new scheme known as “Knowledge Involvement in Research Advancement through Nurturing” (KIRAN) has been launched. A pilot scheme VIGYAN JYOTI was tested on limited scale and duration to attract and encourage young women in underrepresented areas such as engineering, mathematics in  top institutions. A scheme called Augmenting Writing Skills for Articulating Research - AWSAR was launched to encourage young scientists to write popular science articles on their research pursuits. To encourage young students to think innovatively, a scheme MANAK - Million Minds Augmenting National Aspirations and Knowledge has been launched to target 10 lakh students every year from class 6 to 10.  (c) & (d)   The gross expenditure on R & D (GERD) in the country has been consistently increasing over the years and has nearly tripled from Rs. 29,932.58 crore in 2005-06 to Rs. 95,452.44 in 2015-16. It has further increased to Rs. 1,03,099.26 crore and Rs. 1,13,825.03 crore in 2016-17 and 2017-18, respectively. It is estimated to be Rs. 1,23,847.70 crore in 2018-19.(e)    The contribution of central government, private sector industry, state sector, public sector industry and higher education sector in  R&D investments  in the year 2017-18 is estimated as 45.4%, 36.8%, 6.4%, 4.6% and 6.8%, respectively. India has active S&T cooperation with 46 countries and 17 regional and multilateral partnerships. These collaborations are in the form of joint R&D projects, human and institutional capacity building, innovation and technology development, creation of centres of excellence, networking, utilization and creation of mega science facilities etc. During last 3 years, a total of 658 joint research projects have been supported. India’s share of international collaboration in world output increased from 3.8 % in 2011 to 4.2 % in 2016.           A few important technology developments have resulted from ongoing bi-lateral and multi-lateral projects under Mega Facilities for Basic Research scheme. Under the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) project at European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), Geneva,  high-tech Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) foil technology was transferred to an Indian Industry. 31 GEM Chambers have been sent to CERN as in-kind contribution from India.   As part of Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) experiment at CERN, design and development of Common Readout Unit (CRU), a hi-tech electronics item was completed. For construction of Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) in Germany, India supplied 164 Power Converters to FAIR, Germany as in-kind contribution from India.
