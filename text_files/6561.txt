Claim amount for wide spread calamites are calculated based on the yield data arrived from requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) conducted by the concerned State Government.  Claims per hectare are worked out by the concerned insurance company based on the yield data provided by the concerned State Governemnt as per following formula :  Threshold Yield (TY) – Actual Yield (AY)----------------------------------------------------  X  Sum Insured            Threshold Yield (TY)Where Threshold Yield for a crop in a notified insurance unit is the average yield of best 5 years out of past 7 years multiplied by applicable indemnity level for that crop.However, losses due to localized risks of hailstorm, landslide, inundation, cloud burst & natural fire and post-harvest losses are calculated on individual insured farm level, based on the report of the joint committee comprising representatives of State Government and insurance company to survey the extent of loss.  Further, there  is also a provision to pay claims towards prevented sowing/failed germination and adhoc claims in case of mid season adversity.

Further, insurance company also process the applications and the requisite documents submitted by the farmers, especially non-laonee farmers.  If the application or documents are not correct/duplicate documents, they reject the application and returned the premium in such cases.   There are such incidences in every season in every State including Maharashtra.(e):	The Government has issued instructions from time to time to the financial institutions to remit the premium and famers’ data correctly and timely on National Crop Insurance Portal so that incidents of mis-match can be reduced
