ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a) to (d) Sanitation is a behavioural issue.  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) [SBM(G)], a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, is being implemented through the State Governments to supplement their efforts to improve sanitation status in the rural areas of the country.  Under this programme, incentive is provided to the eligible households to encourage them to construct individual household latrines (IHHLs) and to use them regularly.  Under SBM(G), three rounds of National Annual Rural Sanitation Survey (NARSS) were conducted by Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation through an Independent Verification Agency in 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20.  As per the results of NARSS 2019-20, 99.9% of the toilets constructed in rural areas of Rajasthan were found to be functional.  However, no ranking of the States was done on this basis.(e) A Swachh Survekshan Grameen was conducted in 2019 covering 683 districts in the country to assess the overall cleanliness in villages and to rank the States and districts accordingly.  As per the results of this survey, Tonk and Sawai Madhopur districts of Rajasthan were ranked 535th and 376th respectively.*****
