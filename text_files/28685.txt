                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS (SHRI DEVUSINH CHAUHAN)(a) & (b) 	Sir, the telecom services in country are functioning properly in most of the places.Telecom Services Providers (TSPs) install towers/Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) as per their techno-commercial viability and to fulfil the rollout obligation criteria as per their License Conditions. Multiple factors such as inability to install additional BTSs on existing Towers due to loading issues, opposition from local residents due to perceived fear of EMF (Electro-Magnetic Field) radiation, non-availability of suitable structure at a few places, inaccessible terrain and transportation difficulties of equipment at some locations, and unwarranted delays in commissioning new sites due to various procedural formalities from local administration/ agencies, limit the feasibility of tower installation. Despite these difficulties over 23 lakhs BTSs have been installed in the Country. Universal Service Obligation Fund has launched a number of projects to install mobile phone network in rural, tribal, aspirational districts and north east region. (c) to (e) 	To enable increase of telecom infrastructure including mobile towers, Indian Telegraph Right of Way Rules, 2016 has been notified to address the challenges of right of way. Under the National Broadband Mission, States/Union Territories have formed their State Broadband Committee which, inter-alia, resolves issues pertaining to installation of mobile towers.
