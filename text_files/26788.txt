                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ?? ????? ?????? ??????      (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c): State-wise details of crop area affected due to hydro-meteorological calamities/hazards during 2021-22 are given at Annexure-I. Further, it is informed that crop-wise details of crop area affected due to natural calamities are not centrally maintained.	The Primary responsibility for disaster management rests with the State Governments.  The State Governments undertake assessment of damages and provide   financial   relief   in   the   wake   of   12 notified natural disasters, from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) already placed at their disposal. Additional financial assistance is extended from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) as per the established procedure in case of disaster of severe nature. 	The Government of India has released the 1st installment of its share under SDRF to the States for the financial year 2021-22, as per the details given at Annexure-II.	In addition, the Government of India has introduced yield based Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and weather based Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS) from Kharif 2016 to provide financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of natural calamities, adverse weather incidence and to stabilize income of farmers. Comprehensive risk insurance is provided under the scheme from pre-harvesting to post-harvest losses. Under this Scheme, claims are paid to only those farmers who have insured their crops and paid their share of premium under any of the notified crop insurance scheme in the notified area/crop by the State Government.  The cut-off date for enrollment under the Scheme in most of the States/Union Territories for Kharif 2021 Season is 31st July, 2021.
