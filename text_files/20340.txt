ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  No sir. However, the Dynamic Ground Water Resources of the country are being periodically assessed jointly by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and State Governments as per the extant methodology.     Besides, CGWB has taken up Aquifer Mapping and Management Programme to delineate aquifer (water bearing formation) disposition and their characterization for preparation of aquifer/ area specific ground water management plans.   (b) & (c)  As per the assessment of Dynamic Ground Water Resources 2017, Out of the total 6881 assessment units (Block/ Taluks/ Mandals/ watersheds/ Firkas) in the country, 1186 units in 17 States/UTs have been categorized as ‘Over-exploited’ where Annual Ground Water Extraction is more than Annual Extractable Ground Water Resource.         With a view to facilitate sustainable development of ground water, Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) is presently granting No Objection Certificates (NOCs) with mandatory conditions in 19 States and 02 Union Territories (UTs) as per the extant ground water regulation guidelines. In balance States/UTs they are regulating as per their extant provisions. The latest guidelines (with pan-India applicability) for regulation and control of groundwater extraction in the country have been notified by the Ministry on 24 Sep 2020. The guidelines can be accessed through the web-link http://cgwa-noc.gov.in/LandingPage/Guidlines/NewGuidelinesNotified250920.pdf#ZOOM=100.         Further, the guidelines provide for registering the drilling rigs by the States/UTs to maintain a database of wells drilled by them to control illegal extraction of groundwater.          Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management including conservation and water harvesting in the Country is primarily States’ responsibility.  However, the important measures taken by the Central Government for conservation, management of ground water and effective implementation of rain water harvesting in the country are at the following URL: http://jalshakti-dowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Feb2021.pdf.*****
