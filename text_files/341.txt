ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) & (b) Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) are opened primarily to cater to the educationalneeds of the children of transferable Central Government Employees includingDefence & Para-Military personnel by providing a common programme of education.Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries orDepartments of the Government of India/State Governments / Union TerritoriesAdministrations thereby committing resources for setting up a new KV as well as theavailability of necessary sanction of the Government. The proposals received fromvarious sponsoring authorities for opening of new KVs also have to compete amongother proposals under the “Challenge Method”.The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme provides for opening of one JawaharNavodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country. Opening of new JNVs is acontinuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned StateGovernment to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction ofschool buildings and the required temporary accommodation (free of rent) to start theVidyalaya. However, actual sanction and opening of the JNV depends on theavailability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority. One JNV each hasbeen sanctioned in all the districts of the country as on 31st May 2014, excludingTamil Nadu which has not yet accepted the Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme.While JNVs have been sanctioned in all the districts of Bihar, there are noKVs functioning in Arwal, Kaimur, Sheikhpura, Nawada, Madhepura, Madhubani andSupaul districts.(c) The vacancies of teaching posts in KVs and JNVs as on 31st March, 2019 are8397 and 2383 respectively. Filling up of vacancies is a continuous process andaction is taken from time to time as per the provisions of the relevant RecruitmentRules for filling up of the posts. Teachers are also engaged on contractual basis fortemporary duration by Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan and Navodaya VidyalayaSamiti to ensure that the teaching-learning process is not hampered.
