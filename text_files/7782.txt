A suggestion has been received in Department related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice in its meeting held on 04.10.2019 for establishment of regional benches of the Supreme Court.(b):	The Government has been receiving representations at various times from various quarters for establishment of Benches of Supreme Court in various parts of the country. The Law Commission, in its 229th Report had also suggested that a Constitutional Bench be set up at Delhi and four Cassation Benches be set up in the Northern region at Delhi, the Southern region at Chennai/Hyderabad, the Eastern region at Kolkata and the Western region at Mumbai. The idea of a separate Bench of Supreme Court outside Delhi has not found favour with the Supreme Court of India.
