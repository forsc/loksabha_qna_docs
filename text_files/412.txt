ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c)	 Under Skill India Mission, the Government of India is implementing around 40 programmes through more than 20 Central Ministries/Departments for skill development. Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing schemes for imparting employable skills to the youth through short term and long term programs. The Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana 2016-20 (PMKVY 2016-20) implemented by MSDE provides short term training to the youth through affiliated training partners/training centres, both in urban and rural areas. The details of candidates trained and placed under the Short Term Training (STT) and assessed under the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) component of PMKVY 2016-20 including Maharashtra during the last three years are placed at Annexure-I  and Annexure-II respectively. 	Long term training is provided through Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs). There are 14495 Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) functioning in the country affiliated with National Council of Vocational Training which provide training to 11.39 lakh 12.17 lakh and14.48 lakh students during the FY 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 respectively. Out of the 14495 ITIs, 29 ITIs are in Mumbai (as per NCVT MIS portal). The Directorate General of Training under MSDE is also providing various vocational/skill training programs through a network of 15 National Skill Training Institutes (NSTIs) and 18 National Skill Training Institutes (Women) (NSTIs-W) in various urban and rural areas of the country. Out of which, 2 NSTIs (one NSTI and one NSTI-W) are in Mumbai. The trainees trained by the NSTIs during 2016-17 are 27410 and during 2017-18 are 29345 trainees. In addition, Ministry of Housing and Urabn Affairs is running a programme Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM) to reduce poverty and vulnerability of urban poor households. The Employment through Skill Training & Placement (EST&P) component of the Mission aims to provide skills to the urban poor to increase their income through structured and market-oriented certified courses that can provide wage employment and/or self-employment opportunities which will eventually lead to better living standards and alleviation of urban poverty on a sustainable basis. Under this, 9,73,084 candidates have been skill trained, out of which 7,79,437 skill trained candidates have been certified and 4,30,694 certified candidates have been placed during FY 2016-17 to 2018-19 (as on 18.06.2019).
