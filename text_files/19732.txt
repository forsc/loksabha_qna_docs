ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)   (a) & (b):	Government receives representations from time to time on various issues concerning agriculture sector including raising Minimum Support Prices (MSP) and cost of production. Since the cost of production varies in different States on account of differences in levels of irrigation, resource endowment, farm mechanization, land holding size, yield etc., Commission for Agricultural Cost & Prices (CACP) uses all-India weighted average cost of production while making its recommendations for MSP. However, CACP ensures that all paid out costs including family labour are covered in the MSPs recommended by them. The objective is to promote regionally differentiated production strategy and encourage an efficient state of agricultural production in the country.	In addition to cost of production, CACP also considers other important factors while recommending MSP which include overall demand and supply, domestic & international prices, inter-crop price parity, the likely effect of the price policy on the rest of the economy, rational utilization of land, water and other production resources and a minimum of 50 percent as the margin over the cost of production. Contd….2/--2-(c) & (d):	MSP is determined for the country as a whole and not region or state-specific. The objective is to promote regionally differentiated production strategy and encourage an efficient state of agricultural production in the country. However, region specific parameters are kept in view by the CACP while formulating price policy for agricultural commodities.*****
