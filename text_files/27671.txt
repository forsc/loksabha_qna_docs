As per the results of PLFS conducted during 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20, the unemployment rate for persons of 15 years and above on usual status in the country was as under :Unemployment Rate  (in %)PLFS (Year)	Rural	Urban	Total2017-18	5.3	7.7	6.02018-19	5.0	7.6	5.82019-20	3.9	6.9	4.8Prior to 2017-18, the quinquennial labour force surveys on employment and unemployment were being conducted by NSO. The last such survey was the NSS 68th round conducted during 2011-12. As per the results of this survey, the unemployment rate of all ages in the country to the extent available was 2.2%. However, Survey methodology and sample selection in PLFS and in quinquennial labour force surveys on employment and unemployment are different, hence, the results of both are not comparable. (d):    Government of India has taken a number of initiatives for promoting employment generation in the country. Aatmanirbhar Bharat RojgarYojana (ABRY) has been launched w.e.f. 1st October, 2020 to incentivize employers for creation of new employment along with social security benefits and restoration of employment. The terminal date for registration of beneficiary under the scheme has been extended from 30th June, 2021 to 31st March, 2022.PM- SVANidhi Scheme has facilitated collateral free working capital loan upto Rs.10,000/- for one-year tenure to street vendors, to help them  resume their businesses during the post Covid period.  Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) is being implemented by the Government inter alia, for facilitating self-employment. Under PMMY collateral free loans uptoRs. 10 lakh, are extended to micro/small business enterprises and to individuals to enable them to setup or expand their business activities.In addition, to enhance the employment generation, Government is encouraging various projects involving substantial investment and through public expenditure on schemes like Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), Deendayal Antodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM) and Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) run by Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs and Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE), respectively.Besides these initiatives, flagship programmes of the Government such as Make in India, Digital India, Swachh Bharat Mission, Smart City Mission, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, Housing for All, Infrastructure development and Industrial corridors and Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme have the potential to generate productive employment opportunities.*****
