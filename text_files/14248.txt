ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS [SHRI KIREN RIJIJU](a) National Sports Development Fund (NSDF) was set up in 1998 to mobilize resources from corporates, NGOs, individuals to augment funds for promotion and development of sports in the country. NSDF supports sportspersons to excel in the field by providing opportunities to train under high quality coaches with technical, scientific and psychological support and also in getting exposure to international competitions. The Fund also provides financial assistance for development of sports infrastructure and for promotion of sports.(b) No, Sir. Rs. 2 crores is the contribution from Government of India to NSDF as matching share during 2018-19. Amount spent from NSDF during 2018-19 is Rs. 54.77 crore.(c) Does not arise.(d) & (e) Budgetary allocation for NSDF is made for matching contribution of Government''s share to NSDF. In 2019-20, there was a shortfall of about Rs. 70.00 crores in Government''s matching share. Therefore, the original budget allocation of Rs. 70.00 crores was enhanced to Rs. 77.15 crore at Revised Estimates stage in the current year.Allocation of Rs. 50.00 crores for NSDF during 2020-21 is considered sufficient as Government’s matching share keeping in view the likelihood of contribution from donors during 2020-21.Adequate funds are available in the corpus of NSDF to meet the requirements.****
