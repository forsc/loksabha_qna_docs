                                                        MINISTER OF CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS(D.V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a): 	Sir, Department of Agriculture Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) in consultation with States/ UTs assesses the requirement of all subsidised fertilizers before the start of each Season. The estimated demand of fertilizers in the country for the ongoing season i.e Kharif 2019-20 (April’19- September’19) is as follows:                           Projected requirement of fertilizers in the country	                                                                       <Figures in LMT>All India/ Kharif 2019-20	                       Kharif 2019Urea	                                                156.72P&K	                                                124.57Total	                                                281.29*7.35 LMT of Urea is reserved allocation.Source: iFMS. The requirement for Rabi 2019-20 is not yet projected by DAC&FW. However, the demand for Rabi 2018-19 is as follows:-                         Projected requirement of fertilizers in the country	                                                                       <Figures in LMT>All India/                                          Rabi 2018-19	Rabi 2018-19Urea	                                            151.13P&K	                                            113.71Total	                                            264.84*6.90 LMT of Urea is reserved allocation.Source: iFMS.The estimated indigenous production of fertilizers in the country for the current year i.e  April 2019 to March’20  is as follows:Estimated Indigenous production of all major fertilizers during 2019-20                                                                             <figures in LMT>Year	                             Urea	DAP	Complex2019-20	                             266.40	47.63	100.76* The estimated production figure shows actual production for April & May 2019 and estimated target for June’19 to March’20.(b): Following steps have been taken by Government to meet the demand of fertilizers in the country:-1.	Before the commencement of each cropping season, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), after consultation with all the State Governments, assesses the requirement of fertilizers. After assessment of requirement, DAC&FW projects month-wise requirement of fertilizers. 2.	At present, there are 31 operating urea manufacturing units in the country with an installed capacity of around 220 LMT of urea. The requirement of urea as assessed by DAC&FW in consultation with State Governments is met through the indigenous production by these urea units. The gap between demand (requirement) and supply through indigenous production, is met through imports. The import for the season is also finalised well in advance to ensure timely availability. 3.	On the basis of month-wise & state-wise projection given by DAC&FW, Department of Fertilizers allocates sufficient/ adequate quantities of fertilizers to States by issuing monthly supply plan and distribution within the State is the responsibility of the concerned State Government.  Further, the availability of fertilizers is continuously monitored through following system: a.	The movement of all major subsidized fertilizers is being monitored throughout the country by an on-line web based monitoring system called integrated Fertilizer Monitoring System (iFMS);b.	The State Governments are regularly advised to coordinate with manufacturers and importers of fertilizers for streamlining the supplies through timely placement of indents for railway rakes through their state institutional agencies like Markfed etc.c.	Regular Weekly Video Conference is conducted jointly by Department of Agriculture & Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW), Department of Fertilizers (DoF), and Ministry of Railways with State Agriculture Officials and corrective actions are taken to dispatch fertilizer as indicated by the State Governments. Thus, with the steps as indicated above, Department of Fertilizers ensures availability of fertilizers at the State level and the distribution to the farmers within the State is the responsibility of the respective State Government.(c) & (d):  The Government of India is reviving 5 closed fertilizer plants of Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd. (FCIL) and Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation Ltd. (HFCL) namely Talcher, Ramagundam, Gorakhpur and Sindri plants of FCIL and Barauni plant of HFCL by setting up new Ammonia Urea plants of 12.7 Lakh metric tonne per annum capacity. These projects upon implementation/ operationalization will bridge the gap between demand and supply of urea in the country, and will rejuvenate the fertilizer sector. Subsequent to commissioning/ start of the above plants, the indigenous urea production will be enhanced by 63.5 Lakh Metric Tonne per year leading to corresponding reduction in import of urea.Government of India has also proposed to set up a new Ammonia-Urea Plant at Brahmaputra Valley Fertilizers Corporation Limited (BVFCL), Namrup-IV having capacity of 12.70 LMT or Urea through nomination (PSU) route.                                          ********
