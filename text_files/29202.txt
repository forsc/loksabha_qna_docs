                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a)  The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component & 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports. Details and status of the proposals for inter-state linking of rivers under the Inter Linking of Rivers Programme is furnished at Annexure.(b) & (c)  As per information provided by the Government of Bihar, Bihar state is prone to floods, having flood prone area of 68.80 lakh hect. Predominantly, Northern Bihar gets affected by floods every year due to heavy rainfall in the upper catchment areas, which mainly lie in Nepal. Whereas, Southern Bihar faces  problem of flash flood as well as drought.  (d)  The Government is pursuing the interlinking of rivers (ILR) Program in a consultative manner and has accorded it top priority.  The implementation of the ILR projects depend on the consensus among the concerned States. Thus the interlinking of rivers programme is being pursued based on the principle of consensus and agreement among the concerned States. ***** ANNEXURE ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. †855 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 02.12.2021 REGARDING “INTER-LINKING OF RIVERS”.
