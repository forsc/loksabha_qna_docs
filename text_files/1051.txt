ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                          (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a) to (c)	As per Metro Rail Policy, 2017, the state government desirous of availing central financial assistance for upcoming metro rail projects, should mandatorily explore the possibility of having a Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement in some form for implementation, operation and maintenance, fare collection or any other unbundled activities of the proposed metro rail project, to the extent feasible.  The policy includes Viability Gap Funding(VGF) under the VGF Scheme of Government of India as one of the option for central financial assistance.Every proposal for Metro Rail should necessarily include proposals for feeder systems that help to enlarge the catchment area of each metro station at least to 5 kms. Provision of last mile connectivity through pedestrian pathways, Non-Motorized Transport (NMT) infrastructure, and induction of facilities for para transit modes will also be essential requirements for availing any central financial assistance. These measures will incentivize commuters for using the metro rail, thus enhancing ridership.                            ***
