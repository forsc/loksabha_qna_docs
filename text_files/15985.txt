ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (f):      Yes. A study conducted by the environmental Non-Government Organization (NGO) “Toxic Link” states that certain detergents cause cancer. The study claims that Nonylphenol, organic compounds used in production of detergents  may cause cancer. Scientific studies report differing opinions about carcinogenic potential of Nonylphenol. It is reported that this compound’s potential role as an endocrine disruptor and due to its ability to act like estrogen it may cause increased incidences of breast cancer.  However, Nonylphenol has not been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as human carcinogen. Due to lack of scientific evidence that Nonylphenol may affect human health, there is no maximum residual limit or safety level proposed by World Health Organization, European Food Safety Authority or any other International agencies.……………………
