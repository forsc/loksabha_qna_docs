ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                        (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)& (b):	As per Central Ground Water Board, 18.7% of the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), including the metro cities of Patna, Chandigarh, Delhi, Pune, Indore, Nashik, Ludhiana, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota, Agra, Ghaziabad, Hyderabad etc. are facing water crisis. The apparent reasons attributed to shortage of drinking water are rapid decline in ground water due to indiscriminate extraction, erratic monsoon and unauthorized development.(c):	Water supply is a State subject and it is the responsibility of the States/ULBs to ensure adequate supply of water in the cities. Government of India augments the efforts of the States/ULBs through its various flagship schemes. Government of India launched Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) on 25 June, 2015 for providing basic amenities in 500 selected Mission cities in the country. Water supply to households is one of the thrust areas under the Mission. Out of the total approved State Annual Action Plans (SAAPs) of ?77,640 crore under AMRUT, ?39,011 crore has been allocated to water supply sector. Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs have taken additional measures aimed at water conservation like issuance of guidelines for Urban Regional Development Plan Formulation and Implementation (URDPFI) and Model Building Bye-laws (MBBL) for the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and Urban Development Authorities (UDA) to implement rain water harvesting and take other water conservation measures. Central Public Works Department has also brought out a manual on “Rain Water Harvesting & Conservation” in June, 2012 to augment groundwater levels.Recently, Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA) has been launched by Government of India to intensify efforts for conservation, restoration, recharge and reuse of water through rainwater harvesting, rejuvenation of water bodies andreuse of treated waste water etc. Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is participating actively in the Abhiyanand has issued “Guidelines for Urban Water Conservation” for the States/UTs.(d) & (e):	Selection, appraisal, approval and implementation of projects under AMRUT are done by the concerned States/Union Territories (UTs). Government of India approves only SAAPs submitted by the States/UTs and releases Central Assistance as per Mission guidelines. Under AMRUT, SAAPs for the entire Mission period (25 June, 2015 to 31 March, 2020) amounting to ?77,640 crore, which include committed Central Assistance of ?35,990 crore, have already been approved by the Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs.                         *****
