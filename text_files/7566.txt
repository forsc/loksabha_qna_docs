The scheme provides for taking up Short Term Training (STT) courses and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) through accredited and affiliated training centers (TCs) throughout the country. Under the scheme, empanelment of TCs is done through the process of accreditation and affiliation for respective job roles on digital platform known as SMART (Skill Management and Accreditation of Training Centres). As on 11.11.2019, 166 TCs have been empanelled under PMKVY 2016-20 in the State of Chhattisgarh. Out of which, 59 TCs are currently operational.Ministry promotes establishment of model and aspirational skill centres known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) in every district for imparting skill training through PMKVY 2016-20. As on 11.11.2019, 27 PMKKs have been allocated and all of them have been established in State of Chhattisgarh.As on 11.11.2019, 0.94 lakh candidates (0.76 lakh in STT and 0.18 lakh in RPL) have been trained under PMKVY 2016-20 in the State of Chhattisgarh. Under STT, as per data reported on SDMS (Skill Development Management System), as on 11.11.2019, 56,341 candidates are certified. Out of these candidates, 20,807 candidates have been reported to be placed in various sectors.(d) and (e)	PMKVY has two components known as Centrally Sponsored Centrally Managed (CSCM) being implemented by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and Centrally Sponsored State Managed (CSSM) being implemented by State Skill Development Missions of the States/ UTs popularly known as State- Engagement Component of PMKVY (2016-20).Under CSCM component of PMKVY 2016-20, there is no provision of State-wise or district-wise funds allocation. However, under CSSM component of PMKVY 2016-20, 25% of the funds and corresponding physical targets of PMKVY 2016-20 have been allocated to the States for the implementation of scheme through State Skill Development Missions across the State covering all districts.
