ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYAND EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a)	& (b) Yes Sir. Based on the statistics during 1891-2017, on an average 5 cyclones develop over North Indian Ocean in a year with 4 developing over Bay of Bengal and 1 over Arabian Sea. However, in the recent past increase in frequency had been observed in formation of cyclones in the North Indian Ocean. Also studies show an increase in frequency of severe cyclones over Arabian Sea in recent years.The details of Cyclones formed over North Indian Ocean during 2017 to 2019 follow: YEAR	Frequency of Cyclones over	Total number of cyclones	Intensity with that of Severe Cyclones or more	Arabian Sea	Bay of Bengal 		2017	1	2	3	22018	3	4	7	62019	5	3	8	6The occurrence of 5 cyclones over Arabian Sea in 2019 against the normal of 1 per year equals the previous record of 1902 for the highest annual cyclone frequency over Arabian Sea. Also 2019 witnessed development of more intense cyclones over Arabian Sea.Regarding flood, it is mentioned that, the country has witnessed intense to very intense rainfall activity leading to flood scenario in the recent past. The number of stations reported Very Heavy and Extreme Heavy rainfall in the last three years, from 2017 to 2019, follow: YEAR	Number of stations reported during SW Monsoon season (June to September)	Very Heavy Rainfall (115.6-204.4 mm)	Extremely Heavy Rainfall (204.5 mm or more)2017	1824	2612018	2181	3212019	3056	554The data shows that there is a steady increase in the number of heavy rainfall events during the last three years.The spatial map of location of Very Heavy & Extremely Heavy Rainfall reported stations for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 are attached separately as Annexure I, II and III, respectively.(c) 	Details of the natural calamities like floods in Madhya Pradesh during the last three years are given in Annexure IV. These are mainly based on media reports, received through State Meteorological Centres.(d)	IMD uses a suite of quality observations from satellites, radars and conventional & automatic weather stations for monitoring of cyclones and prediction of weather. It includes INSAT 3D, 3DR and SCATSAT satellites, Doppler Weather Radars (DWRs) along the coast and Automated Weather Stations (AWS), Automatic Rain Gauges (ARGs), meteorological buoys and ships. Operational implementation of improved suite of prediction models has enhanced the weather forecasting capability through assimilation of all available global satellite radiance & Radar data for the production of forecast products at 12 km grid globally and 3 km grid over India/regional/mega city domains.Further improvements in the observational network and numerical modelling are in progress under the scheme Atmosphere & Climate Research – Modelling Observing Systems & Services (ACROSS) for betterment of forecasting natural disasters like cyclone and heavy rainfall with respect to accuracy, lead time and spatial resolution.
