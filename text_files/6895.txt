As per the review in the year 2017 for categorization of stations for the period 2017-18 to 2022-23, Jhansi is a Non-Suburban Grade (NSG)-2 category station based on  annual passenger earnings (reserved and unreserved) and number of outward passengers handled at station.   (c): There is no station category as Smart railway station category.  Jhansi station is a Adarsh Station and various facilities such as improvement in façade, circulating area, lighting arrangements, retiring room, Pay & Use toilet,  Passenger Guidance System including Signages & Coach Indicator Boards etc. have been provided. However, upgradation of passenger amenities is a continuous process.
