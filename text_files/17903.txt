THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI  PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) & (c): The Government of Rajasthan has launched Rajasthan Investment Promotion Scheme 2019, with an aim to encourage investment in the state. In the Scheme apart from general benefits available to all enterprises, the following additional benefits are offered to enterprises in most backward areas:•	Applicable Investment Subsidy for an additional three years, subject to maximum of ten years•	Applicable Employment Generation Subsidy for an additional three years, subject to maximum of ten years•	Applicable Exemption from payment of electricity duty for an additional three years, subject to maximum of ten years and•	1% Additional Interest subsidy, if an enterprise in eligible for interest subsidy under the scheme.  	Banswara/ Dungarpur districts of the state have been notified, by the Government of Rajasthan, in the list of most backward districts, under the said Scheme and additional benefits as specified above, will be accessible to enterprises in this region. Further, the Government of Rajasthan, is attempting to get loans from financial institutions on a priority basis to, so that industries can be established in these areas. Additionally, for promotion and development of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), throughout the country , including in Banswara-Dungarpur, Rajasthan,  schemes/programmes such as Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), Scheme of Fund for Regeneration of Traditional Industries (SFURTI), A Scheme for Promoting Innovation, Rural Industry and Entrepreneurship (ASPIRE), Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme for Micro and Small Enterprises, Credit Linked Capital Subsidy and Technology Up-gradation Scheme (CLCS-TUS), Micro & Small Enterprises - Cluster Development Programme (MSE-CDP), and National Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Hub (NSSH), are being implemented by the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium enterprises.
