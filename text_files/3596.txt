ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) The country’s economic growth, rise in per capita income, and technological innovations coupled with high obsolescence rate of electronic and electrical equipmentshas resulted in increase in the rate of generation of e-waste. The toxic constituents such as Lead, Mercury, Cadmium, Hexavalent Chromium, Polybrominated biphenyls and Polybrominated diphenyl ethers are used in the manufacturing of electronic devices. Disposal of e-waste from such electronic devices, without processing it in an environmentally sound manner, may affect the human health and environment including soil and ground water.(b)The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in 2005 estimated 1.47 lakh ton of e-waste in the country. As per the United Nations University report, “The Global E-Waste Monitor 2017”, 20 lakh ton of e-waste generation was reported in the country in 2016. Recently Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) has developed a guideline on uniform inventorization of e-waste in the Country. (c) to (e) As per the information available with Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), 312 dismantlers and recyclers have been granted authorization by 18 State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/Pollution Control Committees (PCCs). These authorized dismantlers and recyclers have the cumulative annual processing capacity of 7,82,080MT. State-wise detail of installed recycling/dismantling facilities operating in the country is as given below:Sl. No.	State	Number of Authorized Dismantler/Recycler	State Wise Capacity (MTPA)1.		Andhra Pradesh	01	4802.		Chhattisgarh	01	6003.		Gujarat 	16	490534.		Goa	01	1035.		Haryana	28	827386.		Himachal Pradesh	01	10007.		Jammu & Kashmir	01	1658.		Karnataka	71	527229.

Uttarakhand	04	1925018.		West Bengal	03	1860	312	7,82,080In order to ensure safe disposal of e-waste the Government has notified E-Waste (Management) Rules in March, 2016. The provisions of these Rules include extended producers responsibility, setting up of producer responsibility organizations and e-waste exchange to facilitate collection and recycling, assigning specific responsibility to bulk consumers of electronic products for safe disposal, providing for economic incentives for collection of electronic waste, and other measures which include responsibility of producers of electronic and electrical products for collection and channelizing of electronic waste. The Rules provide for simplified permission process for setting up of dismantling and recycling facilities through single authorization. State Governments have been entrusted with the responsibility for earmarking industrial space for e-waste dismantling and recycling facilities, and to undertake industrial skill development and establish measures for safety and health of workers engaged in dismantling and recycling facilities of e-waste.The MeitY is involved in developing technology to recycle e-waste in an environmentally sound manner. MeitY has set up a demonstration plant at Bangalore through a project titled “Environmentally Sound Methods for Recovery of Metals from Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) – Phase II”, which is being implemented by the Centre for Materials for Electronics Technology (C-MET), Hyderabad and E-Parisara, Bengaluru at a total budget outlay of Rs. 1126.80 lakhs, over a period of five years since August 2014.  A processing technology through physical separation and chemical leaching methods has been developed for recycling and reuse of electronic waste at National Metallurgical Laboratory (NML), Jamshedpur. MeitY has also established demonstration process at the Central Institute of Plastics Engineering & Technology (CIPET), Bhubaneswar- Autonomous academic institute under Department of Chemical & Petrochemicals, Government of India on converting plastics of e-waste to virgin master batch, which can be used for value added products.*****
