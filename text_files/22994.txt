                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (b):	The approval of any new drugs including COVID-19 vaccine for manufacturing and marketing is based on the submission of adequate data including Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control (CMC), non-clinical (animal studies), clinical trial data as per the provisions of New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules,2019 providing favourable risk-benefit profile of the Drugs or vaccine. The data emerging from clinical trials provide the information about solicited and unsolicited adverse reaction limited to trial population.Monitoring of safety by a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is a critical component of any clinical trial for reporting of adverse events, if any, during the clinical trials.(c) to (d):	At the start of COVID-19 vaccination drive, fewer than planned beneficiaries attended vaccination sessions due to transient technical issues in Co-WIN portal, vaccine hesitancy etc. which have progressively been addressed and the rate of vaccination coverage has subsequently increased. Till 17th March 2021, more than 1.20 crore doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered among the Health Care Workers.(e):	COVID-19 Vaccines Communication Strategy has been prepared to raise awareness about the COVID-19 vaccines and address misinformation against vaccination. The strategy aims to promptly disseminate factual information about the vaccines and the vaccination process. This is being done through multimedia platforms (print/electronic/social media), through MoHFW website and engagement of various stakeholders, community leaders and influencers to reach out to the last mile.(f) :	There is no provision of compensation for recipients of COVID-19 vaccine against any kind of side effects or medical complications that may arise due to inoculation. The COVID-19 vaccination is entirely voluntary for the beneficiary.However, measures have been put in place like availability of anaphylaxis kits at each vaccination site, immediate referral to Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) management center and observation of vaccine recipients for 30 minutes at session site for any adverse events so as to take timely corrective measure. Also, the AEFI management of such cases are provided free of cost treatment in Public Health Facilities.
