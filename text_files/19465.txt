ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (d):	India, being  a founding member of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has deep respect for its principles and objectives.  The Government of India has always upheld the basic tenets of tripartism. ILO has not commented about India’s lack of compliance with ILO Convention -144 on Tripartite Consultations in implementing the four Labour Codes. The four Codes namely the Code on Wages, 2019, the Industrial Relations Code, 2020, the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 and the Code on Social Security, 2020 have been notified but the various provisions contained in the Codes have not been brought into force. The Government has done extensive consultations inviting all Central Trade Unions, Employers’ Associations and State Governments. All these Codes, at draft stage, were placed on the website of the Ministry, for stakeholders’ consultations including general public. Further all the Codes were referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour and the Committee has given its report which was taken into account before getting passed by the Parliament.********
