In order to focus on quality education, the Central rules to the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act have been amended to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) conducted a National Achievement Survey, under which learning outcomes of students were evaluated.2.	  The online D.El.Ed. course has been started from 3rd October, 2017 and 9,58,513 teachers have successfully completed the training. A four year B.Ed integrated course has been launched for which applications have been invited on 3rd June 2019. 3.	The Central Government has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education – Samagra Shiksha, from 2018-19. Government of India has decided to  participate in the Programme for International Students Assessment (PISA) to be conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2021. Approval has been given for conducting a Census based audit called Shagunotsav of all government and government aided schools in all States and UTs. In 2019-20, approval has been given for an Integrated Teacher Training Programme formulated by NCERT & National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration (NIEPA) and School Based Assessment (SBA).4. MHRD has designed a 70 indicators based matrix Performance Grading Index (PGI) to grade the States/UTs.  To collect timely and accurate data,  a well-functioning and sustainable Educational Management Information System called UDISE+ (UDISE plus) has been launched in 2018-19.5.  In 2019-20, approval has been given for setting up Youth and Eco Club  in all Government Schools across the country. In order to experience  and celebrate the rich cultural diversity of India, Rangotsav was organized in schools in 2018-19.(b) to (d)  	The Rajkiya Pratibha Vidyalaya is a State Government scheme. The State of Uttar Pradesh has informed that there are two schemes on lines of Rajkiya Pratibha Vidyalaya, namely 18 Abhinav Vidyalaya (one in each Division) and 148 Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya model schools.However, the Ministry of Human Resource Development is running the Kendriya Vidyalayas & Novodaya Vidyalayas, which are pace setting institutions providing quality education. Further, under the centrally sponsored scheme Samagra Shiksha, funds are given to all States and UTs for strengthening of infrastructure and provision of other facilities in schools to ensure that all schools meet the prescribed norms, besides other interventions to improve the quality of education.                                         *****
