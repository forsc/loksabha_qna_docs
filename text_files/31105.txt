Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), in consultation with the State Governments, has also started a comprehensive reform exercise in States and UTs in December 2014. Under Business Reforms Action Plan (BRAP), all States/UTs in the country are ranked on the basis of reforms implemented by them on designated parameters. This exercise has helped in improving business environment across States.An Empowered Group of Secretaries has been constituted to fast track investments in the country.
