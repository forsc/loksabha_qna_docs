The sector has been severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.No formal study has been instituted for assessment of the impact on the Tourism sector and job losses. However, several rounds of discussions and brainstorming sessions with industry stakeholders indicate massive loss of revenue, foreign exchange and jobs. In view of the highly unorganized nature of the sector, the impact in numerical terms can only be ascertained in due course. (c) to (f): The stimulus packages announced by the various agencies and ministries of Government of India are outlined as under:•	RBI has extended moratorium on term loans till 31st August 2020.•	The government has further announced Atmanirbhar Bharat Package vide which Rs 3 lakh crore collateral free automatic loan has been made available for MSMEs. The loan will have 4-year tenure and will have 12-month moratorium.•	The Government waived off PF contribution for three months for organizations with less than 100 pax and 90% employees having salary below Rs.15000. Under Atmanirbhar Bharat package, PF contribution of both employer and employee has been reduced to 10% each from existing 12% each for all establishments covered by EPFO for the next three months i.e. up to September 2020.•	Deferment of TCS upto October 2020.•	Return filing deferred for three months with no penal interest for companies upto 5 Crore, rest @ 9% penal interest.•	The Central government has also given relief from various regulatory compliances under Income Tax Act, companies Act and GST Act for varying period in the wake of COVID-19 crisis to ensure business continuity and survival. The Ministry of Tourism has not received any proposal from any state for increased allocation of funds for development and promotion of tourism in view of the covid-19 pandemic. The following steps have been taken to overcome the crisis caused by Covid-19 pandemic in the tourism sector: (i)   Detailed operational guidelines for Covid safety and hygiene  for hotels, restaurants, B&Bs/ Home stays and Tourism Service Providers have been formulated and issued on 08.06.2020 to facilitate smooth resumption of business.(ii)   Validity of approval or certifications of hotels and other accommodation units whose project approval / re-approval and classification / re-classification have expired / were likely to expire, has been extended upto 30th September, 2020.(iii)  The Ministry,  has developed an initiative called SAATHI (System for Assessment, Awareness & Training for Hospitality Industry), for effective implementation of Guidelines/SOPs issued with reference to COVID 19 and beyond for safe operations of Hotels, Restaurants, B&Bs and other units.(iv) Operational Recommendations for safe resumption of business with easing of lockdown restrictions have been issued for various segments of the travel and hospitality industry and circulated amongst all stakeholders.
