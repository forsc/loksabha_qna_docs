ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) to (e):	Ministry of Labour & Employment in technical collaboration with National Informatics Centre (NIC) is in the process of developing a registration module for creating a comprehensive National Database for Unorganized Workers (NDUW) seeded with Aadhaar for all Unorganised workers including Construction Workers, Migrant Workers, Gig and Platform workers, Street Vendors, Domestic Workers, Agriculture Workers, Migrant workers and similar other sub-group of Unorganised workers. At present, the process for dry run and security audit is underway. The State Governments are to populate the data on the portal by mobilising the unorganised workers. The portal will be available in public  domain for self  registration. The Common Service Centre through its nation-wide network of over 4 lakh centres and selected post offices of the Department of Posts will act as registration centres, where workers can visit and register themselves free of cost. Contd..2/-::  2 ::The Central Government has already implemented the One Nation One Ration Card  across the country except in the States/UT of Assam, Chhattisgarh, Delhi and West Bengal. These States/UT have been directed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court to implement the same by not later than 31st July 2021. (f):		As per Section 142 of the Code on Social Security, 2020, Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) had made Aadhaar seeding mandatory for filing Electronic Challan-cum-Return (ECR) for all Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) accounts from 01.06.2021 and all employers were instructed to make Universal Account Numbers (UANs) of EPF account holders Aadhaar authenticated. However, representations were received from various stakeholders for extension of the time period. Keeping in view of pandemic situation and closure of Aadhaar enrolment centres due to Covid-19, Government has extended the mandatory filing of ECRs with Aadhaar-verified UAN till 1st September, 2021.*****
