ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) :     Biomass co-firing in Thermal Power Station (TPS) has several benefits as under:i.	Reduction in amount of coal used for power generation resulting in corresponding savings in CO2 emissions. This would also reduce the sector’s dependence on coal.ii.	Production of electricity from a resource (biomass) which was earlier being wasted.iii.	Income generation for farmers and job creation by pellet manufacturers.iv.	Preservation of soil culture which gets destroyed in farm fires.v.	Reduction in air pollution due to reduction in stubble burning.(b) :    		Efforts are being made to meet the demand for 5% co-firing in TPS across the country. With the Government policy in force and multiple initiatives taken to strengthen supply chain infrastructure, pellet/briquette manufacturing capacity is expected to rise in near future.(c) : 	  	About 23 Thermal Power Plants have co-fired biomass pellets so far. Approximately 66000 Metric Tons (MT) of biomass has been co-fired till date. (d) & (e) : 	As per present initiative, Biomass Pellets are targeted to co-fire with coal. The blending of biomass with coal will reduce coal dependence in thermal power plants.************
