                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c):	A total of 3,207 hospitals are registered with National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH) under its voluntary Accreditation Schemes and 8,602 under its Certification Schemes.	Quality Council of India has informed that it is difficult to state the exact percentage of the hospitals registered with the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH) in the country as there is no exact count of all the hospitals and nursing homes in the country. 	As per arrangement with Central Government Health Schemes (CGHS), Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) and Medical Value Travel Facilitator (MVTF), NABH processes the applications received from hospitals for empanelment by concerned agencies. A total of 2,756 hospitals have applied to NABH under this arrangement.NABH Accreditation is a voluntary process and therefore it is entirely up to the healthcare organization whether or not to apply and get NABH accreditation.
