                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	The Government is not in receipt of any such report regarding use of banned pesticides by farmers. States of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himanchal Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana and Tamilnadu have also reported that there are no instances of use of banned pesticides.(b):	 Pesticides are registered for use in the country by the Registration Committee only after satisfying about their efficacy and safety to human health, animal and environment.Further, monitoring of quality of pesticides is a shared responsibility between the Central and State Governments. Central Government and State Governments have notified 192 and 10946 Insecticides Inspectors respectively to check sale of misbranded pesticides. Insecticide samples are drawn on a regular basis and analyzed in 70 State Pesticides Testing Laboratories (SPTLs) and at the two Regional Pesticides Testing Laboratories at Chandigarh and Kanpur. Action is initiated under the provisions of the Insecticides Act, 1968 against those samples which are found misbranded. In the last 05 years (2014-15 to 2018-19), 3,33,557 samples have been analyzed and 3855 prosecutions have been launched against the firms and dealers whose samples were found substandard and penalty was imposed by the Hon’ble Courts in 152 cases. Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare is implementing ‘Sub-Mission on Plant Protection and Plant Quarantine’ Scheme, under which Integrated Pest Management approach is being promoted to educate the farmers about judicious use of chemical pesticides and to recommend use as per the directions prescribed on the label and leaflets. Integrated Pest Management seeks to promote cultural, mechanical, biological methods of pest control and recommends use of chemical pesticides as a measure of last resort.  During the last 5 years (2014-15 to 2018-19), 3730 Farmer Field Schools and 732 HRD programmes were conducted under Integrated Pest Management and 1,41,180 farmers, pesticide dealers and officials have been trained.
