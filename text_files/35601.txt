ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) & (b) In order to achieve universal literacy, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched the Samagra Shiksha - an Integrated Scheme for School Education, throughout the country as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme with effect from Financial Year 2018-19. This programme subsumes the three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). It is an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education. It envisages the ‘school’ as a continuum from pre-school, primary, upper primary, secondary to senior secondary levels. The States/UTs are assisted by the central government to implement the Samagra Shiksha as a programme for providing universal access and retention, bridging the gender and social category gaps in education and enhancement of learning level of children at all levels of school education. 		In order to improve the literacy rate among adults, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Adult Education namely Saakshar Bharat was implemented in the rural areas of 404 districts in 26 States and one UT, that had adult female literacy rate of 50 percent and below as per Census 2001, including left wing extremism affected districts, irrespective of their literacy rates, with special focus on women and other disadvantaged groups, since October 2009. The target was to raise the overall literacy rate of the country to 80 per cent and reduce gender gap to 10 percentage point by end of XII five year plan. The scheme was extended upto 31.03.2019. During the implementation of Saakshar Bharat scheme, against the overall target of making 7 crore adult non-literates as literates, around 7.64 crore learners, having passed the biannual Basic Literacy Assessment Tests conducted by National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) between August, 2010 to March, 2018, were certified as literates. Further, a new Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Adult Education “Padhna Likhna Abhiyaan” is being implemented in rural and urban areas of 33 states/ UTs during the financial year 2020-21, with a target of making 48.16 lakh adult non-literates as literates. The scheme has been further extended upto 31.03.2022. The Union of India has approved a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, namely, “New India Literacy Programme (NILP)” with the aim to support the States and Union Territories in promoting literacy among non-literates in the age group of 15 and above, across the country covering 5 crore non-literates during the implementation period from 2022-23 to 2026-27. The scheme has been approved with a financial outlay of Rs.1037.90 crore including Central share of Rs.700.00 crore and State share of Rs.337.90 crore.  ****
