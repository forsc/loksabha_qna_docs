ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS,  HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) & (b)	No, Sir. A test check has however been done by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) of India in the year 2015 across the country which has revealed that Speed Post service is faster and more reliable than private couriers at the local level, in major cities and at tehsil level. Moreover, the traffic and revenue of Speed Post have been increasing over the years indicating the trust of the customers in the service.  There has been more than 34% growth of Speed Post traffic from Financial Year 2014-15 to 2018-19.(c) 	Does not arise in view of the above.(d)	The performance of Speed Post is monitored through a performance dashboard under which various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are regularly evaluated. Direct available flights are being used from one Speed Post processing hub to another to ensure expedited transmission and delivery of Speed Post. Further Nodal Mechanized Delivery Centres (NDCs) have been operationalised for mechanized delivery of Speed Post parcels. Department has also setup semi-automated parcel centres enabling mechanized sorting of parcels (including Speed Post parcels). Funds for site preparation and infrastructure upgrade of the processing hubs are allotted every year to ensure smooth working in the Speed Post hubs.************
