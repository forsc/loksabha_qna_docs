ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (d): Government is aware of the impact of the Covid crisis on airlines. Regular stakeholders consultations are held and required policy decisions are taken.  Further, airlines are commercial entities which prepare their business plan on the basis of their own market assessment and liabilities. Mobilizing financial resources and ensuring efficient operations as per business plan are the responsibility of the airline. ;The Ministry of Civil Aviation  helps the airlines by providing a congenial environment to function. The steps taken to facilitate Civil Aviation in India includes:;;I. Provide airport infrastructure through Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the private operators.II. Provide an efficient Air Navigation System in the CountryIII. Regulate the aviation industry through Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to ensure safety standards.IV. Coordinate with all stakeholders to resolve their issues.V. Provide Viability Gap Funding (VGF) and other concessions to selected airline operators under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) as per the scheme document.VI. Reduction of Central Excise Duty applicable on ATF from 14% to 11% w.e.f. 11th October 2018 and rationalization of Goods and Services Tax (GST) provisions, with a view to revive the airline industry.VII. Rationalization of Category-I routes under Route Dispersal Guidelines (RDGs) on the basis of criteria given in NCAP 2016.VIII. The requirement for 5/20 is modified and all airlines can commence international operations provided that they deploy 20 aircraft or 20% of total capacity (in terms of average number of seats on all departure put together) whichever is higher for domestic operations.IX. Liberalization of domestic code share points in India within the framework of Air Service Agreements (ASA).X.With a view to modernize existing airports so as to establish high standards and ease demand pressures on them, 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) under automatic route has been allowed in brownfield airport projects. This would also facilitate the development of domestic aviation infrastructure. FDI for Scheduled Air Transport Service/ Domestic Scheduled Passenger Airline has been allowed upto 49% under automatic route. For Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), 100% FDI will continue to be allowed under automatic route. Foreign airlines would be allowed to invest in capital of Indian companies operating scheduled and non-scheduled air transport services up to the limit of 49% of their paid up capital. Such investment is subject to the condition, inter alia, that Scheduled and Non-Scheduled Operator''s Permit would be granted only to a company the substantial ownership and effective control of which is vested in Indian nationals.;XI. Also Government of India provides some financial assistance to Air India. ;As per information made available by the scheduled Indian carriers, the financial statement for the period of financial year 2015-16 to 2019-2020 (provisional) is attached as Annexure-I. ;
