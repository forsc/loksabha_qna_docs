Specific schemes are also launched by MHA from time to time.   Under the scheme ‘Cyber Crime Prevention against Women & Children’, financial grant has been released for setting up of a cyber forensic cum training lab in each State/UT and a National Cyber Forensic Lab is also envisaged.  Another scheme has been rolled out namely ‘Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre’ which aims to address all aspects of cyber crimes in a comprehensive and coordinated manner.   Further, use of latest tools and technology by law enforcement agencies to fight crime is an ongoing processIn addition, Cyber Police Stations and Cyber Crime Cells have been set up in each State to deal with cyber crimes. MHA has launched a portal namely, www.cybercrime.gov.in to report complaints of child pornography and sexually abusive explicit content. A dedicated portal www.infosecawareness.in has also been created for awareness creation relating to cyber safety issues.Further, MHA, Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY)  and State Governments have taken steps to modernise and equip police personnel with knowledge and skills for prevention and control of cybercrime through various Police academies/ judicial academies and other institutes. A number of training programmes have been conducted for Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) about cyber-crime investigation. In addition, MeitY has setup Cyber Forensics Training Labs in north-eastern States and cities such as Mumbai, Pune, Kolkata and Bangalore to train State police officials and judiciary in cyber crime detection and collection, preservation and seizing of electronic evidence and dealing with cyber crime. MeitY has also organized a number of cyber crime awareness workshops for LEAs across various States.*******
