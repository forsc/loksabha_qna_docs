ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS(SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)to (d): ‘Land’ and ‘Colonization’ are State subjects. Therefore, it comes in the domain of State / UT Governments to cater to the needs of housing of its citizens. Government of India, however, through its earlier scheme of Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JnNURM) has extended central assistance to States/UTs for providing housing with basic civic amenities to urban poor. Government has also launched Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-(Urban) {PMAY(U)} on 25.06.2015 to provide central assistance to States/UTs for providing housing to all eligible families / beneficiaries. PMAY (U) guidelines require States/UTs to conduct demand assessment and validate the same to arrive at the actual demand for housing among its citizens belonging to the urban poor. So far, a demand of around 7.76 lakh houses has been assessed by the State of Gujarat.A total of 6,59,123  houses have been sanctioned  in the State of Gujarat under JnNURM and PMAY(U); out of which 4,23,591 houses have been constructed and 3,47362 house have been  occupied by beneficiaries. During the last three years, a total of  1,25,102 houses have been allotted and occupied by Economically Weaker Section (EWS) beneficiaries in the State of Gujarat. The names of cities in Gujarat where houses are being constructed under the schemes of JnNURM and PMAY(U)  along with city-wise beneficiaries thereunder are  annexed. 					*******
