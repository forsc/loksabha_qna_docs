The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (PoA Act) has been amended in 2015 to make it more effective. The amendments include new offences, expanded scope of presumptions, institutional strengthening, which inter-alia includes establishment of Exclusive Special Courts and specification of Exclusive Special Public Prosecutors to exclusively try the offences under the PoA Act to enable expeditious disposal of cases, power of Special Courts and Exclusive Special Courts to take direct cognizance of offence and as far as possible, completion of trial within two months from the date of filing of the charge sheet, establishing rights of victims and witnesses, and strengthening preventive measures. Further, Section 18 of the PoA Act was amended by the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2018 (No. 27 of 2018) and enforced on 20.08.2018, and now conduct of a preliminary enquiry before registration of an FIR, or to seek approval of any authority prior to arrest of an accused, is no longer required. Government of India has issued advisories from time to time for effective implementation of the PoA Act and Rules.*****
