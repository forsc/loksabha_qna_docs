ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (SMT. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) and (b) Tata Memorial Centre under aegis of Department of Atomic Energy has published a study, “A Prospective study to determine the cost of illness for Oral Cancer in India”. This study found that the unit cost of treating oral cancer advanced stages was found to be 42 percent greater than early stages. Medical equipment accounted for 97.8 percent of capital costs, with the highest contributor being the radiology services that included CT, MRI and PET scan. Variable costs that included consumables for surgery in advanced stages were 1.4 times higher than in early stages. With the addition of additional chemo and radiotherapy to surgery, the average cost of treatment increased by 44.6 percent. About 60-80 percent of the cases of oral cancer visit their specialist oncologists at advanced stages(c) and (d) Health is a state subject. The Department of Health & Family Welfare, however, is providing technical and financial support to the States/UTs under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) including Oral Cancer, as part of National Health Mission (NHM), based on the proposals received from the States/UTs. The support is inter alia provided for health promotion & awareness generation for Cancer, including Oral Cancer, with focus on risk factors and methods of prevention.A population level initiative for prevention, control and screening for common cancers viz. Oral, breast and cervical cancer, has been rolled out in over 697 districts of the country under NHM, as a part of Comprehensive Primary Healthcare. Under the initiative persons more than 30 years of age are targeted for their screening for common NCDs. Screening of oral cancer is an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres. The process of conducting Population Based Screening for oral cancer also spreads awareness in the community about the importance of maintenance of healthy lifestyles and avoidance of Oral Cancer risk factors, such as the use of tobacco. The National Tobacco Control Programme (NTCP), under the aegis of NHM, also generates awareness through extensive IEC activities about tobacco consumption being a serious risk factor for Oral Cancer.
