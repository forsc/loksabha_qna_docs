ANSWER




 MINISTER OF EDUCATION (SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’) (a) to (d): 	The Department has launched the Samagra Shiksha – an Integrated Scheme for School Education by subsuming the erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE) from 2018-19.  It is an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education. 	The major objectives of the Samagra Shiksha include provisioning of quality education and enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring equity and inclusion at all levels of school education, ensuring minimum standards in schooling, promoting vocationalisation of education, supporting States and UTs in implementation of The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 and strengthening and up-gradation of SCERTs/State Institutes of Education and DIETs.	Under the Samagra Shiksha, the States and UTs were asked to form a single State Implementation Society (SIS) at the State/UT level and one single implementation unit at district and sub-district levels, for implementation of the scheme.Under Samagra Shiksha Scheme, the annual plans are prepared by the States and UTs based on their requirements and priority and this is reflected in their respective Annual Work Plan and Budget (AWP&B) Proposal. These plans are then appraised and approved/estimated by the Project Approval Board (PAB) in the Department of School Education & Literacy in consultation with the States and UTs as per the programmatic and financial norms of the scheme, availability of funds and physical and financial progress of the State for the interventions approved earlier. Further, the funds are  released on the basis of submission of Audited Accounts, Utilization Certificate, physical and financial progress and other documents as prescribed under the Financial Management & Procurement (FMP) Manual of Samagra Shiksha. 	The statement showing State/UT-wise details on release of central share under Samagra Shiksha since 2018-19 to 2020-21 is at Annexure-I.(e)	The Samagra Shiksha aims to achieve universal access, at all levels of education in an inclusive and equitable manner by provisioning of schooling facilities to all children including children belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Minority communities, children affected with migration, urban deprived children, homeless children, children without adult protection, children affected with LWE extremism, children affected with violence etc.   Preference for various interventions is given to Educationally Backward Blocks (EBBs), LWE affected districts, Special Focus Districts (SFDs) and Aspirational Districts. Statement indicating State / UT wise details of EBB, LWEs affected districts, Special Focused Districts and Aspirational Districts is given at Annexure-II.*****
