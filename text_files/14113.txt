                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d):	A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2850 BY SHRI RANJEETSINGH HINDURAO NAIK NIMBALKAR TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 11.03.2020 REGARDING CONSTRUCTION OF PHALTAN TO PANDHARPUR RAILWAY LINE(a) and (b):    Phaltan-Pandharpur (108.70 km) new line project was included in Budget 2017-18 subject to requisite Government approvals.  As per Detailed Project Report (DPR), cost of this new line project has been assessed as `1,153 crore with Rate of Return (-) 3%.Considering the huge shelf of ongoing new line projects and being financially unremunerative, it is very difficult for Railways to bear the entire cost of the project. Accordingly, Government of Maharashtra has been requested to give consent for bearing 50% cost of the project and also to provide land free of cost so that project can be processed for sanction.•	PROJECTS IN MAHARASHTRA (PROJECTS FALING FULLY/PARTLY IN THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA) :?	38 Projects costing `73,485 crore for 5,879 km length falling fully/partly in Maharashtra are under different stage of planning/approval/execution. These include:o	16 New Line Projects covering a length of 2,043 km at a cost of `38,129 crore. Out of which, 63 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `3,479 crore has been incurred upto March 2019.  o	5 Gauge Conversion Projects covering a length of 1,135 km at a cost of `11,102 crore. Out of which, 500 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `4,324 crore has been incurred upto March 2019.o	17 Doubling Projects covering a length of 2,701 km at a cost of `24,255 crore. Out of which, 234 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `5,369 crore has been incurred upto March 2019.•	BUDGET ALLOCATION (FOR THE PROJECTS FALLING FULLY/PARTLY IN THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA):?	Average annual Budget allocation on infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/partly in the State of Maharashtra, during 2014-19 has increased to `4,801 crore per year from `1,171 crore per year (during 2009-14). Thus, the average annual Budget allocation during 2014-19 is 310% more as compared to average annual allocation of 2009-14. ?	Total allocation of Budget for infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/ partly in State of   Maharashtra, in 2019-20 is `7,281 crore, which is 522% more than the average annual Budget allocation of 2009-14.•	COMMISSIONING OF PROJECTS (FALLING FULLY/PARTLY IN THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA):?	During 2009-14, 292 km (111 km of New Line, 135 km of Gauge Conversion and 46 km of Doubling) falling fully/partly in the State of Maharashtra, have been commissioned at an average rate of 58 km per year.  ?	During 2014-19, 596 km (87 km of New Line, 92 km of Gauge Conversion and 417 km of Doubling) falling fully/partly in the State of Maharashtra, have been commissioned in the State at an average rate of 119 km per year, which is 104% more than commissioning during 2009-14. (c) and (d):	       Question of completion time line of the project does not arise since the project is not sanctioned.  Satara to Phaltan via Lonand is an existing line.*****
