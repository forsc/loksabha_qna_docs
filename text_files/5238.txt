ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI THAAWARCHAND GEHLOT)(a) to (e):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.  STATEMENT (a) to (e):	Instructions have been issued by Department of Personnel and Training for issuance and verification of Caste Certificates of Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) throughout the country including Delhi, from time to time.  The lists of Scheduled Castes (SCs) under the provisions of Articles 341 of the Constitution and the Central Lists of OBCs are State/Union Territory (UT) specific.  To be eligible for SC/OBC status in a State or UT one should be permanent resident of that State/UT on the date of notification of the Presidential Order, or notification of the caste in the Central List of OBCs, as may be applicable in his case.  The list of SCs of GNCT of Delhi was notified on 20.9.1951 whereas the notification of first list of Castes included in the Central List of OBCs in the State of Delhi was issued on 24.5.1995 followed by various other notifications.  In case of persons born after the date of notification of the relevant Presidential order or the relevant notification in the OBC List, the place of residence for the purpose of acquiring the status of SC/OBC is the place of permanent abode of their parents at the time of notification of Presidential Order.  In order to remove the difficulty faced by persons belonging to SCs/OBCs who have migrated from one State/UT to another, in obtaining caste certificate from the State/UT to which they have migrated, it has been clarified to all State Governments and UT Administrations, that the prescribed authority of a State Government/UT Administration may issue  the SC/OBC Certificate to a persons who has migrated from another State/UT, on the production of a genuine certificate issued to his father by the prescribed authority of the State/UT of the father’s origin, except where the prescribed authority feels that detailed enquiry is necessary through the State of origin before issue of the certificate.  The certificate will be issued irrespective of whether the caste in question is scheduled or not (or is included in the OBC List or not) in relation to the State/UT Territory to which the person has migrated.  Under the existing scheme, a SC/OBC inter-state migrant is not entitled for SC/OBC benefits in the State of migration; however, he would be entitled to SC/OBC benefits of the State of origin as well as of Central Government.
