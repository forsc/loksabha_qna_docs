On recommendation of the respective State Governments, a State Government entity has been appointed as Cluster Development Agency (CDA) for each of 12 clusters. The programme is in very early stage of implementation and will take 4-5 years to achieve the envisaged objectives. (b) No cluster from Kerala is included in the 12 clusters selected for Pilot phase, hence question of providing financial assistance does not arise.(c)  There is no such proposal as no request for inclusion of jackfruit in HCDP has been received from any of the stake holders.(d)  The guidelines for CDP was launched on 29th October, 2021 and the programme is in initial stage of implementation.
