The Department is implementing the following two Centrally Sponsored Scholarship Schemes for Scheduled Caste (SC) students in the country, including in the State of Maharashtra:i.	Post matric scholarships to the students belonging to scheduled castes for studies in India (PMS-SC);ii.	Pre- matric scholarships scheme for SC students and othersUnder both the schemes scholarships are provided to SC students having parental income less than Rs.2.5 lakh per annum. PMS-SC scheme provides compulsory non-refundable fees including tuition fee of the course and academic allowance to students studying at the post matric stage i.e. from class 11 onwards. Pre-Matric Scholarship Scheme for SC students and others provides the academic allowance to eligible students studying in classes 9th and 10th. Under the PMS-SC, no central assistance (CA) was released to the State for the years 2018-19 and  2019-20 as their demand for the year was within their committed liability. In the year 2020-21, consequent to the revision in the funding pattern of the scheme from the concept of Committed Liability of the State to a sharing ratio of 60:40  between Centre and the States, Rs.558 cr. was released to the State as CA.

Under the Pre-Matric Scholarship Scheme for SC Students, the State was released Rs. 179.32 cr. during 2013-14 and 2014-15. As per the information provided by the State Government, out of this amount, the State has utilized Rs. 98.59 cr. for disbursing scholarships for the years 2013-14 to 2017-18 and Rs. 23.32 cr. were utilised during the year 2019-20 for 99,200 beneficiaries.
