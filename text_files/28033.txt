ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)& (b): The Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) is being implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India since 2016 in the country to provide assistance to eligible rural households for construction of 2.95 crore Pucca houses with basic amenities to achieve the objective of “Housing for All”.The Scheme aims at providing a pucca house, with basic amenities, to all houseless households and those living in kutcha and dilapidated house. To ensure that assistance is targeted at those who are genuinely deprived and that the selection is objective and verifiable, under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G),the beneficiaries are selected using housing deprivation parameters in the Socio Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011 data which is to be verified by the Gram Sabhas.	As on 06.08.2021, out of the target of 2.63 crore allocated till the financial year 2021-22, 2.0 core houses have been sanctioned and 1.52 crore houses have been completed.  In order to identify those households who though are eligible for assistance under PMAY-G (as per the parameters specified under SECC-2011) but were not included in the list of eligible beneficiaries, another survey Awaas+ was conducted by the Ministry of Rural Development through the States / UTs. Under the Awaas+ surveyan additionallist of 3.57 crore households have been registered. From the list of 3.57 crore registrations on Awaas+, there was a need for filtration of genuinely deprived households for providing the benefit under the Scheme and therefore an Expert Committee was constituted. The recommendations of the Expert Committee have been accepted by the Ministry and targets of 51 lakh (approximately) from final Awaas+ list have been allocated to the eligible States/UTs till financial year 2021-22. ******
