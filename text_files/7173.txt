                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)	  The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component and 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). (b) to (f)	The implementation of river link projects involves various steps such as preparation of Pre Feasibility Reports/ Feasibility Reports of links, negotiation and consensus among concerned States, preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) of the projects, clearances from Ministry of Environment and Forests and Climate Change, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, techno-economic clearance by Advisory Committee on Irrigation, Flood control & multipurpose projects of Ministry of Jal Shakti and investment clearance.The stage of implementation of a project would be reached after its DPR is prepared with the consensus of concerned States and the requisite statutory clearances are obtained.Contd…P/2//2//Under NPP, three inter-linking of rivers (ILR) projects namely, Yamuna- Rajasthan link project, Rajasthan-Sabarmati link project and Parbati–Kalishindh – Chambal link project have been identified benefitting Rajasthan State. The details of these link projects indicating their status along with districts to be benefitted is given at Annexure.Further, Pre-feasibility Reports of two intra-state links namely, Mahi – Luni link and Wakal – Sabarmati – Sei – West Banas – Kameri link was prepared by NWDA and sent to Govt of Rajasthan. The above intra-State links were not found to be feasible due to technical reasons.Water resources projects are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priorities.  In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes such as Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP) etc. under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY).During 2016-17, ninety-nine (99) on-going Major/Medium Irrigation (MMI) projects under PMKSY-AIBP having ultimate irrigation potential of 76.03 lakh hectare and balance estimated cost of Rs.77595 crore (Central Assistance (CA) component of Rs.31342 crore) have been prioritized. Funding mechanism through NABARD has also been approved by the Government for both Central and State share. The funds are released for projects on receipt of eligible proposals from the State Government.Under PMKSY-AIBP, two prioritized projects namely, Narmada canal and Modernization of Ganga canal having combined potential of 3.16 Lakh ha have been identified benefitting Rajasthan State and the AIBP works of both the projects have been reported as completed.***** ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (b) to (f) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. †814 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 21.11.2019 REGARDING “SCHEMES FOR INTER-LINKING OF RIVERS INRAJASTHAN”.Names of Inter Basin Water Transfer Links, name of rivers, status of Feasibility Reports/Detailed Project Report benefitting State of RajasthanSl.
