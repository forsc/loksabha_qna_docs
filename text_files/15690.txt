ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES(SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a) to (d): No, Sir. The Ministry has been providing financial support in the form of Grants-in-Aid to Prasar Bharati to meet the requirement of salary for Government employees on deemed deputation and for implementation of Central Sector Scheme, namely, Broadcasting Infrastructure and Network Development (BIND).	No bailout package is contemplated for Prasar Bharati by Government of India.(e)	The Prasar Bharati (Broadcasting Corporation of India) Act, 1990 confers autonomy on Akashvani and Doordarshan so that they may function in a fair, objective and creative manner.	Prasar Bharati is managing its operational expenses from Internal and Extra Budgetary Resources (IEBR) generated by it from sale of airtime on Radio and TV, sharing of TV/Radio towers and carriage fees from Private Broadcasters for carrying their Channel over DD’s DTH Platform. Increase in competition in the radio and television sector in the recent years and the development of new media platforms have impacted revenue earnings of Prasar Bharati. However, Prasar Bharati is hopeful of mobilizing adequate funds to become self-sufficient in future. *****
