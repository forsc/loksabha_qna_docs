ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI) (a) to (e)         2,178 km has been envisaged for development under Bharatmala Pariyojana Phase-I with cost of Rs. 54,485 crore in the State of Telangana. Works comprising length of 568 km having total cost of Rs. 9,906 crore have been awarded and length of about 336 km has been completed.	Generally, preparation of DPR takes 12-18 months during which various pre-construction activities including land acquisition, clearances for utility as also forest and Environment are completed and based on the preparedness of the project, the work is awarded.  The pre-construction activities i.e. land acquisition, utility shifting as also clearances of Forest department are carried out in consultation with various State Governments and is a time consuming activity, which has been expedited to minimise the delay at the programme level. 	All the projects envisaged under the Bharatmala Pariyojana Phase-I, including in the State of Telangana, are targeted to be completed by 2026-27.*****
