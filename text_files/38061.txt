On receipt of the proposal on these lines from State Government, the feasibility of the project will be determined and appropriate action will be taken.(c) & (c)      The Detailed Project Report (DPR) preparation for the said stretch has been initiated for analysing the viability of the project and finalising the alignment, project cost, features, bidding documents etc. keeping in view the tourism potential of the area.  *****
