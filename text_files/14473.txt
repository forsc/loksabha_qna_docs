ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (f) The National Commission for Integrated Water Resources Development (NCIWRD) in its 1999 Report assessed the percentage of water demand for irrigation for the years 2010 and 2025 at 78 percent and 72 percent respectively of the total water demand in India. As per Agriculture Census, 2015-16 (Phase II), net irrigated area in India stands at 68,233.83 Thousand Hectare (Th. Ha.). State/UT-wise net irrigated area is given at Annexure I.The Government of India launched the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) in 2015-16 with the aim to expand cultivable area under assured irrigation, improve on-farm water use efficiency, introduce sustainable water conservation practices, etc. PMKSY has various components namely, Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP); Command Area Development and Water Management (CADWM); Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP) components of Ground Water Irrigation, Surface-Minor Irrigation (SMI), and Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies implemented by Department of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation; Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) implemented by Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmer’s Welfare; and Watershed Development (WD) implemented by Department of Land Resources.Contd…P/2//2//In 2016-17, ninety-nine (99) on-going Major/Medium Irrigation (MMI) projects (and 7 phases) under AIBP with ultimate irrigation potential of 76 lakh hectares, and balance estimated cost of Rs.77,595 crore, including Central Assistance (CA) component of Rs.31,342 crore, have been prioritized under PMKSY in consultation with the States for completion in phases along with the corresponding CADWM works. Ground Water component of PMKSY-HKKP envisages increasing area of irrigated land through ground water irrigation. As per the proposals received from State Governments, during 2019-20, more than 56,000 hectares is proposed to be brought under additional irrigation through ground water. Under the Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI) scheme, since 12th Plan onwards, 5838 schemes are ongoing with an estimated cost of Rs.13222 crore and target irrigation potential creation of 10.412 Lakh Ha. Central Assistance of Rs. 6531 crore was released to States upto March, 2019 and during current financial year, 2019-20 (till date) CA of Rs.694.71 crore has been released. Under the Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies scheme, since 12th Plan onwards, 2219 schemes are ongoing with an estimated cost of Rs.1910 crore and target irrigation potential of 1.888 Lakh Ha. Central Assistance (CA) of Rs.369 crore was released to States upto March, 2019, and during current financial year, 2019-20 (till date), CA of Rs.64.78 crore has been released.The Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmer’s Welfare implements Per Drop More Crop component of PMKSY. The PMKSY-Per Drop More Crop mainly focuses on water use efficiency at farm level through precision/micro irrigation. Besides promoting precision irrigation (Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation System), better on-farm water management practices to optimize the use of available water resources, this component also supports micro level water storage or water conservation/management activities to supplement Micro Irrigation. The Watershed Management Division implementing by Department of Land Resources has sanctioned 8214 watershed development projects from 2009-10 to 2014-15 covering an area of about 39.07 million hectare under Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP). IWMP was amalgamated as the Watershed Development Component (WDC) of PMKSY in 2015-16. State-wise Central Assistance released under major components of PMKSY, namely, AIBP, CADWM, Per Drop More Crop and Watershed Development are given at Annexure-II, Annexure-III, Annexure-IV, and Annexure-V respectively. ***** ANNEXURE- I Annexure referred to in reply to part (a) to (f) of Unstarred Question No. 3151 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 12.03.2020 regarding “Usage of Water for Irrigation”State-wise Net Irrigated Area as per Agriculture Census, 2015-16S.
