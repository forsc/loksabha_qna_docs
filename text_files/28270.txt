ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) and (b): As per input received from PSBs, there are no such offices where rent payable is not being provided for by PSBs. However, due to various reasons which includes inter alia non-execution of lease deed/rent agreement, death of landlord and dispute among legal heirs or legal ownership details not provided by the family members of landlord, change of ownership of the property, rent is not being directly credited into the account of the landlord but is being provided for by PSBs in their books for payment on completion of required formalities / settlement of dispute.
