ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (d):  No, Sir. Handicrafts and Handlooms Exports Corporation of India (HHEC) has withheld  amount of M/s Edelweiss Commodities Limited (ECL) against which investigation by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is going on. HHEC has also withheld payments of other bullion parties with whom HHEC has identical agreement as signed with ECL. During CBI investigation in the case against ECL, CBI has examined the transaction of buyer’s credit and sought information from HHEC regarding availing of buyer’s credit and passing on difference amount between interest earned on Fixed Deposit (FD) and interest charged by the foreign bank for providing buyer’s credit. This case has not been concluded yet.   HHEC has been informed by CBI on 26.11.2019 that the Agency has registered a case against Vice President, ECL, Mumbai, unknown officials of HHEC, Noida and unknown others. The investigation of the case is still going on. 	HHEC is of the firm view that since the Agreement signed between HHEC and ECL is identical to the agreements signed with other bullion parties and the investigation in the ECL case by CBI is still not concluded, it is not possible at this stage to consider the release of payments to other bullion parties as any adverse outcome in the CBI case against ECL may have implications in other cases.*****
