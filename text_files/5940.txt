As per report of this Committee, the total housing shortage estimated at the beginning of 12th Plan Period i.e. in 2012, was 18.78 million; out of this 10.55 million was in Economically Weaker Section (EWS) Category, 7.41 million was in Lower Income Group (LIG) and the rest of 0.82 million was in the Middle Income Group and above category.  State/Union Territory (UT)-wise details are at Annexure. Further, States/UTs have undertaken demand survey for assessing actual demand of housing under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) [PMAY(U)].  The validated demand reported by States/UTs so far is around 112 Lakh.  (c) & (d):	MoHUA is implementing the PMAY(U) since 25.06.2015 for addressing the housing requirement of the people belonging to EWS, LIG and MIG categories in urban areas.  Total 83,68,861 houses have so far been sanctioned under the Scheme; out of this, 49,54,357 are at various stages of construction and 26,13,799 are completed.  In order to implement the scheme in a time bound manner, the Ministry has taken the following steps:?

A National Urban Housing Fund (NUHF) has been created for providing extra budgetary resources for the PMAY(U). ?	Global Housing Technology Challenge-India (GHTC-India) was held in March-2019 to identify globally best available alternate technologies and six of them are being selected for Light House Projects (LHPs) as live laboratories in six different States.?	Schedule of Rates (SoRs) have been issued for 16 alternate technologies available within the country and nearly 13 lakh houses are being constructed using these technologies.?	Ministry regularly monitors progress of the Mission through periodic review meetings, video-conferences and field visits.                     ******
