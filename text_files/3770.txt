ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (b) : The Committee for the Draft National Education Policy under the Chairmanshipof Dr. K. Kasturirangan has submitted its report to the Ministry on 31st May 2019. As perthe Draft NEP 2019 submitted by the Committee, Paragraph P16.8.2 of Chapter 16 proposesthat ‘The first year or two of the MBBS course will be designed as a common period for allscience graduates after which they can take up MBBS, BDS, Nursing or otherspecialisations. Common foundational courses based on medical pluralism will be followedby core courses focused on specific systems, and electives that encourage bridging acrosssystems. Graduates from other medical disciplines such as nursing, dental etc., will also beallowed lateral entry into the MBBS course. A medical education qualification framework toachieve this will be developed in conjunction with the NMC’.Draft NEP 2019 under its Para 16.8.3 also proposes that ‘Just as the NEET has beenintroduced as a common entrance examination for the MBBS, a common exit examinationfor the MBBS will be introduced (as has been suggested in the National MedicalCommission Bill) that will play a dual role as also the entrance examination for admissioninto postgraduate programmes. This exit examination will be administered at the end of thefourth year of the MBBS so that students are relieved of the burden of studying for aseparate, competitive entrance examinations at the end of their residency period. With theentrance examination out of the way, they can spend their residency period acquiringvaluable skills and competence. Similar common exit examinations can also be conductedfor dental education and other disciplines as needed’.At this stage, the draft NEP 2019 has been uploaded on MHRD’s website and also atinnovate.mygov.in platform to elicit suggestions/comments from all stakeholders includingthe public, Government of India Ministries and State Governments. The Government willfinalize the National Education Policy only after considering the inputs/suggestions andcomments of all stakeholders.**********
