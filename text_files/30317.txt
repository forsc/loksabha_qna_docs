                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (f): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (f) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1650 BY DR. AMOL RAMSING KOLHE, SHRI SUNIL DATTATRAY TATKARE, SHRIMATI SUPRIYA SULE, SHRI KULDEEP RAI SHARMA, DR. DNV SENTHILKUMAR. S. AND DR. SUBHASH RAMRAO BHAMRE TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 08.12.2021 REGARDING SHUT DOWN OF IRSDC(a) to (c): Yes, Sir. A Special Purpose Vehicle, Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Limited (IRSDC), a Joint Venture company of Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) and Ircon International Limited (IRCON) was incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 on 12th April, 2012. The activities performed by both IRSDC and RLDA under station development/redevelopment programme were identical. As such a need was felt that one of the two bodies should be identified as the sole functioning entity and given full responsibilities. Accordingly, it was decided that IRSDC be closed and the works presently assigned to IRSDC be transferred to RLDA being a Statutory Authority under Railway Act, 1989 and Zonal Railways. Indian Railways Organisation for Alternative Fuel (IROAF) has been closed with effect from 07.09.2021 and its work has been redistributed between Northern Railway and Railway Board.(d): Railway Staff working in IROAF have been repatriated to their concerned Railway/Unit. Railway officers working in IRSDC are being adjusted in Zonal Railways and Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA).(e): Carrying out reforms and restructuring as per operational need is an ongoing exercise to keep the organization modern, updated and financially viable. Recently, a report prepared by Principal Economic Advisor, Ministry of Finance, Government of India on ‘Rationalization of Government Bodies under M/o Railways was referred to M/o Railways indicating proposed rationalization. The report has referred to Rationalization of Railway Schools, Railway hospitals, Central/ Zonal Training Institutes, CPSUs under Ministry of Railways, etc. and also winding up/merger of few institutes like closure of CORE, IROAF, COFMOW, IRSDC, etc.(f): Ministry of Railways through various agencies is undertaking techno-economic feasibility studies of Railway stations.  Based on the outcome of these feasibility studies, stations are planned to be taken up for development in phases, especially the stations located in major cities, and important tourist destinations.*****
