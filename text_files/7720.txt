Growth rates of real consumption expenditure in last three years are given below.   Table 1: Growth of total consumption expenditure at constant (2011-12) prices (percent)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	                               2016-17 (2nd RE)     2017-18 (1st RE)     2018-19 (PE)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Total final consumption expenditure	      7.8	          8.6	             8.3-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Note: RE – Revised Estimate, PE – Provisional Estimate     Source: National Statistical Office(c)  National Statistical Office does not compile state wise consumption expenditure data.(d) Government has implemented various measures to boost consumption growth. To boost rural consumption, Government had expanded the cash transfer scheme Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) providing an income support of Rs.6000 per year to all farmers, which was limited to farmers with a land holding of less than 2 hectares.  Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) is focusing more on the distressed districts of the country. Recently, Government has announced a number of measures to give a boost to consumption growth, which inter-alia, include additional credit expansion through infusion of Rs.70,000 crore into public sector banks;  approval of a realty fund worth Rs.25000 crore for stalled housing projects; deduction of additional income tax of Rs.1.5 lakh on the interest paid on loans taken to purchase electric vehicles; and more credit support by strengthening of Non-banking Financial Companies and Housing Finance Companies through partial credit guarantee scheme. Besides, the Reserve Bank of India has cut the repo rate by 135 basis points between February and October 2019 for reducing the lending rates of banks with a view to encourage consumption in the economy. The RBI has further mandated banks to link their lending rates to external benchmark including the repo rate for lowering the lending rates.******
