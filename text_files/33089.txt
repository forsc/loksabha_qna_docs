ANSWER




                                                              MINISTER OF STATE					(SHRI AJAY BHATT)      IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE(a) & (b): Four Army recruitment rallies have been carried out in Recruiting Year 2021-22. However, due to COVID-19 pandemic, all recruitment activities have presently been put on hold by the Indian Army. The COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on recruitment of officers and sailors into the Indian Navy resulting in ‘Batch Holiday’ for recruitment of sailors and delay in commencement of training for officer trainees since mid-2020. There are no pending recruitment examinations conducted by Indian Navy whose result declaration is held up. There are no inductions pending in the officer cadre of the Indian Air Force (IAF). Provisional Select List (PSL) for enrolment of Airmen into IAF intake 02/21 was published on 31st May, 2021. Scheduled Test for Airmen Recruitment (STAR) 01/21 for intake 01/22 has also been completed on 18th July, 2021. (c) & (d): All recruitment rallies planned by Area Recruitment Offices/ Zonal Recruitment Offices of Indian Army have been suspended till further orders due to the prevailing COVID-19 situation in the country, including Rajasthan, till the situation improves.*****
