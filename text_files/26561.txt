ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE AND CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS(SHRI MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a)	& (b):   The details of fertilizers (Urea, DAP, MOP & NPK) which are being imported  into the country through various ports of the country during the last three years is placed at ‘Annexure- A1 & Annexure- A2’.	"Import of Urea on Government account is being made only through designated State Trading Enterprises (STEs) i.e. Mineral & Metals Trading Corporation (MMTC), State Trading Corporation (STC) and Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizers (RCF)" under the Foreign Trade Policy of the Government. Government was also importing approximately 20 Lakh Metric Tonnes urea from Oman India Fertiliser Company (OMIFCO) under a Long Term Urea Off Take Agreement (UOTA) between GOI & OMIFCO. The term of UOTA has expired on 13.07.2020. <Figures in LMT>STE Name	2018-19	      2019-20	        2020-21IPL	       11.21 	- 	 -MMTC	       44.09 	      56.02 	         44.95 OMIFCO	       19.51 	      19.07 	          7.61 RCF	         -   	      16.14 	         45.72 STC	         -   	- 	- Grand Total:   74.81 	     91.23 	        98.28 DGFT vide Notification No.41/2015-2020 dated 05.10.2018, delisted IPL as a State Trading Enterprises for import of Urea. Thereafter, DGFT vide Notification No.23/2015-2020 dated 11.10.2019, designated M/s Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizers (RCF) as STE for import of Urea on Government account.Import of fertilizers (other than Urea) is free, commonly known as Open General Licence (OGL). Various companies import these fertilizers as per their commercial judgment. (c):	DoF is responsible for ensuring adequate and timely supply of fertilisers throughout the country as per the demand projected by Department of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare (DA&FW).  Therefore, in order to bridge the gap between the assessed requirements of urea for an agricultural season as determined by DA&FW and the indigenous production of Urea, the Department of fertilizers imports urea on government account. The imports of P&K fertilizers come under Open General License (OGL) and companies are free to imports it as per the commercial judgments and decide the discharge ports. In respect of urea imports, the following factors are taken into consideration for finalization of ports and quantities:- i.	Port wise allocation scenario, which is based on the zonal distribution of requirement, port linkages and objective criteria for port allocation.ii.	Seasonal requirement of various states and zones & ports catering to these states.iii.	Geographical location of the ports and their catchment area (in terms of state-wise linkages).iv.	Objective criteria of port efficiency in terms of discharge rate, evacuation, lump sum rates etc.v.	Operational/emergent issues at various ports.(d):	Department of Fertilizers has been entrusted  with the responsibility to ensure movement and distribution of subsidized chemical fertilizers, from various fertilizer plants and ports in accordance with the State-wise & month-wise requirement assessed by the Department of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare (DA&FW). On the basis of month-wise & state-wise projection given by DA&FW, Department of Fertilizers allocates sufficient/ adequate quantities of fertilizers to States by issuing monthly supply plan and continuously monitors the availability through the following system:(i)	The movement of all major subsidized fertilizers is being monitored throughout the country by an on-line web based monitoring system called integrated Fertilizer Monitoring System (iFMS);(ii)	The State Governments are regularly advised to coordinate with manufacturers and importers of fertilizers for streamlining the supplies through timely placement of indents for railway rakes through their state institutional agencies like Markfed etc.(iii)	Regular Weekly Video Conference is conducted jointly by Department of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare (DA&FW), Department of Fertilizers (DoF), and Ministry of Railways with State Agriculture Officials and corrective actions are taken to dispatch fertilizer as indicated by the State Governments.(iv)	In case of urea, to bridge the gap between assessed requirement and indigenous production, the Steering Committee of Secretaries (SCOS) gives authorization to DoF for urea imports. In case of P&K fertilizers, the imports come under Open General License (OGL) where companies are free to import based on commercial judgments.Every month DoF prepares agreed supply plan in consultation with manufacturers and importers to meet the demand of fertilizers projected by DA&FW and this plan is issued before the start of each month. The supply plan is prepared keeping in view the factors like local demand, minimum lead distances, port linkage guidelines, market network of respective companies etc. The rationale & planning behind the supply plan is to meet the field demand adequately, timely and at the same time through efficient logistic management.********
