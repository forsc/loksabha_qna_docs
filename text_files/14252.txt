ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.Statement in reply to parts (a) to (d) of the Starred (*) Question No. 263 for answer on 12.03.2020 regarding ''Passenger Amenities at Airports'';; ; (a): To improve the passenger facilities at airports across the country, various measures have been taken by the Government during the last three years which include:; ; 1. Airlines have been allowed web check-in.; 2. Number of security check-in gates at airports have been increased to almost double.; 3. Common Use Self Service (CUSS) Kiosk have been installed at major airports for self check-in.; 4. Wheel chairs from entry gate to boarding gate and battery operated Golf Cart Vehicles have been made available at airports for the facilitation of senior citizens and persons with reduced mobility.  The above measures have considerably reduced the boarding time for passengers resulting into smooth and hassle-free travel. Apart from this, various other facilities such as free wi-fi, food & beverages stalls, free drinking water, executive lounge, smoking lounge, washrooms, wellness centre etc. have been provided at airports for better passenger facilitation and enhancement of airport experience.; ; (b): On time arrival and departure of flights depends upon many factors and runway occupancy time by the aircraft is one of the main factors. During the last three years, most of the busy airports have constructed parallel taxi ways and rapid-exit taxi ways to reduce landing/take-off time. Further, Airports have been provided with Instrument Landing System (ILS) CATEGORY (CAT)-I/II/III- B, Advance Surface Movement Guidance and Control System and Runway Visual Range (RVR) Instruments to deal with the low visibility and foggy conditions. Restructuring of airspace and redesigning of air-routes have further reduced time taken by the flights.  Boarding gates at airports have also been increased to improve the timely arrival and departure of flights. ; (c) & (d): Airports Authority of India has constructed a modern, state-of-the art Air Traffic Flow Management Central Command Center at Delhi which has become operational from 22.06.2019. The Central Command Center functions as the nodal point for nationwide Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) monitoring and managing air traffic demand congestion at major airports and airspace across the country. ATFM improves predictability of flight operations and thereby helps airlines to operate flights on time as far as practicable. Apart from this, airlines take various measures to improve the arrival and departure from airport on time which is monitored by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).
