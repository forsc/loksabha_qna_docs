ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a): 	Yes. Suggestions have been invited form Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) beneficiaries and other stakeholders with reference to revamping CGHS including availing the services at CGHS empanelled hospitals and Diagnostic Centres. The last date for submission of comments/ suggestions is 30.11.2019. (b):	Yes. The Government is committed to provide quality healthcare facilities under CGHS. In the recent past, referral system has been simplified for CGHS beneficiaries aged 75 years and above to seek direct OPD consultations from Specialist of private hospitals empanelled under CGHS without referral from CGHS Wellness Centre. Also, CGHS pensioners beneficiaries (primary card holders) aged 75 years and above have been allowed to undergo annual health check-up at CGHS empanelled hospitals.  Revamping of CGHS is also a step in this direction.(c): 	Instances regarding denial of admission have come to the notice of the Government. Clarificatory instructions have been issued on 18.07.2018 to all empanelled hospitals under CGHS that once a specific listed treatment procedure / investigation has been advised by Government Specialist/ CGHS Medical Officer, no other permission letter is required and the hospitals and diagnostic centres shall not insist on permission letter. Further instructions have been issued on 13.09.2019 to all CGHS empanelled hospitals to the effect that these hospitals will not refuse admission or demand an advance payment from the CGHS beneficiary or his family member and will provide credit facilities to the patient under emergency conditions. In accordance with the Memorandum of Agreement between the CGHS empanelled hospital and the Government of India, refusal to provide treatment to bonafide CGHS beneficiaries on credit basis, without valid ground, would attract disqualification for continuation of empanelment.
