ANSWER




                                                        THE FINANCE MINISTER (a) to (d):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. ***** Statement as referred to in reply to parts (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. *119 (19th Position) for 25th November, 2019 by DR. SUJAY RADHAKRISHNA VIKHE PATIL, M.P. and DR. SHRIKANT EKNATH SHINDE M.P., regarding “Opening of Bank Branches”: (a) to (d): Total number of branches of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) as on 30.6.2019 is  87,526 out of which 28,815 (33%) are in rural areas. During 2016-17: 2168 branches, 2017-18: 834 branches, 2018-19: 438 branches and 2019-20 (till June 30): 86 branches have been opened by PSBs. Total number of branches of Private Sector Banks (PSBs) as on 30.6.2019 is  32,083 out of which 6846 (21%) are in rural areas. During 2016-17: 2216 branches, 2017-18: 1618 branches, 2018-19:1684 branches and 2019-20 (till June 30): 209 branches have been opened by Private Sector Banks.In addition to the bank-branches, as on 30.6.2019, while Public Sector Banks have 1.34 lakh ATMs out of which 27,098 (20%) are in rural areas, Private Sector Banks have  69,019 ATMs, out of which 5759 (8%) are in rural areas. In addition to the branches and ATMs, as per extant guidelines issued by RBI, banking outlets manned by the banks’ Business Correspondents (BCs) also provide banking services. The major activities performed by BCs are opening of bank accounts, cash deposit and withdrawal, remittance, etc. As per information received from RBI, in March 2018, there are 5.15 lakh BCs providing banking services in villages out of which 3.58 lakh (69%) have been deployed by Public Sector Banks.  Based on the information provided by RBI, district-wise number of branches of the Public Sector Banks and Private Sector Banks opened during the last three years in Maharashtra is Annexed to this reply. 	As per extant guidelines dated 18.5.2017 on rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has granted  general  permission  to domestic  Scheduled  Commercial  Banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks) to  open banking outlets  at  any place  in the country, without  seeking  prior  approval of  RBI  in  each  case, subject  to at least  25 percent  of the total  number  of  banking outlets  opened  during a  financial  year being in  unbanked  rural centres i.e. centres having population less than 10,000 (Tier 5 and Tier 6 centres). In pursuance of RBI guidelines, rolling out of banking outlets in uncovered areas is a continuous process and looked after by State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), in consultation with the concerned State Government, member banks and other stakeholders. Banks, inter-alia, consider proposals for opening banking outlets in the light of RBI’s instructions, their business plans and their commercial viability. To further assess the viability for opening a banking outlet, banks carry out survey as required.As apprised by respective SLBCs of Maharashtra and Kerala, all Gram Panchayats are covered by banking outlets. *****
