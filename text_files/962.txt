ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS [SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (c)	The Government is committed to resolving all outstanding issues with Pakistan through a bilateral dialogue in accordance with Simla Agreement (1972) and Lahore declaration (1999). However a meaningful dialogue is possible only in an atmosphere free from terror, violence and hostility. The Government has made it clear that the onus is on Pakistan for creating such an environment.(d) to (f) 	As for other neighbouring countries, there is no outstanding boundary dispute with Afghanistan, Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka.During  the  visit  of  our  Prime Minister  to  Bangladesh  in  June 2015, the Land Boundary Agreement between India and Bangladesh of 1974 and its Protocol of 2011 were ratified. The implementation of the Agreement and Protocol has settled all outstanding land boundary issues between India and Bangladesh. The award rendered by Arbitration Tribunal for Delimitation of    Maritime Boundary between India and Bangladesh on 7 July 2014 has settled maritime boundary between India and Bangladesh.With China, both countries have each appointed a Special Representative (SR) to explore the framework for a boundary settlement from the political perspective of the overall bilateral relationship. There have been twenty one meetings of SRs, with the last meeting being held in Chengdu on 24 November 2018. The two sides have agreed to seek a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solution to the boundary question through dialogue and peaceful negotiations. With Nepal, strip maps covering 98 percent of the India-Nepal boundary have been jointly finalized and initialled by the two sides. There are, however, differences of perception on alignment of the boundary in some areas such as Kalapani in Uttarakhand and Narsahi-Susta in Bihar. The two sides have set up a high-level bilateral mechanism to discuss the matter, with technical inputs from the India-Nepal Boundary Working Group.There is no border dispute between India and Myanmar. However, certain sectors of India-Myanmar boundary remain to be demarcated. Regular dialogue is held between India and Myanmar on issues related with boundary demarcation and border management, through institutionalized mechanisms such as Joint Boundary Working Group, Foreign Office Consultations, National Level Meetings, Sectoral Level Meetings and Heads of Survey Department meeting. ***
