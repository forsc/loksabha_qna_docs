ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a):       Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme is a demand driven scheme. There are enough funds with the scheme to fulfill all the liabilities of the scheme for the States which have met the entire requirement for release of second tranche of funds.The first installment of the first tranche is released in the first half of April after adjusting unspent balance available with the States and considering the pending liabilities, if any. If the proposal for 2nd Tranche is submitted on and after 1st October, then the Audit Report and Audited Utilization Certificate of the previous financial year are required. The funds can only be released after receipt of Audited Utilization Certificate and Audit report of previous financial year submitted by the State. Some of the States are yet to submit Audit reports and other required document for funds release resulting in delay in release of fund. State/UT-wise details of pending liabilities for wage component under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS as on 01.12.2021 are given at Annexure-I. State/UT wise details of pending liabilities for material component under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS as on 01.12.2021 is given at Annexure-II. (b):       As per section 6(1) of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (Mahatma Gandhi NREGA), the Central Government may, by notification, specify the wage rate for unskilled work for its beneficiaries. Accordingly, the Ministry of Rural Development notifies wage rate for unskilled workers under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA every financial year. To compensate the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) workers against inflation, the Ministry of Rural Development revises the wage rates every financial year based on Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labourer (CPI-AL). The wage rate is made applicable from 1st April of each financial year.  (c):       No, Sir. (d) to (f): No proposal has been received from the State of Maharashtra in this regard. Presently wage rate for unskilled workers under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS applicable for the State of Maharashtra  is Rs.248/- per persondays. ******
