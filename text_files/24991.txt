ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) and (b)Shoreline change including erosion and sea level rise are slow phenomena and manifesting globally. The reason for coastal erosion processes and their pace, and turbulent seas cannot be attributablesolely to global warming, but are also affected by multiple other factors.Studies of National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC)indicate various patterns namely, advancement of the sea landwards (erosion), advancement of the land towards sea (accretion) and stable shoreline.Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) alsohascarried out shoreline change mapping on 1:25,000 scale for the entire Indian coast using high tide line demarcated from satellite images of 2004-06 and 2014-16 timeframes. The results show that around 8 percent of the shoreline of Lakshadweep Islands is under erosion, 9 percent is accreting and the remaining 83 percent of the shoreline shows no change with respect to 2004-06 timeframe. As per Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), on an average, the sea level along the Indian coast is considered to be rising at about 1.7 mm/year. Further, as per the climate model projection studies supported bythe Department of Science and Technology, the sea-level rise in Lakshadweep archipelagomay range between 0.4 mm per year to 0.9 mm per year by the end of century.(c)The MoEFCC issued an Island Coastal Regulation Zone (ICRZ) Notification on 8thMarch 2019 which has laid due emphasis on management and conservation of unique island marine and coastal ecosystems, development in coastal areas, eco-tourism, livelihood options and sustainable development of the island communities etc. Government is implementing National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which provides an overarching policy framework for climate actions in the country with eight Missions: (i) National Solar Mission (ii) National Mission on Enhanced Energy Efficiency (iii) National Water Mission (iv) National Mission on Sustainable Habitat (v) National Mission on Sustaining Himalayan Ecosystem (vi) National Green India Mission (vii) National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture and (viii) National Mission on Strategic Knowledge on Climate Change. To support the objectives of NAPCC, 33 States and Union Territories have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) to address State specific actions. The Union Territory (UT) of Lakshadweep has also prepared Lakshadweep Action Plan on Climate Change (LAPCC) which covers the actions and initiatives by the Administration for coastal protection in the UT. In addition, the Government has also establishedthe National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC) to support climate adaptation actions of States and Union Territories in the country.  *****
