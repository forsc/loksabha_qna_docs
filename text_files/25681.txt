ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW) (a) to (f) To prevent the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, Indian Railways discontinued all regular passengers carrying train w.e.f. 23rd March, 2020. Presently, only special trains, keeping in view the concerns and suggestions of State Governments and health advisories are being operated.Prior to discontinuation of regular passenger train services, 12065/66 Delhi Sarai Rohilla-Ajmer Jan Shatabdi Express had been operating via Shri Madhopur and Ringas. The train did not have commercial stoppage at Shri Madhopur. Presently, Delhi-Ajmer sector is being served by 02065/66 Delhi Sarai Rohilla-Ajmer Special Jan Shatabdi Express (via Ringas). The train is not having scheduled commercial stoppage at Shri Madhopur.Provision of stoppage of 12065/66 Delhi Sarai Rohilla-Ajmer Jan Shatabdi Express at Shri Madhopur had been examined earlier but neither found operationally feasible nor commercially justified. In the prevailing situation also, stoppage of    02065/66 Delhi Sarai Rohilla-Ajmer Special Jan Shatabdi Express at Shri Madhopur is not feasible. However, provision of stoppages is an ongoing process on Indian Railways.*****
