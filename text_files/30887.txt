ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)	The Government of India is implementing the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), which comprises of eight missions in specific areas of solar energy, energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan ecosystem, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. One of the eight Missions, viz., the National Mission for a Green India (GIM) aims at protecting, restoring and enhancing India’s forest cover and responding to Climate Change. The objectives of the Mission are to increase forest/tree cover and improve quality of forest cover, improve ecosystem services including biodiversity and hydrological services, increase forest-based livelihood income of households living in and around the forests, and enhance annual CO2 sequestration.In addition, the Ministry has launched the third “National Wildlife Action Plan (2017-2031)” in the year 2017 which is the future road map for wildlife conservation in India. The Plan is unique as this is the first time that India has recognized the concerns relating to climate change impact on wildlife and stressed on integrating actions that need to be taken for its mitigation and adaptation into wildlife management planning processes. (b)  	The important steps taken by Government to promote wildlife friendly renewable energy include the following:i.	The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy had requested the power transmission line agencies and wind energy farm developers to identify critical power transmission lines and wind energy firms passing through the Great Indian Bustard (GIB) habitats in Rajasthan and Gujarat in consultation with the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and concerned States Governments and accordingly, take up risk mitigation measures against bird hits like putting up bird diverters on the conductors, painting of vane tips of the wind turbines, etc.ii.	The Central Electricity Authority has issued directives to avoid laying of transmission lines through Protected Areas and wildlife corridors and has developed technical specifications for bird diverters and has requested the power agencies to install  good quality diverters on transmission lines to reduce bird mortality.iii.	 A Task Force has been constituted by the Ministry for suggesting Eco-friendly measures to mitigate impacts of power transmission lines and other power transmission infrastructures on wildlife including the migratory birds. The recommendations of the Task Force were accepted by the Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife and the same were circulated to all States/ Union Territory Administrations.   (c)	The important steps taken by Government to promote awareness on migratory species in the country include the following:i.	The Government of India successfully hosted the 13th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, during 17th-22nd February, 2020 at Gandhinagar, Gujarat representatives from many countries besides Heads of several biodiversity related Inter-Governmental Organizations. The “Gandhinagar Declaration” was adopted during the COP which envisages “Connectivity” amongst landscapes, habitats, amongst the various conventions and also between the people and ecosystems for ensuring better conservation of migratory species across the globe.ii.	The Ministry has launched the ‘National Action Plan for conservation of Migratory birds along the Central Asian Flyway (CAF)’ in November 2018. The Action Plan emphasizes on coordination and cooperation between various Central Government Ministries, State Government Departments, managers of Protected Areas, local communities, Civil Societies and Private sector. iii.	Awareness generation camps are being organized by the State/ UT Administrations on the importance of conservation of migratory species and their habitats. iv.	Financial assistance is provided to the State/Union Territory Governments under the Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats for providing better protection to wildlife and improvement of habitat which includes funding for awareness generation programmes.*****
