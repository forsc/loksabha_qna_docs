ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a) to (c): Government has liberalized FDI policy by allowing 100% FDI through automatic route for sale of coal, for coal mining activities and associated processing infrastructure on 18.09.2019. However, Government does not fix targets for FDI inflows. Government of India has put in place a liberal and investor friendly FDI policy. FDI inflows depend on a host of factors such as availability of natural resource, market size, infrastructure, political and general investment climate as well as macro-economic stability and investment decision of foreign investors. In coal mining sector, no case relating to foreign investment is pending with the Government. The financial year wise details of FDI equity inflows reported in the coal mining sector during the last five years are as under: Sl. No.	Year	FDI (in US$ million)1	2014-15	0.872	2015-16	1.723	2016-17	29.564	2017-18	2.055	2018-19	1.276	2019-20 (Apr-Jun)	1.78 *****
