                                                        MINISTER OF MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES(SHRI NITIN GADKARI)(a) to (d):	The Reserve Bank of India has issued guidelines on ‘Framework for Revival and Rehabilitation of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises’ to Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks) in March 2016. With the issuance of these Guidelines, the concept of sickness no longer exists.  Under this Framework, banks have been advised to identify incipient stress in the MSME accounts and refer it to the Committees formed under the framework for Corrective Action Plan for rectification, restructuring and recovery.  The latest available data furnished by the Reserve Bank of India, regarding revival and rehabilitation of MSMEs for the half year ended March, 2017 to half year ended March, 2020 is given in Annexure I. Moreover, with a view to facilitate meaningful restructuring of stressed MSME accounts, RBI has permitted a one-time restructuring of loans to MSMEs subject to certain conditions. The restructuring of the MSME borrower account under the revised guidelines is to be implemented by March 31, 2021 and such borrower accounts which may have slipped into NPA category between March 2, 2020 and date of implementation may be upgraded as ‘standard asset’, as on the date of implementation of the restructuring plan.
