ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) & (b) : Education is in the Concurrent List of the Constitution. The recruitment, service conditions and redeployment of teachers are primarily in the domain of the respective State Government and UT Administration. The recruitment of teachers is a continuous process, and the vacancies keep arising due to retirement and additional requirements on account of enhanced students’ strength. However, Department of School & Education Literacy,  Ministry of Education requests the States and UT Governments for filling-up the vacant posts of teachers and their rational deployment, through Review meetings and advisories from time to time. Further, the Central Government through the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Samagra Shiksha, provides assistance to the States and UTs for deployment of additional teachers to maintain appropriate Pupil-Teacher Ratio (PTR) as per the prescribed norms for various levels of schooling.	As informed by the State Government of Madhya Pradesh, 1,01,963 posts of teachers are vacant in Madhya Pradesh state. Further, to ensure the adequate PTR in schools, Guest teachers are engaged by the State Government.  *****
