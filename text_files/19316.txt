                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):   Yes, at the start of COVID-19 vaccination drive, fewer than planned beneficiaries attended vaccination sessions due to transient technical issues in Co-WIN portal, vaccine hesitancy etc.(b):   A total of 7,580 adverse events following immunization (AEFI) have been reported till 31st January 2021 under COVID-19 vaccination roll-out. 12 deaths of vaccinated persons have also been reported. None of the deaths have been causally attributed to COVID-19 vaccination as per the current evidence.(c):  As per the Factsheet of the COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by Bharat Biotech International Limited, one should not get the COVID-19 vaccine (COVAXIN) if the person a) has any allergies b) has fever c) has bleeding disorder or are on blood thinner d) immune-compromised individuals or on medicines that affect immune system e) pregnant f) breastfeeding g) received another COVID-19 vaccine h) any other serious health related issues, as determined by the Vaccinator/Officer supervising vaccination.As per the factsheet of M/s Serum Institute of India, one should not get the COVID-19 Vaccine (COVISHIELD) if a) the person had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of this vaccine and b) had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of this vaccine. Further, the healthcare provider needs to be consulted about medical conditions, including a) severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) after any drug, food, any vaccine or any ingredients of COVISHIELD™ vaccine b) fever c) bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner d) immunocompromised or are on a medicine that affects your immune system e) pregnant or plan to become pregnant f) breastfeeding g) received another COVID-19 vaccine.(d):   Only those COVID-19 vaccines that have been granted permission for restricted use in emergency situation by the Drug Controller General of India [DCG(I)] have been used for COVID-19 vaccination drive in the country.As per New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019 under Drugs and Cosmetics Act,1940 and in light of urgent need due to COVID pandemic in the country, CDSCO has granted permission to manufacture two COVID-19 vaccines based on the prescribed procedure and due evaluation of pre-clinical and clinical trial data.(e):   The experience from other countries with COVID-19 pandemic show that many countries experienced 2nd or 3rd peak of COVID-19 cases in the later part of pandemic. Therefore, a declining trend of cases in the country does not necessarily promise a continued and steady decrease in cases, hence, it is necessary to provide prompt protection to the vulnerable and at risk population and maintain low case count through COVID-19 vaccination.
