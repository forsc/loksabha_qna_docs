                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)  (a)	The prevalence of malnutrition among children in Chhattisgarh as per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), 2015-16 and Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS), 2016-18 conducted by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare is at Annexure I. The data reported for the first phase of NFHS -5 (2019-20) covers only 22 States/UTs and the State of Chhattisgarh is not covered under this phase.(b)	& (c) Government of India implements the Anganwadi Services Scheme, POSHAN Abhiyaan and Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana under the Umbrella Integrated Child Development Services Scheme (ICDS) as targeted interventions to improve nutritional status of Children, Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers throughout the country.The details of fund allocated for  Anganwadi Services Scheme, Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana and POSHAN Abhiyaan for last three years State/UT wise is at Annexure II, III and IV respectively. (d) & (e) For the year 2020-21, the Budget allocation for the Schemes comprising Anganwadi Services, POSHAN Abhiyaan and Scheme for Adolescent Girls was ?24,482 crore and the Revised Budget allocation was ?17902.31 crore. ln 2021-22, after rationalization, these three schemes have been clubbed and named as ''Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0'' having budgetary provision of ?20,105 crore which is 12.3% more than the Revised Budget allocation of ?17902.31 crore. Further, the expenditure of funds in respect of above three schemes was ?16233.35 crore which clearly indicates that adequate funds were available to meet the demands of the States/UTs. In order to ensure proper and effective utilisation of funds under Mission Poshan 2.0, a robust ICT enabled platform named Poshan Tracker has been designed to capture real time data on implementation and monitoring of Anganwadi Services across the country. Additional funds, if required, would be sought at R.E stage for the year 2021-22 from the Ministry of Finance. (f)	For alleviation of malnutrition, Government has announced Mission Poshan 2.0 to strengthen nutritional content, delivery, outreach and outcomes with focus on developing practices that nurture health, wellness and immunity to disease and malnutrition. Steps have been taken to improve nutritional quality and testing in accredited labs, strengthen delivery and leverage technology under the ''Poshan Tracker'', a robust ICT enabled platform to improve governance with regard to real time monitoring of provisioning of supplementary nutrition for prompt supervisions and management of services. Government has advised States/UTs to ensure that the quality of supplementary nutrition conforms to prescribed standards laid down under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and regulations made there under. States/UTs have been advised to promote use of AYUSH systems for prevention of malnutrition and related diseases. A programme to support development of Poshan Vatikas at Anganwadi centers to meet dietary diversity gap leveraging traditional knowledge in nutritional practices has also been taken up.*****Annexure I Statement referred to in reply to Part (a) of Lok Sabha Un-Starred Question No.3016 for 06.08.2021 by SHRI ARUN SAO, SHRI VIJAY BAGHEL AND SHRI SUNIL KUMAR SONI regarding Malnutrition Among Women and Children Indicator	NFHS-4(2015-16)	NFHS-5(2019-20)	CNNS(2016-18)Stunting in Children under 5 years (%)	37.6	-	35.4Wasting in Children under 5 years (%)	23.1	-	19.3Underweight in Children under 5 years (%)	37.7	-	40Annexure- IIStatement referred to in reply to Part (b) & (c) of Lok Sabha Un-Starred Question No.3016 for 06.08.2021 by SHRI ARUN SAO, SHRI VIJAY BAGHEL AND SHRI SUNIL KUMAR SONI regarding Malnutrition Among Women and Children Fund released to State/UT wise in Supplementary Nutrition component of the Anganwadi Services Scheme during last 4 years Sl.
