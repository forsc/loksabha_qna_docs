Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change have informed that they have not issued any guidelines for eco-tourism in forest and wildlife areas recently.  Ministry of Tourism has recognized the immense potential of sustainable tourism in becoming a source of sustainable livelihoods and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.  Ministry of Tourism has accordingly formulated a Draft National Strategy and Roadmap for Sustainable Tourism with focus on eco-tourism.  In order to make the document more comprehensive, Ministry of Tourism has invited  feedback/ comments/ suggestions on the draft National Strategy and Roadmap from concerned Central Ministries, all the State Governments/ UT Administrations and industry stakeholders.  Ministry of Tourism, under its Swadesh Darshan scheme, is developing theme based tourism circuits in the country.  Eco Circuit and Wildlife Circuit are among the fifteen thematic circuits identified for development under the scheme. The objective of the Swadesh Darshan scheme include creating employment through active involvement of local communities and promoting community-based development and pro-poor tourism approach.  Submission of project proposals by the State Governments/Union Territory (UT) Administrations under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme is a continuous process. The projects for development under the scheme are identified in consultation with the State Governments/UT Administrations and are sanctioned subject to availability of funds, submission of suitable detailed project reports, adherence to scheme guidelines and utilization of funds released earlier. The details of the projects sanctioned by Ministry of Tourism under the Eco Circuit and Wildlife Circuit themes of Swadesh Darshan Scheme are given at Annexure.*******
