                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)  Under Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), secondary and tertiary hospitalization care is provided to entitled beneficiaries through pre-defined Health benefit packages (HBPs). To effectively cover AB-PMJAY beneficiaries for testing and treatment of COVID-19, packages for ‘Testing for COVID-19’ and ‘Treatment of COVID-19’ have been notified.    However, States/UTs have been given flexibility to modify the national HBPs related to COVID-19 based on the guidelines issued by National Health Authority.  (b) & (c) No such complaints have been received under AB-PMJAY. Hospitalization benefits under AB-PMJAY are provided to the entitled beneficiaries in a cashless manner. Further, claims are processed and paid based on specified package rates. A package consists of all the costs associated with the treatment, including pre and post hospitalisation expenses. 	A Central Grievance Redressal Management System (CGRMS) has been developed under     AB-PMJAY for addressing any issue related to denial of treatment or overcharging. A beneficiary can lodge grievance on the portal, through national call centre 14555 or through mail, letter, fax etc. which is acknowledged, recorded, escalated & resolved as per a well-defined process. Complaints regarding denial of treatment by an empaneled hospital received through any medium are immediately assigned to respective State Health Agency for action.(d) 294 complaints related to denial of treatment for various ailments have been received from 1st April 2020 to 10th September 2020 at the CGRMS of AB-PMJAY and Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS). Out of these, 208 grievances have been resolved and others are in process of resolution. The State/UT -wise numbers of complaints related to denial of benefits under the scheme are provided at Annexure.  	During the same period more than 27.2 Lakh beneficiaries have taken treatment under the scheme.(e) A dedicated fraud and abuse control unit has been set up at the National level which continuously tracks utilization data, generation of e-cards and instances of fraud/abuse through monitoring tools on real time basis across India.  However, during the said period, no instances of corruption related to COVID-19 hospitalization have been reported. (f) Government has set up National Health Authority to ensure the effective monitoring and implementation of the AB-PMJAY in collaboration with the State Health Agencies (SHA) set up by the implementing States/UTs. Additionally, District Implementation Units have been setup in the districts to direct the implementation at district. The progress of AB-PMJAY is continuously assessed and monitored on a real time basis. The performance of the scheme is objectively evaluated in terms of e-cards issued, number of hospital admissions, quality of treatment provided, timely settlement of claims etc. Additionally, review meetings are conducted with the stakeholders, including State Health Agencies, on a periodic basis. Necessary interventions based on the feedback regarding the scheme implementation are being made. Other steps taken to ensure the effective implementation of the scheme are at the Annexure II.
