MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT (SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a)	& (b): Yes Sir. The Government promotes Sanskrit language through various schemes implemented through Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan (RSKS) an autonomous organization under this Ministry. A list of schemes implemented for promotion of Sanskrit language through RSKS is annexed as Annexure-I. Also, a Committee formed by Government under the Chairmanship of Shri N. Gopalaswami had suggested a ‘long term vision and road map for the development of Sanskrit language for the next ten years’ wherein a wide range of activities are recommended to be implemented from high school to Research level for promotion of Sanskrit. This has been sent to the respective stakeholders for implementation. Further, Sanskrit is being taught as a Modern Indian Language from Class VI onwards and accordingly, NCERT has developed textbooks in Sanskrit from Class VI to XII. (c ) & (d): Presently there is no such proposal under consideration.*****
