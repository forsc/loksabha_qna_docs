The list of potential export products were shared with the Indian Mission abroad for identification of potential buyers in the respective countries. In order to make the textile sector competitive by rebating all taxes/levies in international market, the Government has decided to continue the RoSCTL (Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies) scheme until such time the RoSCTL scheme is merged with Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) scheme. For this purpose, the Government has approved adhoc allocation of funds of Rs. 7398 crore for FY 2020-21 for issuance of duty credit scrips under RoSCTL scheme.

Its easy availability and competitive pricing is desirable to unlock the immense potential in textile sector which is a significant employment generator.          In order to promote and develop various sectors/ segments of the textiles and clothing industry, the  Government has been implementing  various policy initiatives and schemes which inter alia support/ improve the lives and livelihoods of textile weavers through employment generation and promotes production and export competitiveness of the textile industry such as Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (A-TUFS), Schemes for the development of the Powerloom Sector(Power-Tex), Schemes for Technical Textiles, Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP), Scheme for Additional Grant for Apparel Manufacturing Units under SITP (SAGAM),  Jute (ICARE- Improved Cultivation and Advanced Retting Exercise), Integrated Processing Development Scheme (IPDS), National Handloom Development Progarmme, Comprehensive Handloom Cluster Development Scheme (CHCDS), Silk Samagra, Integrated Wool Development Programme (IWDP), North East Region Textiles Promotion Scheme (NERTPS), Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (ROSCTL) etc. Budgetary allocation of funds is not made State-wise.
