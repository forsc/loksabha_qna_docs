To promote the use of drone technology in the country the Ministry of Civil Aviation notified the liberalized Drone Rules, 2021.  The DA&FW released the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for use of drones in agriculture for pesticide and nutrient application, which provide concise instructions for effective and safe operations of agricultural drones. In the Union Budget 2022-23, the Government has also announced that the use of Kisan Drones will be promoted for crop assessment, digitization of land records, spraying of insecticides and nutrients. To promote use of drones in agriculture and make drone technology affordable to the farmers and other stakeholders of this sector, financial assistance @ 100 % cost of drone together with the contingent expenditure is extended under Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) to the Farm Machinery Training & Testing Institutes, Institutions of Indian Council of Agricultural Research, Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) and State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) for its demonstration on the farmer’s fields. Farmers Producers Organizations (FPOs) are provided grants @ 75% for purchase of drones for its demonstration on the farmers’ fields.  In order to provide agricultural services through drone application, financial assistance @ 40% of the basic cost of drone and its attachments or Rs.4 lakhs, whichever less is also provided for drone purchase by existing and new Custom Hiring Centers (CHCs) under Cooperative Society of Farmers, Farmers Producer Organizations (FPOs)?and Rural entrepreneurs. The agriculture graduates establishing CHCs are eligible to receive financial assistance @ 50% of the cost of drone up to a maximum Rs.5.00 lakhs.The Government of India supports and facilitates the State Governments through various Centrally Sponsored and Central Sector Schemes to promote agriculture throughout the country and infusing new technologies into the agriculture sector including agricultural drones. National e-Governance Plan in Agriculture (NeGP-A) is being implemented and funds are released for sanctioning projects involving use of modern Information Technologies such as Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, Block Chain Technology, Internet of Things, Robotics etc., and for customization / shifting of web & mobile applications already developed by the States, to the platform to be developed using digital/emerging technologies.

To provide impetus to start ups for agriculture, a component called “Innovation and Agri-Entrepreneurship Development” has been launched under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY-RAFTAAR) in 2018-19 with the objective of promoting innovation and agri-entrepreneurship by providing financial support and nurturing the incubation ecosystem. Under this programme, start-ups including for drones are encouraged to use innovative technologies to resolve challenges faced in agriculture and allied sectors.
