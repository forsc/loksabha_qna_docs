MINISTER OF EDUCATION (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (d) The syllabus and textbooks in all subjects are prepared on the basis of the extant education policy and the National Curriculum Framework (NCF). The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)’s present set of textbooks and academic materials have been prepared based on the National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005. NCERT has informed that the contents about various aspects of the North Eastern Region have been included in the current NCERT textbooks for different disciplines of Social Sciences such as History, Geography, Political Science and Sociology across the stages. Besides, supplementary reading material, namely, “Women of North-East India: Making a Difference” and “North East India: People, History and Culture” have also been developed by NCERT. The NCERT, as a regular activity, update their textbooks before these are reprinted every year keeping in view the comments, suggestions and grievances received from different stakeholders.****
