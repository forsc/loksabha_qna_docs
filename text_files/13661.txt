ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (e)  Ganga-Bhagirathi-Hooghly river system from Prayagraj to Haldia was declared as National Waterway-1 in 1986.   Fairway between Haldia to Prayagraj is monitored through regular surveys and related interventions by Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI).  However, no specific scheme is being implemented for development of water transport in Prayagraj at present.  The Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) is being implemented by the IWAI at an estimated cost of Rs. 5369.18 crore for capacity augmentation of navigation on the Haldia-Varanasi stretch of National Waterway-1 with technical and financial assistance of the World Bank.  Under JMVP projects worth Rs. 1800 crore (approx.) have commenced on ground in a time period of three years after statutory clearances.   The project is progressing in a time bound manner with scheduled completion in March, 2023.  To harness the expertise of private sector, terminal operations at Varanasi, Sahibganj and Haldia is envisaged under the PPP model.                                                 *****
