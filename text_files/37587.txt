ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (d): As per Sample Registration System Report 2019 of Registrar General of India, The Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) is 20 per 1000 live births in urban areas in comparison to 34 per 1000 live births in rural areas at national level.The primary responsibility to provide adequate healthcare services in public health facilities across the country including rural areas lies with the State Governments. To address the healthcare challenges, particularly in rural areas, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in 2005 to supplement the efforts of the State/UT governments to provide accessible, affordable and quality healthcare to all those who access public health facilities. Currently, NRHM is a sub-mission of National Health Mission (NHM). This support under NHM includes provision of a host of free services related to maternal health, child health, adolescent health, family planning, universal immunisation programme, and for major diseases such as Tuberculosis, HIV/ AIDS, vector borne diseases like Malaria, Dengue and Kala Azar, Leprosy etc.Mobile Medical Units (MMUs) and Telemedicine are also implemented with NHM support to improve healthcare access particularly in rural areas.As part of Ayushman Bharat, the Government is supporting the States for strengthening Sub Centres and Primary Health Centres as Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs) for provision of comprehensive primary health care that includes preventive healthcare and health promotion at the community level with continuum of care approach. Further, Ayushman Bharat, Pradhan Mantri Jan ArogyaYojana (AB-PMJAY) provides health coverage up to Rs. 5.00 lakh per family per year as per Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC). The States are also encouraged to adopt flexible norms for engaging specialists for public health facilities. Financial support is also provided to States for providing hard area allowance, performance-based incentives, providing accommodation and transport facilities in rural and remote areas, sponsoring training programmes, etc to engaged human resources to address the issue of shortage of doctors and specialists in the public health facilities.The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) is supporting all States/UTs in implementation of Reproductive, Maternal, New-born, Child, Adolescent health and Nutrition (RMNCAH+N) strategy under National Health Mission (NHM) based on the Annual Programme Implementation Plan (APIP) submitted by States/ UTs to reduce Infant Mortality Rate. The details of interventions are placed at Annexure I.
