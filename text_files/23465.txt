In the critical Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected blocks (as identified by Ministry of Home Affairs), provision were made to connect habitations with population 100 persons and above (as per 2001 census). The unit of PMGSY programme is a habitation and not a revenue village or panchayat.Against 1,78,184 eligible habitations of 250+ and 500+ population size identified for coverage under the scheme, 16,086 habitations have been provided connectivity by the States out of their own resources and 4,689 habitations have either been dropped or have not been found feasible due to various reasons. Out of the balance 1,57,409 habitations sanctioned for providing connectivity under the PMGSY, 1,54,676 have already been connected by all-weather roads and the balance 2,733 habitations are proposed for connectivity by March, 2022.  Under 100-249 population category habitations in LWE areas, out of 6,286 habitations sanctioned for providing all-weather road connectivity, 5,565 habitations have been provided all-weather road connectivity and balance 721 habitations are proposed for all-weather road connectivity by March, 2022.The details of habitations provided connectivity under PMGSY, State/UT-wise are indicated in Annexure.

In addition to this, special review meetings/monthly review meetings are also held by Secretary/ Additional Secretary/Joint Secretary, Ministry of Rural Development with Chief Secretaries/Principal Secretaries of the States.
