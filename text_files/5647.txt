 MINISTER OF COAL, MINES & PARLIAMENTARY AFFIARS(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a)	Yes, Sir.  The development of captive coal block is a major project and involves a gestation period of 3 to 4 years for obtaining various clearances from State / Centre agencies.  In some cases, the development of captive coal blocks has suffered as the allocatees were not able to obtain various approval / clearances from the State / Central Agencies like Environment Clearances (EC), Forest Clearances (FC), Mining Leases and purchase /acquisition / mutation of land, etc. within the timelines prescribed in the Allotment Agreement.(b)	Total production from captive mines allocated under Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 and Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1973 in FY 2018-19 is 49.93 MT. (c) to (d) : Under Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, total of 68 captive coal mines have been allocated.  Out of these 68 coal mines, 29 have got Mine Opening Permission. Out of these 29, production has commenced in 17 coal mines.  In the remaining 12 coal mines, 4 coal mines are in the process of removal of overburden, 5 coal mines have got Mine Opening Permission in March-April, 2019 only and in case of 3 coal mines court cases pertaining to Mine Developer-cum-Operator are pending in various Courts.Under the provisions of the Mines & Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act, 1957, 10 captive coal blocks have been allocated out of which none has commenced production.  Further, under the provisions of the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1973, 4 captive coal blocks remain allocated out of which 3 are under production.  *******
