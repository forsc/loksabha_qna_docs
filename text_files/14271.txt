                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS[SHRI KIREN RIJIJU](a) Preparation of Indian sportspersons and teams for international sports events including Olympics is an ongoing process. The Central Government is supporting sportspersons through National Sports Federations (NSFs) for their training, foreign exposures and competitions to enable them to obtain maximum quota for participation in Olympics and enhance their chances of winning medals. Under the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), customized training and allied facilities are also being made available to medal prospects and high achievers.(b) ‘Sports’ being a State subject, the responsibility for promotion and development of sports, including scouting and grooming of talent at school level, is that of the State/UT Governments. However the Central Government supplements the efforts of the State Governments and NSFs under its various schemes such as Khelo India, Scheme of Assistance to NSFs and providing training facilities in Sports Authority of India (SAI) centres.Besides, SAI Promotional Schemes, Khelo India Scheme has ‘Talent Search and Development’ and ‘Annual Sports Competition’ verticals. In addition, while considering NSF proposals for Annual Calendar for Training and Competitions (ACTC), Government is impressing upon scouting and nurturing of talent.(c) Khelo India Scheme of the Ministry aims at strengthening the entire sports ecosystem to promote the twin objectives of mass participation and promotion of excellence in sports across the country.Utilisation and Creation/ Upgradation of Sports Infrastructure is one of the components of Khelo India Scheme under which sports infrastructure projects are sanctioned to the proponent authorities from various States/Union Territories.****
