ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) and (b) The spread of COVID-19 pandemic has also had a severe impact on education as schools, universities and colleges closed their premises and states shut their borders in response to lockdown measures. However, learning could not be stopped. To ensure that children have access to education with quality and equity and to minimize the impact of the pandemic on school education in the country, the Department of School Education and Literacy has taken lots of initiatives to continue children’s learning from home through online or offline mode.The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has developed an Alternative Academic Calendar for all learners including learners with disabilities studying at home for all stages of school education along with guidelines for teachers, parents and school principals on how to carry out calendar of activities at home. A multi-pronged approach has been adopted leveraging technology to reach the students. Digital initiatives like PMeVIDYA, DIKSHA, e-pathshala, NROER, NISHTHA, etc., are being used to provide educational e-contents on 24x7 basis. The text books of NCERT are made available on e-pathshala in digital modes which are accessible through ‘read text’, ‘read aloud’ and ‘text to speech’. These books can also be downloaded free of cost. There is one earmarked TV channel per class from 1 to 12 (one class,one channel) under PMeVidya. There has been extensive use of Shiksha Vani- radio, community radio and podcast to broadcast learning content. The initiatives taken by the Department of School Education and Literacy are available in public domain. Link of the same is:https://www.education.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/DOSEL_COMPILATION_ON_COVID_ACTIVITIES.pdf.The University Grants Commission ( UGC ) have issued certain guidelines and advisories from time to time and have taken concrete steps to impart online education by making the best use of e-resources which are available on www.ugc.ac.in. In order to disseminate educational content to masses, 32 Direct-To-Home (DTH) educational TV channels called “SWAYAM Prabha” broadcasting education content 24x7 basis has been launched, and the content developed under SWAYAM would be used for transmission in SWAYAM Prabha (SP) DTH channels. UGC’s SWAYAMPRABHA initiative is for remote areas, with low bandwidth connectivity. This may now be viewed by any learner free of cost without any registration. It provides access to best teaching learning resources which were earlier delivered on the SWAYAM Platform. UGC has shared the list of 82 UG and 42 PG SWAYAM MOOCs courses to be offered in the July 2020 semester on the SWAYAM platform, with universities and colleges and requested them to come forward in large numbers to adopt the SWAYAM courses for credit transfer, and encourage more and more students to enroll in these courses to ensure uninterrupted teaching learning for students. (c) Education being a subject in the Concurrent List of the Constitution and majority of schools/colleges are under the jurisdiction of the State/Union Territory Governments, it is for the respective State/Union Territory Governments to take necessary measures in this regard. The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme of the Central Government envisages for opening of a new Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each District of the Country. As on date, there are 649 JNVs functional and all of them are in rural areas. ******
