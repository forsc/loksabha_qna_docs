ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  Dam Safety Organization (DSO) in the Central Water Commission compiles and maintains nation-wide register of Large Dams (NRLD) as per input/ information provided by dam owners. Latest edition of NRLD was published in June 2019. As per NRLD 2019, the country has 5334 completed large dams and 411 under-construction large dams. As per NRLD 2019, Union Government has not constructed any new large dam in the country during the last 5 years.However, Union Government is providing assistance to State Governments for irrigation projects through various schemes for harnessing desired outcome/ benefit i.e. Irrigation Potential creation/utilization.  Details are placed at Annexure-I.(b) & (c)  As per NRLD 2019, 13 Large dams have been constructed since 2016. Details are as per Annexure II.(d)   As water is a State Subject, ownership and operation of dams lies with the State Governments, State PSUs and a few Hydro power Generating Central PSUs. As per NRLD 2019, No large dam comes under the direct and exclusive control of the Union Government.***** ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.544 to be answered on 04.02.2021 on ‘CONSTRUCTION OF NEW DAMS’.The Union Government had launched Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) in 1996-97 to expedite the implementation of ongoing Major, Medium Irrigation Projects which are in advance stage of construction and for which State Government is facing financial resource crunch. Since the inception of Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP), 297 MMI projects have been benefitted. 143 projects have been completed, whereas 5 projects have been deferred from the AIBP due to their inadequate performance and non-submission of subsequent proposals for seeking Central Assistance (CA) under AIBP. 149 projects were ongoing under AIBP as on March 2015. During 2015-16, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) was conceived by the Central Government with an aim to enhance physical access of water on farm and expand cultivable area under assured irrigation, improve on farm water use efficiency, introduce sustainable water conservation practices etc to produce per drop more crop, thus bringing much desired rural prosperity. The programmes as being implemented by the Govt. of India, viz. Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programmes (AIBP); Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) and Command Area Development and Water Management (CADWM) have been subsumed in PMKSY. With the vision of extending the coverage of irrigation ‘Har Khet ko pani’ and improving water use efficiency ‘More crop per drop'' the scheme has been formulated under PMKSY in a focused manner with end to end solution on source creation, distribution, management, field application and extension activities. The schemes “Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI) & RRR of water bodies” are now part of PMKSY (Har Khet ko pani, HKKP). Under the PMKSY-AIBP, 99 priority projects have been identified out of ongoing 149 major / medium irrigation projects under AIBP with a dedicated funding mechanism to complete them in a time bound manner. 44 priority projects have been completed as on 31st March 2020 and the remaining are targeted to be completed soon. In addition, Government of India has sanctioned a special package for completion of Irrigation Projects to address agrarian distress in Vidarbha and Marathwada and other chronically drought prone areas of Rest of Maharashtra during July, 2018. The package consists of 8 Major and Medium Irrigation (MMI) Projects approved by TAC of MoWR, RD & GR and 83 Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI) Projects.
