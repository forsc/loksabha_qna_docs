ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) to (c):	The Minimum Wages Act, 1948, provides for minimum wages to workers in scheduled employments and increase in the rates of wages from time to time. Under the provisions of the Act, the Central Government and the State Governments, as appropriate Government, fix, periodically review and revise the minimum wages of the employees employed in the Scheduled employments including agriculture in their respective jurisdiction. Accordingly, the minimum rates of wages in the scheduled employments in the Central sphere were last revised by the Central Government in 2017. Further, in order to take care of the rising prices, the Central Government revises the Variable   Dearness  Allowance  (V.D.A)  on  basic  rates  of   minimum wages every six months effective from 1st  April and 1st October  of  every  year  on    theContd..2/-:: 2 ::basis of Consumer Price Index for Industrial workers. V.D.A. was last revised w.e.f. 01.10.2021. A statement showing increase in the rates of minimum wages on account of periodic increase in minimum rates of wage and V.D.A thereon in the Central Sphere is at Annexure-I. The details of periodic revision of minimum rates of wages in the Scheduled employments in the State sphere are not centrally maintained. On account of the constant endeavor of the Central Government to extend the coverage of minimum wages to all sets of workers, the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, have been rationalized and amalgamated in the Code on Wages Act, 2019, as passed by the Parliament and notified on 08.08.2019. The Code on Wages, 2019, provides for universal minimum wage across employments in organized and unorganized sector. Further, section 6(6) of the Code, inter alia, provides that for the purpose of fixation of minimum rate of wages the appropriate government shall take into account the skill of workers required for working under the categories of unskilled, skilled, semi-skilled and highly skilled.  The Government is committed to provide social security to unorganised sector workers by formulating suitable welfare schemes on matters relating to (i) life and disability cover, (ii) health and maternity benefits, (iii) old age protection and (iv) any other benefit as may be determined by the Central Government. In this direction, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) provide for life and disability cover at the annual premium of Rs. 342/- (Rs. 330/- for PMJJBY + Rs.12/- for PMSBY) through banks. The benefits under the schemes are Rs.4.0 lakh on death due to accident, Rs. 2.0 lakh on death due to any cause. Rs. 2.0 lakh on permanent disability and Rs. 1.0 lakh on partial disability. Ayushman Bharat Scheme is a universal health scheme to take care of the health and maternity benefits of workers. In order to provide old age protection to unorganised sector workers, the Government of India has launched a flagship scheme namely Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Mandhan Yojana (PM-SYM) in March 2019, which is a voluntary and contributory pension scheme. The workers in the age group of 18-40 years whose monthly income is Rs.15000/-or less and not a member of EPFO/ESIC/NPS can join the scheme. Under the scheme, 50%  monthly  contribution  is payable byContd..3/-:: 3 ::the beneficiary and equal matching contribution is paid by the Central Government. Under the scheme, beneficiaries are provided monthly minimum assured pension of Rs.3000/- after attaining the age of 60 years. Enrolment to the Scheme is done through the Common Service Centres, with its network of 3.50 lakh Centres across the country. In addition eligible persons can also self-enroll through visiting the portal.Apart from above, under Skill India Mission, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship is implementing its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) for skill based training of the youth across the country under Short Term Training (STT) courses and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). Under PMKVY, STT is linked to placement, while RPL does not mandate placements as it recognizes the existing skills of candidate. Presently, the third phase of PMKVY i.e. PMKVY 3.0 is being implemented.*                                                ********
