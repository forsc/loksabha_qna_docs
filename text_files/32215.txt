ANSWER




                                                        (a)       Under Skill India Mission the Ministry of Skill Development (MSDE) has been implementing Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) Scheme and National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS), for providing short term Skill Development training and Craftsman Training Scheme (CTS), for long term training, to the youth belonging to all section of the society across all over India. The number of youth imparted training for employment under various Skill Development Schemes from 2015-2021, scheme-wise and state-wise is placed at Annexure I, II, III and IV. (b)        No, Sir.(c)	Training is imparted for skilling to enable the trained persons to obtain wageemployment or self-employment but actual placement/employment of any skilled person depends on many factors like the state of the economy, consequent derived demand for skills and sector-wise matching of demand and supply etc. Further, many trained candidates go with self-employment or entrepreneurial ventures. As per the Third Party Evaluation of PMKVY 2.0 (2016-20), it was found that average monthly income of PMKVY trained and certified individuals was 15% higher than the comparison group. Also, a significant 19% difference in average monthly income was observed with respondents who had undertaken RPL versus those who had not over a period of time. Moreover, 76% of the candidates acknowledged that after the training, they have better chance of getting employment. The objective of training imparted under JSS is to link the individuals for gainful livelihood and supplement their family income through self-employment and wage employment. The providing of employment/placement to the beneficiaries is not the mandate of the JSS Scheme. As far as the employment of the JSS scheme beneficiaries is concerned, third party evaluation report of the scheme has been mentioned. “It is finally observed that as an impact of the training programme conducted at JSSs, the self and wage employment and private jobs have become evident”. The usefulness of the scheme would be further self-evident from the fact that the same report has mentioned that (I) 77.05% of the beneficiary trainees have undergone occupational shifts and (II) number of beneficiaries enrolled and trained has increased by 59.23% between the year 2018 and 19. This fact shows the positive impact of the scheme on the livelihood options of the beneficiaries. The final report of Tracer Study of ITI Graduates (published in January 2018 by the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, GoI) mentions that 63.5% of total ITI pass-outs got employed (wage+ self, out of which 6.7% are self-employed) and 36.4% remained unemployed and was looking for jobs.
