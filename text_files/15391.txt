While RCEP was intended to provide mutually beneficial outcomes for RCEP countries including India, the current structure did not adequately address ambition and concerns of India’s stakeholders. India also stated that the Act East Policy was the bedrock of India’s economic policy and India’s engagement with ASEAN countries and other trading partners would continue.****
