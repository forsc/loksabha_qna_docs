ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) & (b) Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) was launched by the Government on 01.05.2016. On account of implementation of PMUY, the LPG coverage has increased to 94.2 % as on 01.06.2019, 61.9 % as on 01.04.2016.(c) to (f) Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell (PPAC) had engaged M/s CRISIL Risk and Infrastructure Solutions Limited (CRISIL) for preparing a master plan and end to end solution for LPG taking into account the entire supply chain logistics of LPG network to increase and scale up the coverage of LPG. CRISIL submitted the draft report in March 2016 to PPAC, before thelaunch of the PMUY Scheme i.e. 01.05.2016. The report identified issues that require stakeholders’ coordinated efforts, such as :-(i) Last mile connectivity is a key barrier despite initiatives taken by the Government and OMCs. As a result, availability of LPG, especially in the rural pockets, is lacking.(ii) Affordability is a concern for Below Poverty Line (BPL) households, as they deem the security deposit and recurring refilling charges to be high.(iii) Awareness related to the utility and advantages of LPG over currently used fuels.The Government through implementation of PMUY, expansion of distributorship network, the PAHAL scheme and the PM LPG Panchayats to spread awareness and education about safe & sustained usage of LPG has taken steps to address the above concerns
