                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d):	To achieve the objective of “Housing for All” by 2022, in rural areas of the country, the Government has re-structured the erstwhile rural housing scheme Indira Awaas Yojana (IAY) into  Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G). PMAY-G is being implemented by Ministry of Rural Development w.e.f. 1st April 2016. In urban areas of the country, Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Urban) [PMAY (U)] is being implemented by Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs  w.e.f. 25.06.2015.Under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G), being implemented by Ministry of Rural Development for rural areas, the beneficiaries are provided unit assistance of Rs. 1.20 lakh in plains and Rs. 1.30 lakh in hilly states, difficult areas and IAP districts for construction of pucca house. In addition, beneficiaries are provided assistance of 90/95 persondays of unskilled labour wages through convergence with Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and Rs. 12,000 for construction of toilets through convergence with Swachh Bharat Mission – Gramin (SBM-G), MGNREGS or any other dedicated source of funding. State Government is free to top up the unit assistance under PMAY-G.	Under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Urban [PMAY(U)] being implemented by Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs since 25.06.2015, assistance is provided to States/Union Territories (UTs) for addressing the housing requirement in urban areas. The scheme comprises the following four verticals:S. No.	    Vertical	                         Central Assistance per house1	In-situ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR)	      Rs. 1.00 Lakh2	Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS)	 Interest subsidy of 6.5 %, 4% and 3% on housing loan                                                  amounts upto Rs. 6 lakh, Rs. 9 lakh and Rs. 12 lakh                                                  for beneficiaries belonging to Economically Weaker                                                  section (EWS)/Lower Income Group (LIG), Middle                                                  Income Group (MIG-I) and MIG-II categories                                                  respectively3	Affordable Housing in Partnership         (AHP)	                                  Rs. 1.50 Lakh4	Beneficiary-led individual house         construction/ enhancements (BLC)	  Rs. 1.50 LakhCentral Assistance under PMAY(U) for different verticals is fixed to all States/UTs not withstanding topographical/ geographical differences across the country. States/UTs/ULBs may also make different levels of financial assistance to the beneficiaries under ISSR, AHP and BLC verticals of PMAY(U).The cost of construction of houses in rural and urban areas under both schemes of PMAY varies from State to State depending upon various factors like location, material cost, labour cost, technology used, etc. Under PMAY-G, it is the beneficiary who decides the design to be adopted for construction of his/her PMAY-G house. The beneficiary is provided with a bouquet of housing designs, according to local conditions, using appropriate technology suitable to region of their residence. The Central Government is providing financial assistance to eligible households for construction of house and not constructing houses under any of the two schemes. At present, there is no scheme for equalizing the unit assistance amount under both the schemes of PMAY.***********************
