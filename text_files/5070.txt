Accordingly, the minimum wages fixed by the Appropriate Government are equally payable both to male and female workers and the Act does not discriminate on the basis of gender.	Equal Remuneration Act, 1976 provides for payment of equal remuneration to men and women workers for the same work or work of similar nature without any discrimination. The Act is effectively enforced by the Central and State Government by conducting regular inspections to detect the violation of provisions of the Act by establishments. The office of Chief Labour Commissioner (Central) in the Central Sphere and State Government in State Sphere are the appropriate authorities to conduct inspection to ensure implementation of the provisions of the Act. Officers of the appropriate Government notified as Inspectors make inspections and prosecute those found violating provision of the Act.******
