ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) & (b): Access, equity, quality, affordability and accountability are the guiding principles for framing the policies for Higher Education. The minimum standard of education in every University is specified by the University Grants Commission (UGC) through its regulations.(c) & (d): Education being a subject in the Concurrent List, needs careful planning, joint monitoring and collaborative implementation between the Centre and States. Considering that Education plays a significant and remedial role in balancing the socio-economic fabric of the Country, the Ministry has taken several measures for the planned development, including expanding access and improving quality of the educational institutions throughout the country, through various Centrally sponsored and Central Sector schemes. As a result there has been a significant improvement in key indicators of education. As per the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report, during the last five years the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) has increased from 24.5 (Female: 23.5, Male: 25.4, SC:19.9, ST: 14.2) in 2015-16 to 27.1 (Female: 27.3, Male: 26.9, SC: 23.4, ST: 18.0) in 2019-20. The number of Universities has increased from 799 in 2015-16 to 1043 in 2019-20, thus marking an increase of 30.5%. The number of colleges has also increased by 8.4% from 39,071 in 2015-16 to 42,343 in 2019-20.******
