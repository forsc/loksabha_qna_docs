A comprehensive initiative called PM e-Vidya has been started which aims to unify all efforts related to digital/online/on-air education to enable multi-mode access to education. The initiative includes all forms of digital modes to provide remote access DIKSHA (online), SWAYAM (online), SWAYAM PRABHA (TV), other TV Channels including use of Doordarshan and Air Networks. Further, Pragyata guidelines were issued to States/UTs to facilitate continued education through various modes. The guidelines provide all forms of digital modes to provide remote access, inter-alia, include situation where internet connectivity is not available or available with very less bandwidth, resources are shared through various platforms like television, radio etc that do not depend on internet.

Besides these, community radio, worksheets & textbooks supplied to residence of learners, home visits by teachers, community classes, toll free numbers, SMS based requests for audio content, localised radio content for edutainment etc have been used. The steps taken by all the states are shown in the - India Report Digital Education June 2020, which is available at the following link:https://www.education.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/India_Report_Digital_Education_0.pdf.(e): As per Unified District Information System for Education 2019-20 (provisional), 53725, 22804, 39693 and 99116 government schools in rural areas have been provided with ICT facilities, digital board, PCs integrated teaching learning devices and internet facilities respectively.****
