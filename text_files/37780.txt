ANSWER




(a) to (b) : As informed by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the State-wise number of cases registered under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (including offences by care takers / in-charge of Juvenile Homes etc., and other offences) for crime against children during the last three years is at Annexure-I.   (c)  : The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 is the primary legislation for ensuring the safety, security, dignity and well-being of children. The Act provides for protection of children in need of care and protection and those in conflict with law by catering to their basic needs through care, protection, development, treatment and social re-integration. The primary responsibility of implementation of the JJ Act lies with the respective State/UT Government.  Further, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 provides safeguards for children against sexual abuse. The Act defines a child as any person below the age of 18 years. The POCSO Act 2012 provides for establishment of Special Courts for the purpose of ensuring speedy trial. The Act was amended in 2019 to introduce more stringent punishment including death penalty for committing sexual crimes on children, with a view to deter the perpetrators & prevent such crimes against children.**** ANNEXURE-I ANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (A) TO (B) OF LOK SABHA UN-STARRED QUESTION NO.4945 FOR ANSWER ON 01.04.2022 BY SHRI ASHOK MAHADEORAO NETE REGARDING CASES OF SEXUAL ABUSE IN JUVENILE HOMES STATE-WISE NUMBER OF CASES REGISTERED UNDER THE JUVENILE JUSTICE (CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN) ACT, 2015 (INCLUDING OFFENCES BY CARE TAKERS / IN-CHARGE OF JUVENILE HOMES ETC., AND OTHER OFFENCES) FOR CRIME AGAINST CHILDREN DURING THE LAST THREE YEARS Sl.
