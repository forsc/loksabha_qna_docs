ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU) (a) & (b)  Works related to enumeration of water bodies, their protection from encroachment, or diversion for use for other purposes, comes under the purview of the State Government concerned. However, from time to time, this Ministry conducts census of minor irrigation schemes in the country, which captures data regarding water bodies in rural areas associated with irrigation. As per the 5th Minor Irrigation Census conducted by this Ministry with reference year 2013-14, there are 5,16,303 water bodies in the rural areas of the country which are being used for minor irrigation, out of which 53,396 are not in use for various reasons such as non-availability of water, siltation, salinity, etc. As per the above-mentioned 5th Minor Irrigation Census, details for Rajasthan and Gujarat are as below: S. No	State	Water bodies  (with Not-in use MI schemes)	Water bodies  (with  In-Use MI schemes)	Total Water bodies (with MI scheme)1	GUJARAT	901	38,432	39,3332	RAJASTHAN	445	11,851	12,296 Note 1: Water bodies cover all natural or artificial units with some or no masonry work   used for storing water for minor irrigation (MI). These are usually of various types known by different names like tank, reservoir, pond. Note 2: In MI Census information is collected for villages/ rural areas only.Note 3: The above data pertains to only those water bodies where some minor irrigation scheme(s) (either in-use or not-in-use) is/are installed or those water bodies which function as surface flow schemes.Note 4:  Reasons for not in -use as minor irrigation schemes are non-availability of adequate power/fuel, mechanical break-down, less discharge of water, storage not filled up fully, siltation of storage, salinity, dried up, destroyed beyond repair, due to sinking. Contd…P/2//2//(c)  Though water is a State subject, Government of India has taken a number of important measures to identify and conserve such water bodies in a stipulated time frame. Key measures taken recently in this regard are listed below:1. Government of India is providing financial assistance to the identified schemes under Repair, Renovation and Restoration of Water Bodies component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) - Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP). 2. In 2019, Jal Shakti Abhiyan was launched by the Government. This was followed in  2021, by “Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch The Rain” (JSA:CTR) campaign. Focused interventions under these annual campaigns taken up by the Government of  India and the State Governments, inter-alia, include renovation of traditional and other water bodies/ tanks, enumeration, geo-tagging and making inventory of all water bodies, and removal of encroachments of tanks/ lakes, and de-silting of tanks. 3. Government has launched the first Census of Water bodies in convergence with the Sixth round of Minor Irrigation Census (reference year 2017-18), under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme- “Irrigation Census”. The objective of the Census of Water bodies is to develop a national database of all water bodies in the country. 4. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS) has provisions for public works relating to natural resource management, water conservation and water harvesting structures to augment and improve ground water like underground dykes, earthen dams, stop dams, check dams and roof top rain water harvesting structures in public buildings.*****
