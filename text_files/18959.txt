ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS(SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN)(a) to (d) 	The Government has consistently called upon Sri Lanka to fulfill its commitments on addressing the issues related to protecting the interest of Tamils in Sri Lanka. This was reiterated during the recently held India- Sri Lanka Virtual Bilateral Summit on 26 September 2020 between the two Prime Ministers. EAM during his visit in January 2021 conveyed that it was in Sri Lanka’s own interest that the expectations of the Tamil people for equality, justice, peace and dignity within a united Sri Lanka were fulfilled. That applied equally to the commitments made by the Sri Lankan Government on meaningful devolution; including the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. India continues to remain engaged with Sri Lanka at all levels in its efforts to build a future that accommodates the aspirations of all sections of society, including the Sri Lankan Tamil community, for a life of equality, justice, peace and dignity in a united Sri Lanka. ***
