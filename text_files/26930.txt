ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (d) At present no Indian Railway route has been privatized and no passenger train is being operated by the private operators. Indian Railways have observed a dropped waiting list of about 5 crore passengers during 2019-20 due to lack of capacity and to meet this gap, Indian Railways is already increasing production of Vande Bharat, Tejas, LHB, Vistadome etc types of coaches in trains. In addition, Indian Railways has invited bids for private participation to induct 151 trains (rakes) over 12 clusters through Public Private Partnership (PPP). The financial bids for all the 12 clusters for the PPP project have been opened on 23.07.2020. The Bids are under evaluation. The Origin-Destination pairs of the train services have been decided on the basis of commercial demand and operational feasibility. The existing passenger train services shall not be affected by the operation of train services through PPP mode as these train services will be in addition to the existing train services.  *****
