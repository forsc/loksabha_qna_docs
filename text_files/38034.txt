ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) to (c) As per the National Commission on Integrated Water Resources Development (NCIWRD) Report-1999, water requirement of the country for High Demand scenario for the year 2050 is 1180 BCM.As per study titled “Reassessment of Water Availability in India using Space Inputs, 2019” conducted by Central Water Commission in collaboration with NRSC, the average annual water resources availability in the country is assessed as 1999.20 BCM. It is estimated that owing to topographic, hydrological and other constraints, the utilizable water is 1,126 BCM which comprises 690 BCM of surface water and 436 BCM of replenishable ground water. The Ministry of Jal Shakti has been formed by the Government of India, integrating the erstwhile Ministry of Water Resources River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation and the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, with an aim to integrate water resources management under one umbrella so that the issues relating to water are dealt with in a holistic manner. This also synergises demand side and supply side management.(d) Water being a State subject, steps for augmentation, conservation and efficient management of water resources are primarily undertaken by the respective State Governments. In order to supplement the efforts of the State Governments, Central Government provides technical and financial assistance to them through various schemes and programmes.Government of India, in partnership with States, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) to make provision of potable tap water supply to every rural household of the country at the service level of 55 litre per capita per day by 2024.Government of India has launched AMRUT 2.0 on 1st October, 2021 for a period of 5 years (FY 2021- 22 to 2025-26), with the objective of providing universal coverage of water supply through functional household tap connections in all statutory towns in the country. One of the major objective of IEC under AMRUT 2.0 is to create awareness about practices for water conservation like rainwater harvesting, clean water bodies, ground water recharge and intensive plantation, etc.       The Hon’ble Prime Minister launched the “Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain” (JSA:CTR) with the theme “Catch the Rain - Where it Falls When it Falls” on 22nd March 2021, the World Water Day, to cover all the blocks of all districts (rural as well as urban areas) across the country during 22nd March, 2021 to 30th November, 2021 - the pre-monsoon and monsoon period. JSA:CTR campaign had five focused interventions- (1) rainwater harvesting & water conservation (2) enumerating, geo-tagging & making inventory of all water bodies; preparation of scientific plans for water conservation (3) setting up Jal Shakti Kendras in all districts (4) intensive afforestation and (5) awareness generation. The Command Area Development & Water Management (CADWM) Programme has been brought under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) – Har Khet Ko Pani from 2015-16 onwards. The main objective of taking up CAD works is to enhance utilization of irrigation potential created, and improve agriculture production on a sustainable basis through Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM). The new guidelines make separate financial provisions of Rs 5,000 per ha for PIM under non-structural intervention covering cost of training, adaptive trials, etc. and direct financial assistance to WUAs in the form of functional grant and infrastructural grant.  Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare is implementing "Per Drop More Crop" component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) which is operational from 2015-16 in the India. The PMKSY- "Per Drop More Crop" mainly focuses on water use efficiency at farm level through micro irrigation (drip and sprinkler irrigation system). ‘Sahi Fasal’ campaign was launched by National Water Mission (NWM) on 14.11.2019 to nudge farmers in the water stressed areas to grow crops which use water very efficiently, are economically remunerative, are healthy and nutritious, suited to the agro-climatic-hydro characteristics of the area, and are environment friendly. Government of India is implementing Atal Bhujal Yojana, a central sector scheme, in 8,774 gram panchayats of 81 districts of seven States namely Haryana, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The focus of the scheme is on community participation and demand side intervention for sustainable ground water management in identified water stressed areas. National Aquifer Mapping and Management program (NAQUIM) is being implemented by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) as part of Ground Water Management and Regulation (GWM&R) Scheme, a central sector scheme. Public Interaction Programs (PIP) are being organised at grass root level for disseminating the tenets of the Aquifer Management Plans as part of the National Aquifer Mapping and Management (NAQUIM) Programme for the benefit of the stakeholders. A monthly ‘WATER TALK’ lecture series is an important activity undertaken by NWM with the aim to stimulate awareness, (thinking), build capacities of stakeholders and encourage people to become active participants in sustaining life by saving water. In order to assist public/policy makers/various government functionaries, the technique for effective rainwater harvesting, Manuals on rainwater harvesting and artificial recharge of ground water, and master plan on artificial recharge to ground water etc have been prepared by the CGWB, which can be seen in the CGWB web-site at URL: http://cgwb.gov.in. Best practices of water conservation by various entities, including private persons, NGOs, PSUs etc, have been compiled and put on the web site of the Ministry for the benefit of general public.  Mass awareness programmes (Trainings, Seminars, Workshops, etc.) are conducted from time to time each year under the information, Education & Communication (IEC) Scheme of DoWR, RD & GR in various parts of the Country to promote rain water harvesting and artificial recharge of ground water. *****
