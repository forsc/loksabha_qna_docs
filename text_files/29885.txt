                                                        MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ?????? 	(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (h): As per the study on “All India Cold-chain Infrastructure Capacity (AICIC-2015)” conducted by NABARD Consultancy Services (NABCONS) reported the capacity of cold storages required at that time was 35 million MT against the existing capacity of 32 million MT in 2014. No such study has been conducted by Government for shortage of warehouse facilities. However, the present capacity of cold storages is 37.83 million MT and Warehouses is 173.65 million MT in the country. Government is implementing various schemes to develop the cold storage and warehouse facilities in the country including Gujarat:	Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare is implementing Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) under which financial assistance is provided for various horticulture activities including setting up of cold storages through State Governments. The component is demand/ entrepreneur-driven from among entrepreneurs, private companies, cooperatives, farmers groups etc through commercial ventures for which assistance at the rate of 35% of admissible project cost in general areas and 50% in hilly and scheduled area is available as credit linked back ended subsidy.	Besides, National Horticulture Board (NHB) is implementing a scheme namely “Capital Investment Subsidy for Construction/Expansion /Modernization of Cold Storages and Storages for Horticulture Products”. It is a demand/entrepreneur driven under which credit linked back-ended subsidy at the rate of 35% of the capital cost of the project in general areas and 50% in case of North East, hilly & scheduled areas for construction/expansion/modernization of cold storage and controlled atmosphere (CA) storage of capacity above 5000 MT and up to 10000 MT is available. In case of North Eastern States, the units with capacity above 1000 MT are also eligible for assistance. 	Further, Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MOFPI) is implementing a Scheme for Integrated Cold Chain, Value Addition and Preservation Infrastructure as one of the components of Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana with the objective of reducing post-harvest losses of horticulture and non-horticulture produce and providing remunerative price to farmers for their produce. Under the scheme, Ministry provides financial assistance in the form of grant-in-aid at the rate of 35% for general areas and 50% for North East and Himalayan States, ITDP areas and Islands for storage and transport infrastructure and at the rate of 50% and 75% respectively for value addition and processing infrastructure subject to a maximum grant-in-aid of Rs. 10 crore per project for setting up integrated cold chain projects including irradiation facility. Standalone cold storages are not covered under the Scheme.	Department of Agriculture and Farmer’s Welfare is also implementing Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure (AMI), a sub-scheme of Integrated Scheme for Agricultural Marketing (ISAM) across the country including Gujarat. AMI is demand driven, credit linked, back ended subsidy scheme. Under the scheme, subsidy at the rate of 25% for plain areas and 33.33% for NER, hilly area is available for beneficiaries viz, Farmers, Individuals, Farmers, Group of farmers/growers, Agri-preneurs, Registered Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), Cooperatives, and state agencies etc. for development of Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure Projects including storage infrastructure.	Depending on requirement in specific areas and for modernization of the storage facilities, the Government has been implementing the following schemes for construction of Warehouse/godowns including silos in the country:i.	Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) Scheme: Under this Scheme, which was formulated in 2008, storage capacity is created by private parties, Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and State Government Agencies for guaranteed hiring by Food Corporation of India (FCI). ii.	Central Sector Scheme: This scheme is implemented in the North Eastern States along with Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand and Kerala. Funds are released by the Government to FCI and also directly to the State Governments for construction of godowns. iii.	Construction of steel silos: In addition to conventional godowns, construction of steel silos has been undertaken from 2016 for modernizing the storage infrastructure and improving shelf life of stored foodgrains.	As per available information, State-wise number of cold storages and warehouses infrastructure sanctioned during the past three years including Gujarat is at Annexure – I.	These schemes are demand/entrepreneur driven, for which financial assistance is provided as per availability of funds and resources. Under MIDH, funds are allocated to States on the basis of Annual Action Plans (AAPs) received from State Governments, availability of resources and requirement of States. State-wise details of funds allocated and released including setting up of cold storages during last two years and current year are at Annexure – II.Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) plays a vital role in increasing the income of farmers throughout the country including Gujarat through various interventions, as given below:•	Increasing productivity through introduction of improved varieties, quality seeds and planting materials, protected cultivation, high density plantation, rejuvenation, precision farming and horticultural mechanization.•	Diversification to High Value Horticulture for orchards and Plantation crops, Vineyards, vegetable & flower gardens, Bee keeping, Mushroom cultivation, off season vegetables.•	Promoting Post Harvest Management through Cold storage (CS), cold chain supply chain including pack houses, ripening chamber, reefer vehicle, etc.•	Promoting Primary and minimal processing•	Market Linkages: Market infrastructure such as mobile vending cart, retail outlet, primary and wholesale markets.
