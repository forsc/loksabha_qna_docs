                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTER OF PLANNINGAND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICSAND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	Yes Sir, the Government has been regularly assessing progress in all the 112 Aspirational Districts including Barpeta and Baksa in Assam. Every month, districts are assessed on the basis of incremental progress made in the focus sectors of the programme including Health & Nutrition, Education, Agriculture & Water Resources, Basic Infrastructure and Skill Development & Financial Inclusion. The incremental progress is captured across these sectors through 49 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and the best performing Districts in overall terms and in each of the five sectors is rewarded for undertaking developmental works and filling critical gaps in the focus sectors. List of 49 KPIs on which the progress is assessed is placed at Annexure-I.  (b)	Under the present arrangement, Baksa district having secured good rank in the overall category and in basic infrastructure sector was rewarded Rs.3 crore for implementing projects for Strengthening Health Care, Education and Local Self Government institutions in Baksa district by addressing electricity and water availability at the facilities. Similarly, Barpeta District having secured good overall rank was awarded Rs. 5 crores for implementing various projects in Health & Nutrition, Education, Financial Inclusion and Agriculture sectors. (c)	The Aspirational Districts programme aims to bring about rapid progress in India’s 112 districts that have shown relatively less progress across key social indicators. Both Barpeta and Baksa Districts have shown good progress under the programme. While both districts have shown good improvement in the Education sector, Baksa has also shown improvement in key indicators in the agriculture & water resources sector.  (d)	One of the key strategies in the programme is to make development a Jan Andolan. Member of Parliament and other elected leaders have potential to involve community under this programme for this purpose. It is for this reason that details of progress of the districts across 49 indicators is placed in public domain www.championsofchange.gov.in which can be accessed by elected representatives and members of public.  One senior officer from Central Government has been nominated as the Central Prabhari Officer to guide the district administration. They have been requested to interact with the elected representatives including Members of Parliament. The programme envisages, that based on available data, Members of Parliament may guide the district administration for rapid development. ***** Annexure-ILIST OF 49 KPIs IN ASPIRATIONAL DISTRICTS
