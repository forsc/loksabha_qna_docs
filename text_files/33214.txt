                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(DR. SUBHAS SARKAR)(a) to (e): As per the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE+), the Average drop-out rates of students of all categories of schools from 2014-15 to 2019-20, year-wise, gender-wise and State-wise are at Annexure.	Education is in the Concurrent List of the Constitution and majority of the schools come under the purview of the respective State and UT Government. 	A National Achievement Survey across the country has been conducted on 12th November 2021 for Grade 3, 5, 8 and 10 students of State Government schools, Government Aided schools, Private Unaided recognized schools and Central Government schools for assessing the competencies attained by the students vis-a-vis learning outcomes.	The Department of School Education & Literacy has, in order to prevent drop outs, lower enrolments and loss of learning, issued guidelines on 13th July, 2020 for identification, smooth admission process and continued education of migrant children.	Further, to ensure that children have access to education with quality and equity and to minimize the impact of the pandemic on school education in the country, Ministry of Education has shared guidelines dated 7th January, 2021 with all States  which, among others, include identification of out of school children from age 6-18 years, enrolment drives and awareness generation, student support while schools are closed, continued Education for children with Special Needs (CWSN), student support on school reopening and Teacher capacity building. 	Also, a comprehensive Covid action plan  has been shared with the States and UTs on 4th May 2021, outlining the role of local bodies, formation of nodal group at village/town level, conducting door-to-door/helpdesk-based/app based survey to identify out of school children, their mainstreaming and resource sharing. 	This Department has also developed an online module for compiling the data of Out of School Children (OoSC) identified by each State/UT and their mapping with Special Training Centres (STC) on the PRABANDH Portal (http://samagrashiksha.in). The concerned State/UT validates the child wise information of the identified OoSC and STC uploaded by the concerned Block Resource Centre of the State for monitoring the progress of mainstreaming of OoSC.	During the pandemic, the Ministry of Education has taken various steps for providing continued access to education, which are available to each category of students irrespective of their region or economic standard. A comprehensive initiative called PM e-Vidya has been started which aims to unify all efforts related to digital/online/on-air education to enable multi-mode access to education. The initiative includes all forms of digital modes to provide wide access- DIKSHA (online), SWAYAM (online), SWAYAM PRABHA (TV), other TV Channels including use of Doordarshan and AIR Networks. Further, an Alternate Academic Calendar has been prepared for learning solutions for grade 1 to 12 for both children with and without device. Also, PRAGYATA guidelines were issued to States/UTs to facilitate continued education through various modes. The guidelines inter-alia include situation where internet connectivity is not available or available with very less bandwidth, resources are shared through various platforms like television, radio etc. that do not depend on internet.Also, to bridge the learning gaps and to ensure continuity of education, this Department has shared Learning Recovery Plan with all the states and Union Territories on 01.02.2022 describing the actions/ activities to be undertaken by all the stakeholders, indicative annual calendar of activities, existing interventions which can be utilized and additional support with funds as one time measure.
