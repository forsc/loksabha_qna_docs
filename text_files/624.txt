ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES & PENSIONS AND PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (Dr. JITENDRA SINGH):    (a)	The details of State/UT-wise energy requirement during last five years and the current year, 2019-20 (up to May 2019) are enclosed at Annexure-I. The details of electricity generation from conventional sources having installed capacity of 25 MW and above, State-wise, in the country during the last five years & current year i.e. 2019-20 (up to May 2019) are enclosed as Annexure-II.(b)	Details of amount and percentage share of atomic energy in the total generation of the country for last five years and current year, 2019-20 (up to May, 2019) are enclosed at Annexure-III. The share of nuclear power in the total electricity generation in the country was about 3% in 2018-19. (c)	Yes, Sir. To increase the share of nuclear power generation, the government has taken several steps to increase the nuclear power capacity and to provide adequate quantity of fuel. These include:(i)	Resolution of issues related to Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act & creation of Indian Nuclear Insurance Pool (INIP).(ii)	Accord of administrative approval and financial sanction of - ten (10) indigenous 700 MW Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) to be set up in fleet mode & two (02) units of Light Water Reactors (LWRs) to be set up in cooperation with Russian Federation.(iii)	Amendment of the Atomic Energy Act to enable Joint Ventures of Public Sector Companies to set up nuclear power projects. (iv)	Entering into enabling agreements with foreign countries for nuclear power cooperation including supply of fuel. (d) 	The capital cost for 1 MW Solar photovoltaic (PV) power plant is in the range of Rs.4 to 5 crore.  In respect of Thermal power projects presently under construction, the capital cost varies from about Rs. 5 crore to Rs.10 crore per MW.  Similarly, the capital cost of hydro power projects presently under construction vary widely from Rs. 4 crore to Rs.20 crore/ MW. In respect of nuclear power, the completion cost of Indigenous 700 MW PHWR is about Rs.15 crore per MW. The cost per MW of reactors to be set up with foreign cooperation depends on the business model adopted. However, the tariffs of electricity generated by nuclear power are competitive with those of contemporary base load generators like thermal power, owing to the low energy (fuel) cost component of nuclear power. (e)	The present policy (Consolidated FDI Policy of Government) puts atomic energy in the list of prohibited sectors. However, there is no restriction on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the nuclear industry for manufacturing of equipment and providing other supplies for nuclear power plants and related other facilities.******
