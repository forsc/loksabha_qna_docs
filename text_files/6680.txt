ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c)  Panchayat, being “Local Government”, is a State subject  and part of State list of Seventh Schedule of Constitution of India. Mandate for setting up of Panchayats is provided by Article 246 in Part IX of the Constitution of India. Accordingly the Panchayats are setup and operate through the respective State Panchayati Raj Acts.  Further, Article 243K (4) provide that the Legislature of a State may, by law, make provision with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with, elections to the Panchayats. Therefore, the State legislature through provisions in their respective State Panchayati Raj Acts may prescribe the minimum educational qualifications for the election to Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI). As per information available with Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR), the States of Rajasthan and Haryana had prescribed minimum educational qualification for elections to the Panchayati Raj Institutions in year 2015. However, the State of Rajasthan has repealed such provisions in year 2019.**********
