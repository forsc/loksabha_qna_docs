ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) & (b) :           At present there is no proposal to implement uniform electricity pricing through out the country. However, Government is promoting competition through Power Exchanges. Uniform tariff is discovered on the Power Exchanges for a specific time block of the day. Accordingly, to this extent, for the power procured by the distribution utilities from Power Exchanges the price of electricity remains uniform, except in case of market splitting.(c) to (f) :    As per provision of the Electricity Act, 2003, the responsibility for fixing retail supply tariff of electricity falls under the purview of respective State Electricity Regulatory Commissions. In case of Odisha, the tariff is determined by the Odisha State Electricity Regulatory Commission. The Retail Supply tariff of electricity depends upon various factors like power purchase cost and other operational and financial parameters of Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) and it varies across the DISCOMs throughout the country.*************
