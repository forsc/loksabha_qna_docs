(b)	National Centre for Seismology under Ministry of Earth Sciences, is the nodal agency of Government of India (GoI), for monitoring and to study earthquakesin and around the country. For this purpose, NCS maintains a National Seismological Network (NSN) consisting of 115 observatories spread across the country.The network is capable of recording any event of M:2.5 and above in and around Delhi, M:3.0 and above for NE region, M:3.5 and above in Peninsular and extra-peninsular region, M:4.0 and above in Andaman region, and M:4.5 and above in border regions. In order to spatially densify the gap areas and to improve the magnitude detection threshold down to 3.0 in the country, 35 new stations have been planned in the country and the installation is already in progress. It is also planned to strengthen the NSN further by adding 100 seismic stations in the next 5 years to increase the detection capability of earthquake up to M:2.5 throughout the country.(c)	All the 35 new stations shall be commissioned and will start functioning by December 2021. Thus, the strength of National Seismological Network (NSN) will increase to 150 by December 2021.Subsequently, additional 100 new stations will be installed by March 2026.
