August 1, 2019...........2/--2-(b): 	Department of Food and Public Distribution in collaboration with States/UTs is implementing a scheme on ‘End-to-End Computerization of TPDS Operations’ to improve the efficiency and transparency in Public Distribution System (PDS) operations. The scheme comprises digitization of ration cards/beneficiary and other databases, online allocation, computerization of supply-chain management, setting up of transparency portal and grievance redressal mechanisms.  Under the scheme online grievance redressal facility/Toll-free (1967/1800-series) number has been implemented in all States/UTs.
