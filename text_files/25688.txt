ANSWER




MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (d): Project of new line from Ajmer (Nasirabad) – Sawai Madhopur (ChauthKa Barwara) via Tonk (165 km) was included in the Budget 2015-16 with the commitment from Government of Rajasthan to provide land free of cost and to share 50% cost of the project. Accordingly, State Government was requested for funding 50% of the project cost and to provide land free of cost, which has not been agreed by Rajasthan Government. (e) to (g): Considering the huge shelf of ongoing New Line projects, focus of Ministry of Railways is to complete the existing New Line projects. Hence, there is no proposal to execute the Ajmer to Tonk via Sawai Madhopur new line project from Gross Budgetary Support (GBS).*****
