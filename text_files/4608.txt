Thus, the decision to include ATF under GST rests with the GST Council. No decision has been taken in this regard.;;(b): The details of central excise duty and customs duty collected on the ATF is as under:;;                                                         ;(in Rs. crore);Year            Central Excise Duty     Customs Duty2014-15              1,063                             58;2015-16              1,623                             78;2016-17              1,520                            161;2017-18              1,938                            162;2018-19 (P)        2,540                            229;;(c): Excise duty rebate is allowed on export of excisable goods.
