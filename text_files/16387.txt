ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TOURISM (INDEPENDENT CHARGE)(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a):  As per the estimation in accordance with 3rd TSA on the basis of latest available NAS 2020, contribution of Tourism in GDP and jobs in year 2018-19 is 5.00% and  12. 95 % respectively. Further data on tax revenue received is not maintained by Ministry of tourism, Government of India.(b): No formal study has been instituted for assessment of the impact on the Tourism sector, tax revenue loss and job losses. However, several rounds of discussions and brainstorming sessions with industry stakeholders indicate massive loss of revenue, foreign exchange and jobs. In view of the highly unorganized nature of the sector, the impact in numerical terms can only be ascertained in due course.(c) &(d): The stimulus packages announced by the various agencies and ministries of Government of India are given in annexure I. Further steps which have been taken to overcome the crisis caused by Covid-19 pandemic in the tourism sector is given in Annexure II.(e) & (f): All the prominent stakeholders have given representations regarding extension of moratorium and other provisions including information about the amount of loan disbursed to Tourism sector under Atmanirbhar Bharat Package which are being taken up with the concerned Ministries/ Departments of Government of India and the States/UTs  on a regular basis. *******
