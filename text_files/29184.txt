STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (g) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 514 BY ¬ SHRIMATI JASKAUR MEENA TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 01.12.2021 REGARDING KISAN RAIL SCHEME(a) to (c): In compliance to the announcement made in Union Budget 2020-21, Kisan Rail trains have been introduced by Indian Railways to enable speedy movement of perishables including fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, fishery and dairy products from production or surplus regions to consumption or deficient regions.  Kisan Rail enables farmers to utilize the vast railway network to gain access to distant, bigger and more lucrative markets.  It is based on the concept of multi commodity, multi consignor, multi consignee and multi stoppages. There is no minimum limit on quantity that can be booked, enabling small farmers to reach bigger and distant markets. Commodities booked via Kisan Rail trains are charged at ‘P’-scale of parcel tariff.  Since the launch of first Kisan Rail service on 7th August 2020 and upto 19th November 2021, Indian Railways have operated 1,586 Kisan Rail services, transporting approximately 5.2 lakh tonnes of perishables including fruits and vegetables.  (d) to (f)  Potential circuits for movement of vegetables, fruits and other perishables are identified in consultation with Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare and Agriculture/Animal Husbandry/ Fisheries Departments of State Governments as well as local bodies and agencies, Mandis etc., and based on demand, rakes are provided on priority for running of Kisan Rail services.  So far, Kisan Rail has not been operated from any location in Rajasthan.    (g):  Yes, Sir.  During COVID-19, Kisan Rail and other time tabled parcel special services played a significant role in transportation of farm products and other essential commodities (including food items, medicines, medical and surgical equipment, etc.) across the country.  *********
