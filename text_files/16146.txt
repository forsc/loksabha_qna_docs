ANSWER




                                                        (a): As per the information available in the open source, in the report published by the agency ‘Transparency International’ on Corruption Perception Index (CPI) for the year 2019, India is placed at 80th  position among 180 countries surveyed in 2019. This survey / report by Transparency International was not conducted at the behest of the Government of India.(b):	There is no evidence to show that there is a rise in corruption after demonetisation. On the contrary, demonetisation, besides serving other objectives of eliminating fake currency, stopping terror financing, promoting formalisation of economy, promoting digital payments, also succeeded in unearthing black money. Eliminating black money was one of the objectives of demonetisation. During the period from November 2016 to March 2017, the Income-tax Department conducted search and seizure actions in around 900 groups leading to seizures of around Rs. 900 crore, including cash of Rs. 636 crore and admission of undisclosed income of about Rs. 7961 crore. Further, a dedicated campaign was launched to take focused action on non-filers who had deposited large value of cash during the demonetisation period. The cash deposit data was analysed to identify those persons whose cash transactions did not appear in line with their profile. These exercises promoted compliance, which has resulted in increase of income tax returns filer base and direct tax collections also.The Government of India, in pursuance to its commitment to “Zero Tolerance against Corruption” has taken several measures to combat corruption, which, inter alia, include the following:(i) Systemic improvements and reforms to provide transparent citizen-friendly services and reduce corruption. These include: (a) Disbursement of welfare benefits directly to the citizens under various schemes of the Government in a transparent manner through the Direct Benefit Transfer initiative. (b)  Implementation of E-tendering in public procurements.(c)  Introduction of E-Governance and simplification of procedure and systems. (d) Introduction of Government procurement through the Government eMarketplace (GeM).(ii) Discontinuation of interviews in recruitment of Group ‘B’ (Non-Gazetted) and Group ‘C’ posts in Government of India. (iii) The All India Services (Disciplinary and Appeal) Rules and Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules have been amended to provide for specific timelines in the procedure related to disciplinary proceedings.(iv) The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 has been amended on 26.07.2018 to bring a paradigm shift in tackling corruption in as much as clearly criminalising the act of giving bribe and to help checking the big ticket corruption by creating a vicarious liability in respect of senior management of commercial organisations.(v) Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) through various orders and circulars recommended adoption of Integrity Pact to all the organisations in major procurement activities and to ensure effective and expeditious investigation wherever any irregularity/misconduct is noticed. In addition, the CVC, as an apex integrity institution, has adopted a multi-pronged strategy and approach to combat corruption, which encompasses punitive, preventive and participative vigilance.(vi) The institution of Lokpal has been operationalised by appointment of a Chairperson and Members. Lokpal is statutorily mandated to directly receive and process complaints as regards alleged offences against public servants under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.(c): No, Sir.                                                *******
