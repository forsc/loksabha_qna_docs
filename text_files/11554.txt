ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a) & (b):  Government has taken balanced approach to reduce carbon footprints. The share of fossil fuel based energy generation has been reduced and there is thrust to promote non-fossil fuel based energy resources. Specific measures have been taken by the Government to reduce emission intensity, thus reducing carbon footprints with a view:•	To achieve about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030 with the help of transfer of technology and low cost international finance including from Green Climate Fund (GCF). •	To create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. •	To generate alternative sources of energy, like solar power.  (c):    Coal India Limited (CIL) & its subsidiaries have given stress on reduction of carbon footprint by technology upgradation in mining, exploring alternative source of energy (like generation of solar power), create additional forest & green cover, and installation of LED & solar light etc. SCCL has also planned to install 300 MW solar power plants in next 2-3 years to reduce the carbon footprints. (d):     Current status of coal production, supply for the ongoing projects and newly proposed projects of CIL and its subsidiary companies in FY 2018-19 having sanction capital Rs. 150 Crore are as follows: S.No	SUB	PROJECT	TYPE	TOTAL CAPCITY(MTY)	PROD 2018-19 (MT)1	ECL	JHANJRA COMBINED	UG	3.50	3.382	ECL	PARASEA BELBAID	UG	2.07	0.003	ECL	SIDULI UG+OC	UG	2.32	0.114	ECL	TILABONI	UG	1.86	0.005	ECL	CHITRA EAST RCE	OC	2.50	2.036	ECL	HURA C	OC	3.00	0.007	ECL	NAKRAKONDA KUMARDI B	OC	3.00	0.008	ECL	SONEPUR-BAZARI COMB.
