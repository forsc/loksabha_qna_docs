                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW & JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS, ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) to (f): Setting up of subordinate courts including Fast Track Courts (FTCs) and its functioning  comes within the domain of the State Governments in consultation with the respective High Courts.  The 11th Finance Commission had recommended a scheme for creation of 1734 FTCs in the Country for disposal of long pending cases.  The criteria adopted for creation of number of FTCs was based on the report of Sh.N.C.Jain, Member, 11th Finance Commission that one such court can dispose of upto 168 number of cases per year. The Scheme continued up to 2010-11 and then it was decided to discontinue.  An amount of Rs. 870 Cr. was released to the State Government within the period of 11 years and central funding was not continued beyond 31.03.2011. However, the Central Government decided to provide funds up to a maximum of Rs. 80 Cr. per annum on a matching basis up to 31.03.2015. Out of   38.99 Lakh cases transferred to FTCs since inception, 32.93 Lakh cases were disposed of as per the report received as on 31.03.2011.  In its judgment in Brij Mohan Lal & Others  V/s. UoI & Others on 19.04.2012 the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India had inter-alia directed the States that they shall not take a decision to continue FTCs on an ad-hoc and temporary basis. They will need to decide either to bring the FTCs Scheme to an end or to continue the same as a permanent feature in the State. Number of States opted to discontinue the Scheme.   Considering the need for setting up of FTCs for specific nature of cases pending in Courts viz. cases of heinous nature, civil cases involving senior citizen women and children and other marginalized section     of society and civil disputes involving land acquisition etc. pending for more than five years, the Union of India proposed setting up of 1800 FTCs at a total cost of Rs. 4144 Cr. during the period of 2015-2020, in its memorandum to the 14th Finance Commission. The Commission endorsed the proposal and urged the State Government to use the additional fiscal space provided by the Commission in the tax devolution to meet the requirements. Further the Union Government has also urged the State Governments to allocate funds for the activities mentioned in the 14th FC recommendation including setting up of FTCs from their State budgets from the financial year 2015-16 onwards. The number of FTCs and fund proposed, State wise,  is given at Annexure-I. The present status of number of Fast Track Courts functional, the information on the number of cases disposed of during the last three years including the current year, the number of cases presently pending in these courts as made available by the various High Courts is given at Annexure-II.		*** ANNEXURE-ILOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.1476  TO BE ANSWERED ON 27.11 2019STATUS OF NO.
