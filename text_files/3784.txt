ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) to (d) State-wise details of number of Kisan Credit Cards (KCCs) issued and amount sanctioned by Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) and Cooperative Banks, during the last three years, as reported by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), are given at Annexure I. State-wise details of number of operative KCCs and loans outstanding during the years 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19, in respect of Public and Private Sector Banks, as reported by RBI, are given at Annexure II. As reported by RBI and NABARD, segregated information regarding loans above rupees three lakh sanctioned under KCC, is not centrally maintained.As per Reserve Bank of India (RBI) extant directions on Priority Sector Lending (PSL), Domestic Scheduled Commercial Banks are required to lend 18% of the Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) or Credit Equivalent to Off-Balance Sheet Exposure (CEOBE), whichever is higher, towards agriculture. A sub-target of 8% is also prescribed for lending to small and marginal farmers including landless agricultural labourers, tenant farmers, oral lessees and share croppers. Similarly, in the case of Regional Rural Banks 18% of their total outstanding advances is required to be towards agriculture and a sub-target of 8% has been set for lending to small and marginal farmers.The percentage share of small and marginal farmers under agriculture credit disbursement for the last 3 years as reported by NABARD is as under:Years	Number of Accounts	Amount2016-17	72.1 %	50.1 %2017-18	74.7 %	49.9 %2018-19 (provisional)	74.3 %	49.9 %Under the KCC Scheme, a flexible limit of ` 10,000 to ` 50,000 has been provided to marginal farmers (as Flexi KCC) based on the land holding and crops grown including post harvest warehouse storage related credit needs and other farm expenses, consumption needs, etc., plus small term loan investments without relating it to the value of land.To enhance coverage of small and marginal farmers in the formal credit system, RBI has decided to raise the limit for collateral-free agriculture loans from `1 lakh to `1.6 lakh. The requirement of ''no due’ certificate has also been dispensed with for small loans up to `50,000 to small and marginal farmers, share-croppers and the like and, instead, only a self-declaration from the borrower is required.To bring small, marginal, tenant farmers, oral lessees, etc. into the fold of institutional credit, Joint Liability Groups (JLGs) have been promoted by banks.The KCC scheme has since been simplified and provides for issue of ATM enabled RuPay Debit Card, inter alia, with facilities of one-time documentation, built-in cost escalation in the limit, any number of drawals within the limit, etc.The credit limit/ loan amount under KCCs is fixed by Banks as per guidelines prescribed in the Master Circular dated July 4, 2018 issued by RBI. The short term credit limit under KCC for the first year is determined based on Scale of Finance for the crop (as decided by District Level Technical Committee) x Extent of area cultivated + 10% of limit towards post-harvest/household/ consumption requirements + 20% of limit towards repairs and maintenance expenses of farm assets + crop insurance and/or accident insurance including personal accidental insurance scheme (PAIS), health insurance & asset insurance. The limit for second and subsequent years (3rd, 4th and 5th year) is arrived based on first year limit for crop cultivation purpose plus 10% of the limit towards cost escalation / increase in scale of finance and estimated term loan component for the tenure of KCC, i.e., five years. The short term loan limit arrived for the 5th year plus the estimated long term loan requirement will be the Maximum Permissible Limit (MPL) and is to be treated as the Kisan Credit Card limit.*******
