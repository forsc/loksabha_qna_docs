                                                        (a)	to (c) NBCC (India) Limited, formerly known as National Building Construction Corporation Limited has undertaken a number of projects in India  and foreign  countries  during  the  last  5 years.    The  details   are annexed at Annexure I and Annexure II.  NBCC (India) Limited is executing Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojaya (PMGSY) project in Tripura.  The sanctioned cost of the project is Rs. 1,795.35crore for construction of 2,419.80 Km, out of which, 2,249.79 Km has been completed and the remaining 170.01 Km is to be completed by June, 2020. (d) & (e) NBCC is working as Project Management Consultant for the redevelopment of Pragati Maidan and for redevelopment of three GPRA colonies i.e. Nauroji Nagar, Netaji Nagar and Sarojini Nagar. Delhi High Court has ordered to maintain status quo at Nauroji Nagar in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 6680 of 2018. This has resulted in stoppage of work at this colony.  Statutory approvals for the plans of Netaji Nagar and Sarojini Nagar are in progress, after which, the work will commence.  The three colonies are expected to be completed within 32-48 months from the date of commencement of construction work.                                            *****
