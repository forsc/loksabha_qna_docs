ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) & (b) 	With a view to supplement the effort of the Department of Telecommunications in providing telecommunication services to the people, National Telecom Policy 1994 allowed the companies registered in India to participate in the expansion of the telecommunication network. Any company registered under the Indian Companies Act and fulfilling certain conditions can apply for grant of a specific License/Authorization for providing specific telecommunication services in a specific Licensed Service Area. The License is granted on non-exclusion basis i.e.  without any restriction on the number of entrants for provision of any service in a Service Area. The details of various Licenses issued by Department of Telecom are available on the website https://dot.gov.in/. Tariffs for telecommunication services are governed by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India; and are under forbearance except for Rural Fixed Line Services, National Roaming Services and Leased Circuits. (c) 		The Union Cabinet on 23.10.2019 approved the revival plan for BSNL and MTNL which included reduction in employee costs through Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS), administrative allotment of spectrum for 4G services through Capital Infusion, debt restructuring by raising of sovereign guarantee bonds, monetization of core and non-core assets and in-principle approval for merger of BSNL and MTNL.
