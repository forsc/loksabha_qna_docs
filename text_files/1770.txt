                                                        MINISTER OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI RAMVILAS PASWAN)(a) to (d): 	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.**** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF THE STARRED QUESTION NO. *148 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 02.07.2019 IN THE LOK SABHA(a)to(d):	The State–wise details of cane price dues of sugarcane farmers during current sugar season 2018-19 and last sugar season 2017-18, as on 25.06.2019, is at Annexure. With a view to improve the liquidity position of sugar mills enabling them to clear  cane price dues of farmers, the Government has taken following measures in sugar seasons 2017-18 & 2018-19:(i)	Fixing a Minimum Selling Price (MSP) of sugar w.e.f 07.06.2018 at Rs.29/kg for sale at factory gate in domestic market, below which no sugar mill can sell sugar.  MSP has further been increased to Rs. 31/Kg. w.e.f.  14th February, 2019.(ii)	Extending Assistance to sugar mills to offset the cost of cane in sugar seasons 2017-18 and 2018-19.(iii)	Extending assistance to sugar mills by reimbursing carrying cost towards maintenance of buffer stock of 30 LMT of sugar.(iv)	Extending Assistance to sugar mills for defraying expenditure towards internal transport, freight, handling and other charges to facilitate export of sugar from the country in sugar season 2018-19. (v)	Extending soft loans to sugar mills through banks for which Government would bear interest subvention @ 7% for one year to clear cane price arrears.Under the schemes enumerated in para (ii) to (v) above, it has been provided that funds released to sugar mills will be directly credited to farmer’s accounts on behalf of the sugar mills against their cane price dues. The Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966 stipulates payment of cane price within 14 days of supply, failing which interest at the rate of 15% per annum on amount due for the delayed period beyond 14 days is payable. The powers to enforce the provisions of Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966 with regard to payment of cane dues of farmers is vested with the State Governments. The Central Government from time to time issues advisory to the State Governments for ensuring clearance of cane price arrears of farmers and to take action against defaulting mills and also reviews the position of cane dues through meetings and video conferences with State Governments.....2/--2-With a view to diversify sugarcane farming away from sugar production, Government is promoting production of ethanol from sugarcane. To divert excess sugarcane for manufacturing ethanol, Government has for the first time allowed production of ethanol from B-Heavy molasses as well as from sugarcane juice. Further, Government has also fixed remunerative price of ethanol produced from C-Heavy molasses and B-Heavy molasses/sugarcane juice separately for supply under Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) programme during ethanol season 2018-19. *** ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED IN REPLY TO PART (a) TO (d) OF THE STARRED QUESTION NO. 148  DUE FOR ANSWERED ON 02.07.2019 IN THE LOK SABHA.
