                                                        THE MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES & PUBLIC ENTERPRISES(SHRI ARVIND GANPAT SAWANT)(a): As per information available in the Public Enterprises Survey 2017-18 that was laid on the Table of both the Houses of Parliament on 27.12.2018,  there are  24 operating Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) which have Registered Office in the State of West Bengal as on 31.3.2018. Detail of such CPSEs is given in Annex-I. (b) to (d): As per the information available with Department of Public Enterprises (DPE), out of these 24  CPSEs having Registered Office in the State of West Bengal, 5 CPSEs namely Hindustan Cables Limited, Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd., Burn Standard Company Ltd., National Jute Manufactures Corporation Ltd. and Birds Jute and Exports Limited have been approved for closure by the Government. The detail of status of disposal of land of these five CPSEs is given in Annex-II. DPE, being a nodal Ministry for all CPSEs, has issued guidelines on 14.6.2018 to all the administrative Ministries/ Departments of CPSEs on time bound closure of sick / loss making CPSEs and disposal of their movable and immovable assets. As per these guidelines, the administrative Ministry / Department / CPSE in consultation with Land Management Agency (LMA) identifies/ undertakes sale/ transfer of land of CPSE under closure. DPE does not centrally maintain data on disposal of land and other assets of CPSEs and amount realized thereof.   (e):  DPE coordinated a year-long broad based consultative exercise for redefining the role and functioning of CPSEs in the context of broad Vision of New India 2022 which culminated in the first ever CPSE Conclave held on 9th April, 2018 in New Delhi. The conclave came up with key challenges for the CPSEs to focus on, namely, (i) maximising geo-strategic reach of CPSEs, (ii) minimizing import bill of the country, (iii) Integration of Innovation and Research amongst CPSEs, etc. The CPSEs have prepared their action plans accordingly.Further, in order to bring in systematic improvement in the functioning of CPSEs, an advisory has been issued by DPE on 16.1.2019 on professionalization of below Board level management in CPSEs.***
