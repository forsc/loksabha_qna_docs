The government has taken various steps to strengthen the Intellectual Property ecosystem in the country, which in turn has had a positive impact on new inventions and technology in Science and Technology sector. A comprehensive National Intellectual Property Right (IPR) policy has been approved in 2016 to stimulate innovation and creativity across sectors.
