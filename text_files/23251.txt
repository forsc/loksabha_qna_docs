                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE (a) and (b) On February 24, 2021, the National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE) took a decision to halt trading from 11:40 a.m due to technical issues. However, the system of interoperability among clearing corporations which allows market participants to consolidate their clearing and settlement functions at a single Clearing Corporation, irrespective of the stock exchange on which the trade is executed, continued to remain functional. The trading at NSE resumed from 03:30 pm and trading hours were extended from 03:30 p.m. to 05:00 p.m. for the day in all the three stock exchanges, viz. NSE, BSE and MSEI to enable investors to square off their existing positions.  The Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) has advised SEBI to review the issues leading to the halt in trading in NSE and the corresponding disaster recovery process. DEA has further advised SEBI to take necessary measures to ensure that all the underlying issues leading up to the market disruption are addressed appropriately. (c) The details of investment made by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI)/ Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in the Indian Market on 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th and 26th February 2021 are as follows: Date	Equity (in ? crores)	Debt (in ? crores)	Hybrid (in ? crores)	Debt (Voluntary Retention Route*) (in ? crores)	Total (in ? crores)22-Feb-2021	       932	    (648)	     (68)	             134	       34923-Feb-2021	      (493)	    (796)	     (68)	                 2	        (1,356)24-Feb-2021	      (345)	      465	     (44)	          2,256	    2,33225-Feb-2021	      (300)	 (1,730)	     (37)	           (731)	        (2,799)26-Feb-2021	    1,790	 (2,028)	     (47)	             192	      (93) (d) FPIs made a net investment of Rs.2,332 Crores on February 24, 2021.
