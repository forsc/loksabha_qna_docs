ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS[SHRI KIREN RIJIJU](a) to (c): Inclusion of any sport discipline in the Olympic Games is decided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Among other things, IOC has prescribed that a sport discipline must be governed by an International Federation which undertakes to follow the rules of the Olympic Charter and it must also be practised widely across the world and meet various criteria.The Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports does not have a direct role in inclusion of Kabaddi in Olympic Games. It is for the International Kabaddi Federation to take required steps for inclusion of Kabaddi in Olympic Games.For promotion and development of Kabaddi, the Ministry is supplementing the efforts of the Amateur Kabaddi Federation of India by providing support for training, competitive exposure within country and abroad.*****
