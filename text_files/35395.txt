ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in association with Pollution Control Board/ Committees in different States/ Union Territories (UTs), have been monitoring the water quality of rivers and other water bodies through a network of monitoring stations under the National Water Quality Monitoring Programme. Based on water quality monitoring results, pollution assessment of rivers has been carried out by CPCB from time to time. As per the report published by CPCB in September, 2018, a total of 351 polluted stretches were identified on 323 rivers in the country based on monitoring results in terms of Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), an indicator of organic pollution. Out of these 351 polluted river stretches (PRS), following 8 are in Telangana:  Sl. No.	River	Polluted Stretch	BOD Range(mg/l)	Priority1.	 	Musi	Hydrabad to Nalgonda	4.0-60.0	I2.	 	Manjeera	Gowdicharla to Nakkavagu	5.0-26	II3.	 	Nakkavagu	Gandilachapet to Sevalal Thanda	26.0	II4.	 	Karakavagu	Along Palwancha	18.0	III5.	 	Maner	Warangal to  Somnapalli	6-20.0	III6.	 	Godavari	Basar to Khammam	4.0-9.0	IV7.	 	Kinnersani	Along Palwancha	10.0	IV8.	 	Krishna	Thangadigi to Wadapally	5.0-6.0	V (b) to (d)  Cleaning and rejuvenation of rivers is an ongoing activity. It is the responsibility of the States/UTs, Local Bodies and Industrial Units to ensure required treatment of sewage and industrial effluents in sewage treatment plants (STPs)/effluent treatment plants (ETPs) to the prescribed norms before discharging into river and other water bodies, coastal waters or land to prevent and control of pollution therein. For conservation of rivers, this Ministry has been supplementing efforts of the States/UTs by providing financial and technical assistance for abatement of pollution in identified stretches of rivers in the country through the Central Sector Scheme of Namami Gange for Ganga and its tributaries and the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) for other rivers. Setting up of STPs is one of the important components of these programmes. NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches on 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country with the project sanctioned cost of Rs.5961.75 crore, and inter-alia, a sewage treatment capacity of 2677 million litres per day (mld) has been created. Of these, 2 rivers namely Godavari at Bhadrachalam, Mancherial, Ramagundam and Musi at Hyderabad have been included from Telangana at a sanctioned cost of Rs.345.72 crore. These works in the State of Telangana include setting up of 10 STPs of 635.46 mld capacity, interception & diversion, low cost sanitation, river front development and improved wood crematoria etc.            Besides, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (HMWSSB) has submitted 4 projects pertaining to conservation of Musi and Manjira rivers at Hyderabad at an estimated cost of Rs. 3249.19 crore in February, 2020. These projects have been returned to HMWSSB for prioritization and modification. *****
