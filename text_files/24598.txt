ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a): During the last three years, Government of India (GoI) has accorded ''in-principle'' approval for setting up of two Greenfield Airports across the country namely Jewar (2018) in Uttar Pradesh and Hollongi (2019) in Arunachal Pradesh. Ministry of Civil Aviation has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21-10-2016 to stimulate regional air connectivity. An airport which is included in the awarded routes of RCS - UDAN and requires upgradation/development for commencement of RCS operations, is developed under "Revival of unserved and underserved airports" scheme. Under the scheme, as on 15.07.2021, 59 airports including 2 water aerodromes and 5 heliports have been revived/developed.;;(b): During the last three years (FY 2018-19, 2019-20 & 2020-21), an amount of Approx. Rs. 13226 crore has been invested by the Government/Airports Authority of India in renovating/building airports.(c): Airports Authority of India (AAI) has recently awarded six airports namely Ahmedabad in Gujarat, Jaipur in Rajasthan, Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh, Guwahati in Assam, Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala and Mangaluru in Karnataka for Operations, Management and Development under Public Private Partnership (PPP) for a period of 50 years.  AAI will get back their investment in these six airports to the tune of Rs. 2299 crore as upfront payment. Further, AAI will also get Per Passenger Fee, indexed to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), from the PPP Partner. Post PPP, the estimated net benefits accruing to AAI are more than the net benefits had AAI continued to operate the six airports on its own. Moreover, AAI is not required to incur any CAPEX and OPEX at these airports during the lease period. ;PPP at the airports has helped in creating world class airports and delivery of efficient and quality services to the airport passengers.  World class infrastructure created at PPP airports has led to increased slots for the airlines and efficient management of their services. PPP at airports has also helped Airports Authority of India (AAI) in enhancing its revenues and focusing on developing airports  at Tier-II and Tier-lll cities. Moreover, AAI is also able to focus more on its statutory function of providing Air Navigation Services at airports leading to enhanced efficiency in the civil operations.;(d) & (e): Prescribed procedures for leasing out AAI airports through PPP were adhered to while awarding airports for Operations, Management and Development under PPP .;
