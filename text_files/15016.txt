                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING:(SHRI PRATAP CHANDRA SARANGI) (a) Yes, Sir. The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Hyderabad has reported that Oceansat Satellite data from Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) are used to prepare the Potential Fishing Zone (PFZ) advisories on the potential rich fishing areas and provide to the sea faring fishermen in all states.  (b)  ISRO has developed the methodology for the generation of fishery advisories and transfer to INCOIS since 2002 as an operational service for providing PFZ advisories. This service utilizes data on chlorophyll concentration (Chl) obtained from ISRO’s Oceansat-2 satellite and the sea surface temperature from National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA / USA satellites).(c) & (d) INCOIS has reported that a study conducted by National Council for Applied Economic Research revealed that the emission of carbon in the environment is reduced due to the savings in diesel consumption and reported a carbon credit equivalent to an annuity of Rs. 36,200 crore. Another study, conducted the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) in Maharashtra during 2013-14, under National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP) of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), reported that a fishing village of 32 fishing boats in Maharashtra could save 70,000 litres of diesel in a month as the PFZ advisories helped them in avoiding the unwanted search for fish shoals. *****
