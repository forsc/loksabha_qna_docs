ANSWER




                                                        (a):   No, Sir.   There is no proposal to incorporate the caste and domicile details in the Aadhaar card of a resident including student. Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) issues Aadhaar number to a resident, after collecting the required biometric and demographic details of a resident. As per Section 2(k) of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016, “demographic information” includes information relating to the name, date of birth, address and other relevant information of an individual, as may be specified by regulations for the purpose of issuing an Aadhaar number, but shall not include race, religion, caste, tribe, ethnicity, language, records of entitlement, income or medical history. (b) to (f):  Do not arise in view of (a) above. *******
