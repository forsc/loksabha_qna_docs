ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                         (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)	No, Sir. The Government is not planning to release any report card of 100 selected Smart Cities. However, Ministry is planning to release the Ease of Living Index 2019-20 to assess the ease of living of citizens across three pillars of Quality of Life, Economic Ability and Sustainability.(b)	The 100 Smart Cities proposed 5,151 projects amounting to more than Rs. 2 lakh crore. As on 24th February 2020, 4,488 projects worth Rs.1,63,817 crore have been tendered out of which 3,655 projects worth Rs. 1,21,698 crore have been grounded and 1,575 projects worth Rs. 25,872 crore have been completed.(c)	 The concept of Sister Cities was announced in the 3rd Apex Conference held in January, 2020. The 20 best performing smart cities have been teamed up with 20 other cities which need support to improve performance. Starting from 20th February 2020, each city-pair has undertaken a 100 day challenge to plug gaps in implementation, thereby boosting progress. (d)	The 3rd Apex Conference of Smart Cities was held in the city of Vizag on 24th and 25th January, 2020. The issues deliberated in the Conference, inter alia, related to accelerating pace of implementation of the Mission, concept of sister cities,  sustainability of assets created under Smart Cities Mission (SCM), ClimateSmart Cities Assessment Framework, Data Maturity Assessment Framework, Ease of Living Index, Municipal Performance Index and Global Liveability Index etc. (e)	Each Smart City is expected to complete its projects within 5 years from the date of its selection. The regular monitoring of performance has ensured significant improvement in project implementation. There has been 227% growth in projects tendered, 294% growth in projects grounded/completed and 393% growth in projects completed in the last one and a half years. The review of progress of Smart Cities is carried out regularly at different levels. At Smart Cities level, the implementation of the Smart Cities projects is done by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) created for the purpose. The SPVs plan, appraise, approve, implement, manage, operate, monitor and evaluate their Smart City projects. At State level, Mission implementation is coordinated by the State level High Powered Steering Committees (HPSCs) chaired by the respective Chief Secretaries of States/Union Territories. At the National level, the implementation of SCM is being monitored by an Apex Committee headed by Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA).  The Nominee Directors of MoHUA on the Boards of SPVs are also monitoring the progress in respective Smart Cities on a regular basis. In addition, MoHUA regularly interacts with the States/Smart Cities through video conferences, review meetings, field visits, regional workshops etc. at various levels to assess the performance of the cities and to handhold them for improving the same. Besides, the guidance of domain experts participating in the regional workshops, cities benefit from peer-to-peer learning during these interactions. The Smart Cities are regularly reporting implementation status of projects under SCM through the Online-Management Information System (MIS). In addition, all the Smart Cities have been advised to furnish utilization status of Government of India funds on a monthly basis for monitoring the utilization of funds more closely.                                                   ….
