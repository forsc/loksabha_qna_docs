The details of such schemes are at Annexure ‘A’.(b) All the schemes of DGR as mentioned in reply to part (a) of the question except ‘Management of CNG Stations’ and ‘Allotment of Mother Dairy Milk Booths and Fruit & Vegetable (Safal) shops in NCR’  are meant for all States/UTs.All welfare schemes of KSB are meant for all States/UTs.

Details of percentage of ESM re-employed in such Departments as per information available as on 31st December 2019 is at Annexure ‘C’.  Data regarding employment of non ex-servicemen against vacancies reserved for ex-servicemen is not compiled.(e)  DGR Schemes are based on requisitions from user Departments and sponsorship is made once such vacancies are released to DGR and they are utilized in totality.Low employment rate of ex-servicemen in jobs is mainly due to not possessing National Council of Vocational Training (NCVT) qualification which is an essential qualification for technical posts and inadequate preparation by ESM for the competitive selection process in recruiting agencies which is totally academic.*****
