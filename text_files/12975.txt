                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN MINISTRY OF FINANCE(Shri Anurag Singh Thakur)(a) & (b):- As per provision in the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, compensation is being released to the States on bi-monthly basis for loss of revenue on account of implementation of GST. Accordingly, GST Compensation of Rs.48785 crore and Rs.81141 crore has been released to the States/UTs for the financial year 2017-18 (July, 17 to March, 18) and 2018-19 (April, 18 to March, 19) respectively. In the current financial year 2019-20, GST Compensation has been released fully to Kerala along with other States for April-September, 2019 and partly for October-November, 2019. The details of GST Compensation released to Kerala in the current financial year are given below: -     Period for which compensation has been released	Amount (Rs. in  Crore)April-May, 2019	862June-July, 2019	1284Aug-Sept, 2019	1597Oct-Nov, 2019 	854*Total	4597      * Rs.854 crore has been released as GST Compensation for Oct-Nov, 2019 against the due of Rs.1506 crore.(c) (d) & (e):- Net Borrowing Ceilings (NBC) of the State of Kerala for the year 2019-20 have been fixed at Rs. 24,915 crore anchoring the Fiscal Deficit target of 3 per cent of GSDP based on the calculation prescribed under the recommendations of Fourteenth Finance Commission (FFC) for the period of 2015-16 to 2019-20. Hence, the Union Government has not cut the borrowing ceiling for Government of Kerala from 3 percent of GSDP. However, the Union Government also approved in April 2016 that any additional borrowings availed beyond the State’s entitlements shall be adjusted from Net Borrowing Ceiling of the following year. Accordingly, as per the information submitted by the State of Kerala for 2018-19 (RE), there is an over-utilisation of borrowing of Rs.12,008 crore beyond the State’s entitlements during the year 2018-19, which has been adjusted from the NBC of 2019-20. (f):-  No, Sir.
