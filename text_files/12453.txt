                                                        MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (c): Education is in the concurrent list of the Constitution. The recruitment, serviceconditions and deployment of teachers including staff members come under the purview ofthe respective State and Union Territory (UT) Government. The Right of Children to Freeand Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 in its Schedule lays down Pupil-Teacher Ratio(PTR) for both primary and upper primary schools which is 30:1 and 35:1 respectively. Asper the framework of erstwhile scheme Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA)-now subsumed under Samagra Shiksha, PTR at secondary level should be 30:1. As per theUnified District Information System for Education (UDISE) 2017-18 (provisional), the PTRat national level for primary schools is 23:1, for upper primary schools is 25:1 and forSecondary level is 26:1.The recruitment of teachers in schools is a continuous process and the vacancies keep arisingdue to retirement, resignation and additional requirements on account of enhanced students’strength. However, Ministry of Human Resource Development has been requesting all theStates and UT Governments for filling-up the vacant posts of teachers and their rationaldeployment, for which the Ministry issues advisories to all States and UTs from time to time.Further, the Central Government through the centrally sponsored Scheme of SamagraShiksha, provides assistance to the States and UTs for deployment of additional teachers tomaintain appropriate Pupil Teacher Ratio as per the prescribed norms for various levels ofschooling.******
