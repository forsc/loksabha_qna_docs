                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                                    (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a):	The aims and objectives of Affordable Rental Housing Complexes (ARHCs) scheme announced under Atma Nirbhar Bharat package are as follows:i.	To address the vision of ‘AatmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ by creating a sustainable ecosystem of affordable rental housing solutions for urban migrants/ poor. ii.	To achieve overall objective of “Housing for All” encompassing the need of affordable rental housing for urban migrants/poor. ARHCs will provide them dignified living with necessary civic amenities near their place of work. iii.	To create a conducive environment by incentivizing Public/ Private Entities to leverage investment for creating affordable rental housing stock to take care of their own requirements for workforce and also cater to neighbouring areas, if they have available vacant land.(b) & (c): Yes, Sir. About 87,967 existing Government funded vacant houses are available in some of the States that can be converted into ARHCs by States /Union Territories (UTs)/ Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to provide rental accommodation to urban migrants/poor. State-wise details are at Annexure. State Government of Telangana had 9,913 Government funded vacant houses which have already been allotted to eligible beneficiaries. (d):   As per the Scheme Guidelines of ARHCs, initial affordable rent will be fixed by local authority based on local survey.  Subsequently, rent can be enhanced biannually by 8%, subject to maximum increase of 20% in aggregate, over a period of 5 years, effective from the date of signing the contract. The same mechanism shall be followed over the entire concession period i.e. 25 years.                                     *****
