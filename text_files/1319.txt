                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) & (b):	Following initiatives are taken for the promotion of Indian silk in the global market.i.)	Central Silk Board (CSB) introduced ‘Silk Samagra’ (2017-2020) for overall development of the silk sector to meet domestic as well as global requirements. Under the Scheme, Govt. of India through CSB provides support to establish Automatic Reeling Machines (ARMs) to produce international grade quality raw silk to cater to the needs of the domestic as well as export markets. In addition, support is also extended to establish Arm dyeing and fabric processing units to produce export quality silk materials such as denim Knitwear, crepe, Georgette, Chiffon & union fabrics. ii.)	Under Quality Certification Systems/Brand Promotion component of ‘Silk Samagra’, CSB is popularising “Silk Mark”, an assurance label for purity of silk products through the Silk Mark Organisation of India (SMOI) to protect the interests of the consumers from the traders selling artificial silk products in the name of pure silk.iii.)	SMOI is participating in the international exhibitions such as ‘India International Silk Fair’, ‘Heimtextil (India)’, ‘Who’s next’, etc., to increase the awareness about the ‘Indian Silk’ among the foreign buyers. ‘Buyers Seller Meets’, Fashion Shows etc., are arranged coinciding with major events to attract global markets.iv.)	Further, as a support to the silk export business, Ministry of Commerce (MOC) is also implementing schemes such as Merchandise Export from India (MEIS) scheme wherein the duty scrip as an incentive to an extent of 2% to 5% is provided to silk products to boost the exports. In addition, support is also extended under EPCG, EOU schemes of MOC.(c):	Traditionally, tasar yarn is reeled manually by the women folk, using thigh for reeling, which is unhygienic and against dignity of women. In order to replace/eradicate thigh reeling, the Buniyaad reeling machine has been developed and popularized. Upto March-2019, 4530 Buniyad reeling machines have been distributed among the tribal women under ‘Silk Samagra’(d) & (e):	Yes, Sir.  CSB has developed an Android based mobile application “e-cocoon” for onsite/online reporting of the inspection proceeds of Seed officers (SO) and Seed Analysts (SA). The “e-cocoon” was launched in “Surging Silk” Mega Event held on 09.02.2019 at New Delhi. This mobile app will help in real-time reporting of field visits/activities by the SOs & SAs. ***
