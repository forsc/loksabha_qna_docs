ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) :		No, Sir. India’s Power Grid is not in a bad condition. The availability of AC and HVDC transmission systems of POWERGRID for 2019-20 (up to Jan, 2020) is 99.81% and 98.51% against normative annual Transmission System availability factor(NATAF) of 98% and 95% respectively specified in the CERC tariff Regulation 2019.(b) :		India has established a strong national electricity grid leading to One Nation-One Grid-One Frequency and this has facilitated seamless transfer of power from resource rich areas to load centres without any transmission constraint. As on 31st January 2020, the National Electricity Grid has Transmission lines of 4,23,001 ckm and transformation capacity in substations of 9,60,453 MVA (voltage level of 220 kV and above). Development and Modernisation of transmission system is a continuous and evolving process, based on electricity demand and generation. At present, the Ministry of Power is implementing following Central Schemes for strengthening/modernising transmission system in the country:-i.	Comprehensive Scheme for strengthening of Transmission & Distribution in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim ii.	North Eastern Region Power System Improvement Project (NERPSIP) for Six (6) North Eastern States (Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura and Nagaland) for strengthening of the Intra-State Transmission and Distribution Systems (33kV and above). iii.	Financial assistance to UTs of Jammu and Kashmir and UT of Ladakh as part of Prime Minister’s Development Package-2015 for improving sub-transmission and distribution grids in these UTs. iv.	Establishing 13 nos Renewable Energy Management Centre to facilitate scheduling, forecasting and monitoring of Renewable Energy Generators which would in turn lead to improvement in Grid Stability. (c) & (d) :	Transmission system comprises of Inter State and Intra-State component.  Inter State Transmission System is planned by Central Transmission Utility, while Intra State Transmission System is planned by State Transmission Utility. Performance of Inter State Transmission System is not affected by rampant theft or degraded equipment or cost of renewable energy. Dedicated Green Energy Corridor has been planned for evacuation of Renewable Energy (RE) Generation from RE rich states. Further, all necessary safeguards have been taken for integration of Renewable Energy in the Grid, so that grid stability and security are not compromised. As explained in reply to part (b), the Central Government also from time to time assists the States in upgradation of their Intra-State Transmission System to ensure better performance.*************
