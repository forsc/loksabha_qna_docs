ANSWER




MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) & (b): 	Agricultural land/ Cultivable land consists of net area sown, current fallows, fallow lands other than current fallows, culturalble wasteland and land under miscellaneous tree crops. As per the latest data available on land use statistics, State wise details of cultivable land and culturalble wasteland including Karnataka for the year 2014-15 is at annexure-I.(c) & (d):  	As per Seventh Schedule of Constitution of India, land comes under the purview of State Government. Therefore, the State Governments are to take suitable steps to check diversion of agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes. However, under the National Policy for Farmers – 2007 (NPF-2007), State Governments have been advised to earmark lands with low biological potential such as uncultivable land, land affected by salinity, acidity, etc., for non agricultural developmental activities, including industrial and construction activities. National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy – 2007 (NRRP-2007) has also recommended that as far as possible, projects may be set up on waste land, degraded land or un-irrigated land. Acquisition of irrigated, multi-cropped agricultural land for non-agricultural uses may be kept to the minimum and avoided, to the extent possible.Contd…2/--2-Ministry of Rural Development is implementing an Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) for development of rainfed / degraded areas.  The IWMP has been converted to the Watershed Development Component of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) from the financial year 2015-16 principally for development of rainfed portions of net cultivated area and culturable wastelands. The activities being undertaken through the watershed development projects inter alia include ridge area treatment, drainage line treatment, soil and moisture conservation, rain water harvesting, nursery raising, afforestation, horticulture, pasture development, livelihoods for asset less persons etc.              In order to bring waste/degraded land into cultivation, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has developed several location specific bio-engineering measures to check soil erosion due to run-off of rain water, sand dune stabilization and shelter belt technology to check wind erosion, reclamation technology for saline, sodic, waterlogged and acid soils in the country. Agro forestry intervention has also been suggested. The ICAR also imparts training, organises Frontline Demonstrations (FLDs) etc. to educate farmers on all these aspects.
