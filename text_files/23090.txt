ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a)  and (b): In the Budget 2021-22, Government has announced a New Public Sector Enterprise (PSE) policy, which provides for a roadmap for disinvestment of PSEs in all non-strategic and strategic sectors. As per the policy, four broad strategic sectors have been identified, where bare minimum presence of the existing public sector commercial enterprises at Holding Company level will be retained under Government control, while the rest will be considered for privatization or merger or subsidiarization with another PSE or for closure. In the remaining sectors, where feasible, all CPSEs will be considered for privatization, otherwise such enterprises shall be considered for closure. The identification of CPSEs to be retained in a strategic sector shall be subsequently done with the approval of a group of Ministers called as ‘Alternative Mechanism’. The new PSE Policy is available on the website of DIPAM. (c) and (d): PSE Policy aims at making newer investment opportunities available for private sector, so as to allow infusion of private capital, technology, innovation and best management practices.  Privatization of the PSEs will help discovery of true economic potential of such entities which may result in generation of higher economic growth of the company, development of ancillary industries, which may add to the GDP of the country and creation of new job opportunities. ***
