                                                        MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a)	to (e) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*** STATEMENT REFEERED TO IN REPLY TO PARAS (a) TO (e) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 114 FOR 28.06.2019 REGARDING “RISE IN OZONE LEVELS” RAISED BY SHRI DEEPAK BAIJ(a)	 The monitoring data of ozone in Delhi-NCR is regularly displayed on Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) website on real time basis. The analysis of AQI for Delhi reveals that during last three years (2016-2018), ozone was reported as prominent pollutant for 95 days in Delhi and 11, 48, 8 and 49 days in Faridabad, Gurugram, Ghaziabad and Noida respectively. Data is attached as Annexure -1.(b), (d) & (e) Rise in ozone levels is considered as one of the triggering factors for respiratory ailments and associated diseases. Irritation can occur in respiratory system causing coughing, and uncomfortable sensation in chest. It may reduce lung function and make breathing difficult.  There are no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct correlation of mortality/morbidity exclusively due to rise in ozone levels.   (c) Ozone is a secondary pollutant which is formed through atmospheric reactions and responsible factors are high temperature and emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) & Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Major sources for NOx include vehicles, power plants and burning of fuel/waste. VOCs are emitted from vehicles, petrol pumps, use of solvents and burning of waste. The Government has taken several measures to control NOx and VOCs emissions which include the following:•	Leapfrogging from BS-IV to BS-VI fuel standards since 1st April, 2018 in NCT of Delhi and from by 1st April, 2020 in the rest of the country which will reduce NOx emissions of heavy duty diesel vehicles by 88.5% in comparison to BS-IV vehicles.•	Installation of vapour recovery systems in petrol pumps.•	Introduction of cleaner / alternate fuels like gaseous fuel (CNG, LPG etc.), ethanol  blending. •	Promotion of public transport and improvements in roads and building of more bridges to ease congestion on roads.•	Operationalisation of  Eastern Peripheral Expressway & Western Peripheral Expressway to divert non-destined traffic from Delhi which results in smooth traffic flow and reduces emissions.•	Streamlining the issuance of Pollution Under Control Certificate.•	Banning of burning of biomass and garbage.•	3 Waste-to-Energy (W-t-E) plants are currently operational in Delhi with a total capacity of 5100 Tonnes Per Day(TPD).•	Notifications of 6 waste management rules covering solid waste, plastic waste, e-waste, bio-medical waste, C&D waste and hazardous wastes issued in 2016.•	Notification of stricter emission norms for power plants.•	Closure of Badarpur thermal power plant in Delhi.*****
