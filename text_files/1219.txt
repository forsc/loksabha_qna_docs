The National Environment Policy intended to be a guide to action: in regulatory reform, programmes and projects for environmental conservation; and review and enactment of legislation, by agencies of the Central, State and Local Governments. The principal objectives of the policy were to protect and conserve critical ecological systems and resources; ensure equitable access to and judicious use of environmental resources; integrate environmental concerns into policies, plans, programmes and projects; apply the principles of good governance, etc.The Ministry has issued sectoral policy statements on areas of Environment Impact Assessment, Hazardous Substance Management, Climate Change, Biodiversity, Coastal Regulatory Zone etc. in response to emerging challenges, from time to time. The Government has framed Rules, Regulations and issued Directions while addressing the sustainable development concerns to create harmony between economic, social and environmental needs of the country. India has also played a pivotal role in significant and major international initiatives concerned with environment and is a signatory to key multilateral agreements and has emerged as a global leader in spearheading the interests of the developing nations, at all fora, making a positive contribution to international efforts. Based on the dynamics of the environment sector and global and domestic regulatory and jurisprudence issues, the policies made by the Government for the environment sector are judiciously formulated, periodically reviewed, suitably revised and updated, from time to time following a process of wide consultations and taking into account global best practices and duly notified, as and when the need arises.(d)	The provisions of the National Environment Policy are applicable to the entire country, including Delhi/ NCR. ***
