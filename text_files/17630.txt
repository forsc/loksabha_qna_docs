                                                        (a)  to (d):	 The Unorganised Workers’ Social Security Act, 2008 does not make any distinction between ‘informal’ and ‘unorganised’ sector. As per the definition given in the Act, “unorganised sector” means an enterprise owned by individuals or self-employed workers and engaged in the production or sale of goods or providing service of any kind whatsoever, and where the enterprise employs workers, the number of such workers is less than ten.  Contd..2/-::  2  ::	As per the Economic Survey 2019-20, estimated total employment in the country on the basis of Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), 2017-18 is 47.13 crore, out of which 9.05 crore is in the organised sector and 38.07 crore is in the unorganised sector.  As per PLFS 2018-19, the female worker participation ratio for age-group (15 years and above) as per usual status is 23.3 per cent. This includes both organised and unorganised sector.Pradhan  Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY) was  launched  by the Ministry of Labour & Employment in 2016 with  the  objective  to incentivise  employers  for  creation  of  formal  employment  with  social  security  benefits. Under  the  scheme, Government  of  India  is  paying  Employer’s  full  contribution  i.e. 12% towards   EPF  and  EPS  both ( as  admissible  from  time  to  time)  for  a   period  of  three  years to  the  new  employees  through EPFO w.e.f. 01.04.2018.  The terminal date for registration of beneficiary through establishment was 31st March, 2019. The beneficiaries registered upto 31st March, 2019 will continue to receive the benefit for three years from the date of registration under the scheme. As on 14th September, 2020, around 1.21 crore beneficiaries have been benefitted through 1.52 lakh establishments.******
