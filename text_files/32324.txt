NALSA does not make any distinction regarding the category of cases in which the assistance is sought by any person belonging to the SC and ST categories and provide all sort of assistance to the said categories.   The details of the persons belonging to SC and  ST category were benefited through legal services under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, during the financial year 2020-21 and the current financial year 2021-22 (upto October, 2021) are as under:-Years	No. of persons belongs to SC category were benefited through Legal Services.
