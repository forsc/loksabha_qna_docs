Prior to discontinuation of services to prevent spread of COVID-19 pandemic, Thawe was being served by 01 pair of Mail/Express and 10 pairs of Passenger services. Similarly, Gopalganj was being served by 01 pair of Mail/Express and 02 pairs of Passenger services. These services provide connectivity to the passengers of Thawe/Gopalganj inter alia for destinations like Siwan, Patliputra, Gorakhpur, Lucknow, etc. Further, passengers of Thawe/Gopalganj may also avail changeover at Siwan (28 kilometre from Thawe). However, at present, no proposal for stoppage of additional trains at Thawe/Gopalganj and/or introduction of additional trains from Thawe/Gopalganj is under consideration.For extension of 12571/72 Anand Vihar (T)-Gorakhpur Humsafar Express and 12555/56 Hisar-Gorakhpur Gorakhdham Express upto Chhapra, demands, including that from the Hon’ble Member of Parliament, have been received. These demands have been examined, but have not been found operationally feasible, at present.(f): Owing to operational constraints, at present, there is no proposal for diversion of 12565/66 Darbhanga-New Delhi Bihar Sampark Kranti Express, 15909/10 Dibrugarh-Lalgarh Avadh-Assam Express, 22411/12 Naharlagun-Anand Vihar(T) AC Express and/or any other Mail/Express train via Thawe/Gopalganj.
