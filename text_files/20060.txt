ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI SOM PARKASH)(a) & (b):       	No Sir. As per Industry estimates, the glass industry melts approximately 20,000 tonnes of glass per day.  The share of glass for vaccine vials is estimated to be approximately 1%.  Thus, the demand for glass for vaccine vials has had minor effect on overall demand for glass. (c):       	Total exports and imports of glass and glassware from India in the last three months are at Annexure. (d) & (e):  	To fully overcome the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a need to maintain caution and take all necessary measures to promote COVID-19 appropriate behavior and ensure wearing of face masks/ face shields.  As such, this question does not arise.*****ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (c) OF THE LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1396  FOR ANSWER ON 10.02.2021Exports and Imports of Glass and Glassware(Value in US$ million)Period- September-November, 2020a.
