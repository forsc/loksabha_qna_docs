                                                        ANSWERMINSITER OF CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS (SHRI D. V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a) Yes, Sir. IPFT has developed different bio-pesticide formulations as safe anduser & environment friendly alternative to chemical pesticides for controllingvarious insects in seed spices crops. The Research & Development work isbeing carried out in collaboration with Indian Council of Agricultural Research(ICAR)- National Research Centre for Seed Spices (NRCSS), Ajmer. Theformulation development work being done by IPFT and bio-efficacy studies onseed spices crops were conducted by ICAR-NRCSS.(b) The following bio-botanical pesticide formulations have been developed:(i) Verticillium lecanii Suspension Concentrate (SC):The technology for the preparation of water based Suspension Concentrateformulation of bio-pesticide Verticillium lecanii, an entomo-pathogenic funguswas developed. In the bio-efficacy studies, these formulation was found veryeffective against Aphis craccivora- pest of fenugreek; Myzus persicae andAphis gossypii- pest of cumin; Hyadaphis corianderi- pest of coriander. Theformulation offers various advantages over chemical pesticides such as goodbio-efficacy, non-phytotoxicity, safe for non-target organisms and environmentand residue free crop.(ii) Shisham Leaves extract based Oil dispersion (OD) formulation:Oil dispersion (OD) formulation of Sisham (Dalbergia sissoo) leaf extract hasbeen developed under this collaborative research. In the bio-efficacy studies,this formulation is found effective in a field assay against Aphids of spicecrops like Hyadaphis coriandri in coriander and Myzus persicae in fenugreek.The formulation is free from chemical insecticides and organic solvents andsafe to human, non-target organisms and environment.(c) Patents have been filed for the preparation of Verticillium lecanii SuspensionConcentrate and Shisham Leaves extract based Oil dispersion formulations.These technologies are available to industries for commercialization. Thenew product needs to be registered with Central Insecticide Board prior tocommercialization. IPFT is making efforts for popularizing the use of biopesticidesfor controlling different agricultural insects. Recently, one-dayworkshop and Scientist-Farmers interaction has been organized at ICARDirectorateof Rape seed- Mustard Research, Bharatpur (Rajasthan) on 29thJanuary, 2021. Under this meet the Scientists of both institutions explainedthe use of extracts from locally available botanicals like Sisham leaves andNeem seeds to farmers for controlling various insects. The bio-botanical zerobudgetingformulations may be effectively applied for minimization of pesticideresidue in crops and to promote organic farming.*****
