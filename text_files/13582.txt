ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): Government has launched Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) on 21.10.2016 to stimulate regional air connectivity by making it affordable. RCS-UDAN has been prepared in extensive consultations with State Governments and airlines. Promoting affordability of regional air connectivity is envisioned under RCS by supporting Selected Airline Operators (SAOs) through concessions by Central Government, State Governments/UTs and airport operators to reduce the cost of airline operations on regional routes and financial support (Viability Gap Funding or VGF) to meet the gap, if any, between the cost of airline operations and expected revenues on such RCS routes. Central Government and State Governments share Viability Gap Funding (VGF) in the ratio of 80:20, whereas for the States in North-Eastern region / Union Territories (UTs) the ratio is 90:10. RCS-UDAN is a market driven scheme. Airlines undertake assessment of demand and nature of supply required on particular routes and lead the process under RCS. After three rounds of bidding, the Implementing Agency, the Airports Authority of India (AAI),  has awarded 688 valid RCS routes. Under the scheme, routes connecting Amravati, Aurangabad, Jalgaon, Kolhapur, Nanded, Nasik and Solapur have been awarded to SAOs in Maharashtra .;
