ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND EARTH SCIENCES(DR. JITENDRA SINGH)??????? ?? ???????????? ??? ?????? ??????? ??  ????? ?????? (???????? ??????)  (??. ???????? ????)(a)   Yes, Sir. The Government of India, is aware about the huge strength of science students in Maharashtra having scientific acumen/approach.  This is revealed from the participation of students from Maharashtra in schemes and programs run for students, as detailed below:-In order to attract young talent towards pursuing scientific career, the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India  is implementing ‘Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE)’, an umbrella scheme to communicate excitement of creative pursuit of science to students. The scheme also aims to build the required critical human resource pool for strengthening and expanding the Research & Development (R&D) base.Under this umbrella INSPIRE Awards MANAK (Million Minds Augmenting National Aspiration and Knowledge) attracts talented school students at an early age of 10-15 years studying in Class 6-10 to pursue science. One lakh ideas from these students are eligible for INSPIRE Award of Rs. 10000/- each.  In last three years 12,176 students from Maharashtra were given INSPIRE Awards MANAK, which reflects the innovation and creative potential of school students from Maharashtra.INSPIRE Internship provides exposure to top 1% students from Class X Board by organizing Science Camps during summer or winter thus presents opportunity of interaction with Science icons from India and abroad, including Nobel Laureates, to experience the joy of scientific pursuit. During 2017-20, 3500 students from Maharashtra participated in these camps.Another component under INSPIRE, Scholarship for Higher Education (SHE) aims to encourage meritorious students to study basic and natural sciences in Bachelor in Science (B. Sc) and Masters in Science (M.Sc) through attractive scholarship and mentorship opportunities. The selections under SHE is based on performance (top 1%) in Class XII examinations of State/Central School Examination Boards and in selected national level competitive examinations like IIT-JEE, etc. During last three years (2018-21), 4631 students from Maharashtra received SHE scholarship, which reflects the merit potential of science students from Maharashtra.During the year 2020, about 1300 school students from Maharashtra participated in National Children Science Congress, organized by Department of Science & Technology, to exhibit their creativity and innovativeness and particularly their ability to solve a societal problem experienced locally, using the method of science.In order to encourage students for career development in the area of Biotechnology, Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India, is supporting 39 Colleges under Star College Scheme in Maharashtra.‘JIGYASA’ is another major initiative for bringing scientists and teachers for nurturing young minds by Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), Ministry of Science and Technology. This program envisages opening up the national scientific facilities to schoolchildren including students from Maharashtra, thus enabling CSIR scientific knowledge base and facilities to be utilized by them.  Various activities such as Laboratory Visit; Popular Lecture Series; Summer Vacation Programmes; Scientists as Teachers and Teachers as Scientists; Teachers’ Workshop; Student Residential Programme; Visits of Scientists to schools; Lab specific activities/Onsite experiments and many more are being conducted on regular basis. (b) & (c):  Presently, the Government does not propose to set up a Technology Development Centre in Maharashtra as there is no  scheme for setting up Technology Development Centres.*****
