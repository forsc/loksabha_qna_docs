                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):	No. As per the findings of the third party assisted Nationwide Milk Safety and Quality Survey conducted by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) in 2018, 93% of the samples (5976 out of 6432) were found to be safe for human consumption. 41% samples, though  found safe, were, however, deficient in  quality parameters [low fat or low SNF (Solid  Not Fat)] or both.  (b):	As per findings of the survey, presence of Aflatoxin M1 residues beyond permissible limits were observed in 368 out of 6432 samples constituting 5.7% of the samples. Amongst the top three States with highest levels of Aflatoxin M1 residues are Tamil Nadu (88 out of 551 samples), Delhi (38 out of 262 samples) and Kerala (37 out of 187 samples).  (c):	 In order to ensure the availability of safe food products including milk and milk products to the consumers and for keeping a check on adulteration, Food Safety Commissioners of States/UTs have been advised from time to time to keep a strict vigil by regularly drawing food samples from all sources viz. manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers and to take strict action against the offenders under the provisions of FSS Act, 2006. They have also been advised to carry out enforcement drive for 3 months during which samples of milk should be drawn from all cities & towns, both of raw milk as well as processed milk, with focus on areas where samples were found to be unsafe during the survey. FSSAI, vide Order dated 13th August, 2019  has directed that a food business holding Central License and falling under 6 high risk categories, including dairy products and analogues excluding products of food category 2.0 (Fats and oils, and fat emulsion),  shall get its business audited by a recognised auditing agency at intervals specified by the Food Authority regarding adherence to  hygiene and  sanitary requirements as specified in Schedule 4 of Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration) Regulations, 2011.FSSAI has recently announced a policy for adoption of Rapid Analytical Food Testing (RAFT) Kit/Equipment/Method  for regulatory purpose (either on field, in laboratory or both) which includes kits for analysis of milk including adulterations. In cases where samples are found to be non-conforming to the provisions of FSS Act, 2006 , Rules and Regulations made thereunder, penal action  is being  taken against the defaulting Food Business Operators as per the provisions of FSS Act, 2006, Rules and Regulations made thereunder.
