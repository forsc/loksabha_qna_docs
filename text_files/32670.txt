Ministry of Railways (MoR) has formulated a Participative Policy-2012 for providing rail connectivity to Ports, Mines, cluster of industries etc. in partnership with interested stakeholders. Several Coal Companies, Ports, cluster of industries etc. have come forward to participate under this policy. State Governments/Local bodies/Government Companies/Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) are also participating as stakeholder and investors for the development of new lines/gauge conversion project under this participative policy of MoR. In all such Projects, train operation continues to remain with Railway to ensure seamless operation. The projects undertaken under Participative Policy have been found to be quite successful in Railways, proving beneficial to all stakeholders like Ports, Coal Companies, cluster of industries and Associated State Governments, especially in providing last mile rail connectivity to many ports and industrial clusters. Till now, 14 such projects have been completed and 10 projects are under implementation.****
