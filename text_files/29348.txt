Statement referred to in reply to parts (a) & (b) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 67 asked by Shri Girish Chandra to be answered on 02nd December, 2021 regarding “Average Price of Petroleum Products”.(a) & (b): Prices of petrol and diesel are market-determined with effect from 26.06.2010 and 19.10.2014 respectively. Since then, the Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) have been taking appropriate decision on pricing of petrol and diesel on the basis of international product prices and other market conditions. The OMCs have increased and decreased the prices of petrol and diesel according to changes in international prices and rupee dollar exchange rate. The Average price of Indian Basket of Crude oil has risen approximately 313% from April, 2020 to October, 2021 ($19.90/bbl to $82.11/bbl).Prices of LPG in the country are based on Saudi Contract Price (CP), the benchmark for international prices of LPG. However, for domestic LPG the Government continues to modulate the effective price to consumer to insulate the common man from rise in international prices. Saudi CP has risen approximately 238% from April, 2020 to October, 2021 (236 USD to 797 USD).The average retail selling price of petrol, diesel and domestic LPG at Delhi and PDS kerosene at Mumbai during last three years and current year as on 30th June is given as under:Year	Petrol	Diesel	PDS Kerosene	Domestic LPG RSP 	Rs./Litre	Rs./14.2 Kg cylinder2018-19	75.37	68.22	27.05	768.122019-20	72.69	65.78	33.73	694.732020-21	80.84	73.58	25.39	695.152021-22 (till 30th June)	93.10	83.67	37.70	809.00The contribution to Central and State exchequer during last three years and current year, year-wise is given below:								        	   (Rs./Crores)Year	Total Contribution of Petroleum Sector to Exchequer	Share of Central Exchequer	Share of State Exchequer2018-19	5,75,632	60%	40%2019-20	5,55,370	60%	40%2020-21	6,72,719	68%	32%(Apr-Sep) 2021-22 (P)	3,49,923	62%	38%	Based on data from 16 major oil & gas companiesx-x-x-x-x
