                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH ANDFAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARTI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (e): Till 26th July 2021, causality assessment for 179 serious and severe AEFI cases has been approved by the National AEFI Committee of which only one death case from Maharashtra was found to be associated with COVID 19 vaccine. This was a case of anaphylaxis which can occur with any medicinal product including vaccines and can be fatal.Covaxin at present is not part of WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) and is not yet included in the list of approved vaccines for the COVAX vaccine distribution programme. All documents required for Emergency Use Listing (EUL) have been submitted by Bharat Biotech International Ltd. (BBIL) to WHO as of 9th July 2021. WHO will examine the technical data provided by BBIL for taking a final decision on the issue. Due to COVID-19 pandemic normal international travel services remain suspended. International air travel is taking place through special arrangements, including air bubble and Vande Bharat Mission. Such travel is not directly linked to the possession of vaccination certificates. Further, at present, there is no multilateral protocol on the travel of COVID-19 vaccinated people. Most countries require a negative COVID-19 test report, along with compliance with country specific COVID protocols.While there have been multilateral discussions, including under the framework of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), regarding COVID-19 vaccination certificates, no multilateral arrangements in this regard have been reached so far. India has been part of ongoing discussion to ensure that Indian manufactured vaccines are recognized in any multilateral arrangement. India is also engaging with countries for mutual recognition of vaccination certificates.
