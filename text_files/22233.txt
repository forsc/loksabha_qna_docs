THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR HEAVY INDUSTRIES & PUBLIC ENTERPRISES(SHRI ARJUN RAM MEGHWAL) (a)&(b): Department of Public Enterprises (DPE)  has issued guidelines on 14th June,2018  on time bound closure of sick / loss making CPSEs and disposal of their movable and immovable assets. Introducing a revised mechanism to ensure timely closure of sick and loss-making units has been announced by the Hon’ble Union Finance Minister in the Budget Speech 2021-22. Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) being the nodal department for Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) will formulate the revised mechanism for timely closure of sick and loss-making CPSEs and will notify the revised mechanism on completion of due process.(c) to (e ): The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), Ministry of Finance is the nodal Department for disinvestment and privatization of CPSEs. DIPAM has informed that since 2016, Government has ‘in-principle’ approved strategic disinvestment of 35 CPSEs and subsidiaries/Units/Joint Ventures. Out of which, 4 CPSEs viz. Scooters India Ltd, Uttar Pradesh., Hindustan Fluorocarbons Ltd. Telangana, Bharat Pumps and Compressors Ltd. Uttar Pradesh and Hindustan Prefab Ltd. New Delhi are identified for closure. The main reason for failure of strategic disinvestment of the above CPSEs is due to limited investor response/ failure to get the bids, etc. * * *
