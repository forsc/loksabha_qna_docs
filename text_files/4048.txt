                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		 	  (SHRI NARENDRA  SINGH TOMAR) (a) to (d):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 334  DUE FOR REPLY ON 16TH JULY, 2019.(a) & (b):	 Government has been implementing ‘Soil Health Card’ (SHC) scheme since 2015 to assist State Governments in soil testing and providing soil health cards to all farm holdings in the country regularly in a cycle of 2 years. Soil health cards provide information to farmers on nutrient status of their soil along with recommendations on appropriate dosage of nutrients to be applied for improving soil health and it’s fertility. The Samples are collected at a grid of 2.5 ha in irrigated area and 10 ha in un-irrigated area. 12 Soil Health parameters viz. primary nutrients (NPK); secondary nutrient (S); micronutrients (B, Zn, Mn, Fe, & Cu); and others (pH, EC & OC) are analyzed for comprehensiveness.  During the 1st Cycle (2015-2017) of the scheme, 10.73 crore soil health cards and during the 2nd Cycle (2017-19), 10.69 crore soil health cards have been distributed by State Governments to farmers across the country.    Under Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme, during current year (2019-20) soil sample collection has been taken up at individual farm holding with farmer’s participation instead of sample collection at grids. This will result in acceptance of SHC by farmers. This has been taken up on pilot basis, one village per block for farm holding based sample collection & testing. Organization of larger number of demonstrations up to a maximum number of 100 demonstrations (1 ha each) for each adopted village for prescribing SHC based application of fertilizers.(c):        As per information received from states, presently 7949 soil testing laboratories are functioning in the country including Bihar.  State/UT-wise number of static, mobile, mini and village level soil testing laboratories (functional) including Bihar is given in Annexure-I. Contd…2/--2-(d):	  Under the Soil Health Management (SHM) scheme, Government is providing financial assistance to States for setting up / strengthening of various types of soil testing laboratories according to their requirement. So far 411 new static Soil Testing Labs (STLs), 100 new mobile STLs, 8752 mini STLs and 1562 village level STLs have been sanctioned under the scheme since 2014-15. This includes 6 mobile STLs and 28 village level STLs sanctioned to Bihar. Out of these sanctioned labs, 129 new static Soil Testing Labs (STLs), 86 new mobile STLs, 6498 mini STLs and 17 village level STLs are already established.
