                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (f): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.******STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (f) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 1882 BY DR. PRITAM GOPINATHRAO MUNDE, SHRI VINAYAK RAUT AND DR. SHRIKANT EKNATH SHINDE TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 03.07.2019 REGARDING STATION REDEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME(a)	to (f) : Railways had invited bids on modified bid challenge method for 23 stations for redevelopment of stations in February 2017.  Bids were received for two stations only, viz. Jammu Tawi and Kozhikode stations.  A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed on 30.06.2017 between Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA) and National Buildings Construction Corporation Limited (NBCC) for redevelopment of railway stations.  As per this MOU, Contracts for redevelopment have been awarded for Gomtinagar, Charbagh (Uttar Pradesh) and Puducherry (Union Territory of Puducherry) stations in 2018-19.  Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation Limited (IRSDC) have awarded contracts for Habibganj (Madhya Pradesh) in the year 2016 and Gandhinagar (Gujarat) in the year 2017 stations.  IRSDC has also received bids for Anand Vihar, Bijwasan, Chandigarh, Gwalior and Nagpur stations.   Bids for Nellore and Surat were invited by NBCC and IRSDC respectively.  However, no Bid was received.  Bid for Surat has been re-invited.Redevelopment of stations is planned through leveraging commercial development of vacant land and air space in and around railway stations. The revenues realised from real estate development should be sufficient to cover the entire cost of station redevelopment after meeting the full expenditure on real estate development and maintenance obligations.  Since all railway stations may not be commercially viable station, the Cost neutrality in certain cases may have to be seen over a basket of projects on an all India basis.Ministry of Railways on case to case basis, may designate Zonal Railway, IRSDC, RLDA or any other Central Government agencies as the Project Development Agency.Ministry of Railways though various agencies is undertaking techno-economic feasibility studies of Railway stations.  Based on the outcome of the feasibility studies, stations are planned to be taken up for redevelopment in phases, especially the stations located in major cities, pilgrimage centers and important tourist destinations.  Station redevelopment projects are first of its kind and complex in nature and require detailed techno-financial feasibility studies and statutory clearances from local bodies etc.  Therefore, no time-frame can be indicated at this stage.*****
