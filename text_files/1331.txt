ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE  IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO) (a) & (b) The country’s economic growth, rise in per capita income, and technological innovations coupled with high obsolescence rate of electronic and electrical equipmentshas resulted in increase in the rate of generation of e-waste. Disposal of e-waste from such electronic devices, without processing it in an environmentally sound manner, affects human health and environment including soil and ground water.In order to ensure safe disposal of e-waste the Government has notified E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016 and has further made amendments in March, 2018 for its effective implementation. The provisions of these Rules include extended producer responsibility, setting up of producer responsibility organizations and e-waste exchange to facilitate collection and recycling, assigning specific responsibility to bulk consumers of electronic products for safe disposal and other measures which include responsibility of producers of electronic and electrical products for collection and channelizing of electronic waste. The Rules provide for simplified permission process for setting up of dismantling and recycling facilities through single authorization by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). State Governments have been entrusted with the responsibility for earmarking industrial space for e-waste dismantling and recycling facilities, to undertake industrial skill development and establish measures for protection of health and safety of workers engaged in dismantling and recycling facilities of e-waste.(c) So far, no comprehensive inventorization of e-waste generation in the country has been done. However, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in 2005 estimated 1.47 lakh ton of e-waste in the country. As per the United Nations University report, “The Global E-Waste Monitor 2017”, 20 lakh ton of e-waste generation was reported in the country for year 2016.(d) & (e)The import of waste including e-waste is regulated under Hazardous and Other Waste (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016. As per the Rules, no import of waste for dumping or for disposal in the country is permitted. The Ministry has not granted any permission for import of e-waste into the country for the above purpose.****
