Implementation of the spirit and intent of the Policy is the most criticalmatter.

The policy unequivocally endorses and envisionsa substantial increase in public investment in education by both the Central government and allState Governments. The Centre and the States will work together to increase the public investmentin Education sector to reach 6% of GDP at the earliest.(f): NEP 2020 aims to ensure that no child loses any opportunity to learn and excel because ofthe circumstances of birth or background.
