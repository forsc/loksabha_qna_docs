( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a)   to (d):	Normally Rabi sowing starts from the month of October and as per the weekly report received from the States, the total area  sown in Rabi season as on date (29.01.2021) is 684.59 lakh ha as compared to last year’s area sown of 665.59 lakh ha, thereby indicating an increase of 19.01 lakh ha area sown for the current year as compared to last year. Government of India has not received any information of loss to the farmers due to closed borders barring them to sell their produce to national capital. Hence, the question of compensation for loss of produce does not arise.********
