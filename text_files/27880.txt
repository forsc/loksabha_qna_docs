NARAYANASWAMY)(a) to (c): As per the information available on the website of Registrar General of India, numbers of children engaged in the act of Begging (Age up to 19 years) in the State of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Maharashtra are attached at Annexure. These figures are based on Census 2011.(d) to (e): Yes Sir. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has formulated a scheme “SMILE - Support for Marginalized Individuals for Livelihood and Enterprise”, which includes sub-scheme - ‘Central Sector Scheme for Comprehensive Rehabilitation of persons engaged in the act of Begging’. This scheme covers several comprehensive measures including welfare measures for persons who are engaged in the act of begging. The focus of the scheme is extensively on rehabilitation, provision of medical facilities, counseling, basic documentation, education, skill development, economic linkages and so on. The scheme would be implemented with the support of State/UT Governments/Local Urban Bodies, Voluntary Organizations, Community Based Organizations (CBOs), institutions and others.As per information provided by Ministry of Home Affairs, ''Police'' and ''Public Order'' are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. The responsibilities to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens rest with the respective State Governments. The State Governments are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provisions of laws. However, Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had written to the Railway Board to sensitize their Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Government Railway Police (GRP) personnel to keep vigil on Railway stations to watch out for hapless victims, who could be in the process of being trafficked through Railways. Further, MHA has also requested all States/UTs to sensitize police personnel posted on Bus Depots/Bus Terminals etc to keep a close watch on suspicious activities at such places. MHA has also requested all States/UTs to establish mechanisms for effective inter-state coordination between the law enforcement officers concerned for apprehending and rescuing the victims of trafficking and investigation and prosecution of the offenders.***** AnnexureAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) to (c) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 3469 for answer on 10.08.2021 regarding ‘Child Beggars ’.
