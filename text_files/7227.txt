ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a): Medical treatment facilities to Central Government employees are provided by the Government either by extending the benefits of Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) or through the mechanism under Central Services (Medical Attendance) [CS(MA)] Rules, 1944. In both cases, the Government reimburses to the government employee the cost of hospitalization at empanelled hospitals. In case of OPD treatment, however, the beneficiary does not have to pay anything at CGHS Wellness Centre, whereas the cost of OPD treatment given by Authorised Medical Attendant under CS(MA) Rules, 1944 is reimbursed by the office of the government employee concerned. In case of Central Government Pensioners residing in CGHS areas, medical treatment facilities, both Indoor and Outdoor, are provided by CGHS within parameters of the scheme. Central Government Pensioners residing in non-CGHS covered areas can avail Fixed Medical Allowance every month. They also have the option to avail CGHS facility from the nearest CGHS covered city on payment of requisite subscription. -2-(b):  In 2014, CGHS was operational in 25 cities with 273 Allopathic Wellness Centres. The same is now extended to 71 cities with 328 Allopathic Wellness Centres.  Details are at Annexure. (c) & (d):    There is no separate plan scheme regarding opening of new CGHS Wellness Centre. Hence, no separate budget is provisioned for opening new CGHS Wellness Centres. The expenditure for this purpose is incurred from the overall budget of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare allocated to CGHS.………………
