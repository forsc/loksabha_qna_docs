                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) to (c): Bekal airport does not figure in the tentative list of unserved/underserved airports of Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS)- UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik) Scheme document. An airport/airstrip could be added in the tentative list of RCS airports of the Scheme document, if the State Government requests for the same. RCS-UDAN is a market driven mechanism. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN from time to time.  Moreover, none of the airlines has  submitted any  proposal to operate RCS flights from Bekal airstrip till 4 rounds of bidding under RCS-UDAN. However, if any valid bid is received in future rounds of RCS-UDAN, the same shall be considered as per Scheme document.
