ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):	The latest available National Sample Survey on ‘Migration In India 2007-2008’ was conducted during July 2007 to June 2008 (64th Round). The state-wise proportion of rural migration as per NSS 64th Round report is at Annexure.          Ministry of Rural Development is implementing various rural development schemes for creating employment opportunities, providing access to basic needs and creating rural infrastructure. Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme provides guaranteed wage employment of 100 days in a financial year to a rural household whose adult members are willing to take up manual work. An additional 50 days of wage employment is provided over and above 100 days in the notified drought affected areas or natural calamity affected areas in the country on recommendations of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) is implemented with the objective of providing self-employment to the members of the rural poor families. The Department is implementing Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM) aimed at developing 300 rural growth clusters called ‘Rurban Clusters’, which have latent potential for growth, in all States and UTs. The Objective of the Mission is to bridge the rural urban divide and to reduce migration from rural to urban areas and eventually to facilitate reverse migration. Besides, Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G) and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) are also implemented to provide basic needs and developing rural infrastructure for improving living conditions of rural masses to reduce distress migration from rural areas to cities. The findings of independent studies conducted by the Ministry of Rural Development indicate that out-migration from villages has gone down due to implementation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS.*****
