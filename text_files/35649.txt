                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI PANKAJ CHAUDHARY)(a)to (e): Prices of petrol and diesel have been market –determined with effect from 26.6.2010 and 19.10.2014 respectively and are linked to the prices of respective products in the international market. Since then, the Public Sector OMCs take appropriate decisions on pricing of petrol and diesel. The government has put in place a policy framework on FDI which is transparent, predictable and easily comprehensible.  The Government does not foresee any effect on its push towards renewable energy even after the disinvestment of BPCL. ****
