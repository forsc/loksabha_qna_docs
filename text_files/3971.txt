KISHAN REDDY)(a) & (b): Such specific data is not maintained by the National Crime Records Bureau. (c) & (d): To address the issue of victims of such cross-border trafficking, the Government has taken several initiatives: i)	India has signed bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for Prevention of Human Trafficking with United Arab Emirates (UAE) on 25.1.2017. This MoU aims to  enhance  bilateral  cooperation  on  the issue of prevention, rescue, recovery and repatriation related to human trafficking, especially women and children. --2--L.S.US.Q.NO. 3644 FOR 16.07.2019ii)	India has ratified the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organized Crime (UNCTOC) in 2011 and its Protocols namely  (a) Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children and (b) Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air.iii)	In order to promote the welfare and protection of women workers, the Ministry of External Affairs has taken measures to restrict the recruitment of Emigration Check Required (ECR) passport holding Indian female workers only through seven State Government recruiting agencies w.e.f. 2nd August, 2016 to avoid their harassment by foreign employers. The Foreign Employers who intend to recruit Indian female domestic workers directly, have to register themselves on e-Migrate System with the respective Missions and deposit a bank guarantee equivalent to US$2500/-. The age restriction of 30 years has been made mandatory in respect of all women emigrants emigrating on ECR passport, irrespective of the nature/category of employment. Further, mandatory insurance and medical cover is extended to all Indian workers including women, through Pravasi Bhartiya Bima Yojana (PBBY) who go through e-Migrate after clearance.

ICWF guidelines have been further revised with effect from September 2017 to make them more broad based and expand the scope of welfare measures that can be extended through the fund. These revisions are expected to provide flexibility in swiftly addressing to requests for assistance by overseas Indian nationals, including distressed women. The Mission houses such women workers at its premises as they await completion of their repatriation process by the Deportation Centre.iv)	MHA has issued various advisories to the States and UTs from time to time on preventing and combating human trafficking. These advisories are available at MHA’s website: www.mha.gov.in.  v)	MHA has provided financial assistance to all States for setting up Anti Human Trafficking Units and 332 Anti Human Trafficking Units have been set up in various districts.  ******
