Based on the outcome of these feasibility studies, stations are taken up for redevelopment in phases.           The work of redevelopment is in progress at Gandhinagar and Habibganj railway stations.  Contracts have been awarded for redevelopment of Gomtinagar, Anand Vihar, Bijwasan  and Chandigarh  railway stations.(c): Station redevelopment program, at this scale, is first of its kind and complex in nature and requires detailed techno-financial feasibility studies and various statutory clearances from Urban / local bodies etc.  Therefore, no time-frame can be indicated at this stage.*****
