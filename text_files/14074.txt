ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNINGAND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION(RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a) The Aspirational Districts Programme launched on 5th January 2018 aims to bring transformative changes in the most under-developed districts of India called Aspirational Districts. As the main strategy of the Programme is based on convergence of existing schemes which have their own funding arrangement, large infusion of additional fund is not envisaged. However, in order to foster competitive spirit and for addressing the critical gaps, additional allocation on challenge route is also envisaged. Under this arrangement Purbi Singhbhum has been sanctioned Rs.2.99 crores in the month of January 2020; Khunti Rs. 3 crore in the month of December 2019 and Pakur Rs.4.92 crore in January 2020.(b) As these funds have been sanctioned recently, the projects are under implementation. (c) For Purbi Singhbhum the funds have been released for projects proposed by the District in Health & Nutrition Sector; for Khunti in Education Sector and for Pakur in Health & Nutrition and Education Sectors. As stated above, since the projects of the districts have been sanctioned recently, currently, they are in the initial stage of implementation. ***
