ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) and (b): The Government decided in January, 2013, after due consultation with all the concerned Ministries/Departments of Government of India and with the approval of the prescribed competent authority, to transfer all the schools run by the Central Tibetan Schools Administration (CTSA) to the Department of Education (DoE), Central TibetanAdministration (CTA), or any registered society run by DoE, CTA. Transfer of property of CTSA includes immoveable assets other than land through long term renewable lease, and moveable assets, at book value. In compliance therewith, 55 schools, out of the total 61 schools managed and run by CTSA, have already been transferred to the Sambhota Tibetan Schools Society (STSS), a society registered under the Societies Registration Act of XXI of 1860 and run by DoE, CTA, in three phases during 2013 to 2017. Further, orders for transfer of the remaining 6 schools have also been issued. There does not seem to be any violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) in the matter.(c): CTSA has informed that as per existing practice, no income tax is deducted by CTSA from the pension of their retired employees. The pensioners are expected to pay the income tax on their income from all sources, including pension, individually and file Income Tax Return.(d): CTSA has informed that the Assured Career Progression (ACP) Scheme and the Modified Assured Career Progression (MACP) Scheme have been extended to the Education Officer and Principal Grade-I of CTSA with the approval of the prescribed competent authority.(e): The Indian teaching and non-teaching staffs of the transferred CTSA schools have been suitably absorbed in other Autonomous Bodies under this Department as per the options exercised by them. As the transferred schools are now under the administrative control of STSS, any decision to make appointment against the vacancies in these schools is to be taken by them.(f) and (g) : Government has already taken a decision to transfer all the CTSA schools to CTA.*****
