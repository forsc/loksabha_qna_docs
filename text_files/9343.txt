As per study, the total estimated energy generation potential from urban and Industrial organic waste in India is approximately 5690 MW as on 2017.  (b) So far 96 waste-to-energy projects for generation of electricity based on Urban, industrial, agricultural waste and Municipal Solid Waste have been successfully established in the country.

Poor quality of municipal solid waste,ii).	lack of an efficient mechanism to segregate waste into biodegradable/dry/wet/ carbonaceous materials, etc. componentsiii).	seasonal variations in waste composition and propertiesiv).	high capital and O&M costs of waste-to-energy systems,      v).  lack of indigenous technology,(d) During the last three years, funds to the tune of Rs. 76 crore were allocated under Waste to Energy Programme out of which Rs 32.64 crore were released to various developers for setting up of Waste to Energy projects for generation of Biogas/BioCNG/Power.  In the current year, funds to the tune of Rs.75 crore have been allocated under Waste to Energy and Biomass programmes and Rs.0.82 crore have been released for setting up of Waste to Energy projects for generation of Biogas/BioCNG/Power till date.In addition to above, Under the National Clean Energy Fund (NCEF), The Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance in its 11th meeting of the Inter-Ministerial Group (IMG) held on 25th September, 2014 has approved a grant of Rs. 120 Crore as Viability Gap Funding to M/s East Delhi Waste Processing Company Limited (EDWPCL) for setting up of 12 MW Waste to Energy Plant in Ghazipur Delhi.

In order to recover energy from waste/effluent generated from industries distillery, paper and pulp, pharmaceutical industries etc and urban/rural areas, 199 projects with cumulative capacity of 329.43 MWeq have been set up so far meeting objectives of the scheme. The technologies for the recovery of Biogas/Power from these wastes are well established and such plants work with supply of sufficient & quality feedstock whose Operation & Maintenance is kept properly on regular basis work well.*****
