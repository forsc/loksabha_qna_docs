                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)& (b)Rapid urbanization creates pressure on natural resources and environment. Sustainable management of urban environment requires collective efforts of Central and State Government. According to the report  titled “Status of Water Supply, Wastewater Generation and Treatment in Class-I Cities & Class-II Towns of India” published by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)  out of 38254 MLD of sewage generated by class I cities and class II towns, only 11787 MLD was  treated. CPCB reassessed sewage generation and treatment capacity for urban population of India for the year 2015. Estimated sewage generation was61948 MLD approximately and sewage treatment capacity developed so far was only 23277 MLD.Sewage generation for 46 million plus cities is estimated to 33099 MLD. The water quality of recipient water bodies in the catchment of each million plus city are deteriorating. Brief status depicting sewage generation, treatment capacity and water quality status is attached at Annexure-I.CPCB had conducted a study on comprehensive environmental assessment for 88 industrial areas across the country during 2009-10 and rated these industrial areas on concept of Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI). Out of 88 industrial areas, 43 industrial areas with CEPI score 70 and above were identified as Critically Polluted Areas (CPAs). State-wise details of CPAs are provided at the Annexure II.(c)	Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), had imposed temporary moratorium on consideration of new projects /expansion of existing projects for environmental clearance in 43 Critically Polluted Areas, vide Office Memorandum, dated 13.01.2010. As per the direction of MoEF&CC, remedial Action Plans were formulated by concerned State Pollution Control Boards for the CPAs falling under their jurisdiction. The progress made in the implementation of these action plans were periodically reviewed by the Local Committees and it is noted that the effective implementation of these action plans helped in the restoration of environmental quality of these 43 areas.  Based on progress in implementation of action plan moratorium has been lifted. The areas where there was no improvement in the environmental quality, the moratorium continued.  MoEF&CC  alsodevised a “Mechanism for environmental management in critically/severely polluted areas (CPAs/SPAs) for consideration of projects listed as Red/Orange categories”. Protocols to be followed by the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) /Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) for improvement of environmental quality in the Critically/Severely Polluted Areas (CPAs/SPAs) are provided. Stringent emission and effluent discharge have been stipulated for improvement of environmental quality. For consideration of new proposals and expansion activities list in red and orange category located in the CPAs/SPAs stringent conditions have been recommended. Any project or activity in Category ‘B1’ are being appraised at the Central Level, if located in whole or in part with in 5 km from the boundary of CPAs or SPAs. Proposals located in CPAs and SPAs are examined by the sectoral Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) during scoping/appraisal based on the EPI scores of Air/Water/Land Environment published by CPCB from time to time. In such proposals, appropriate mitigation measures for environment possessing higher CEPI score are made by EAC in the form of recommendations/decision. These recommendations are explicitly mentioned in the Terms of Reference/Environmental Clearance letter and are ensured by the Member Secretary concerned.*****
