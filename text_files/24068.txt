ANSWER




MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI)(a):	The Ministry of Education implements  scheme for providing Education to Madarsas/Minorities (SPEMM) since 2014-15 with revised guidelines. SPEMM is an Umbrella scheme which comprises two previously existing schemes namely, Scheme for Providing Quality Education in Madarsas (SPQEM) and Infrastructural Development in Minority Institutions (IDMI).The Objectives of SPQEM is to encourage traditional institutions like Madarsas and Maktabs by giving financial assistance to engage teachers to teach Science, Mathematics, Social Studies, Hindi and English in their curriculum so that academic proficiency for classes I-XII is attainable for children studying in these institutions. The process of modernization of traditional Madarsas and Maktabs is voluntary.The objectives of IDMI is to facilitate education of minorities by augmenting and strengthening school infrastructure in Minority Institutions (elementary/secondary/senior secondary schools) in order to expand facilities for formal education to children of minority communities.In addition, the Department of School Education and Literacy (DoSEL), Ministry of Education implements Samagra Shiksha scheme and one of the major objectives of the scheme is bridging of gender and social category gaps including minorities at all levels of school education. The Scheme reaches out to children including those belonging to SC, ST, minority communities and transgender. The scheme has  also  given  attention  to urban  deprived  children, children affected by periodic migration, and children living in remote and scattered habitations. The Integrated Scheme also focuses on the identified Special Focus Districts (SFDs) on the basis of adverse performance on various indicators of enrolment, retention, and gender parity, as well as concentration of SC, ST and minority communities.The Ministry of Minority Affairs implements below mentioned  schemes for educational empowerment of six notified minority communities  i.e. Christians, Sikhs, Jains, Muslims, Buddhists and Parsis  under which approx 4.50 crore minority students belonging to economically weaker section  from the six centrally notified minority communities have been benefitted since 2014-15.  The details of the schemes are given below:   (i)	Scholarship Schemes: Pre-Matric Scholarship, Post-Matric Scholarship and Merit-cum-Means based Scholarship.(ii)	In addition, the Maulana Azad Education Foundation implements Begum Hazrat Mahal National Scholarship for meritorious girl  students,  belonging to the minority communities and whose total annual family income is less than Rs.2 lakh, and who are studying in Classes IX to XII. (iii)	 Maulana Azad National Fellowship Scheme provides financial assistance to students from notified minority communities, to pursue higher education such as M.Phil and Ph.D.(iv)	Padho Pardesh: A scheme for providing interest subsidy on educational loans for overseas studies to enable students from minority communities to pursue higher education.(v)	Naya Savera: The Free Coaching and Allied Scheme aims to assist students and candidates from minority communities, and whose total annual family income is less than Rs. 6 lakh,  to  qualify in examinations for admission in technical and professional courses as well as to succeed in competitive examinations  for recruitment to Group ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ services and other equivalent posts under the Central & State Governments including PSUs etc. (vi)  Educational Loan Scheme of National Minorities Development Finance Corporation (NMDFC):  NMDFC a PSU under the Ministry implements Educational Loan Scheme with the objective to facilitate job oriented education for the eligible persons belonging to minorities. Loan is available for ‘technical and professional courses’ for which loan up to Rs. 20.00 lakh for domestic courses and upto Rs. 30.00 lakh for courses abroad is provided.   During 2014-15 to 2019-20, loan to the tune of Rs. 197.35 Crore has been sanctioned to 15, 563 minority students.  Besides, there is another Scheme namely Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram (PMJVK), which is implemented by the Ministry, in 1300 identified Minority Concentration Areas (MCAs) of the country with the objective to develop socio-economic assets and basic amenities in these areas.  The thrust of  PMJVK is to allocate at least 80% of the resources to education, health and skill development sectors of which at least 33-40% are allocated for women centric projects.  The type of education projects sanctioned under PMJVK includes new school buildings, student hostels, residential schools, smart classrooms, computer labs, Libraries, Degree colleges, ITIs, Polytechnics, Unani Medical College, Nursing College,.etc.The Ministry, under PMJVK  w.e.f.  2014-15 to 2020-21 has approved projects of Rs. 8924.02 Crore in the education sector. The projects include 165 - Residential Schools, 32 - Degree Colleges, 646 - Student Hostels, 6 - Navodayas Vidyalayas, 95 - ITIs, 13 - Polytechnics, 22,908 - Additional Classrooms (ACRs), 356 - ACR blocks, 5,361 - Sanitation Projects in Schools, 9999 - Smart Class rooms and Teaching Aids, etc.(b):	No, Sir. However, Ministry of Education has informed that  a policy decision has been taken by the State Government of Assam to convert the Madarsa Educational Institutions affiliated under the State Madarsa Board to upper primary, high school, higher secondary school etc. in order to allow an exposure of students towards more subjects and enable greater flexibility with more frequent formative assessment for learning. There is no change in the status, pay & allowances, service conditions etc. of the teaching and non-teaching staff. However, private madarsas will continue to function as it functioned earlier and the centrally sponsored schemes of SPQEM and IDMI will continue in respect of private madarsas.(c):	The Constitution of India under Article 21 A provides that “ The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such manner as the State may, by law, determine.”  In pursuance of this  Provision  Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 was enacted. The Act  mandates the appropriate Government to provide free and compulsory elementary education to every child of the age 6 to 14 years in a neighborhood school. *****
