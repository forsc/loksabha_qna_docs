The Department of Biotechnology implements Star College Scheme which aims to improve critical thinking and ‘hands-on’ experimental work at undergraduate (College) level in sciences. It is expected to encourage more students to take up higher education in science. Through this scheme, the department identifies colleges with potential for excellence and provides academic and physical infrastructure for achieving excellence in teaching and unique exposure of students to experimental science. Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has been providing doctoral and postdoctoral fellowships to young budding students through its various fellowship programmes such as Junior Research Fellowship-National Eligibility Test, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Fellowship, Senior Research Fellowship-Direct, Research Associateships and CSIR-National Post Doctoral Fellowship.
