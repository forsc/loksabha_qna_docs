ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) and (b): As per the Indian Council of Medical Research’s Cancer Registry Data Report on “National Cancer Registry Programme Report, 2020”, the estimated number of incidences of cancer cases is increasing in the country and the details for the years 2018 to 2020 by State/UT wise is enclosed in Annexure. Lung cancer is the most common cancer among men and breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the country. As per National Non-Communicable Diseases Monitoring Survey (NNMS), the prevalence of risk factors associated with Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) including cancer amongst adults (18-69 years) such as current tobacco use, current alcohol use, inadequate intake of fruits and/or vegetables intake, insufficient physical activity is 32.8%, 15.9%, 98.4% and 41.3% respectively(c): Health is a state subject. The Department of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India, however, provides technical and financial support to the States/UTs under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), as part of National Health Mission (NHM), based on the proposals received from the States/UTs and subject to the resource envelope. Cancer is an integral part of NPCDCS. The programme focusses on strengthening infrastructure, human resource development, health promotion & awareness generation for Cancer prevention, early diagnosis, management and referral to an appropriate level of healthcare facility for treatment of the NCDs, including Cancer.A population-based initiative for prevention, control and screening for common NCDs i.e. diabetes, hypertension and common cancers has been rolled out in the country under NHM and also as a part of Comprehensive Primary Health Care. Under the initiative, persons more than 30 years of age are targeted for their screening for the three common cancers i.e oral, breast and cervical. Screening of these common cancers is an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres.Preventive aspect of Cancer is strengthened under Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Ayushman Bharat Health Wellness Centre scheme, by promotion of wellness activities and targeted communication at the community level. Other initiatives for increasing public awareness about Cancer and for promotion of healthy lifestyle includes observation of National Cancer Awareness Day and use of print, electronic and social media for continued community awareness. Furthermore, healthy eating is also promoted through FSSAI. Fit India movement is implemented by Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, and various Yoga related activities are carried out by Ministry of AYUSH. In addition, NPCDCS gives financial support under NHM for awareness generation (IEC) activities for Cancer to be undertaken by the States/UTs as per their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs).The Central Government is also implementing Strengthening of Tertiary Care of Cancer Scheme in order to enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer. 19 State Cancer Institutes (SCIs) and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres (TCCCs) have been approved under the said scheme. There is also focus on Oncology in its various aspects in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojna (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar (Haryana) and second campus of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata are also steps in this direction. All these enhance the capacity for treatment of cancer in the country.Cancer is diagnosed and treated at various levels in the health care facilities. The treatment in Government Hospitals is either free or highly subsidized for the poor and needy. Treatment of Cancers is also available under Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY). Besides, quality generic medicines are made available at affordable prices to all, under Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) in collaboration with the State Governments. Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment (AMRIT) Pharmacy stores have been set up in some hospitals/institutions, with an objective to make available Cancer drugs at a substantial discount vis-à-vis the Maximum Retail Price. Under the umbrella scheme of Rashtrya Arogya Nidhi (RAN), financial assistance is provided to families living below threshold poverty line for their treatment, including treatment of Cancer in Government hospitals.
