ANSWER




                                                        (a)	Earlier, there existed a multiplicity of norms, guidelines and standards for skill development courses. However, after the establishment of the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) in 2014, it has initiated various convergence efforts across the skill ecosystem to bring a common set of rules and guidelines into force so that the skill training provided across the country could follow a common set of rules in every area of skill development MSDE has undertaken various measures in this regard; the key measures are as below-(i)     The introduction of the Common Cost Norms.(ii)    The creation of a National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF).The Common Cost Norms have helped to harmonise the various skilling schemes/programs and bring a base level of consistency in the inputs, process and output metrics. These norms are followed by Central Government''s Ministries/Departments running skill training programs.MSDE has created a unified regulatory authority, the National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET), to promote a credible learner-centric skill ecosystem by creating minimal, uniform standards to regulate the functioning of the vocational education ecosystem and enabling market-driven solutions.NSDA (the precursor to NCVET) was given the mandate to manage the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), created in 2013, which facilitates the adoption of common standardization for all skill related course curriculums. All major skill development programs being implemented centrally have adopted this framework. Currently, NSQF has organized more than 4600 skill quali?cations according to the level of knowledge, skills and aptitude.(b) 	In order to bring about uniformity and standardisation in the implementation of various skill development schemes by different central Ministries/departments of the Government, MSDE has created the Common Cost Norms. The Common Cost Norms define the activities constituting ‘skill development’ in the country, set guidelines for skill development courses and their alignment with the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) along with broad input standards for skilling related programmes and their outcomes. (c)	Skill India is a continuous dynamic programme that adapts changing needs of skills and opportunities. With the objective of coordinating the efforts of all concerned stakeholders in the ?eld of skill development and entrepreneurship, MSDE was created in November, 2014. With the advent of a central Ministry, efforts to improve and streamline the skilling ecosystem were ramped up as the government launched the National Skill Development Mission as well as the National Policy on Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. More and more areas are being aligned with the common framework spanning the skills ecosystem so that the outcomes of the Government skilling programs are uniform across the skilling ecosystem.(d)	MSDE has made various effortsat the institutional and structural levels to rationalise and streamline the entire skill development process. Certain key steps such as the Common Cost Norms, NSQF and NCVET have been covered above in part (a). Other key initiatives are summarised below –(i)	Standardization of input quality through SMART Portal - Skill Management & Accreditation of Training Centre (SMART) is an accreditation and affiliation platform developed by NSDC to bring about uniformity in the process of accreditation and affiliation and improve quality assurance across training centres.(ii)	Data convergence on the Skill India Portal - TheSkill India Portal has been brought into existence to ensure data congruence and converge data relating to all skilling programmes in the country including Central Ministries, State Governments and corporations on one platform. This process is in progress. Once the process of integration is complete, the Skill India Portal would provide an accurate estimation and planning for training program, reduction in duplication and wasteful expenditure and better visibility of the entire skill ecosystem.(iii)	National Portal for Trainers and Assessors - Takshashila, a dedicated online portal has been setup by MSDE for the management of trainers and assessors of the skill ecosystem, functioning as the central repository of information concerning development of quality Trainers and Assessors.(e)	The set of desired outcomes of skill training programmes already include placement achieved in wage and self-employment (for both for fresh trainees and existing workers who have undergone Recognition of Prior Learning) as one of the outcomes. (f)	The flagship program of MSDE, scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), captures data up to 3 months for both wage workers and self-employed workers. Other MSDE schemes do not provide for placement of the skilled persons. Skills training apart from direct placements also results in many students becoming self-employed or starting entrepreneurship ventures. Beyond these, the NSDC runs fee-based courses as well but the same are not included here since they are not conducted with expenditure from Government. Moreover, placement can be only one of the desired outcomes and in the vast skill ecosystem, placement cannot always be assured since it depends heavily on market conditions, general economic scenario (including foreign trade) and derived demand for skilled labour.
