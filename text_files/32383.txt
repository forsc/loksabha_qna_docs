ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) 	Under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G), the target is the construction of 2.95 crore houses to achieve the objective of “Housing for All” in rural areas. The beneficiaries have been identified based on the housing deprivation parameters prescribed under Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011. After due verification by the Gram Sabha and completion of Appellate Process, Gram Panchayat-wise Permanent Wait List (PWL) is prepared. The auto generated priority list of households from SECC, 2011 database was provided to the States/Union Territories (UTs) for conducting Gram Sabha meetings to finalize the PWL. As on 20.12.2021, a total of 2.15 crore households have been identified and included in PWL from SECC, 2011. Further, the details of such households who, though eligible for inclusion in PWL, but claimed to be left out from the SECC 2011 based PWL, have been captured in the Awaas+ Mobile App based Survey. The Survey was conducted during January 2018 and March 2019. In this exercise, the States/UTs have uploaded details of additional households. The beneficiaries from finalisedAwaas+ lists are also being granted benefits under PMAY-G as per the approved guidelines, within a ceiling of 2.95 crore houses under PMAY-G. Thus, the Ministry has taken effective steps to ensure that genuine beneficiaries are not left out of the scheme. (b) & (d)  The Framework for Implementation (FFI) of PMAY-G provides that the house construction should be completed within 12 months of sanctioning of house to the beneficiary. The State/UT-wise & Phase-wise details of houses built/constructed under the scheme, average number of days taken for completing the construction of the house and the total Central Assistance released since inception till 20.12.2021 is given in Annexure-I. (c)  & (f) The State/UT-wise number of landless beneficiaries, identified in the PWL of PMAY-G, those that have been provided land or assistance for purchase of land and ones that are remaining to be provided land is given in Annexure-II. (e) There is no proposal under consideration of the Ministry for increasing per unit assistance under the Scheme.   ******
