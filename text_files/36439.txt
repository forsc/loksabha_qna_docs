It provides for establishment of Gram Nyayalayas at intermediate panchayat level.  The State Governments are responsible for establishing Gram Nyayalayas in consultation with the respective High Courts.  As per information made available by State Governments / High Courts, 476 Gram Nyayalayas have been notified so far by 15 States/UT.  Out of these, 257 are operational in 10 States at present. The State-wise detail including Haryana is as below:Sl.

The issues affecting operationalization of the Gram Nyayalayas were discussed in the Conference of Chief Justices of High Courts and Chief Ministers of the States on 7th April, 2013.

For opening of Gram Nyayalayas, the Central Government has been encouraging the States by way of providing financial assistance.*********AnnexureSTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (C) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3781 FOR REPLY ON 25.03.2022 (As on 22.03.2022)Sl.
