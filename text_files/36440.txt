ANSWER




                                                        The MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU) (a) to (e): A Statement showing the details of appointment of Judges to the High Courts since 2014 is enclosed herewith as Annexure-A.  As on 14.03.2022, against the sanctioned strength of 1104 Judges in the High Courts, 699 Judges are in position, leaving 405 vacancies of Judges to be filled. Against 405 Vacancies, at present, 175 proposals are at various stages of processing between the Government and the Supreme Court Collegium. Further recommendations from High Court Collegiums are yet to be received in respect of 230 vacancies in High Courts. The current strength of Judges in the High Courts and details of vacant positions is enclosed at Annexure-B.  Filling up of vacancies in the High Courts is a continuous, integrated and collaborative process between the Executive and the Judiciary. It requires consultation and approval from various Constitutional Authorities both at the State and Centre level. While every effort is made to fill up the existing vacancies expeditiously, vacancies of Judges in High Courts do keep on arising on account of retirement, resignation or elevation of Judges and also due to increase in the strength of Judges.Since 2014 total 198 seats of Judges have been created in various High Courts the details of which are at Annexure-C. Appointment of Judges of the High Courts is made under Articles 217 and 224 of the Constitution of India, which do not provide for reservation for any caste or class of persons. However, the Government is committed to social diversity in the appointment of Judges in the in the Higher Judiciary and has been requesting the Chief Justices of High Courts that while sending proposals for appointment of Judges, due consideration be given to suitable candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, Minorities and Women to ensure social diversity in appointment of Judges in High Courts.                                                ***** ANNEXURE-A		(As on 14.03.2022)S.
