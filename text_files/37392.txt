ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) to (e):  As per inputs received from Department of Sports, the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports extends financial assistance to the National Sports Federations (NSFs) for various sports activities including training and participation of Indian sportspersons and teams in international tournaments. Excursion/Economy air fare from residence / camp to the destinations is extended under the Scheme of Assistance to NSFs. Booking of Air Tickets will be done through three Authorized Travel Agents viz. i) M/s Balmer Lawrie & Company Limited (BLCL), ii) M/s Ashok Travels & Tours (ATT) and iii) Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd. (IRCTC) in terms of the Department of Expenditure''s OM dated 31.12.2021. No concessions are offered by the Government as airfares are neither regulated nor established by the Government whether international or domestic. Airlines are commercial organizations which fix air fares based on interplay of market forces. Also, providing concessions in air tickets is airline prerogative. Government does not interfere in the commercial activities of the airlines.******
