ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STEEL		   (SHRI RAM CHANDRA PRASAD SINGH)(a)to(c): Steel is a deregulated sector where prices are a function of demand and supply, global market conditions, trends in price of raw materials, logistics cost, power and fuel cost etc. In order to remain competitive in market, public sector companies take commercial decisions like fixing of steel prices, discounts / rebates in tune with the market trends. The details of market price (retail) of key items of iron and steel during last two year i.e. 2019-20 and 2020-21 are given in Annexure-I.(d)	The Government has taken various steps to increase availability of steel, which, inter-alia, include Mining and Mineral Policy reforms to enhance production / availability of iron ore, early operationalization of forfeited working mines of Odisha by the State and Central PSUs etc., and ramping up production and capacity utilization by steel producers. In Union Budget 2021-22, Customs Duty has been reduced uniformly to 7.5% on Semis, Flat and Long products of non-alloy, alloy and stainless steels. Further, to provide relief to metal re-cyclers, mostly MSMEs, BCD on steel scrap has been exempted for a period up to 31st March, 2022. In addition to the above, ADD and CVD on certain steel products have also been revoked / temporarily revoked.********
