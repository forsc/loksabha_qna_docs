Also, as part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Initiative, MoFPI is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme-PM Formalisation of Micro Food Processing Enterprises Scheme (PMFME) for providing financial, technical and business support for setting up/upgradation of two lakh micro food processing enterprises through credit linked subsidy during five years from 2020-21 to 2024-25. A total of Rs 39.63 Crore has been released to the state, so far under the scheme.*****
