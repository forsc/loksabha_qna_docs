SINGH (RETD))(a) Currently, due to significant imbalance in the number of points of call in favour of foreign carriers, the Government of India is not granting any non-metro airport as a new point of call to any foreign carrier for the purpose of operating passenger services.

Within a period of one year, by Winter 2019 schedule, Indian carriers were operating 65 international services per week from Kannur. Presently, there is no proposal to grant Kannur as a point of call, as mentioned at (a) above.******
