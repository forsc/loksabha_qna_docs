ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF TEXTILES  (SMT. DARSHANA JARDOSH)(a) & (b):	Under Scheme for Integrated Textile Park (SITP), 66 Parks were sanctioned. Out of 66 textile parks, 10 have been cancelled, 24 have been completed and 32 are under implementation at various stages.  Initially two Parks viz. Doddabalapur Integrated Textile Park and Gulbarga Textile Park were approved in the State of Karnataka. Doddabalapur Integrated Textile Park has been completed as per scheme guidelines and Gulbarga Textile Park was cancelled. (c) to (e):	In the Union Budget 2021-22, it has been announced that a scheme of Mega Investment Textile Parks will be launched. Under the scheme, seven Mega Textile Parks will be set up in the country over next 3 years. Ministry of Textiles is in the process of obtaining approval of the Cabinet for the proposed Scheme.  Once, the proposed scheme is approved and modalities are finalized, the details of location, Government funding structure etc. will be decided. (f):	Under SITP, each textile park should have a minimum of 25 acres of land. In the case of North Eastern and other special category states, the requirement will be 10 acres. However, under the proposed Mega Investment Textile Park Scheme, the modalities of which are to be decided by the Cabinet while approving the scheme, the land would be 1000+ acres in size, to achieve economies of scale and size. ***
