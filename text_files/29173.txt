                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component & 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports. Details and status of the proposals for inter-state linking of rivers under the Inter Linking of Rivers Programme is furnished at Annexure.(b) The implementation of the ILR projects depend on the consensus of the concerned States. Thus the interlinking of rivers programme is being pursued based on the principle of consensus and agreement among the concerned States. An interlinking project would reach the implementation stage once agreement amongst party states is reached on water sharing. Thereafter for implementation all requisite statutory clearances need to be obtained.(c) & (d) Government of Uttar Pradesh has requested NWDA to take up the study of linking Sharda River to Gomtiriver. Draft Pre-Feasibility Report of the Intra State link viz; Sharda-Gomti link has been completed by NWDA  and submitted to the State Government in October, 2021. *****  ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (a)  UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 817 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 02.12.2021 REGARDING “NATIONAL RIVER LINKING PROJECT”.
