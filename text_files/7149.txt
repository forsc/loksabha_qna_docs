                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA) (a) Under the erstwhile National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), minimum service level of 40 litre per capita per day (lpcd) of safe drinking water was provided in rural areas to meet the basic minimum need. Based on the information furnished by States/ UTs, details of Fully Covered (FC), Partially Covered (PC) (i.e. getting less than 40 lpcd of safe drinking water) and Quality Affected (QA)(i.e. containing chemical contamination) habitations, is at Annex-I.Government of India has launched Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) in August 2019 by restructuring and subsuming erstwhile NRDWP to provide every rural household to have potable drinking water on regular basis in adequate quantity i.e. service level of 55 lpcd through Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC) by 2024.(b) As informed by Central Water Commission, D/o Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, the National Water Policy, 2012, inter alia has certain provisions with regard to promotion of efficient use of water in heavy industries, as at Annex-II. (c) As per information provided by Department of Agriculture Cooperation & Farmers Welfare, micro irrigation systems viz. drip & sprinkler irrigation are promoted under the ‘Per Drop More Crop’ component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY-PDMC). Under the scheme, financial assistance is available @ 55% for small and marginal farmers and @ 45% for other farmers for installation of drip and sprinkler irrigation systems. Further, 25% higher unit cost have been taken into calculation of subsidy for the North Eastern and Himalayan states and 15% higher for States with low penetration of micro irrigation for larger adoption of systems by the farmers under the scheme. In addition, some States provide additional incentives & top up subsidy for encouraging farmers to adopt micro irrigation. Year wise releases made to States under PMKSY-Per Drop More Crop is at Annex-III.            Also, as per information provided by Department of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, under the Command Area Development and Water Management Programme (CADWM), no direct incentives is given to farmers for use of less water intensive irrigation tools. However, CADWM Programme is targeting Command Area Development (CAD) works in the balance Culturable Command Area (CCA) of 44.35 lakh ha as per proposals received from the States. It is provisioned in the CADWM scheme that micro–irrigation shall cover at least 10% of the targeted CCA of the Project. Central Assistance @ 50% is being provided  to the State Governments with a cost norm of Rs. 50,000 per hectare for development of micro irrigation infrastructure covering construction of sump, installation of water pump, and laying of piped conveyance system up to the field head.****
