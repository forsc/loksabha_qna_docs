ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION  (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)&(b) The Government is implementing a number of targeted programmes for overall balanced development and amelioration of poverty in the country such as Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (PMAY), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM), National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP), Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM), Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY), Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Atal Pension Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, Stand Up India Scheme etc. As per the information received from M/o Rural Development and M/o Housing and  Urban Affairs there is no proposal under consideration to bring one or more major schemes by combining various schemes for the poor and low-income groups.(c)&(d) Government has taken several important measures towards making schemes more result-oriented. Development Monitoring and Evaluation Office (DMEO) was established in NITI Aayog with the mandate to undertake evaluation of the development/welfare programs and policies of the Government of India to assess their performance and impact. DMEO has been preparing an Output-Outcome Monitoring Framework (OOMF) of all CS/CSS Schemes in close-coordination and approval of respective Ministry/Department, since 2018-19. This defines key Outputs-Outcomes and key indicators for monitoring the implementation/progress of schemes. The concerned Ministries/Departments set targets on these indicators, each year and therefore progress can be updated/tracked against the targets set. Individual Ministries also takes steps to effectively monitor the expenditures and programme implementation in the States. The Ministry of Rural Development has evolved several initiatives, including submission of periodical reports by the State Rural Livelihoods Missions (SRLMs), periodic meeting of the Performance Review Committee (PRC) of the Ministry, monitoring the submission of Utilization Certificates, submission of reports by third party monitoring through National Level Monitors and Area Officers, monitoring through various MIS modules as well as bi-monthly financial management review of all states. Implementation Support Missions (ISMs) have been carried out in some States such as Assam, U.P. and Karnataka, wherein, technical experts from the National Mission Management Unit supervise the work of the SRLMs and support them to resolve outstanding issues and plan for future implementation of the programme in the States in consultation with the SRLMs. The 2nd installment under DAY-NRLM is released only after receipt of satisfactory Utilization Certificate and physical progress in the concerned state.	As part of effective implementation and monitoring, the performance under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA, is periodically reviewed by M/o Rural Development. The major steps taken by the Government to improve the programme implementation under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA are as follows:•	At least 60% of the works to be taken up in a district in terms of cost shall be for creation of productive assets directly linked to agriculture and allied activities through development of land, water and trees.•	The wage-material ratio for works taken up by agencies other than Gram Panchayats would be counted at the district level to facilitate taking more durable assets.•	The associated outcomes of each work would be estimated before taking up the work and the same would be measured after completion of the work-thereby bringing in more focus on outcomes. Similarly, for proper implementation of the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) scheme, making it result oriented and to ensure that the projects are completed in time, the Ministry follows a system of concurrent monitoring of projects through State Rural Livelihoods Missions/ State Skills Missions in the State Government, and through the Central Technical Support Agencies designated by the Ministry. *****
