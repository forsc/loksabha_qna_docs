                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS,  HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) to (c) 	Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) have reported that none of the Members of Parliament (MPs) has desired to opt out of telecom services provided by BSNL/MTNL on account of issues such as call drops and poor network connectivity. BSNL, however, has informed that Hon’ble House Committee of Rajya Sabha in June 2019 had sought comments of BSNL on the subject “Shifting of mobile telephone services of Hon’ble Members of Rajya Sabha to private telecom service operators”. BSNL has informed that to further improve its network and services in all its Licensed Service Areas (LSAs), it is over time adding new equipment and updating existing equipment in both urban and rural areas under various network expansion phases. MTNL has informed that it has recently improved its wireless network by increasing the download and upload speed.Further, the Cabinet in the meeting held on 23.10.2019 approved a revival plan for BSNL and MTNL which inter-alia, includes administrative allotment of spectrum for providing 4G services.  With the roll out of 4G services, the high-speed wireless internet services can also be availed by all customers of BSNL/MTNL including Hon’ble MPs.************
