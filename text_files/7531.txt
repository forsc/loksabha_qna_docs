ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c): Gram Vikas Yojana is not implemented by Ministry of Tribal Affairs. However, Ministry of Tribal Affairs had implemented a programme for development of forest villages since 2005-06 as a onetime measure for integrated development of forest villages with a view to raise the Human Development Index (HDI) of the inhabitants of the forest villages and for providing basic facilities and services in 2,474 forest villages/habitations that were covered under the programmes spread over twelve States in the country namely Assam, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Odisha, Tripura, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The programme included infrastructure works relating to basic services and facilities viz. approach roads, healthcare, primary education, minor irrigation, rainwater harvesting, drinking water, sanitation, community halls, etc. and activities related to income generation. The programme was implemented as a part of the Special Area Programme ‘Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Plan” and funds were released from the year 2006-07 to 2011-12 only. No fund has been released during 2012-13 and onwards.		As per information received from Government of Maharashtra, presently there are no forest villages in the State of Maharashtra. All the forest villages have been converted into Revenue Villages. *****
