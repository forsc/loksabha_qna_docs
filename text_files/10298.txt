ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a) & (b):	Yes, Sir.  Under Agriculture Export Policy, 2018, Poultry Clusters at Namakkal, Salem and Erode districts of Tamil Nadu State have been identified for increasing supply and exports of poultry products.(c):	At present, there is no plan to set up such cluster in the State of Telangana.  (d):	The concept of separate export zones was introduced by the Government through Exim Policy in 2001.  Due to non-satisfactory performance of the Agri Export Zones (AEZ), the Ministry constituted a Peer Review Group for its re-valuation.  On the basis of the recommendations of the Peer Review Group, it was decided not to consider and approve new separate AEZ.  The constraints like lack of interest and coordination amongst the stakeholders, lack of separate allocation of funds by the State Governments, lack of project orientation and conceptual design of separate AEZ etc. were noticed.   However, Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying has recognised 29 poultry establishments (i.e. 10 establishments in Tamil Nadu, 13 establishments in Maharashtra and 6 establishments in Chhattisgarh) as ‘Compartment free from Avian Influenza’ as per norms of World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) intended for export of poultry and poultry products.***
