                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)&(b)	The National Forest Policy, 1988 envisages that a minimum of one-third of the total land area of the country should be under forest or tree cover. In the hills and in mountainous region, the aim should be to maintain two-third of the area under such cover in order to prevent erosion and land degradation and to ensure the stability of the fragile eco-system. Besides National Forest Policy, 1988, there are other Acts and Rules such as the Indian Forest Act, 1927; the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980; the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, Biological Diversity Act, 2002; and State Forest Acts and Rules made thereunder by State/UT Governments which govern the protection, conservation and management of forests in the country. (c) There is no Forest Rights Act, 2005. However, Government of India enacted “the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006” which is commonly known as “Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006”. Under the Act, rights of tribals and other traditional forest dwellers are recognized and vested in forest land who have been residing in such forests for generations but whose rights could not be recorded. Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal Ministry for implementation of FRA, 2006. As per information received from the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, a total number of 19,64,048 titles (18,87,894 individual and 76,154 community claims) have been distributed till May, 2019 over an area involving forest lands to the extent of 1,29,38,762.14 acres.(d) & (e) Climate change is a global challenge and requires action from all Countries based on the principles of equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC). India is Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), its Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement. India is meeting all its commitments and obligations under these instruments, and independent studies have rated India’s efforts highly.  ***
