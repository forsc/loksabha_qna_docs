ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a): Railways undertook the construction of Road under Bridges (RUBs)/ Subways as a viable techno-economic solution to the problem of road users to compulsorily wait at Level Crossings (LCs) as well as affecting their safety while crossing the Railways tracks. The responsibility of road maintenance, drainage arrangements and light in the RUB/ Subway was initially given to State Government due to their presence in such isolated locations. However, there were complaints of inadequate drainage. Therefore, in 2018, all Zonal Railways were instructed to take up this responsibility of road maintenance, drainage arrangements & lighting etc. within Railway portion.Railway is accordingly taking action to address these problems.(b): Number of RUBs in North Central Railway is 675. Out of these 675 RUBs, adequate drainage arrangements have been done in 648 RUBs. Every RUB is unique and depends upon features such as railway tracks embankment height, ground water table, type of soil and terrain around it and type of construction adopted for its construction etc.Some RUBs, having adequate bank height do not need any elaborate Rain water drainage system and serve well with natural drainage arrangements. However, bank height in most of the RUBs in North Central Railway is such that ground level is higher than the bottom of road level. Efforts have been made to provide cover sheds at all such locations. Feasibility of provision of light is also under examination by Railways.The work of providing sheds and other required drainage works at the RUBs is in progress at 27 RUBs.However, adequate pumping arrangements have been done at all such locations where water logging is experienced.(c): In new construction of RUB/ Subways, provision of proper drainage arrangements are done along with construction of the RUBs. Sometimes, due to developments in adjoining area, RUBs which are newly constructed experience water-logging in the next monsoon and then adequate arrangements are done immediately  after identifying the reasons of water-logging at specific location.*****
