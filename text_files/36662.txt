The review of the progress made in implementation of the stimulus package announced under Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Packages is done regularly.Further, to boost employment and livelihood opportunities for migrant workers, including women migrant workers, returning to villages, in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak, Government of India has launched Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan (GKRA) on 20.06.2020.
