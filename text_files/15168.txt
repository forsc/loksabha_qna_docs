FCI stores/handles large quantities of foodgrains over long periods. Out of these Stocks, a negligible quantity become non-issuable due to various reasons like natural calamities, transit damages etc.Depending on requirement in specific areas and for modernization of the storage facilities, the Government implements following  schemes for creation of storage facilities for Central Pool stocks in the country:i.	Private Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) Scheme: Under this Scheme, formulated in 2008, storage capacity is created by private parties, Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) and State Government Agencies for guaranteed hiring by FCI. As on 31.01.2020, a total capacity of 143.63 LMT has been created.  Under this scheme, no funds are allocated by Government for construction of godowns and full investment is done by the private parties/CWC/State Agencies.............3/--3-ii.	Central Sector Scheme (erstwhile Plan Scheme): This scheme is implemented in the North Eastern States along with a few other States. Funds from annual budgetary allocation are released by the Government of India to FCI and also to the State Governments for construction of godowns. A total capacity of 1,84,175 MT has been completed by FCI and State Governments during the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-17). This scheme has been extended from 01.04.2017 to 31.03.2022. A capacity of 51,925 MT has been created by FCI & State Governments from 01.04.2017 to 31.01.2020.iii.	Construction of Steel Silos: In addition to conventional godowns, Government of India in the year 2016 has also approved an action plan for construction of steel silos in the country for a capacity of 100 LMT in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode for modernizing storage infrastructure and improving shelf life of stored foodgrains. As on 31.01.2020, steel silos of 7.25 LMT capacity have been created under this action plan. In case of construction of silos under Non-Viability Gap Funding (non-VGF), no investment is made by the Government/FCI and only monthly rentals as per accepted bid are paid. While, in case of silos under Viability Gap Funding (VGF-National Institution for Transforming India [NITI Aayog)] model), the grant is provided by Government to the private party for locations where land is provided by FCI. As on 31.01.2020, the grant has been required for only one location at Kotkapura (Punjab). In case of VGF silos (Department of Economic Affairs model) the land is purchased by concessionaire and is transferred to FCI for which the land cost is paid by the Government from the Budgetary allocation, as on 31.01.2020, only two locations i.e. Kaimur and Buxar are covered under this model.iv.	Cover and Plinth (CAP) hiring scheme: Government of India has approved a Scheme for construction of 90 LMT of CAP in PPP mode as temporary storage facilities for accommodating the wheat stocks for Rabi Marketing Season (RMS) 2020-21. Under this scheme no funds are allocated by the Government for construction of CAP.In addition, godowns are hired by FCI under Private Warehousing Scheme (PWS) to address immediate/urgent requirement of storage space. Godowns under PWS can be hired after hiring all the capacity available with CWC/State Warehousing Corporations (SWCs)/State Agencies/PEG capacity available.****AnnexureANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.3762 FOR ANSWER ON 17.03.2020 IN THE LOK SABHA.The State-wise and year-wise details of the storage capacity created under PEG scheme:(Fig. in LMT)Sl.
