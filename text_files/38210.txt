ANSWER




                                                        Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance(a) to(d)  The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance (2003) in their 55th Report had, inter alia, recommended that Government may consider the setting up of an apex body viz. National Rural Bank of India (NRBI).  Government has been receiving various representations from time to time in this regard.In the Action Taken Report on the said recommendations, it was, inter alia, stated that the proposal for consolidating the RRBs under a National Rural Bank or NABARD had not found favour with most of the States, who suggested state level amalgamation of RRBs.  Moreover, creation of NRBI might lead to a structure which would also dilute the regional character of RRBs.	With a view to minimize overhead expenses, optimize the use of technology, enhance the capital base and the area of operation, amalgamation process of RRBs was initiated during the year 2004-05.  Consequently, the number of RRBs has reduced from 196 during 2004 to 43 at present.  *****
