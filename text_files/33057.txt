ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a) to (e):	The Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act, 1956 was amended to increase the sanctioned strength of Supreme Court of India from 30 to 33 (excluding CJI). The Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Amendment Act, 2019 came into force w.e.f. 09.8.2019. In the Joint Conference of Chief Justices and Chief Ministers held on 7.4.2013, a decision was taken to increase the number of Judges of the High Courts by 25%. Accordingly, Government has increased   the Judge strength of the High Courts from 906 to 1098 i.e. by 192 posts, during the period from 01.07.2014 to 31.01.2022 with the approval of the respective State Governments, related High Courts and the Chief Justice of India. While filling up of vacancies in the High Courts is a continuous, integrated and collaborative process requiring consultation and approval from various constitutional authorities, vacancies keep on arising on account of retirement, resignation or elevation of Judges. Government is committed to filling up of vacancy expeditiously in time-bound manner. A Statement showing the details of appointment of Judges for last ten years, High Court wise and year-wise, is enclosed herewith as Annexure.As regards district and subordinate courts, under Article 235 of the Constitution of India, the administrative control over the members of district and subordinate judiciary in the States vest with the concerned High Court. Further, in exercise of powers conferred under proviso to Article 309 read with Articles 233 and 234 of the Constitution, the respective State Governments, in consultation with the High Court, frames the Rules and Regulations regarding the issue of appointment, promotion, reservations and retirement of Judicial Officers in the State Judicial Service.  Hence, in so far as recruitment of judicial officers in the States is concerned, respective High Courts do it in certain States, whereas the High Courts do it in consultation with the State Public Service Commissions in other States. The Union Government does not have a role under the Constitution in the selection and appointment of judicial officers in District/ subordinate judiciary. The Supreme Court, in its orders of 04th January, 2007 in Malik Mazhar case, has devised a process and time frame to be followed for the filling up of vacancies in subordinate judiciary which stipulates that the process for recruitment of judges in the subordinate courts would commence on 31st March of a calendar year and end by 31st October of the same year. The Supreme Court has permitted State Governments / High Courts for variations in the time schedule in case of any difficulty based on the peculiar geographical and climatic conditions in the State or other relevant conditions. 	Further, in compliance of the above directions of the Supreme Court, Department of Justice forwarded a copy of the Malik Mazhar judgement to Registrars General of all High Courts for necessary action. Department of Justice is writing from time to time to Registrars General of all High Courts to expedite the filling up of vacancies in subordinate judiciary mandated by Malik Mazhar case. In September, 2016, Union Minister of Law & Justice wrote to the Chief Ministers of States and the Chief Justices of High Courts to enhance the cadre strength of the District and Subordinate Courts and provide physical infrastructure to the State judiciary. The same was reiterated in May, 2017.  The sanctioned strength of judges in District and Subordinate Courts increased from 19,518 in the year 2014 to 24,514 as on 01.02.2022.  In August, 2018, in the context of increasing pendency of cases, the Union Minister of Law & Justice has written to all Chief Justices of High Courts to monitor the status of the vacancies regularly and to ensure proper coordination with the State Public Service Commission to fill up vacant posts as per time schedule prescribed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the Malik Mazhar Sultan case. The filling up of vacancies is also being monitored by the Supreme Court in a suo-motu Writ Petition (Civil) No. 2 of 2018.******** ANNEXURE STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO  PARTS (A) TO (E)  OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 478  FOR ANSWER ON 04.02.2022 REGARDING  APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES.
