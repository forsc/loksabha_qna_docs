ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	&  (b): The Government is formulating a Scheme for Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) under which a mechanism would be created for re-imbursement of taxes/ duties/ levies, which are currently not being refunded under any other mechanism, at the central, state and local level, but which are incurred in the process of manufacture and distribution of exported products. RoDTEP is based on the principle that taxes and levies borne on the exported products should be either exempted or remitted to exporters unlike the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) , which is an export incentive scheme.(c)  & (d):  RoDTEP Scheme is being conceptualized keeping in view the WTO provisions, particularly the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM).****
