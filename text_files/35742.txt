Further, in 2009, the Draft Model PESA Rules had been framed and circulated by Ministry of Panchayati Raj to the ten PESA States. As a result of regular persuasion, the six States of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Telangana have framed their State PESA Rules under their respective State Panchayati Raj Acts. Rajasthan has also enacted “The Rajasthan Panchayati Raj (Modification of Provisions in their Application to the Scheduled Areas) Act 1999” to bring them in conformity with the PESA Act 1996.  ___
