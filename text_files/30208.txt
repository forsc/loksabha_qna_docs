ANSWER




 THE MINISTER OF MINORITY AFFAIRS(SHRI MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI) (a)	The entire process of Haj has been made 100% digital / online which has facilitated the dream of “Ease of Doing Haj” for the Indian Muslims. Making the entire Haj process online / digital, has made the Haj process smooth, transparent and eliminated middle-men, which has ensured that no extra financial burden has been put on Haj pilgrims even after removal of Haj subsidy. Haj Pilgrims, Private Haj Organizers, Haj Committee of India and other stake-holders involved in Haj management have all benefitted due to the digitization of Haj process. Also, the process of online registration of Haj Applications for Haj-2022 has commenced with effect from 01.11.2021 and the intending pilgrims have been requested to submit their applications through the portal www.hajcommittee.gov.in and mobile App till 31.01.2022.(b) & (c) From several decades, Indian Muslim women had been demanding the removal of government restriction on Muslim women performing Haj without Mehram (Male Companion), as this restriction prohibited single ladies and other working women like teachers, doctors, nurses, entrepreneurs who desired to go on Haj but could not able to get Mehram to perform the Haj Pilgrimage.For the first time after the independence, the restriction on Muslim women performing Haj without Mehram has been lifted in the year 2018 and till date 3,401 women pilgrims have performed Haj Without Mehram.  For Haj 2020 & Haj-2021, 2980  Ladies without Mehram had applied for Haj Pilgrimage but could not perform Haj due to Covid pandemic. Now, all such Women and new women applicants for Haj 2022 (without Mehram) will be eligible to perform Haj without Lottery system. *****
