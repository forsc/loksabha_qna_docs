                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL) (a) to (e) A Statement of reply is laid on the Table of the House. Statement referred to in the reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 319 due for reply on 24.03.2022(a) & (b) To make provision of potable tap water supply in adequate quantity, of prescribed quality and on regular & long-term basis to every rural household in the country by 2024, since August, 2019, Government of India in partnership with States/ UTs, is implementing Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) – Har Ghar Jal. Under JJM, while allocating the funds to States/ UTs, 10% weightage is given to the population residing in habitations affected by chemical contaminants.Under JJM, while planning for potable water supply to household through tap water connection, priority is to be given to quality-affected habitations. Since, planning, implementation and commissioning of piped water supply scheme based on a safe water source is likely to take time, purely as an interim measure, States/ UTs have been advised to install community water purification plants (CWPPs) especially in Arsenic and Fluoride affected habitations to provide potable water to every household at the rate of 8–10 litre per capita per day (lpcd) to meet their drinking and cooking requirements.Under Jal Jeevan Mission, States/ UTs have been advised to plan schemes of bulk water transfer from long distance in villages with water quality issues and non-availability of suitable surface water source in nearby areas.As reported by States, as on 21.03.2022, States have taken up 6,249 community water purification plant (CWPP) schemes since launch of Jal Jeevan Mission.(c) to (e) Rural drinking water supply is a State subject. Powers to plan, approve and implement water supply schemes is vested with States. The States may take up appropriate water treatment system depending upon techno-economic feasibility.*****
