ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD AND PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI DANVE RAOSAHEB DADARAO)(a) :    Food inflation based on Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI), brought out by M/o Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) from September to December, 2019 is given below.All India Inflation rate (%) based on CFPIIndex	Sept’19	Oct’19	Nov’19	Dec’19CFPI	5.11	7.89	10.01	14.12(P) P – Provisional,      Source: MoSPI.            Government has taken various measures from time to time to stabilize prices of essential food items which, inter-alia, include appropriately utilizing trade and fiscal policy instruments like import duty, Minimum Export Price, export restrictions, etc. to regulate domestic availability and moderate prices; imposition of stock limits and advising States for effective action against hoarders & black marketers ; and, provision of higher Minimum Support Prices to incentivize farmers for increasing production. Government is also implementing Schemes which, inter alia, include Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH), National Food Security Mission (NFSM), National Mission on Oilseeds and Oil Palm (NMOOP), etc for increasing agricultural production and productivity through appropriate interventions. Besides, Government is also implementing Price Stabilization Fund (PSF) to help moderate the volatility in prices of agri-horticultural commodities like pulses, onion, and potato.  (b) :  Increase in prices of food items is mainly on account of demand supply mismatch owing to shortfall in production because of adverse weather condition and seasonality, increased transportation costs, supply chain constraints like lack of storage facilities and artificial shortage created by hoarding and black marketing.*****
