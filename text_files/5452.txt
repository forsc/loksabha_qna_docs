The first list of SCs in relation to a State or Union Territory is by a notified order of the President. Any subsequent inclusion in, exclusion from and other modifications in the said list can only be made by an Act of Parliament as stipulated in clause (2) of Article 341. The Supreme Court of India has held through a catena of judgments that it is not open to State Governments or courts or tribunals or any other authority to modify, amend or alter the list of SCs specified in the notification issued under Clause (1) of Article 341.(c) & (d): Does not arise.****
