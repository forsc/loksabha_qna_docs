                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (c) The project proposal of Rajasthan for full utilisation of Yamuna water from Okhla head works through remodelling of existing canal system in Haryana was considered by Advisory Committee of Ministry of Water Resources on Irrigation, Flood Control and Multipurpose projects in its 80th meeting held on 07.02.2003, with certain observations which besides others, included concurrence of Govt. of Haryana for the cost of works to be carried out in their territory and taking up the construction in Haryana and Rajasthan simultaneously. Accordingly, Rajasthan Government had sent a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in 2003 to Haryana. But Haryana has not given its consent in spite of consistent efforts. In the year 2012, Detailed Project Report (DPR) of extension of Gurgaon Main Canal was submitted to CWC. The said DPR was treated as returned back by CWC due to non-compliance of outstanding comments of Advisory Committee held on 07.02.2003. The issue related to short supply of Yamuna water to Rajasthan from its allocated share at Okhla has been regularly discussed in various meetings held in Ministry, meetings of Upper Yamuna River Board (UYRB) and Upper Yamuna River Committee (UYRC).*****
