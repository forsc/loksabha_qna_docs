                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)  (a) & (b): After taking suo-motu cognizance of the twitter and other media reports about alleged violence against women including the cases of heinous crimes like rape and murder, an Inquiry Committee constituted by National Commission for Women (NCW) visited the State of West Bengal on 5th – 6th May, 2021. The Committee held consultation with various Government functionaries, institutions and violence affected individuals/ women. The Committee was informed of physical assault, threat calls, stone pelting, molestation etc. The Committee observed that the State Government was not taking any conclusive or effective steps to provide security to women and was neglecting the voice of women victims, the police appeared  to be supporting unlawful elements instead of protecting people of the State, and proper shelter homes were not available in the State.         "Police? and “Public Order? are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibility to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens including investigation and prosecution of crime against women and children rests primarily with the respective State Governments.          Nevertheless, the Central Government gives high priority to ensuring safety and security of women and has undertaken various legislative and schematic interventions in this regard. These include legislations such as ‘The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018’, ‘The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013’, ‘The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013’, ‘The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2006’, ‘The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961’, etc. The schemes/ projects include One Stop Centres (OSCs) for violence affected women, Universalisation of Women Helplines (WHL), Emergency Response Support System (ERSS) which is a pan-India single number (112)/ mobile app based system for emergencies, a cyber-crime reporting portal to report obscene content and assistance to States/ UTs for strengthening cyber forensic capabilities, safe city projects in 8 cities (Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow and Mumbai), training and skill development programs for Investigation Officers (IOs), Prosecution Officers (POs) and Medical Officers (MOs), distribution of Sexual Assault Evidence Collection (SAEC) Kits to States/ UTs, establishment of state of the art DNA Laboratory at CFSL, Chandigarh, assistance to 20 States/ UTs to strengthen Forensic Science Laboratories, assistance to States/ UTs for their respective victim compensation schemes under Central Victim Compensation Fund (CVCF), setting up of 1023 Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) for speedy disposal of cases of rape and cases under POCSO Act, setting up/ strengthening of Anti Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs) in all districts of the country, setting up/ strengthening of Women Help Desks (WHDs) at Police Stations, Integrated Emergency Response Management System  (IERMS) at 983 railway stations,  deployment and management of vehicle tracking platform etc. The Government has also put in place Investigation Tracking System for Sexual Offences, an online analytic tool for tracking and monitoring of investigation. A National Database on Sexual Offenders (NDSO) has also been created. In addition, Ministry of Women and Child Development and Ministry of Home Affairs have issued advisories to States/ UTs from time to time on various issues pertaining to safety and security of women and children. (c):       The Government of India implements the ‘Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012’, which provides for mandatory reporting, child friendly recording of statement and evidence and speedy trial of the cases. It is stipulated in the POCSO Act, 2012 that National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and State Commissions for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) shall monitor the implementation of the provisions of the Act. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 has been amended in 2019 to provide for more stringent punishments in cases of child sexual abuse. As already mentioned, for expeditious trial and disposal of cases related to rape and POCSO Act, the Government implements a scheme for setting up of 1023 Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs), including 389 exclusive POCSO Courts under which financial assistance has been provided to States/ UTs. Further, the Government has also provided financial support to States/ UTs for their victim compensation schemes. *****
