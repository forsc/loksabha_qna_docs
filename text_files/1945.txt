ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b): As per Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade(DPIIT), a Coordination Committee for affirmative action in the private Sector was set up by the Prime Minister Office in 2006. DPIIT is providing the secretarial assistance to the committee. So far 9 meetings of Coordination Committee have been held. In the first Coordination Committee meeting, it was stated that the best course for achieving progress on the issue of affirmative action is through voluntary action by the industry itself.In the context of reservation in private sector, the Industry representatives are of the view that reservation is not a solution but are willing to partner with the Government and appropriate agencies in enhancing and expanding current recruitment policy for the marginalized section, especially the SC and ST at all levels, as also to encourage skill development and training.Accordingly, the Apex Industry Associations namely Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and Associate Chamber of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHEM), have prepared voluntary Code of Conduct (VCC) for their member companies centered around education, employability, entrepreneurship and employment to achieve inclusion. Measures undertaken by the member of Industry Associations, inter-alia, includes scholarships, vocation training, entrepreneurship development programmes and coaching etc. Further, in the 8th Meeting of the Coordination Committee, the Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce & Industry (DICCI) has also been included as a stakeholder.(c) & (d): Does not arise.****
