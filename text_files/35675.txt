                                                                                                   ANSWER                         MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND PANCHAYATI RAJ                                    (SHRI GIRIRAJ SINGH)        (a)  & (f):      A Statement is laid on the Table of the House. Statement referred to in reply to Parts (a) to (f) of the Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 279 due for reply on 22.03.2022.(a), (b) and (e):   Registration of deed and documents is a concurrent subject as per Entry No.6 of the List III of VII Schedule of the Constitution. Documents / deeds are registered as per the Registration Act, 1908 applicable in a State / Union Territory (UT). The Central Government, through the Digital India Land Records Modernization Programme, a Central Sector Scheme, is providing 100% financial assistance to States/UTs inter alia to modernize land records and computerisation of registration. In order to have a uniform process for registration for deeds/documents, Department of Land Resources, after detailed consultation with States / Union Territories (UTs), with the help of National Informatics Centre (NIC) developed a common generic customizable software namely National Generic Document Registration System (NGDRS) that will address prevalent diversity on account of language, formats, terminology etc. and accommodate state specific needs.Field Testing of NGDRS were done in the States of Bihar, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. In each State / UT before rolling out of NGDRS, pilot testing as per requirement is done and User Acceptance Test (UAT) certificate is provided by the concerned State /UT to Software Development Unit (SDU), NIC, Pune. State Governments / UT Administration of Punjab, Andaman & Nicobar, Manipur, Goa, Jharkhand, Mizoram, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Dadar Nagar Haveli, Jammu and Kashmir, Chhattisgarh, Tripura and Ladakh have adopted and rolled out NGDRS.Technical support for customisation of software in the States /UTs is provided by the Software Development Unit (SDU), NIC, Pune.  (c) & (d):  The Department does not centrally maintain data relating to fake registration of documents in various Sub-Registrar Offices of the States /UTs. Integration of Aadhaar Number with land records which has now been made a component of DILRMP and authentication of identity of sellers and buyers of properties using consent based Aadhaar authentication, will check impersonation, fraudulent transactions and land disputes.(f):      Rolling out / adoption of NGDRS depends on preparedness of the States and UTs. Thirteen States / UTs have, so far, adopted and rolled out this software in their respective States / UTs. Department is ready to extend technical support through NIC to all the remaining States /UTs for customisation and adoption of NGDRS in their respective States / UTs as per their requirement.                                          *****
