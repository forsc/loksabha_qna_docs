ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING (RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a) to (c): National Statistical Office (NSO) takes up socio-economic survey on  different subjects based on the requests of various Ministries including health. The last survey on Health was conducted by NSO during July, 2017 -June, 2018 and the report of the same has been published which is available at www.mospi.gov.in(d) & (e): Yes, all efforts are being made to ensure that there is no vacancy at the level of Senior Statistical Officer (SSO) and Junior Statistical Officer (JSO) of Subordinate Statistical Service (SSS). The Posts of SSOs are filled through promotion from the post of JSO. During 2020, the promotion to SSO from JSO have been processed for the entire panel year of 2020, keeping in view the expected vacancies that may arise at the level of SSOs in 2020. The JSOs are recruited through the Combined Graduate Level Examination conducted by the Staff Selection Commission.  However, the shortage of Statistical Officers of various surveys is met by hiring contractual staff i.e. Field Investigators, Field Officers and Consultants.
