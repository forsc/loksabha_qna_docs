PMAY-U is a demand driven scheme. Selection of beneficiaries is made by States/ UTs as per the eligibility criteria prescribed in PMAY-U guidelines and not as per any 2011 Survey list. States/ UTs have undertaken demand survey under PMAY-U for assessing actual demand of housing for eligible beneficiaries.Total assessed demand of houses reported by States/ UTs under the scheme is 112.24 lakhs. Based on the project proposals received from the States/UTs, more than 115 lakh houses have been sanctioned across the country.In order to achieve the vision of ‘Housing for All’, Ministry monitors progress of the Scheme through periodic review meetings, video-conferences and field visits. Ministry has advised States/ UTs to expedite the construction of sanctioned houses so that all houses are completed within the stipulated timeline.Further, in order to complement the efforts of States/UTs for providing shelter for the urban homeless, MoHUA is also administering a scheme ‘Shelter for Urban Homeless (SUH)’ under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM), through respective States/UTs. It focuses on providing permanent shelters equipped with basic facilities to the urban homeless. The guidelines of SUH provide for third party survey by urban local bodies so as to assess accurately the need for shelters at suitable locations.As per information received from the States/ UTs, a total of 2,414 shelters for urban homeless have been sanctioned under DAY-NULM. Out of these, 1,678 shelters are operational.                                               *****
