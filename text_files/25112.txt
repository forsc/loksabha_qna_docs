ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI PANKAJ CHAUDHARY)(a)   The net direct tax collection in the 1st quarter of FY 2021-2022 is Rs. 2,46,519.82 crore as against 1,17,783.87 crore during the same period of previous FY 2020-21 representing a growth of 109.3%. Similarly net  indirect tax collection in the 1st quarter of FY 2021-2022 is Rs. 3,11,398 crore as against 1,82,862 crore  during the same period of previous FY 2020-21 representing a growth of 70.3%.(b)  Government has not borrowed long-term securities from RBI in 2020-21. However, to meet the short term cash mismatches, Government avails the Ways and Means Advance (WMA)/Overdraft (OD) on a regular basis. Under this facility, WMA/OD to the extent of Rs. 3,98,990 crore was availed from RBI during 2020-21. The same was fully repaid to RBI within 2020-21 itself. RBI transferred a surplus of Rs. 57,128 crore as non-tax revenue receipts to Government in 2020-21. In 2021-22 also Government does not plan to borrow any long-term securities from RBI.  (c )   The Government’s plan to meet its fiscal deficit in the FY 2020-21 (RE) and 2021-22 (BE) are as under:                                                                                     (Rs. in crore)Source	2020-21 (RE)	(2021-22 (BE)Market Borrowing (Net)	1048788*	917708*Short term Borrowing (Net)	225000	50000External Borrowings 	54522	1514Sec.

Further, it is stated that in FY 2020-21. Central had borrowed Rs. 1.1 lakh crore under a special window and passed on to the States as back-to-back loan to help the States to meet the resource gap due to short-release of compensation on account of inadequate balance in the Compensation Fund. Subsequent to deliberation in the 43rd GST Council meeting, it has been decided that the Centre is borrowing Rs. 1.59 lakh crores from the market through special window in current FY and passing it on to the States/UTs as a back to back loan in appropriate tranches as was done in last year. As per this decision Rs. 75000 crore has been released to States/UTs on 15.07.2021.(d)    India’s sovereign rating by the major rating agencies from financial year 2004-05 to 2021-22 are as Annexure. It may be seen that India’s rating in last few years have remained unchanged except for rating by Moody’s Investor Services which changed from Baa3 to Baa2 in 2017 and again to Naa3 in 2020. Thus, changes in fiscal deficit do not seem to have directly impacted the sovereign rating of the country. ***** Annexure Standard & Poor’s GlobalRating status	Foreign Currency	Local Currency	Ratings	Outlook	Ratings	Outlook 2021 	BBB-	Stable	BBB-	Stable 2020	BBB- 	Stable 	BBB-  	Stable 2019	BBB- 	Stable 	BBB- 	Stable 2018	BBB- 	Stable  No ratings were given for local currency2017	BBB- 	Stable  2016	BBB- 	Stable	2015 	BBB-  	Stable	2014 	BBB-	Stable 	2013 	BBB-	Negative 	2012 	BBB-	Negative 	2011	BBB-	Stable 	2010 	BBB-	Stable 	2009 	BBB-	Negative 	2008 	BBB-	Stable 	2007 	BBB-	Stable 	2006 	BB+	Positive	2005 	BB+	Positive 	2004 	BB 	Positive 	Moody’s Investor ServicesRating status 	Foreign Currency	Local Currency	Ratings	Outlook 	Ratings	Outlook2021 	Baa3	Negative  	 No ratings were given. 2020 	Baa3	Negative 	Baa3	Negative 2019 	Baa2	Negative	 Baa2	Negative2018	Baa2	Stable	 No ratings were given for local currency2017	Baa2	Stable (revised from positive)	 Baa2	Stable 2016	Baa3	Positive	Baa3	Positive2015	Baa3	Positive	Baa3	Positive 2014	Baa3 	Stable 	Baa3	Stable 2013	Baa3 	Stable 	Baa3	Stable 2012 	Baa3 	Stable 	Baa3	Stable 2011	Baa3 	Stable 	Baa3	Stable 2010	Baa3 	Positive 	Ba1	Positive 2009 	Baa3 	Positive 	Ba2	Positive 2008	Baa3 	Stable 	Aa3	Stable 2007	Baa3	Stable 	Aa3	Stable 2006 	Baa3 	Stable 	Aa3	Stable 2005	Baa3	Stable 	No ratings given 2004 	Baa3	Stable 	 FITCH Ratings Rating status	Foreign Currency	Local Currency	Ratings	Outlook	Ratings	Outlook2021 	BBB-  	Negative	BBB-	Negative2020	BBB- 	Negative 	BBB-	Negative 2019	BBB-  	Stable 	BBB-	Stable  2018 	BBB- 	Stable 	BBB-	Stable 2017 	BBB- 	Stable 	BBB-	Stable 2016 	BBB-  	Stable 	BBB-	Stable 2015 	BBB-  	Stable 	BBB-	Stable 2014	BBB- 	Stable 	No ratings were given 2013	BBB- 	Stable 	2012	BBB- 	Negative 	2011	BBB- 	Stable 	2010	BBB- 	Stable 	2009	BBB- 	Stable 	2008	BBB- 	Stable 	2007	BBB- 	Stable 	2006	BBB- 	Stable 	2005	BB+	Stable 	2004	BB+	Stable 	******
