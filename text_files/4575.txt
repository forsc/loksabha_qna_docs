Thanjavur airport project tenders were called by AAI however the same were cancelled due to non-availability of working permission from IAF. ;;(c): Completion of airport projects depends upon many factors such as availability of land, availability of mandatory clearances , financial closure etc. by the airport developer which involve a lengthy and time consuming process. As such, no timeline has been decided to make the airport functional.
