                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) Presently, the Environmental Clearance process for Thermal Power Projects is governed by the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006 and its amendments. While prescribing the Terms of Reference for conducting EIA studies for Thermal Power Plants, studies related to water source sustainability, details of competing downstream users and impacts of withdrawal on availability of water to all other users are stipulated. During the final appraisal, source sustainability study is examined thoroughly and the Environmental Clearance is accorded only after confirming the availability of sufficient water without compromising the needs of other competent users including e-flow and after obtaining approval for firm allocation of water to Power Plant from the State Water Resources Department.
