ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (d) The National Action Plan on climate change (NAPCC) encompasses eight missions in the specific areas of Solar Energy, Enhanced Energy Efficiency, Sustainable Habitat, Water, Sustaining the Himalayan Eco-system, Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change, Green India, and Sustainable Agriculture. These specific areas tackle core issues pertaining to climate change, outlining steps to simultaneously advance India’s development and climate change related-objectives of adaptation and mitigation. NAPCC is guided by the principles - (i) protecting the poor and vulnerable sections of society through an inclusive and sustainable development strategy, sensitive to climate change; (ii) achieving national growth through ecological sustainability (iii) devising efficient and cost-effective strategies for end use Demand Side Management (iv) deploying appropriate technologies for both adaptation and mitigation of greenhouse gases emissions (v) engineering new and innovative forms of market, regulatory and voluntary mechanisms to promote sustainable development (vi) effecting implementation of programmes by including civil society and local government institutions and through public-private partnership; and (vii) welcoming international cooperation for research, development, sharing and transfer of technologies. Under the NAPCC Government has initiated several activities, schemes, programmes under the national Missions. The activities in the areas of solar energy, energy efficiency and forestry sector are linked with reduction in carbon emissions. Other Missions also support carbon emissions reduction as co-benefit. Consistent with the approach of NAPCC, State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs) are already in place for 33 States and Union Territories of the country, including the State of Gujarat. States and Union Territories have indicated their sector specific and cross sectoral priority actions for combating climate change in its SAPCC. Gujarat’s SAPCC has identified priority areas for the State like water, agriculture, health, forests and biodiversity, coastal regions, infrastructure, energy efficiency and renewable energy, transport, waste, urban development and rural livelihood. (e)	The share of coal in the energy basket is going to remain significant in years ahead, while there is push for renewable/non-fossil based energy. ****
