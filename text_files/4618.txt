ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a): ‘Land’ and ‘Colonisation’ being the State subjects, the State/ Union Territory (UT) Governments frame policies and implement schemes for improving the living conditions of slum dwellers. However, Government of India through its programmatic interventions viz. Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Swachh Bharat Mission - Urban (SBM-U) and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) {PMAY(U)} Mission, has been making overarching efforts by assisting States/ UTs to provide houses and basic civic amenities to the urban poor including slum dwellers residing in towns/ cities of the country. AMRUT focuses on water supply, sewerage and septage management, storm water drainage, non-motorized urban transport and development of green spaces/ parks etc. in 500 Mission cities in the country. Under AMRUT, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) approves only State Annual Action Plans (SAAPs) submitted by each State/ UT and releases Central Assistance (CA) as per the Mission guidelines. Selection, appraisal, approval and implementation of individual projects under SAAP in Mission cities including slum areas is done by the respective States/ UTs.	Under the Mission, SAAPs for the entire Mission period (2015-2020) amounting to Rs. 77,640 crore has been approved by the MoHUA for all the States/ UTs in 3 rounds; SAAP-I (2015-16), SAAP-II (2016-17) and SAAP-III (2017-20). Central funds for implementation of projects are allocated SAAP-wise and not year-wise under the Mission. The State/UT-wise details of approved SAAP sizes and committed Central Assistance under AMRUT are at Annexure-I.	 	Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U) mainly aims at making urban India free from open defecation and achieving 100% scientific management of municipal solid waste in all 4,041 statutory towns of the country. Under SBM-U, funds are released for providing Community/ Public Toilets (CT/ PT) and Individual Household Latrines (IHHL) on need basis to all citizens of urban areas. The CTs and IHHLs are targeted on the under-privileged sections of the society who cannot afford these facilities. The Public Toilets (PT) on the other hand are targeted for the floating population and common persons in public places in urban areas. The funds released for CT/ PTs and IHHLs under SBM-U are based on projects conceptualised, planned and executed by the respective States/ UTs for urban areas including slum areas.  State/ UT-wise details of funds released under SBM-U during the last three years and current year are at Annexure-II. Under ‘In-Situ’ Slum Rehabilitation (ISSR) component of PMAY(U) mission, there is a provision to provide all weather pucca houses to all eligible urban households including slum dwellers. PMAY(U) mission envisages that houses constructed by the States/ UTs should have basic civic infrastructure like water, sanitation, sewerage, road, electricity etc. The State/ UT-wise details of Central Assistance sanctioned and released during each of the last three years and the current year under ISSR component of PMAY(U) is at Annexure-III. (b) & (c): National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Government of India conducts survey on particulars of slum periodically.  NSSO has reported that at present there is no such proposal to conduct a survey of slums in urban areas and locate them with the help of remote sensing and geo information system.(d): The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoH&FW) has reported that the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) was launched as a sub-mission under an overarching National Health Mission (NHM) on May 1, 2013 for providing equitable and quality primary healthcare services to the urban population with special focus on slum and vulnerable sections of the society. The NUHM is implemented through the State Health Department or the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). MoH&FW has added that NUHM envisages setting up of Urban Primary Health Centre (U-PHC) in cities and towns with more than 50,000 population as well as district and State headquarters having more than 30,000 population, Urban     Community Health Centres (U-CHC) in cities with more than five lakh population and targeted interventions for slum areas such as Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) for every 10,000 population, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) for every 1,000-2,500 population and Mahila Arogya Samiti (MAS) for every 250-500 population.                                *****
