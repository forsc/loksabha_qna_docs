(b) Yes, Sir. The details of funds allocated/spent by the Government on the development of National Highways in last three years are as under-Year	Funds allocated for NHAI projects from toll remittances(Rs./Crores)	Funds allocated for the Permanent Bridge Fee Fund through State PWDs (Rs./Crores)2016-17	7500.00	72.292017-18	8462.14	21.422018-19	9570.13	04.092019-20 (upto May, 2019)	2650.00	------In addition, Government through Toll-Operate-Transfer (TOT) has received an amount of Rs. 9,681.50 crore from the concessionaire and the same has been deposited in Consolidated Fund of India (CFI). The entire proceeds of Rs.9,681.50 crore under TOT was released to National Highways authority of India (NHAI) during FY 2018-19. However, toll plough-back is a small component of the overall allocation for the sector.(c) & (d) The buses of Kerala State Road Transport Corporation are not paying user fee on fee plazas of NHAI. NHAI has taken up the issue several times with the State Government and has also raised claim on State Government of Kerala to reimburse the loss in toll revenue. Further, six fee plazas under public funded projects and one fee plaza under Public Private Partnership (PPP) project are non-operational in different states due to public agitation and the matter is still unresolved despite constant follow up of NHAI with the respective State Government. The details of such fee plazas are at ‘Annexure-B’.
