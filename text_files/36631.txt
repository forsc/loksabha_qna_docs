                                                        MINISTER OF STATE					(SHRI AJAY BHATT)      IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE(a) & (b): Yes, Sir. The tableaux proposals received from various States/UTs are evaluated in a series of meetings of the Expert Committee. These tableaux proposals are examined on the basis of theme, concept, design and their visual impact. Regular instructions for modification in tableaux proposals are given during the meetings of the Expert Committee. Due to limited time allotted for tableaux in the overall duration of the parade, shortlisting of tableaux is done by the Expert Committee. (c): The list is attached as Annexure.(d): Yes, Sir. Letter from Government of Kerala was received for inclusion of their tableau in Republic Day Parade, 2022. However, the decision for inclusion or exclusion of tableau for Republic Day Parade is taken on the recommendation of the Expert Committee.(e): Every State/UT proposes a tableau with a certain theme/social message. For example the theme of the tableau of Maharashtra was ‘Biodiversity and State Bio-Symbols of Maharashtra’; the theme of the tableau of Uttar Pradesh was ‘One district one product and Kashi Vishwanath Dham’; the theme of the tableau of Arunachal Pradesh was ‘Anglo-Abor (Adi) wars’; the theme of the tableau of Haryana was ‘Haryana number one in sports’ etc. The final selection of tableau for participating in Republic Day Parade is made by the Expert Committee on the basis of the theme, concept, design and visual impact of the tableaux proposals. ****
