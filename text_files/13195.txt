ANSWER




                                                                          THE MINISTER OF HEAVY INDUSTRIES & PUBLIC ENTERPRISES                                  (SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR)(a) & (b): Yes, Sir. The Government has notified the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India (FAME-India II) scheme to provide subsidies to the Electric Vehicles (EVs) being used as transport vehicles. FAME India Scheme Phase-II is being implemented for a period of 3 years w.e.f. 01stApril, 2019 with a total budgetary support of Rs. 10,000 crore.  This phase will mainly focus on supporting electrification of public & shared transportation and aims to support through demand incentive approximately 7000 e-Buses, 5 lakh e-3 Wheelers, 55000 e-4 Wheeler Passenger Cars and 10 lakh e-2 Wheelers. With greater emphasis on providing affordable & environment friendly public transportation options for the masses, the scheme will be applicable mainly to vehicles used for public transport or those registered for commercial purposes in e-3W, e-4W and e-bus segments. Privately owned registered e-2W will also be covered under the scheme as a mass segment.  In addition, creation of charging infrastructure will be also supported to address range anxiety among users of electric vehicles.(c) & (d): Since Automobile is a liberalized sector and 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) by automatic route is permitted in this sector, the Department of Heavy Industry is not mandated to maintain the data related to manufacturing of vehicles, including EVs. However, in the first phase of the FAME-India Scheme about 2.8 lakh hybrid and electric vehicles are supported by way of demand incentive amounting to about Rs 359 crore. Further, DHI sanctioned 425 electric and hybrid buses to various cities in the country with total cost of about 300 Crores.  Under Phase-II of FAME India Scheme, about 14,160 Electric Vehicles have been supported till 26.02.2020 by way of Demand Incentive amounting to about Rs. 50 Cr.  Further, 5595 electrical buses have been sanctioned to various State/ City Transport Undertakings under Phase-II of the Scheme. This involves Government incentive of around Rs. 2800 Cr.                                                       *****
