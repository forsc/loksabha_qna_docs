ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c): There are 3 Nos. of Level Crossings (LCs) i.e. 247, 248, 249 near Sandila Railway Station. All these LCs qualify for their replacement by Road over Bridge (ROB) on cost sharing basis with State Government as traffic density of these LCs is more than 1 lakh Train Vehicle Unit (TVU). Accordingly, State Government has been approached to submit the formal proposal for consent of ROB at these locations alongwith necessary consents for sharing of cost and closure of LC. No proposal in this regard has, however, been received from State Government.*****
