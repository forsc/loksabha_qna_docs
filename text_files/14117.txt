                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a)	 to (d):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2859 BY SHRI JUAL ORAM TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 11.03.2020 REGARDING CONSTRUCTION WORK OF TALCHER-BIMLAGARH RAILWAY LINE  (a) to (d):  Railway has taken up the work of Talcher-Bimlagarh (150 km) New Line project.  The estimated cost of the project is `1928 crore. So far, an expenditure of `788.63 crore has been incurred upto February,  2020.  Budget Estimate (BE) outlay of `150 crore has been provided in the Budget 2019-20.  So far, 20 km long Talcher-Sunakhani section of the project has been completed.  Further work has been taken up in around 23.5 km length from Sunakhani station,  km 20.00 to km 43.50. Further land in remaining sections is not available and Railway has approached State Government of Odisha from time to time to expedite early handing over of remaining 1621 acre land. BUDGET ALLOCATION (FOR THE PROJECTS FALLING FULLY/PARTLY IN THE STATE OF ODISHA):Average annual Budget allocation for the projects, falling fully/partly in the State of Odisha for Infrastructure projects & safety works during 2014-19 has increased to `4,126 crore per year from `838 crore per year during 2009-14. Thus, the average annual budget allocation during 2014-19 is 392% more than average annual budget allocation during 2009-14.Total allocation of Budget for Infrastructure projects & safety works, falling fully/partly in State of Odisha, in 2019-20 is `4,568 crore,  which is 445% more than average annual budget allocation during  2009-14, (`838 crore).COMMISSIONING OF PROJECTS (FALLING FULLY/PARTLY IN THE STATE OF ODISHA):During 2009-14, 267 km (56 km of New line, 83 km of Gauge conversion and 128 km of Doubling projects), falling fully/partly in the State of Odisha, have been commissioned at an average rate of 53 km per year.  During 2014-19, 588 km (136 km of New line and 452 km of Doubling projects), falling fully/partly in the State of Odisha, have been commissioned at an average rate of 118 km per year, which is 120% more than commissioning achieved during 2009-14.The completion of the project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions, cooperation and zeal of the State Government for early completion of project, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions of working agencies/contractors etc.  All these factors affect the completion time of the project, which is finely worked out at the completion stage. As such, firm completion time of the project can not be fixed at this stage.The project-wise detail including cost, expenditure and outlay are available in public domain on Indian Railways’ website i.e. www.indianrailways.gov.in >Ministry of Railways >Railway Board >About Indian Railways >Railway Board Directorates >Finance (Budget)>Railway-wise Works Machinery & Rolling Stock Programme > Regular Budget (year).*****
