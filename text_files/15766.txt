ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  Central Ground Water Board is periodically monitoring the ground water levels throughout the Country on a regional scale, through a network of monitoring wells. In order to assess the decline in water level on a long-term basis, Pre-monsoon water level data collected by CGWB during Pre-monsoon 2019 has been compared with the decadal average (2009-2018). Analysis of water level data indicates that about 61% of the wells monitored have registered decline in ground water levels, mostly in the range of 0 – 2 m. Details are given at Annexure.(b) & (c)  Ground water levels in various parts of the Country are declining because of continuous withdrawal necessitated by increased demand of fresh water for various uses, vagaries of rainfall, increased population, industrialization & urbanization etc.  The Dynamic Ground Water Resources of the country are being periodically assessed jointly by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and State Governments. As per the 2017 assessment, total Annual Ground Water Recharge is 432 Billion Cubic Meter (BCM) and the Annual Ground Water Extraction for all uses is 249 BCM, out of which around 221 BCM & 27 BCM is for irrigation use & industrial/domestic uses respectively. ***** ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) of Unstarred Question No. 4189 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 19.03.2020 regarding “Declining Ground Water Level”.State-wise Decadal  Water Level Fluctuation With Mean [Premonsoon (2009 to 2018] and Premonsoon 2019S.
