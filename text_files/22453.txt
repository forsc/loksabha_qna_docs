Operational preparedness of the Armed Forces is reviewed from time to time based on the threat perception.  Further, development of the combat capabilities of the Armed Forces to tackle the entire spectrum of security challenges is an ongoing process.To meet the unforeseen situation/ contingencies across the border, Armed Forces have been granted Emergency Procurement powers with simplified procedures to facilitate quick procurements, thereby ensuring that critical capabilities of Armed Forces are maintained.  Additionally, Armed Forces continue to acquire capabilities through routine Annual Acquisition process.Greater thrust towards indigenization of defence acquisitions and Military Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) is being carried out.*****
