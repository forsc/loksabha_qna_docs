ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                                (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)	& (b) No. The rationale behind the Central Vista Development/  Redevelopment Project is as under:	Parliament House building construction was started in 1921 and commissioned in 1927 and is almost 100 years old. This Parliament building was designed to house the Imperial Legislative Council and was not planned for a bicameral legislature. Two floors were added to the structure in 1956 to cater to the demand for more space. The Library building was also a later addition. 	This building had to be modified from time to time to a large extent to suit the purpose of a modern Parliament. New constructions and modifications have been done in an ad-hoc manner. Over repair and over maintenance has led to poor condition of the building and issues of structural safety. Further, over the years, the parliamentary activities and the number of people working therein and visitors have increased manifold. Therefore, it is showing signs of distress and over utilization and is not able to meet the current requirements in terms of space, amenities and technology.The number of Lok Sabha seats has remained unaltered at 545 based on the delimitation carried out on the basis of 1971 Census. It is likely to increase substantially after 2026 as the freeze on total number of seats is only till 2026.The Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha are packed to capacity and have no space for addition of seats when the Parliament is expanded. Seating arrangements are cramped and cumbersome; there are no desks beyond second row and movement is extremely constrained. The Central Hall has seating only for about 440 persons.  When Joint Sessions are held a large number of temporary seats have to be arranged in the aisles.  This arrangement undermines the dignity of the institution and poses security challenges as movements are highly restricted. The offices of the Central Government are spread over different locations in Delhi which lead to inefficiencies and difficulty in inter-departmental coordination. Also, this leads to higher travel time causing traffic congestion and pollution. Further, most of the existing buildings have outlived their structural lives of around 50 years and are not earthquake safe. These buildings suffer from certain construction & service integration deficiencies, inefficient use of land, inadequate facilities,  outdated infrastructure and lack of coherent architectural identity. They lack modern office facilities and require regular retrofitting and refurbishment. Further, large number of central government offices are housed in rented accommodations.The main avenue of Central Vista in New Delhi, which extends from Rashtrapati Bhawan to India Gate, is one of the most visited tourist places in Delhi. It is used for Republic Day parade and various other functions which showcase the Capital to the world. However, it lacks basic public facilities, amenities and parking. The unorganized vending and haphazard parking leads to congestion and gives a poor public perception. The water bodies and greens require proper upkeep. Therefore, there is a need for its upgradation. Government of India has, therefore, decided to develop a New Parliament Building, Common Central Secretariat and redevelop the Central Vista. The objectives of this project are:•	A new Parliament Building with space and technology to meet the present and emerging needs of vibrant Indian democracy.•	Common Central Secretariat with all Ministries in a single location for efficiency and synergy in functioning.•	Central Vista to be redeveloped as a world class public space and venue of events.The project shall generate direct and indirect employment which will contribute in boosting the economy.(c) These are yet to be worked out for entire project. Decisions shall be taken for each part component of the Project, as and when they are approved,  after obtaining all mandatory clearances.                                             *****
