                                                         ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a&b): Land-related disputes are in the nature of civil cases. As per data available on the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG), as on 20th June, 2019, civil cases constitute 88.04 lakh cases and criminal cases constitute 222.62 lakh cases out of the total 310.67 lakh cases pending in various District and Subordinate Courts. Further, civil cases constitute 18.73 lakh cases, criminal cases constitute 12.12 lakh cases and writ cases constitute 12.64 lakh cases out of the total 43.50 lakh cases pending in various High Courts. However, NJDG does not separately provide the number of pending land-related disputes. Details of land-related disputes in revenue courts in various States is maintained by the respective States. (c) & (d):Land and its management falls under the domain of State Governments. Department of Land Resources, Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India is, however, implementing the `Digital India Land Records Modernisation Programme that, inter alia, provides for digitization of Records of Right, cadastral maps, computerization of registration and integration of registration with the revenue offices, ultimately resulting in minimization of land disputes, to some extent.
