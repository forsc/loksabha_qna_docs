                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b) Yes Sir. Details of changes in the carbon stock are informed to the Government through the biennially published ‘India State of Forest Report’(ISFR) since 2013 by the Forest Survey of India. The details of the increase in the carbon stock are shown in Table 1 of Annexure. The increase in carbon stock is attributed to the increase in the forest cover and corresponding increase in the growing stock, as published in the ISFRs from 2013 to 2019.  (c) No Sir. The Government has not taken any decision to reduce the carbon stocks. Rather, it aims to increase the carbon stocks in the country, particularly in its forests and also through trees outside forests.(d) Does not arise.***
