ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) to (d) :  At present 37 nos. Hydro Electric Projects (above 25 MW) aggregating to 12,823.5 MW are under construction in the country including Maharashtra, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The details of funds sanctioned, allocated & utilised under these projects during the last three years and the current year, along with details of cost/time overrun as well as reasons therefor in respect of the under-construction Hydro-electric projects are given at Annexure-I. These projects are under construction – so no generation is taking place in these power projects.In respect of Thermal Power Projects, as per Section 7 of the Electricity Act, 2003, "any generating company may establish, operate and maintain a generating station without obtaining a license/permission under this Act, if it complies with the technical standards relating to connectivity with the grid. Accordingly, sanction of the Government is not required for setting up of thermal power projects."The list of under-construction Thermal power projects is at Annexure-II. Out of these, 22 nos. of thermal power projects aggregating to capacity of 19,280 MW are partially commissioned and generated electricity (From April to December 2020) aggregating to 48,321.14 BU. The details of funds sanctioned, allocated & utilised under these projects during the last three years and the current year, along with details of cost/time overrun in respect of the under-construction Thermal power projects are given at Annexure-II. The main reasons for delay in completion of these projects are as under:•	Work stopped due to COVID pandemic •	Contractual Issues•	Readiness of railway line / Railway sidings •	Delay in supply by equipment manufacturers•	Delay in land acquisitions •	Disruption of work due to Local issues •	Litigations •	Delay due to change in design•	Delay due to readiness of Balance of Plant•	Delay in getting coal mines, coal linkages.The following action/steps are taken by the Ministry of Power/CEA to ensure timely completion of Power Projects:(i)	Ministry of Power/ Central Electricity Authority (CEA) monitor the progress of under-construction power projects through frequent site visits and interaction with the developers & other stakeholders. CEA holds review meetings periodically with the developers and other stakeholders to identify and resolve issues critical for commissioning of Pr`ojects.(ii)	Regular reviews are also undertaken in Ministry of Power (MoP) to identify the constraint areas to facilitate faster resolution of inter-Ministerial and other outstanding issues.(iii)	In case of Central Power Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) projects, the project implementation parameters/ milestones are incorporated in the annual MoU signed between respective CPSU''s and Ministry of Power and the same are monitored during the quarterly performance review meetings of CPSU''s and other meetings held in MoP/CEA.(iv)	Various matters related with project implementation are being taken up with State Government/District Administration for facilitating the support in resolving the issues to the project implementing agencies.(v)	Matters are taken up with State Government/District Administration for extending help to the project implementing agencies in resolving Right of Way (ROW) issues.(vi)	As and when required, issues are also reviewed in the PRAGATI portal of PMO for proactive governance and timely implementation.******
