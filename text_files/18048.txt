ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (c) Since September 2019, Pakistan has attempted to designate four Indian nationals (who had previously worked in Afghanistan) by the UN Security Council Committee pursuant to Resolution 1267. However, the 1267 Sanctions Committee, based on its internal procedures, has not approved the request.Globally, as a result of Government’s persistent efforts, there is enhanced concern in the international community at terrorism emanating from Pakistan, including the continuing activities of internationally designated terrorist entities and individuals such as Jamaat-ud Dawa (JuD), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Jaish-e-Mohammad, Hizbul Mujahideen. International community strongly condemned the cross-border terrorist attack in Pulwama in February 2019. Several countries have called upon Pakistan to not allow its territory to be used for terrorism in any manner.	Many terrorist entities and individuals who find shelter in Pakistan and are also engaged in terrorism against India have been proscribed by the United Nations (UN), the European Union and other countries. On 01 May 2019, the United Nations 1267 Sanctions Committee designated Masood Azhar, the leader of Jaish-e-Mohammad, as a UN proscribed terrorist. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) at its Plenary in June 2018, notified Pakistan in the ‘Grey List’ due to continuing terror financing related concerns, including with respect to the UN proscribed terrorist entities like LeT, JuD and Falah-i-Insaniyat Foundation.Pakistan has been targeting Indian professionals working in Afghanistan through a variety of ways. Several Indians working in Afghanistan on various development projects have been attacked and kidnapped over the past 12 years. With the assistance of Government of Afghanistan, India has been able to secure release of many Indians from captivity. In addition, Indian Embassy and its Consulates have also been attacked. ***
