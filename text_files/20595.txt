So far, 19.27 lakh house under BLC vertical have been completed/delivered to beneficiaries throughout the country, including 14,708 houses  in the State of Maharashtra. (b)	The release of central funds is incumbent on various compliances as per scheme guidelines. The issues which are being faced to release funds to the State Government of Maharashtra are Utilisation Certificates (UCs) for funds released by the Union Government, Aadhaar seeding of beneficiaries in the Management Information System (MIS);  Action Taken Report (ATR) on the recommendations of Third-Party Quality Monitoring Agencies (TPQMA), Geo-tagging of various stages of construction of houses/ projects; registration of projects under Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), etc.(c)	For successful implementation of the scheme and in order to achieve the vision of ‘Housing for All’ by 2022, this Ministry has taken the following measures:I.	PMAY-U through its four verticals has adopted a cafeteria approach to suit the needs of individuals based on the geographical conditions, topography, economic conditions, availability of land, infrastructure etc. All houses constructed under the scheme have provision of basic amenities like water supply, electricity, kitchen and toilet. II.	The on-ground implementation of the scheme is done by States/UTs through their Urban Local Bodies/Implementing Agencies in the spirit of cooperative federalism. PMAY-U guidelines provide flexibility to States/UTs for assessing the housing demand, appraisal and approval of projects.III.	To ensure uninterrupted flow of funds, in addition to budgetary resources, National Urban Housing Fund (NUHF) for ?60,000 crore has been created for raising Extra Budgetary Resources (EBR) in phases for rapid implementation of the scheme. Moreover, an ‘Affordable Housing Fund’ (AHF) of ?10,000 crore has been created in National Housing Bank (NHB) using the Priority Sector Lending Shortfall in Banks/Financial Institutions to reduce interest burden on housing loans in Affordable housing segment. IV.	Aadhaar validation of beneficiaries, funds transfer through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode, geo-tagging of projects and houses, social audit, third party quality monitoring, robust centralized Management Information System (MIS) and tools like CLSS Awas Portal and application tracker are provisioned to ensure transparency and accountability. V.	Alternative and innovative technologies have been promoted under the scheme for rapid delivery of houses. VI.	This Ministry regularly monitors the progress of implementation of the scheme through periodic review meetings/video-conferencing and field visits.                                            *****
