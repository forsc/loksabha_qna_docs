                                                        THE MINISTER OF AYUSH(SHRI SARBANANDA SONOWAL)(a) & (b)	No, Sir. There is no such proposal to launch any special programme to prevent anaemia among children by the use of ayurveda, naturopathy and homoeopathy in the country. However, under Ayush in Public Health (PHI) component of Central Sector Scheme of Ayurswasthya Yojana, there is a provision to promote Ayush interventions for community healthcare including Iron deficiency Anaemia and documentation of the efficacy of Ayush systems in various public health issues.	Under PHI scheme, the Ministry of Ayush has approved eight projects to prevent Anaemia by the use of Ayush systems of medicine in the country. The details of such projects are furnished at Annexure.	Further, Ministry of Ayush has launched a composite nutritional guideline as “Ayush Dietary Advisory for Kuposhan Mukt Bharat” to improve nutritional outcomes in children, pregnant women and lactating mothers with Ayush practices and principles. This guideline has been endorsed by the Ministry of Women and Child Development and circulated to the State/UT Governments to address this problem.(c)	Does not arise.
