Ambient Air Quality for Boisar is not available with CPCB since it is not covered under NAMP network.Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) has launched National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) on 10 January, 2019 as a national level strategy for pan India implementation to reduce air pollution levels across the country. Taking into account the available international experiences and national studies, the tentative national level target of 20%–30% reduction of PM2.5 and PM10 concentration by 2024 is proposed under the NCAP.The states/UTs with non-attainment cities were directed to formulateand implement city specific action plan for reducing the air pollution. Further, under NCAP Sates have been directed to constitute several committees at State level namely Steering Committee headed by Chief Secretary of the State; Monitoring Committee headed by Pr. Secretary (Environment) of the State Government; and Implementation Committee headed by either District Magistrate or Commissioner of the Municipal Corporation for implementation and monitoring of the city specific action plans to reduce air pollution.
