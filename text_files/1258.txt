                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE; MINISTER OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY; AND MINISTER OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????; ??????? ?? ???????????? ??????; ?? ?????? ??????? ??????( (a) to (d):  A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT AS REFERRED IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO.115 ON 28/6/2019 REGARDING INSPIRE FACULTY(a) & (b): The Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE) Faculty Fellowship Scheme of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India (GOI), offers an attractive fellowship amount and an independent research grant for 5 years to meritorious Ph.D. holders so that they are able to pursue high-quality post-doctoral research, establish themselves as independent researchers and become competitive for regular positions that may come up in the academic and research institutions of the country. With effect from October 2018, the fellowship amount has been increased by 56% from Rs.80,000/- to Rs.1,25,000/- p.m. and the amount of research grant is Rs.7 lakh peryear. The Scheme does not offer any guarantee for regular employment after the 5-year duration of Fellowship. However, given their meritorious record, their domain knowledge and the stringent guidelines followed for their selection, DST has already requested the institutions where the INSPIRE Faculty Fellows pursue their post-doctoral research to consider them as potential candidates for their regular positions when such positions become available, subject to their fulfilling the institutional criteria. DST has also requested the institutions to provide them conducive atmosphere for work.(c) & (d): DST has already created a new fellowship under its autonomous body, Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), called the SERB Research Scientist Scheme, which offers another two-year support, possibly extendable by one more year, to INSPIRE Faculty Fellows who are unable to get regular or permanent position at the end of the 5-year term of their INSPIRE Faculty Fellowship. This support is for further sustaining their post-doctoral research and is granted on very selective and competitive basis.                                         ********
