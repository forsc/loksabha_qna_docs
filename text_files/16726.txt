ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	& (b): Yes Sir. Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) has imposed Anti-dumping duty on import of ceramic tiles from India with effect from 06.06.2020.Indonesia has imposed Anti-dumping duty on import of following commodities from India: - Polyesters staple fibre with effect from 23.11.2010 (extended on 19.08.2019), Biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate with effect from 17.12.2015 and Hot rolled coil with effect from 02.03.2008 (extended on 02.04.2019).(c)  to (f):  The issue of the imposition of anti-dumping duty by GCC on Indian ceramic tiles has been continuously raised with the governments of member countries of GCC at various levels, including at the Ministerial level. The Government, through the Indian Mission in Riyadh, has also extended its support to the Indian ceramic tiles industry in filing the administrative review with the Ministerial Committee of GCC in May 2020 and appeal before the Judicial Commission in September 2020. It is difficult to assess the exact impact of anti-dumping duty on our exports of ceramic tiles to GCC countries due to COVID-19 pandemic which has created supply chain disruption and fall in global demand across all sectors. As per information received from the Indian ceramic industry, out of six GCC countries, three countries namely Kuwait, Qatar, and Oman have not yet started collecting anti-dumping duty.  ******
