ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY(SMT. ANUPRIYA PATEL)(a) to (d):  	The Government is facilitating export of agricultural commodities through inspection and phytosanitary certification as per the requirements of importing countries. This is undertaken as per International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC), 1951 of Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Presently, there are 73 Plant quarantine Stations at different international airports, seaports and land frontiers implementing the plant quarantine regulations. Approval/accreditation/registration is also granted for treatment providers (Aluminum Phosphide fumigation/ forced hot air treatment, irradiation, vapour heat treatment & hot water immersion treatment etc.), pack houses, farm units, warehouses and processing units for fulfilling product-specific requirements of importing countries. The existing Plant Quarantine Information System (PQIS) is being replaced by Plant Quarantine Management System (PQMS), a new online system, which would integrate with the "e-phyto system of IPPC and would ease the process of export of agricultural commodities. ********
