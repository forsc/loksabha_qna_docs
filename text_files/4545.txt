                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (c)    The Dynamic Ground Water Resources of the country are being periodically assessed jointly by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and State Governments. As per the 2017 assessment, Total Annual Ground Water Recharge is 432 Billion Cubic Meter (BCM) and the Annual Extractable Ground Water Resource is 393 BCM. The Annual Ground Water Extraction for all uses is 249 BCM. The Stage of Ground Water Extraction, which is a measure of Annual Ground Water Extraction for all uses (irrigation, industrial and domestic uses) over Annual Extractable Ground Water Resource is 63% for the country as a whole.Out of the total 6881 assessment units (Block/ Taluks/ Mandals/ watersheds/ Firkas) in the country, 1186 units in 17 States/UTs have been categorized as ‘Over-exploited’ where Annual Ground Water Extraction is more than Annual Extractable Ground Water Resource. State-wise details are given at Annexure.Hon’ble Prime Minister has written a letter to all Sarpanchs on 08.06.2019 regarding the importance of water conservation and rain harvesting and exhorted them to adopt all appropriate measures to make water conservation a mass movement.Contd…P/2//2//An ‘Inter Ministerial Committee’ under the Chairmanship of Secretary (WR, RD & GR) has been constituted to take forward the subject of ‘Water Conservation Related Activities for Optimum Utilization of Monsoon Rainfall’ which meets from time to time to discuss the issue of water conservation. The Committee includes officers from different States/UTs. Last meeting of the Inter-Ministerial Committee was held on 01/05/2019.Cabinet Secretary discussed the issue of water conservation with the Chief Secretaries of the States through video-conference on 21.05.2019.The issue was also discussed with the concerned Ministers and officials of the State Governments by Minister Jal Shakti in a meeting held on 11.6.2019.In order to regulate the over-exploitation and consequent depletion of ground water, a Model Bill has been circulated to all the States/UTs to enable them to enact suitable ground water legislation for regulation of its development, which includes provision of rain water harvesting. So far, 15 States/UTs have adopted and implemented the ground water legislation on the lines of Model Bill.Further, Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has been constituted under Section 3 (3) of the “Environment (Protection) Act, 1986” for the purpose of regulation and control of ground water development and management in the Country.Government of India has launched the Jal Shakti Abhiyan which is a time bound campaign with a mission mode approach intended to improve water availability including ground water conditions in the water stressed blocks. The other important initiatives taken up are available at the following URL: http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps_to_control_water_depletion_Jun2019.pdf(d) & (e)   National Water Policy (2012) emphasizes that Water needs to be managed as a common pool community resource held, by the State, under public trust doctrine to achieve food security, support livelihood, and ensure equitable and sustainable development for all”. Further, it also prioritises water use with safe water for drinking and sanitation as pre-emptive needs, followed by high priority allocation for other basic domestic needs (including needs of animals), achieving food security, supporting sustenance agriculture and minimum eco-system needs. Available water, after meeting the above needs, should be allocated in a manner to promote its conservation and efficient use.The National Water Policy (2012) has been forwarded to all States/UTs and concerned Ministries/Departments of Central Government for adoption.(f)   As per the directives of Hon’ble National Green Tribunal, CGWA has stopped grant of NOC for ground water extraction for Industrial, Infrastructure unit and Mining projects located in ‘Over-exploited’, ‘Critical’ and ‘Semi-critical’ assessment units except for drinking and domestic uses.***** ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) to (c) of Unstarred Q.No. 4187 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 18.07.2019  regarding “Depleting Ground Water”CATEGORIZATION OF BLOCKS/ MANDALS/ TALUKAS IN INDIA (2017)S.No.	States / Union Territories	Total No. of Assessed Units	Semi-Critical	Critical	Over-Exploited			Nos.	%	Nos.	%	Nos.	% 	States	 	 	 	 	 	 	 1	Andhra Pradesh	670	60	9	24	4	45	72	Arunachal Pradesh	11	0	0	0	0	0	03	Assam	28	0	0	0	0	0	04	Bihar	534	72	13	18	3	12	25	Chattisgarh	146	22	15	2	1	0	06	Delhi	34	7	21	2	6	22	657	Goa	12	0	0	0	0	0	08	Gujarat	248	11	4	5	2	25	109	Haryana	128	21	16	3	2	78	6110	Himachal Pradesh	8	1	13	0	0	4	5011	Jammu & Kashmir	22	0	0	0	0	0	012	Jharkhand	260	10	4	2	1	3	113	Karnataka	176	26	15	8	5	45	2614	Kerala	152	30	20	2	1	1	115	Madhya Pradesh	313	44	14	7	2	22	716	Maharashtra	353	61	17	9	3	11	317	Manipur	9	0	0	0	0	0	018	Meghalaya	11	0	0	0	0	0	019	Mizoram	26	0	0	0	0	0	020	Nagaland	11	0	0	0	0	0	021	Odisha	314	5	2	0	0	0	022	Punjab	138	5	4	2	1	109	7923	Rajasthan	295	29	10	33	11	185	6324	Sikkim	4	0	0	0	0	0	025	Tamil Nadu	1166	163	14	79	7	462	4026	Telangana	584	169	29	67	11	70	1227	Tripura	59	0	0	0	0	0	028	Uttar Pradesh*	830	151	18	48	6	91	1129	Uttarakhand	18	5	28	0	0	0	030	West Bengal **	268	76	28	1	0	0	0 	Total States	6828	968	14	312	5	1185	17 	Union Territories	 	 	 	 	 	 	 1	Andaman & Nicobar	36	0	0	0	0	0	02	Chandigarh	1	1	100	0	0	0	03	Dadra & Nagar Haveli	1	0	0	0	0	0	04	Daman & Diu	2	0	0	1	50	0	05	Lakshdweep	9	3	33	0	0	0	06	Puducherry	4	0	0	0	0	1	25 	Total UTs	53	4	8	1	2	1	2 	Grand Total	6881	972	14	313	5	1186	17Note											Blocks- Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Kerala, M.P., Manipur, Mizoram, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West BengalTaluks -Karnataka, Goa, Gujarat, MaharashtraMandals- Andhra Pradesh, TelanganaDistricts/Valley- Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Meghalaya, Mizoram, NagalandIslands - Lakshadweep, Andaman & Nicobar IslandsFirka-Tamil NaduRegion - PuducherryUT - Chandigarh, Dadar & Nagar Haveli, Daman & DiuTehsil-NCT Delhi*Uttar Pradesh: There are total 820 block and 10 Cities**The Ground Water resources assessment as on 2013 has been considered for the state of West Bengal*****
