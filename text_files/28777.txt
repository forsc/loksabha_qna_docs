The regulations list out ingredients including vitamins and minerals, additives and specific labelling for products covered under these regulations. Further, the said regulations also have provisions regarding claims. As per these regulations, the labelling, presentation and advertisement shall not claim that the nutraceutical product has the property of preventing, treating or curing a human disease, or refer to such properties. For health claims such as enhanced function claims, disease risk reduction claims, immunity claims etc., where scientific support does not exist, or if a novel ingredient is to be introduced, there shall be a prior approval of the Food Authority which shall be based on adequate scientific evidence. If the health claims are product led, the food business operator shall notify to the Food Authority before putting the same in the market, by submitting relevant documents along with a copy of the label. FSSAI has constituted an Expert Committee on Claims for scrutiny of the Claims. The Food Business Operator (FBO) who wants to manufacture, import, market or sell these products shall comply with the aforementioned regulations. The said regulation is available on FSSAI website www.fssai.gov.in(c): All Food Business Operators have to comply with the aforesaid regulations. Further, to ensure compliance of these standards laid down under Food Safety and Standards (FSS) Act, 2006 and the rules and regulations made thereunder, regular surveillance, monitoring, inspection and sampling of food products are undertaken by the officials of Food Safety Departments of the respective States/UTs and Central Enforcement Authorities. In cases where the food samples are found to be non-conforming, penal action has been initiated against such violating Food Business Operators as specified under Chapter IX of the FSS Act, 2006.FSSAI has recognised and notified a total of 235 NABL accredited food testing laboratories (both primary and referral) across the country. Out of these,20 food testing laboratories are able to test nutraceuticals and such products. Moreover, in order to keep regular watch on Food and Beverages related advertisements appearing across various print and electronic media, FSSAI has signed Memorandum of Agreement(MoA) with Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), a self-regulatory voluntary organization of the advertising content for exclusive tracking, tracing and evaluation of all Food and Beverages advertisements appearing across various media which could be potentially violating the provisions of FSS Act, Rules and Regulations made thereunder.……………………
