ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) & (b):	 Union Government has announced the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for six rabi crops viz. wheat, barley, gram, lentil, rapeseed & mustard and safflower on 23rd October, 2019. MSP is announced for rabi crops of year 2019-20, to be marketed in Rabi Marketing Season 2020-21. Contd…2/--2-		The Union Budget for 2018-19 had announced the pre-determined principle to keep MSP at levels of one and half times of cost of production. Accordingly, Government has increased the MSPs for all mandated Kharif, Rabi and other commercial crops with a return of atleast 50 per cent of cost of production for the agricultural year 2018-19. The recent increase in MSP of rabi crops of year 2019-20 to be marketed in Rabi Marketing Season 2020-21 is also in accordance to the principle of providing atleast 50% return over cost of production. The details of increase in MSP and crop-wise return over cost of production for rabi crops are given in Annexure I. (c):		Food Corporation of India and other designated state agencies provide price support to the farmers in the case of cereals, while State Governments undertake procurement of coarse grains with the prior approval of Government of India. The Government is implementing Price Support Scheme (PSS) for procurement of pulses & oilseeds at MSP under the umbrella Scheme “Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA).  The details regarding procurement of rabi crops and production of rabi crops of year 2018-19 (Rabi Marketing Season 2019-20) is given in Annexure II. (d):		 No, Sir. Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare has not conducted any study in this regard. However, NITI Aayog has conducted an evaluation study on efficacy of Minimum Support Prices (MSP) on Farmers in January, 2016.(e):	 Government’s price policy is to ensure remunerative prices to farmers by offering to procure their produce at minimum support price (MSP). However, farmers are free to sell their produce to the Government procurement agencies at MSP or in the open market whichever is advantageous to them.Apart from increasing MSP, Government has taken several steps to provide remunerative prices to farmers for their produce which include undertaking procurement through designated procurement agencies, implementing e-National Agriculture Market (e-NAM), enacting the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2017 and promoting Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs).The Government is working on market architecture so as to ensure that farmers get remunerative prices on their produce. These include setting up of Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs) with a view to promote 22,000 number of retail markets in close proximity of farm gate; competitive and transparent wholesale trade at APMC through e-NAM.The recently launched Umbrella Scheme “Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA)” provides for a holistic arrangement for assurance of a remunerative price for farmers. This Umbrella Scheme comprises Price Support Scheme (PSS) for pulses, oilseeds and copra, Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) and Pilot of Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme (PPSS) for oilseeds to ensure MSP to the farmers.MSP operations are given wide publicity through pamphlets, banners, sign boards, radio, TV and advertisements through print & electronic media. In addition to that farmers are made aware of the quality specifications and purchase system to facilitate the farmers to bring their produce conforming to the specifications.
