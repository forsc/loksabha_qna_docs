ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) to (c):	 The Government has approved an Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund (AMIF) with a corpus of Rs. 2000 crore for developing and upgrading agricultural marketing infrastructure in the GrAMs and Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) Markets and circulated the Scheme Guidelines to the States/Union Territories (UTs). Since it is a demand driven scheme from the States/UTs, the Government of India has requested States/UTs for submission of proposal for seeking assistance under AMIF and pursuing with them. Hence, the question of corrective measures does not arise. *******
