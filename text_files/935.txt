ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) & (b)	A compilation showing the total number of deaths of people from Andhra Pradesh for each of the Gulf countries during the last three years is provided in Annexure. A large number of deaths of Indian nationals in the Gulf countries can be attributed to natural causes, medical illnesses etc. Some deaths are also reported due to suicides, accidents at work sites and road accidents.(c)	The Ministry of External Affairs and our Missions/Posts in the Gulf, accord high priority to the welfare and well being of Indian nationals especially of Indian workers who constitute a large proportion of expatriate Indians in the region.  In order to prevent workers’ deaths such as suicides, road accidents etc. in Gulf countries, awareness campaigns are conducted by the Missions/Posts through labour camps organised by Pravasi Bharatiya Seva Kendras (PBSK) in collaboration with the Indian Missions/Posts. Indian officials work proactively to alleviate and resolve the difficulties being faced by Indian workers such as excessive working hours, inadequacy of medical facilities, excessive exposure to heat and sun stroke etc. Anyone having any difficulty can approach Community Welfare Wing in getting his problems addressed promptly. In Gulf countries where there are large numbers of Indian workers, our Missions and Posts have specialized Community Welfare Wings and Labour Wings. In addition, the Government has launched an online portal called ‘MADAD’ for addressing the grievances of Indian nationals abroad. The MADAD Portal is regularly monitored in our Missions/Posts at various levels, thus giving high priority to grievances of Indian nationals.
