                                                        MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a)	to (c): The Ministry implements  the Swadhar Greh Scheme with effect from  01.01.2016 by merging two previous Schemes viz. ‘Swadhar’ and ‘Short Stay Homes’ which covers the entire country. The Swadhar Greh Scheme targets women living in difficult circumstances without social and economic support like deserted women and women survivors of natural disaster who have been rendered homeless, trafficked women/girls, women victims of terrorist violence, mentally challenged women/girls who are without support and women with HIV/AIDS deserted by family. These women are in need of institutional support for rehabilitation so that they could lead their life with dignity. The Scheme envisages providing shelter, food, clothing and health services as well as economic and social security for them along with facilitating their emotional and economic rehabilitation into the society. At present there is no proposal to upgrade or introduce a new scheme under Swadhar Greh Scheme.********
