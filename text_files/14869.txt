The entire CSR architecture is disclosure based and CSR mandated companies are required to file details of CSR expenditure annually in MCA21 registry. All data reported in the MCA21 registry by companies on CSR is available on National CSR Data Portal at www.csr.gov.in . Whenever any violation of CSR provisions is reported, action against such non-compliant Companies are initiated as per provisions of Companies Act, 2013 after due examination of records and following due process of law. So far, sanction for prosecution has been accorded in 366 cases. All CSR related offences are compoundable.
