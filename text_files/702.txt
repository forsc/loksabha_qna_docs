ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) to (c):	“Police” and “Public order” are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. Therefore, State Governments and Union Territories Administration are responsible for registration and investigation of crimes under the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973.  However, the Ministry of Home Affairs has issued advisories on compulsory registration of FIRs.  In order to ensure that the police register  FIR  for  cases  when  they  receive  a  call/complaint related to a -2-L.S.US.Q.NO.546 FOR 25.06.2019crime committed outside the jurisdiction of the police station concerned, States/UTs have been advised to instruct police to register ‘Zero FIR’. In order to facilitate police in States/Union Territories with a common platform for filing reports, collecting and sharing information on crimes and criminals at national level, MHA has implemented Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS). Against the approved project target of covering 14306 police stations, a total of 14856 police stations have been covered in CCTNS as new police stations were added in States/Union Territories.  A total of 4.43 crore FIR records are available at national level.  Atotal of 35 States/UTs have launched their State Citizen Portals providing citizen centric police services, including online filing of complaints, obtaining status of complaints, obtaining copies of FIRs, viewing details of arrested persons/ wanted criminals, viewing details of missing person/ unidentified dead bodies, request for antecedent verification and request for issue of various NOCs from police. A total of 3.25 crore service requests have been received from citizens (till April 2019).  Delhi, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have launched e-FIR facility for citizen for property and vehicles thefts where accused are not known.(d):	Does not arise in view of reply at (a) to (c) above.*******
