In respect of remaining States Constitution provision as prescribed in Article 243D applies.(b) ‘Panchayat’, being ‘Local Government’, is a State subject and part of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. Accordingly, all Panchayat related matters, including representation of women in Panchayat systems are governed by the respective State Panchayati Raj Acts and rules. However, Government has been encouraging increased involvement of women in the functioning of Panchayats through active participation in the Gram Sabha meetings for preparation of Gram Panchayat Development Plans and various schemes being implemented by the Panchayats. This Ministry has also issued advisories to the States to facilitate holding of separate Ward Sabha and Mahila Sabha meetings prior to Gram Sabha meetings, enhancing the presence and participation of women in Gram Sabha and Panchayat meetings, allocation of Panchayat funds for women centric activities, combating the evil of women trafficking, female foeticide, child marriage etc.(c) Article 280 (3) (bb) of the Constitution of India provides for the Finance Commission to make recommendations regarding the measures needed to augment the Consolidated Fund of a State to supplement the resources of the Panchayats in the State on the basis of the recommendations made by the Finance Commission of the State. Accordingly, to improve the functioning of Panchayati Raj Institutions, including women related activities, funds have been recommended by Central Finance Commissions successively.
