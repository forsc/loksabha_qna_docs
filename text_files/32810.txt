ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR TEXTILES  (SMT. DARSHANA JARDOSH)(a):	Based on the periodical statistical returns submitted by textile entities to Office of Textile Commissioner, Ministry of Textiles, Mumbai, the number of spinning mills across the country including Maharashtra is 2032. The details of State-wise number of spinning mills in the country including Maharashtra is at Annexure-I. (b):	Certain mills become non-operational permanently or temporarily on account of various factors such as poor management, financial constraints & labour issues.(c):	There is no specific scheme for the revival of the closed and sick spinning mills across the country. Some of the mills are closed due to poor obsolete technology which cannot compete with modern spinning mills.  There is surplus modernized spinning capacity in the country and Govt. is now focusing on creating similar modern weaving, processing and garment production capacity in the country, which has more employment creation potential.  To this objective Govt. is implementing Amended Technology Up-gradation Scheme (ATUFS), Integrated Processing Development Scheme (IPDS), Scheme for Integrated Textile Park (SITP) and other Schemes like National Technical Textile Mission (NTTM). Government has launched Production Linked Incentive Scheme for textiles for Man Made Fibre, Apparel, Fabrics and Technical Textiles. It is expected to attract investment of Rs. 19000 crore for manufacturing of notified product and will be able to provide employment opportunity for 7.5 lakh persons. Government has also launched PM- MITRA Park Scheme to set up 7 Mega Textiles Manufacturing Parks in the country. This will reduce logistics cost and will improve Competitiveness of Indian textile manufacturing. Once completed one such park is expected to provide employment to 1 lakh persons directly and 2 lakh persons indirectly. (d): 	As informed by M/o Labour & Employment, the Labour Bureau is not collecting information on skilled & unskilled workers for such textiles mills.  The Government had introduced Textile Workers Rehabilitation Fund Scheme (TWRFS) with effect from 15.09.1986 to provide relief to the workers rendered jobless due to permanent closure of Non-SSI Textile Mills in private sector. With effect from 01.04.2017, TWRFS has been merged with Rajiv Gandhi Shramik Kalyan Yojna (RGSKY) under Ministry of Labour and Employment and notified vide Notification No. S.O.1081 (E) dated 06.04.2017. Workers rendered jobless can avail benefits under the said scheme.
