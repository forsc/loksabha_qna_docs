ANSWER




                                                        (a) National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), under the aegis of Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship has, so far, formed 37 Sector Skill Councils (SSCs) which cover the major sectors to fulfill the skilling needs of their respective sectors. (b) Under Skill India Mission, Ministry is implementing its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) to impart skill development training to youth in various sectors across the country, including the State of Karnataka. PMKVY has two components, namely, Central component being implemented through NSDC, and State component being implemented through State Skill Development Mission (SSDM) of the State/UT. Under Central component of PMKVY, there is no provision of State-wise funds allocation. However, under the State component of PMKVY, funds and corresponding physical targets have been allocated to the States for the implementation of scheme through SSDMs. As on 31.12.2022, total volume of funds disbursed to State of Karnataka under PMKVY is Rs. 282.24 crore. (c) The allocation of skilling targets and funds amongst the States under PMKVY 2.0 has been done on the basis of the various parameters such as State Population in the age group (15 to 35 years); Human Development Index (HDI) of the State; and Unemployment Percentage of the State.             While parameters such as weighted mean of indicator values under three categories, namely, population, industry and labour supply has been used for allocation of skilling targets and funds amongst the States under PMKVY 3.0(d) Establishment of further SSCs is based on multiple criteria like support from industry for creation of SSC, interest from industry to participate in the activities of SSC, demand for and need for skilling by the industry, existing work force of sector, need for upskilling/ reskilling of existing workforce, etc. SSCs can also be approved if the target segment is special and unorganized but is sizable and needs skilling for better opportunities of employment, e.g., Skill Council for PwD, Domestic Workers Skill Council, etc.
