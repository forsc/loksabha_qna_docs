                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) As per the industry specific environmental standards notified by the Government under the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, discharge of treated or untreated wastewater from industry into the groundwater is not allowed, except in oil drilling sector where re-injection of treated wastewater, meeting the norms, is allowed in abandoned well at a depth of 1000 metres from the ground level. All industries are required to install Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) for treatment of wastewater as per the conditions in the Consent to Operate issued by the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/ Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. Only treated effluent, meeting the standards, is permitted to be discharged into surface water/ land for irrigation.(b) & (c) Provision for penalty is provided under Section 15 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for contravention of the provisions of the Act and the Rules. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), in pursuance of directions of the Hon’ble National Green Tribunal has formulated the environmental compensation to be levied on industrial units. CPCB has issued directions to industries falling in the 17 categories of highly polluting industries to install Online Continuous Effluent/ Emission Monitoring System (OCEMS) to track discharges of pollutants from these units. During 2016-17, CPCB started a scheme of inspection of these industries based on the computer generated alerts. Industries for inspection are selected on the basis of Short Message Service (SMS) alert generated from the online monitoring systems. A total of 663 industries have been inspected till 21.11.2019 and 385 directions have been issued under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to non-complying industries.(d) & (e) CPCB, from time to time, organizes training programmes and workshops for stakeholders for awareness generation. During 2018 and 2019 the following training programmes and workshops were organized:?	Training for Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) operators in Delhi and Haryana for effluent management by CETPs.?	Trainings and workshops for various industrial sectors such as textiles, sugar, tanneries and pulp & paper for water conservation and effluent management.?	Training for implementation of charter Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs) located in Ganga River.?	Workshop on restoration of water bodies/rejuvenation of polluted rivers.*****
