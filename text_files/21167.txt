(c) & (d): 	India is the largest producer of pulses in the world, with nearly 26% share to global pulse production. The increase in pulse production in recent years has been attributed to both area expansion and productivity enhancement. The production of pulses has increased from 16.32 million tonnes during 2015-16 to 24.42 million tonnes during 2020-21 (2nd advance estimates for 2020-21). To meet the marginal shortage, pulses are imported from the countries like Canada, Myanmar, Tanzania Republic, Mozambique, Australia, China, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Russia, United States of America (USA) etc. The quantity and values of imported pulses during last 3 years is as under:  Year	Quantity(million tonnes)	Value(Rs. in crore)2017-18	5.61	18748.572018-19	2.52	8035.302019-20	2.90	10221.0 (e) & (f): National Food Security Mission (NFSM) - Pulses programme has been implemented in 2019-20 and 2020-21 of COVID-19 pandemic period.
