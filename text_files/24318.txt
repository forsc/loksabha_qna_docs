ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a) to (c):  Illegal migrants (including Rohingyas) pose a threat to national security. There are reports about some rohingya migrants indulging in illegal activities.      India is not a signatory to the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status  of Refugees  and  the 1967  Protocol  thereon.  All foreign nationals -2-L.S.US.Q.NO.296 FOR 20.07.2021(including refuge seekers) are governed by the provisions contained in The Foreigners Act, 1946, The Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939, The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 and The Citizenship Act, 1955, and rules and orders made thereunder. Foreign nationals who enter into the country without valid travel documents or whose travel documents expire while staying in India are treated as illegal migrants and are dealt as per the existing legal provisions.(d) and (e):	     India signed the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment on 14 October 1997.  However, India has not ratified the Convention. India acceded to the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) on 10.04.1979.      Detention and deportation of illegal migrants after nationality verification is a continuous process. The powers of the Central Government under Section 3 of The Foreigners Act, 1946 to deport illegal foreign nationals and powers under Section 5 of The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 to remove an illegal foreigner by force have also been entrusted  under  Article 258(1) of the  Constitution of India to all the State -3-L.S.US.Q.NO.296 FOR 20.07.2021Governments.  Further, under Article 239(1) of the Constitution of India, Administrators of all Union Territories have also been directed to discharge the functions of the Central Government relating to the aforesaid powers. A Writ Petition No. 793/2017 has been filed in the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, inter-alia, praying not to deport Rohingyas from India. The matter is sub-judice in the Hon’ble Supreme Court. However, no stay has been granted by the Hon’ble Court on the deportation of Rohingyas being done as per procedure established by law.*******
