However, the problem is faced in construction of approaches because of many factors such as fixing the alignment of approaches, land acquisition, removal of encroachments, finalization of General Arrangement Drawing (GAD), acceptance and sanction of estimate, allocation of requisite funds and decided the executing agency in State portion by State Government etc. Therefore, it is not feasible to fix definite timelines for completion of these ROB/RUBs.*****
