ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) (b) & (c) No, Sir.The Compensatory Afforestation (CA) scheme is one of the essential conditions stipulated in the proposals approved “in-principle” under Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. CA is done as per the approved Annual Plan of Operations (APOs) of the States/UTs. Consistent efforts have yielded good results in addressing the problem of deforestation, besides keeping the pace of development, which is evident from the fact that the forest cover has stabilized and has been constantly increasing over the years. As per the biennial edition of India State of Forest Report (ISFR) of Forest Survey of India (FSI), ISFR 2015(updated), the forest and tree cover increased by 4902.6 square kilometre (sq. km.) over 2013 assessment while as per ISFR, 2017, the forest and tree cover has increased by 8021 sq. km. of total forest and tree cover as compared to that of ISFR, 2015(updated). As per ISFR 2019 there is an increase of 5188 sq. km. in the forest and tree cover over that of ISFR  2017 in the country. A study by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), USA has also stated that India and China are leading the increase in greening on land. ***
