ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF MINES, COAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a) No, Sir.  There is no proposal with the Government to change the definition of ‘illegal mining’ under Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) (MMDR) Act, 1957. However, there is proposal to bring legislative amendments in the MMDR Act, 1957, inter-alia, for bringing clarity on application of the provisions of section 21(4) and section 21(5) of the MMDR Act, 1957 as there is no differentiation between illegal mining done outside leasehold area and mining in violation of various clearances and approvals inside a mining lease area at present. (b)  The data regarding illegal mining is maintained by Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) (A Subordinate Office of Ministry of Mines). As per data available with IBM, the number of complaints about illegal mining received during the last three years State/UTs wise are as under:-Name of State	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20Uttar Pradesh	00	00	00Maharashtra	01	00	01Madhya Pradesh	01	01	00Bihar	01	00	00Odisha	00	01	00Meghalaya	00	01	00Telengana	00	00	01Rajasthan	00	00	01Total	03	03	03(c) The details of fines realised by State Governments (Cumulative from 2016-17 to 2019-20) as a result of illegal mining, state/UT-wise, including the State of Odisha is Annexed.
