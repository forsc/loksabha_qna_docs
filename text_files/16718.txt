ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a):	The National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) is implemented in all States/Union Territories under which, the coverage is provided to eligible households/persons in two categories, namely - Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households to the extent specified by the Central Government and remaining as Priority Households (PHH) to be identified by the State/UT Governments/Administrations as per criteria evolved by them, within the coverage determined for the State/UT. The AAY households, which constitutes the poorest of the poor, are entitled to receive 35 Kg of foodgrains per household per month while PHH households are entitled to receive 5 Kg of foodgrains per person per month, at highly subsidized central issue prices of Rs.3/2/1 per kg for rice/ wheat/coarse-grains respectively...........2/--2-(b):	Statements indicating State/UT-wise Allocation and value of Rice and Wheat for the year 2017-18 to 2019-20 under AAY category are at Annexure-I and Annexure II respectively.(c): 	A Statement indicating the State/UT-wise number of AAY households presently covered under the National Food Security Act, 2013 is at Annexure-III.(d):	Under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) reforms, with an aim to improve the transparency and efficiency of the TPDS operations while addressing the challenges of leakages & diversion of foodgrains, the Department in association with all States/UTs has implemented a scheme on ‘End to End Computerization of TPDS Operations’ as part of which, all ration cards/ beneficiaries data is completely digitized in all States/ UTs,about 90% ration cards are also seeded with Aadhaar numbers of beneficiaries and electronic Point of Sale devices are also installed in 90% Fair Price Shops (FPSs) to ensure transparent delivery of foodgrains to all beneficiaries and also for biometric/ Aadhaar authentication of beneficiaries to ensure rightful targeting of beneficiaries and subsidized foodgrains. Besides, online grievance redressal and toll-free helplines are also setup in all States/UTs to register their complaints/ grievances. These are in addition to the provisions of NFSA such as Vigilance Committees, District Grievance Redressal Officers and independent State Food Commissions.	Further, leveraging the technology-led reforms, the Department has also started the implementation of One Nation One Ration Card plan to enable nation-wide portability of ration cards under NFSA, through which migrant beneficiaries may lift their entitled foodgrains from any FPS of their choice anywhere in the country by using their same/existing ration card after biometric authentication on ePoS device. Presently the facility is enabled in 26 States/UTs and further integration of remaining States/UTs depends on their readiness to implement the same in terms of ePoS installation and implementation of biometric/Aadhaar authentication of beneficiaries. (e) & (f): No proposal for doubling the coverage of AAY is under consideration of the Government.**** ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (b) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.459 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 15.O9.2020 IN THE LOK SABHA.Allocation of Rice for the year 2017-18 to 2019-20 under AAY category				In thousand tonsS.NO	STATE/UT	2017-18	2018-19	2019-201	ANDHRA PRADESH 	381.557	381.557	381.5572	ARUNACHAL PRADESH	15.701	15.701	15.7013	ASSAM	294.096	294.096	294.0964	BIHAR 	630.252	630.252	630.2525	CHHATTISGARH 	301.980	301.980	301.9806	DELHI 	9.113	9.113	9.1137	GOA 	5.276	5.276	5.2438	GUJARAT 	102.258	102.258	102.2589	HARYANA 	0.000	0.000	0.00010	HIMACHAL PRADESH 	31.535	31.535	31.53511	JAMMU & KASHMIR	69.755	69.755	69.63212	JHARKHAND	341.561	341.561	341.56113	KARNATAKA 	460.740	460.740	460.74014	KERALA	213.090	213.090	195.17415	MADHYA PRADESH 	146.796	146.796	146.79616	MAHARASHTRA 	461.797	461.797	461.79717	MANIPUR  	26.712	26.712	26.71218	MEGHALAYA	21.752	21.752	29.48319	MIZORAM 	10.747	10.747	10.74720	NAGALAND	19.950	19.950	19.95021	ORISSA 	509.236	509.236	520.67122	PUNJAB  	0.000	0.000	0.00023	RAJASTHAN 	0.000	0.000	0.00024	SIKKIM 	6.930	6.930	6.93025	TAMIL NADU	689.246	689.246	689.24626	TELANGANA	238.059	238.059	238.05927	TRIPURA	46.040	46.040	46.04028	UTTARAKHAND 	47.944	47.944	47.94429	UTTAR PRADESH	737.004	737.004	736.92930	WEST BENGAL 	293.841	293.841	295.51531	A & N ISLANDS     	1.541	1.541	1.55632	CHANDIGARH  (NFSA/DBT)	0.000	0.000	0.00033	D & N HAVELI 	1.590	1.590	1.66734	DAMAN & DIU 	0.387	0.387	0.38035	LADAKH	0.000	0.000	0.30136	LAKSHADWEEP 	0.441	0.441	0.44137	PUDDUCHERRY(DBT)	0.000	0.000	0.000	Total Rice	6,116.928	6,116.928	6,120.007 	Total Value (Tentative)(in Rs.
