ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (d) : National Curriculum Framework (NCF, 2005) emphasises on ethical development,inculcating the values, attitudes and skills required for living in harmony with oneself and withothers. The values and attitudes are acquired and are best nurtured through experiences. Theseexperiences need to be consistent and inbuilt in the personal and social environment of the students,the nurturance of values will ensure the right attitude amongst students. Value education in schoolcurriculum has been proposed and encouraged by NCERT.The strategy proposed for achieving this goal is through an integrated approach. Valueeducation is based on the understanding that values cannot be taught but are caught. Therefore,NCERT has incorporated such concerns, wherever possible, in the textbooks developed for schoolstage as well as in the entire school life – the curriculum, classroom climate, school management,teaching-learning, teacher-pupil relationships etc. instead of introducing it as a compulsory subject.The Council has been developing support materials for teachers and school stakeholders. Aresource book for teachers entitled ‘Ways to Peace’ published by NCERT during 2010 and‘Education for Values in Schools –A Framework’ during 2012 which advocates holistic andintegrated approach laying emphasis on orienting the school ethos, policies and practices, pedagogicstrategies, transaction of subjects, evaluation system, home-school partnership, teacher developmentand staff orientation in view of promoting values.Central Government has introduced a 4-year Integrated Teacher Education Programme (ITEP)for pre-service training, to offer graduation with certain specializations built into it namely Primaryand Secondary Education. In this regard, a Gazette Notification dated 29th March, 2019 has beenpublished and applications have been invited from 3rd June, 2019. Further, for in-service training ofteachers, school heads and other functionaries, at the elementary level, approval has been given for anIntegrated Teacher Training Programme to be conducted through National Council of EducationalResearch and Training (NCERT) and National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration(NIEPA), in all States and UTs.Moreover, Central Government launched a capacity building programme for teachers with thename NISHTHA, for improving Quality of School Education through Integrated Teacher Training".It aims to build competencies among all the teachers and school principals at the elementary stage.The functionaries (at the state, district, block, cluster level) are being trained in an integrated manneron learning outcomes, school based assessment, learner – centered pedagogy, new initiatives ineducation, addressing diverse needs of children through multiple pedagogies, etc.The Central Government has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education – SamagraShiksha, from 2018-19 which subsumes the erstwhile centrally sponsored schemes of Sarva ShikshaAbhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher EducationScheme(TE). Under Samagra Shiksha, various interventions have been introduced in the schoolsystem to help the student move away from rote learning.Central supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and earlyMathematics programmes through a sub-programme of SSA namely ‘Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat’(PBBB) in classes I and II. In order to encourage students to participate and take up meaningfulenvironmental activities such as debates, music arts, sports, reading, physical activities after schoolhours and during vacation and projects constitution in schools, Youth Club and Eco Club have beenset up. In order to provide supplementary learning material for students and for upgrading the skills ofteacher, MHRD has developed a dedicated Digital infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing DIKSHAplatform. The high quality e-learning material both for students and teachers are being uploaded byMinistry and States/UTs on this portal.****
