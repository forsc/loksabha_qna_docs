Therefore, it has been decided that the commencement of physical work for New Line projects shall be taken up only after completion of land acquisition. However, General Managers of Zonal Railways have been empowered to invite tenders if they are certain of the possibility of land acquisition in a reasonable time frame.  For this, a written assurance from the State Government will be required by General Managers of Zonal Railways. General Managers of Zonal Railways have also been empowered to review further investment in projects where State support is not forthcoming and the projects have remained in limbo for long period. Railways is continuously following up with the State Governments to take necessary steps in this regard to expedite execution work of New Lines.*****
