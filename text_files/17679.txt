ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a): The Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) under its erstwhile scheme of Capacity Building- Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (CB-PSA) and ongoing scheme of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) makes no prior allocation of funds to the States. The scheme is demand driven and proposals are approved based on their Annual Plan proposals. Under the scheme, Rs.184.26 crore was approved for the State of Bihar during the last four years for strengthening of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs). During the last four years, Rs.16646.88 crore basic and Rs.2101.78 crore performance grants was allocated under Fourteenth Finance Commission (FFC) to the State for various developmental schemes in the rural areas. (b): Under the scheme of MoPR, funds released to States/UTs are utilized by them for undertaking the activities sanctioned / permitted under their Annual Plans. The progress of implementation of the schemes, including utilization of funds, is closely monitored through meetings, video-conferences etc. with the States/UTs. For further release of funds to the States/UTs, the status of utilization of funds released earlier is also taken into account. In addition to this, an online monitoring and reporting system (MIS) for RGSA has been developed and operationalised. Moreover, transaction based Public Financial Management System (PFMS) has been introduced for release and tracking of funds under RGSA. (c): The Ministry of Panchayati Raj does not provide funds to any district directly. The States concerned allocate and release funds to the districts.  As per information shared by the Government of Bihar, during the last four years, an amount of Rs.420.48 crores was allocated and utilized out of the Fourteenth Finance Commission allocated grants in the district of Gopalganj. Under its scheme of Incentivisation of Panchayats to best performing Panchayats (District, Intermediate and Gram), the MoPR has provided Rs.12 Lakh for Jigana Jagarnath Gram Panchayat of Gopalganj District under Deen Dayal Upadhyay Panchayat Sashaktikaran Puraskar (DDUPSP) during 2018-19 as award money through State Government. (d): As per the information shared by the Government of Bihar, the schemes of Mukhyamantri Nischay Yojna-MM Grameen Peyjal Yojana, Mukhyamantri Nischay Yojana-MM Grameen Gali Nali Pakkikaran Yojana and Panchayat Sarkar Bhawan  are running in the Gopalganj district of Bihar. ****
