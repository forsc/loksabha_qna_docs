ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR) (a):  Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM) is designed to deliver catalytic interventions in rural areas on the threshold of economic growth. The Mission strives to strengthen selected rural areas by providing economic, social and infrastructure amenities, thus leading to sustainable and balanced regional development in the country. 300 Rurban clusters with thematic economic growth points have been selected under this Mission. Government of India  provides funding support of up to 30% of the estimated investment for each Rurban cluster as Critical Gap Funding (CGF), while 70% of the funds are mobilized by the States through convergence with  State and Central programmes.The CGF is capped at 30% of the project cost or Rs 30 crore, whichever is less, in plain areas and 30% of project cost or Rs 15 crore, whichever is less, in desert, hilly and tribal areas. (b): The State of Assam and Tamil Nadu have been allotted nine (09) and eleven (11) clusters respectively. A total of 32 villages is covered in nine Rurban clusters of Assam and 101 villages are covered in eleven  Rurban clusters of Tamil Nadu.(c): There is no State wise allocation of funds under the Mission. However, the details of funds released and utilization of funds over last three years and current year is given in Annexure-I. (d): Details of the target set and achievements made so far are placed in Annexure II. (e) to (f):  Yes Sir. The Mission has sought a time extension till March.  Following are the reasons for seeking extension of Mission period:-i.	First year of the Mission (2015-16) was utilized in framing Mission policy and cluster identification.ii.	Sensitization and involvement of several stakeholders and Panchayati Raj Institutions needed more time than expected as SPMRM was a new program for all the States/ UTs. It involved participation of 10-12 departments at State/ District/ Block level as well as involvement of Gram Panchayats from planning till implementation.iii.	Special emphasis was also needed in ensuring convergence of resources for making Integrated Cluster Action Plan (ICAP) effective and sustainable. Stakeholders related to convergence were identified and commitment taken from concerned departments. This activity also took significant time. Thereafter, approval of Detailed Project Reports of projects also took time.iv.	Due to limited administrative funds with States and procedural delays at State level in recruitment of professionals, the Mission activities could not progress as anticipated.Annexure-IStatement referred to in reply to Lok Sabha Question No.3766 (part c) scheduled for 17-03-2020Details of funds released and Utilisation over last three years and current yearCentral share of Critical Gap Fund (CGF) and Administrative funds released                                                                      (Rs. in Crore)Name of the State	FY 2016-17	FY 2017-18	FY 2018-2019	FY 2019-20	Total Funds releasedAssam	                   1.75	          32.40	            1.40	 20.25 	         55.80Tamil Nadu	          28.05	          44.25	           16.20	 16.20	        104.70 Utilisation of funds under Convergence and Critical Gap Funding (CGF):                                                                            Rs. in Crore)	                              Assam	                      Tamil NaduFinancial Year	            Convergence	   CGF	  Total Exp.
