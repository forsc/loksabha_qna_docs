(b):   Government of India is not implementing Laadli Scheme. (c):   Question does not arise.(d)to(f):Beti  Bachao  Beti  Padhao  (BBBP)  Scheme    aims  to  address declining Child Sex Ratio (CSR) and   related   issues   of   empowerment  of   girls   and   women   over   a   life   cycle continuum.  The  primary  objective  of  the  scheme  is  to  prevent  gender  biased  se  selective elimination, to  ensure  survival  and  protection  of  the  girl  child  and  to  ensure  education and participation  of  the  girl  child. The  key  elements  of  the  scheme  include  nation-wide  media  and advocacy  campaign  and  multi-sectoral  interventions  in  selected  405  districts. To incentivize girl child education, BBBP scheme has provision for felicitation/reward/recognition for meritorious girls students at district level under multi-sectoral intervention.Department of School Education and Literacy (DoSEL), Ministry of Education is implementing the centrally sponsored scheme of Samagra Shiksha, effective from 2018-19 for universalization of quality education throughout the country in coordination with the States and UTs. Bridging gender and social category gaps at all levels of school education is one of the major objectives of the scheme. Since Education is a subject in the concurrent list of the Constitution, States also adopt several measures to incentivise education of girls, which include provision of bicycles, financial incentives etc. as per their specific requirements. In order to mitigate the impact of challenges thrown by the COVID-19 pandemic, instructions and guidelines have been issued by Ministry of Education to States & UTs for continuing education of all children, including girls. Further, the States and UTs have also been suggested steps/actions to be taken during the school closure and also when the schools re-open such as, identification of out of school children from ages 6 to 18 years, enrollment drives and awareness generation, student support while schools are closed, continued education for Children with Special Needs (CwSN) etc. To reduce gender gaps at all levels of school education and ensure greater participation of girls in education, various interventions/provisions under Samagra Shiksha have been targeted.
