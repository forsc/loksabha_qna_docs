The Central Governmentand the UGC are taking various measures to improve quality of higher education byway of taking several initiatives so as to automatically attract foreign students tostudy in India. The UGC undertakes maintenance of standards in teaching,research and quality assurance in Universities, Deemed to be Universities andColleges through framing and notifying regulations, schemes and disbursing grantsto the eligible institutions.
