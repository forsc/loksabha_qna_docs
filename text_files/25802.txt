                                                        (a) to (c): Aadhaar number is issued to an individual, under Section 2(a) & 3 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016, which is a twelve-digit number.In order to verify Fake Aadhaar cards, Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has created a mechanism to get the Aadhaar number verified online through the official website of UIDAI: (https://resident.uidai.gov.in/verify).The authenticity of the Aadhaar number can also be verified through authentication. Section 4(3) of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, lays down that “Every Aadhaar number holder to establish his identity, may voluntarily use his Aadhaar number in physical or electronic form by way of authentication or offline verification...”.The offline verification includes scanning of QR code printed on Aadhaar letter/ eAadhaar/ Aadhaar PVC Card. The online verification includes OTP based authentication and Biometrics based authentication.Accordingly, the authenticity of fake Aadhaar card (if any) can be verified by the user in above-mentioned ways.Further, whenever such issue of Fake Aadhaar Card is reported to Law enforcement agencies, they are obliged to take appropriate action as per relevant section of IPC and other provisions.*******
