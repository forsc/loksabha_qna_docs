ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(SHRI PRATAP CHANDRA SARANGI)(a) to (c): Remunerative prices of aquaculture produce depends on several factors like input costs, quality of produce, adoption of best management practices, environmental conditions, demand and supply, cold chain infrastructure and global competition;and hence the fact that 70 percent of aqua farmers are not getting remunerative price for their produce may not be quantifiable. The aqua farmers are generally aware of the local market prices and prices at other markets outside the states and they dispose off aqua produce to buyers on mutually agreed prices at farm gate. Therefore, the question of business syndicates causing loss to aqua farmers’ does not arise. Fisheries are a State subject and the Central Government complements the efforts of States/UTs in development of fisheries and aquaculture. In order to support aqua farmers the Central -2-Government under its Scheme Blue Revolution-Integrated Development and Management of Fisheries has been providing assistance for farm development, farm inputsbesides creation ofpost-harvest and marketing infrastructure. Similarly, some State/UT Governments under their own fisheries schemes and programmes also provide assistance to aqua farmers so as to offset costs. Further, Centre and States issue regulatory guidelines from time to time with a view to ensure quality products and higher price realisation to aqua farmers. These initiatives facilitate mitigation of investment costs and enable realization of remunerative prices. In addition, the Marine Product Export Development Authority (MPEDA) facilitates aquaculture farmers for realizing better price through exports by registering exporters, organizing sensitization programmes, buyers and sellers’ meetsand publishing international market prices. ****
