                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) to (d): Government does not have any specific scheme to establish Micro Food Processing Clusters on its own. Rather, it promotes setting up of Agro Processing Clusters (APCs) in the country (including Delhi/NCR) by extending grant-in-aid for eligible projects through its Scheme “Creation of Infrastructure for APCs” under the Umbrella Scheme Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY).The said Yojana was approved in May 2017 and provides for incentivizing setting up of 100 APCs during 14th Finance Commission period in the country with an outlay of          Rs.750 crores.   48 projects have been approved by the Ministry till date. However, no eligible proposal has been approved in Delhi/NCR.Grant-in-aid to a maximum of Rs.10.00 crore per project is provided to the applicant, subject to the Scheme guidelines.*****
