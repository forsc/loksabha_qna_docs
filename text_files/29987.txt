The issues related to EC, FC, Land acquisition and R&R are rigorously followed up at District and State level for early resolution.(ii)   Regular liaison is being done for availability of permissions, clearances, land acquisition.(iii)   High capacity HEMM is being introduced wherever feasible to enhance production and productivity.(iv)   OB removal and coal transportation contracts are being awarded in advance.
