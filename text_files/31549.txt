ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(SHRI PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a) and (b) Yes Sir. The accessibility of bovine health and quality feeds at an affordable price is an important part of the livestock production. For animal health including bovine health, the Government is implementing the following schemes:(i).	Livestock Health & Disease Control(LH&DC): For control and containment of livestock diseases.(ii).	National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP): To control Foot & Mouth Disease (FMD) and Brucellosis and eventual eradication of FMD.	To make the livestock feeds affordable to the farmers, the Government has taken up various initiatives under the sub-mission of  fodder and feed development under National Livestock Mission (NLM) scheme. The sub-mission on fodder and feed development was designed to address the problems of scarcity of animal feed and fodder resources. It is focused on increasing both the production and productivity of fodder and feed through adoption of improved and appropriate technologies best suited to specific agro-climatic region in both arable and non-arable areas. Recently, the NLM has been realigned in 2021 to promote agri entrepreneurship and consequently to increase the fodder and feed production across the country. Under the realigned NLM scheme, capital subsidy towards the project cost is being provided to the entrepreneurs for infrastructure development in feed and fodder sector. The entrepreneurial activities related to the production of hay/silage at village level/ procurement of Fodder blocks making units, TMR machines/equipment, Forage harvester /reaper and Heavy duty Power operated Chaff cutters are supported under this scheme. Moreover, under the activity ‘Assistance for quality fodder seed production’, fodder seed chain i.e. breeder, foundation and certified quality fodder seed production will be incentivized 100%.Further, Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund scheme, ensures quality concentrated animal feed at affordable prices. Activities such as Establishment of Mini, Medium and Large Animal Feed Plant, Total mixed ration block making Unit, By pass protein unit, Mineral mixture plant, Enriched silage making unit, Animal feed testing laboratory and other activities related to animal feed manufacturing are being supported under this scheme. ***
