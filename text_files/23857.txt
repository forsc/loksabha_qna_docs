ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b) Rivers in the country are polluted and contaminated mainly due to discharge of untreated and partially treated sewage from cities/ towns and industrial effluents in their respective catchments. Non-point sources of pollution like agricultural runoff, open defecation, runoff from solid waste dump sites, etc. also contribute to pollution of rivers. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in collaboration with the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)/Pollution Control Committees (PCCs) is regularly monitoring the water quality of rivers & other water bodies in the country through a network of monitoring stations. As per CPCB report of September 2018, 351 polluted river stretches have been identified on 323 rivers based on monitoring results in terms of Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) levels, an indicator of organic pollution. State-wise details of polluted river stretches are given at Annexure-I.            As per another report published by CPCB in March 2015, sewage generation from urban areas in the country is estimated at 61,948 million litres per day (mld), against which available sewage treatment capacity was 23,277 mld.(c) & (d)     For strengthening the monitoring mechanism and effective compliance through self-regulatory mechanism, CPCB has directed all 17 categories of highly polluting industries; including sugar industries, to install Continuous Effluent/ Emission Monitoring Systems (OCEMS) for keeping a constant vigil on pollution levels. CPCB started inspection of the 17 categories of highly polluting industries from 2016-17 onwards based on the computer generated short message service (SMS) alerts owing to violation of effluent and emission standards recorded in OCEMS installed in these industries. Contd…P/2//2//            CPCB has informed that 27 sugar industries have been inspected from October, 2016 till January, 2021 under this initiative, and 13 industries were found non-complying during inspection. Show-cause notices to 3 industries and closure directions to 9 industries were, therefore, issued as per Section 5 of Environment Protection Act, 1986. For the remaining one industry, directions were issued to Maharashtra SPCB under Section 18(1)(b) of the Water Act, 1974 and Air Act, 1981.  Out of these 13 sugar industries found non-complying during inspection, 8 industries are found complying as on date, and directions are, therefore, still in force for the remaining 5 industries.            CPCB has identified 2968 grossly polluting industries (GPIs) in the country. Out of these, 2318 industries are operational and 650 industries have closed down on their own. Out of the 2318 operational industries, 2190 industries are complying with prescribed environmental standards, whereas 128 are non-complying. Accordingly, show-cause notices have been issued to 56 non-complying industries, closure directions have been issued to 55 industries and legal cases have been filed against 2 industries. State-wise status of GPI units in the country is attached as Annexure-II.****       ANNEXURE-IAnnexure referred to in reply to part (a) & (b)  of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 4972 to be answered on the 25.03.2021 regarding “Quality of Water of Rivers”.State / UTs Wise Polluted River Stretches of Surface WaterS.No.	Name Of State	Name Of Polluted River Stretches	Number1	Andhra Pradesh	Kundu, Tungabhadra, Godavari, Krishna, Nagavali	52	Assam	Bharalu, Borsola, Deepar Bill, Digboi, Kamalpur, PanchnaiBrahamputra, Kharsang, Pagldia, Barak, Baroi Bega, Beki, Bhogdoi, Boginadi, Borbeel, BordoibamBeelmukh, Burhidihing, Dhansiri, Dikhow, Dikrong, Diplai, Disang, Gabharu, Holudunga, Jai Bharali, Jhanji, Kalong, Kapili, Killing, Kohora, Kulsi, Malini, Mora Bharali, Parashali, Puthimari, Ranga, Samaguri, Sankosh, Silsako, Sorusola, Son, Sonai, TengaPukhuri	443	Bihar	Sirsia, Farmar, Ganga, Poonpun, Ram Rekha, Sikrahna	64	Chhattisgarh	Hasdeo, Kharoon, Mahanadi, Seonath, Kelo	55	Daman, Diu and Dadra Nagar Haveli	Damanganga	16	Delhi	Yamuna,	17	Goa	Sal, Mandovi, Talpona, Assonora, Bicholim, Chapora, Khandepar, Sinquerim, Tiracol, Valvant, Zuari	118	Gujarat	Amlakhadi, Bhadar, Bhogavo, Khari, Sabarmati, Vishwamitri, Dhadar, Triveni, Amravati (Tributary Of Narmada), Damanganga, Kolak, Mahi, Shedhi, Tapi, Anas, BalehwarKhadi, Kim, Meshwa, Mindhola, Narmada	209	Haryana	Ghaggar, Yamuna	210	Himachal Pradesh	Sukhana, Markanda, Sirsa, Ashwani, Beas, Giri, Pabbar	711	Jammu & Kashmir	Devika, Banganga, ChuntKol, Gawkadal, Tawi, Basanter, Chenab, Jhelam, Sindh	912	Jharkhand	Garga, Sankh, Subarnarekha, Damodar, Jumar, Konar, Nalkari	713	Karnataka	Arkavathi, Lakshmantirtha, Malprbha, Tungabhadra, Bhadra, Cauvery, Kabini, Kagina, Kali, Krishna, Shimsha, AsangiNalla, Bhima, Kumardhara, Netravathi, Tunga, Yagachi	1714	Kerala	Karamana, Bharathapuzha, Kadambayar, Keecheri, Manimala, Pamba, Bhavani, Chitrapuzha, Kadalundy, Kallai, Karuvannur, Kavvai, Kuppam, Kuttiyady, Mogral, Periyar, Peruvamba, Puzhackal, Ramapuram, Thirur, Uppala	21   15	Madhya Pradesh	Chambal, Khan, Kshipra, Betwa, Sone, Gohad, Kolar, Tapi, Bichia, Chamla, Choupan, Kalisot, Kanhan, Katni, Kunda, Malei, Mandakini (Mp), Newaj, Parvati, Simrar, Tons, Wainganga	2216	Maharashtra	Godavari, Kalu, Kundalika, Mithi, Morna, Mula, Mutha, Nira, Vel, Bhima, Indrayani, Mula-Mutha, Pawana, Wainganga, Wardha, Ghod, Kanhan, Kolar (Mah), Krishna, Mor, Patalganga, Pedhi, Penganga, Purna, Tapi, Urmodi, Venna, Waghur, Wena, Bindusar, Bori, Chandrabhaga, Darna, Girna, Hiwara, Koyna, Pehlar, Sina, Titur, Amba, Bhatsa, Gomai, Kan, Manjeera, Panchganga, Panzara, Rangavali, Savitri, Surya, Tansa, Ulhas, Vaitarna, Vashisti	53Contd…17	Manipur	Nambul, Imphal, Iril, Khuga, Khujairok, Lokchao, Manipur, Thoubal, Wangjing	918	Meghalaya	Umkhrah, Umshyrpi, Kyrhukhla, Nonbah, Umtrew, Lukha, Myntdu	719	Mizoram	Tiau, Tlawng, Tuipui, Tuivawl, Chite, Mat, Saikah, Tuikual, Tuirial	920	Nagaland	Dhansiri, Dzuna, Chathe, Dzu, Dzucha, Sano	621	Odisha	Gangua, GuradihNallah, Kathajodi, Nandirajhor, Daya, Kuakhai, BanguruNallah, Bheden, Brahamani, Budhabalnaga, Kusumi, Mahanadi, Mangala, Nagavalli, Nuna, Ratnachira, Rushikulya, Sabulia, Serua	1922	Puducherry	Arasalar, Chunnambar	223	Punjab	Ghaggar, Satluj, Kali Bein, Beas	424	Rajasthan	Banas, Chambal,	225	Sikkim	ManeyKhola, Rangit, Ranichu, Teesta	426	Tamil Nadu	Cauvery, Sarabanga, ThirumanimUthar, Vasista, Bhavani, Tambirapani	627	Telangana	Musi, Manjeera, Nakkavagu, Karakavagu, Maner, Godavari, Kinnersani, Krishna	828	Tripura	Burigaon, Gumti, Haora, Juri, Khowai, Manu	629	Uttar Pradesh	Hindon, Kalinadi, Varuna, Yamuna, Gomti, Ganga, Ramganga, Betwa, Ghaghara, Rapti, Sai, Saryu	1230	Uttarakhand	Bhela, Dhela, Suswa, Kichha, Kalyani, Ganga, Kosi, Nandour, Pilkhar	931	West Bengal	Vindhadhari, Mahananda, Churni, Dwarka, Ganga, Damodar, Jalangi, Kansi, Mathabhanga, Barakar, Dwarakeshwar, Kaljani, Karola, Mayurkashi, Rupnarayan, Silabati, Teesta	17Grand Total :	351   ANNEXURE –IIAnnexure referred to in reply to part (c) & (d)  of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.4972 to be answered on the 25.03.2021 regarding “Quality of Water of Rivers”.Status of Grossly Polluting Industries (GPIs)Sl.
