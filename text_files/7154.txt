ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) & (b):   Yes, Sir. During 2018-19, the difference between the maximum electricity demand met i.e. 175,590 MW and the minimum electricity demand met i.e. 140,939 MW in the country was 34,651 MW. (c) to (f) :  	The schedule of power supply within the State and the tariff structure thereof, is within the functional jurisdiction of the respective State Government. The retail electricity tariff for consumers are determined by the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC). Accordingly, most of the SERC have determined the time of day tariff for mainly industrial consumers and other large consumers. The States have also started switching over to smart pre payment meters. This will enable consumers to manage their electricity consumption in the most optimal manner and shift the load during low tariff period i.e. off peak periods.Further,  with a view to discourage the consumption of electricity during the peak hours, the Tariff Policy, 2016, stipulates introduction of two-part tariffs featuring separate fixed and variable charges and time differentiated tariff, on priority for large consumers (say, consumers with demand exceeding 1 MW) and subsequently for all consumers. This would also help in flattening the peak and implementing various energy conservation measures.                                         **********
