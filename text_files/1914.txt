The Schemes are demand driven. Financial assistance to the eligible applicant is provided as per the Scheme guidelines against the Expression of Interest issued by the Ministry from time to time. Under the scheme of ‘Infrastructure for Agro-processing Clusters’, one of the component schemes of PMKSY, about 100 projects are envisaged for assistance all over India for agro-processing cluster (APC) infrastructure projects; otherwise called ‘Mini Food Parks’ by 2019-20.
