                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT( SRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI )(a)	Government is implementing the POSHAN  Abhiyaan since 18th December, 2017 to address the problem of malnutrition in the country. The salient features of the  Abhiyaan inter-alia includes ensuring convergence with various programmes; incentivizing States/ Union Territories for achieving targeted goals; Information and Communication Technology enabled Integrated Child Development Services-Common Application Software; Evaluation by NITI Aayog; Setting up of National Nutrition Resource  Centre (NNRC) at National level and State Nutrition Resource Centre (SNRC) in each State/Union Territory; Community Mobilization & Behaviour Change & Communication, Awareness Advocacy  and Information Education Communication; Jan Andolan by educating people on nutritional aspects; Innovation; Strengthening human resource;  measuring height and weight of children below 6 years of age for early detection of stunting and wasting;  strengthening of Training & Capacity Building etc. (b)	POSHAN Abhiyaan focuses on converting the agenda of improving nutrition into a Jan Andolan through wide public participation. In order to strengthen processes for community engagement, information dissemination and empowerment of beneficiaries, the POSHAN Abhiyaan provides for the organization of Community Based Events (CBEs) twice in a month on a fixed day of week at each Anganwadi Centre.  Under Community Based Events, activities like Annaprasan Diwas, Suposan Diwas (specifically focused on orienting husbands), Celebrating coming of age- getting ready for pre-school at AWC, dissemination of messages related to public health for improvement of nutrition and to reduce illness are undertaken. Government has celebrated the month of September, 2019 as Rashtriya Poshan Maah across the country. The main  focus during the month was on five sutras i.e. First 1,000 days of a Child, Diarrhoea Prevention, Paushtik Aahaar, WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene), and Anaemia Prevention. During the month, more than 3.66 crore activities were organized which inter-alia included home visits, community based events, Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Days, Poshan Melas, Poshan Rallies, school based activities, anaemia test-treat-talk camps, Panchayat meetings, local leader meetings.  	The results of the POSHAN Abhiyaan can be known after the programme has completed its approved period.  However, in the meantime, as per the report of Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS) conducted by UNICEF, prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight among children is 34.7%, 17% and 33.4% respectively, which is an improvement and reduction from the levels reported in National Family Health Survey-4.(c)	    Ministry of Women and Child Development has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Tata Trusts for providing the Swasth Bharat Preraks (SBPs) at District and State level. Their mandate is to support in design, planning, implementation, and monitoring of effective and successful implementation of the Abhiyaan. So far,346  SBPs have been provided by the Tata Trusts  which have been deployed in 337 districts of  32 States/UTs.********
