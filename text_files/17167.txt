                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (f): Recognising the impact of COVID-19 on delivery of other essential health services, detailed Guidance note on  enabling Delivery of Essential Health Services during the COVID-19 Outbreak, including treatment of cancer,  were issued in April, 2020. In addition, separate guidelines / advisories on delivery of specific health services, including for treatment of  Tuberculosis and immunization, were also issued from time to time. Status of delivery of       non-COVID essential services was also monitored with States/UTs through video conferencing at various levels in order to ensure that such services are continued. Central Government hospitals have provided treatment to patients other than COVID-19 patients. Emergency and trauma services have been functional and available for other than COVID-19  patients. The Ministry also issued directions to Central Government hospitals as well as to State Governments from time to time to also focus on non-COVID essential health care services. Among the measures taken to ensure   treatment to Tuberculosis patients, guidance was issued to State/UTs for bi-directional TB-COVID screening and screening of Tuberculosis among ILI/SARI cases  as well as for ensuring   functionality of  Tuberculosis  diagnostic labs.        Though subsequent to adoption of containment measures aimed at preventing spread of  COVID-19, utilization of immunization services had slowed down,   there is improvement in situation as the restriction on movement is being eased out. The healthcare facilities are improving gradually after introduction of unlock measures in phased manner.
