ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES (SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a).	As per Mega Food Park Scheme Guidelines, each Mega Food Park on being fully operational, would create direct and indirect employment of about 5000 persons. However, the actual configuration of a project may vary depending upon the business plan. Ministry has accorded final approval to 38 Mega Food Parks and in-principle approval to 3 Mega Food Parks in the country under the Mega Food Park scheme. About 6,66,000 direct and indirect employment have been generated by the 22 operational Mega Food Parks. (b).	Ministry of Food Processing Industries has been implementing Mega Food Park Scheme (MFPS) to create modern infrastructure for the food processing sector. The proposals under scheme for setting up of Mega Food Parks in the country are invited through Expression of Interest. The scheme is not State or Area specific. So far Ministry has approved 2 Mega Food Parks in Sonipat and Rohtak districts of Haryana being implemented by State government Agencies (HSIIDC and HAFED). There is no proposal with the Ministry for setting up of Mega Food Park in Bhiwani-Mahendragarh-Charkhi Dadri districts of Haryana.(c).	Ministry of Food Processing Industries does not maintain district wise data for processing potential for various products in the country. *****
