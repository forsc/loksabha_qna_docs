The schemes are being offered by Public Sector insurers and other insurers. Any person having a bank account is eligible for PMJJBY (age group 18-50 yrs) and for PMSBY (age group 18-70 yrs). The schemes PMJJBY and PMSBY are available on pan India basis for all categories of eligible holders of accounts in banks / Post office who give their consent for enrolment under the schemes and auto debit of relevant premium from their accounts for the same.                                 ******
