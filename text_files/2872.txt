Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) provides guaranteed wage employment of 100 days in a financial year to a rural household whose adult members are willing to take up manual work. An additional 50 days of wage employment is provided over and above 100 days in the notified drought affected areas or natural calamity affected areas in the country on recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) is implemented with the objective of providing self-employment to the members of the rural poor families. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya- Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) and Rural Self Employment and Training Institutes (RSETIs) provides for placement linked skill development programme for wage employment and self employment.  DDU-GKY guidelines provide for State concerned to set up Migration Support Centers (MSCs) in areas of high concentration of placement of skilled youth. The Department of Rural Development is implementing Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission (SPMRM) aimed at developing 300 rural growth clusters called ‘Rurban Clusters’ which have latent potential for growth, in all States and UTs. The Objective of the Mission is to bridge the rural urban divide and to reduce migration from rural to urban areas and eventually to facilitate reverse migration. Besides, Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G) and Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) are also implemented to provide basic needs and developing rural infrastructure for improving living conditions of rural masses so that distress migration of people from rural to cities could be reduced. *****
