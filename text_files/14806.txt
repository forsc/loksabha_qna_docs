ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) to (b): The Consumer Price Index-Combined Inflation in the month of December 2019 was registered at 7.35 per cent. The major contributor to the inflation during that month was food price inflation with the Consumer Food Price Index registering an inflation of 14.19 per cent. The relatively higher inflation witnessed in food items is mainly on account of demand supply mismatch owing to shortfall in production because of adverse weather condition and seasonality.*****
