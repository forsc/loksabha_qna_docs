BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (e) Under the National COVID-19 Vaccination Program, COVID-19 vaccines administration is carried out at government as well as private COVID Vaccination Centres (CVCs). Government and Private CVC wise data maintained from 1st May’21, and a total of 108.55 crore doses (96.3%) of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered at Government CVCs while 4.12 crore doses (3.7%) were administered at Private CVCs as on 7th December 2021.As on 7th December 2021, a total of 4.61 crore doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been procured by private hospitals and 49 lakh doses are balance with the private hospitals. Under the ‘Revised Guidelines for Implementation of National COVID Vaccination Program’, effective from 21st June 2021, domestic vaccine manufacturers have the option to provide upto 25% of their monthly vaccine production directly to private hospitals and any leftover vaccine is also procured by Government of India. Instances of fake Covid Vaccination Camps and/or fake vaccine from Maharashtra, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh have come to the notice of Government of India. The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has formally directed the State Governments to investigate these incidences and take stringent legal and administrative actions so that such fraudulent incidences are not repeated in future. Also, as an additional measure of caution and stringent action, all States/UTs were asked to increase the vigilance within the supply chains and carefully authenticate the product and its physical condition before its use so as to guard against such unscrupulous activities.*****
