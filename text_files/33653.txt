                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING:(SHRI PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a)	 COVID-19 pandemic did impact the fisheries and aquaculture sector like any other sector including exports of fisheries products especially in the first quarter of 2020-21. The lockdown measures put in place by majority of the countries including India during the first half of 2020-21 caused decline in demand and caused disruptions in the supply chain. However, with easing of lockdown within India and the efforts taken by Government to restore and maintain food supply  chain, domestic demand has recovered and most states have reported negligible impact on year to year basis. MPEDA has reported a decline of 12% in marine exports in the same period and stated that from the second quarter of 2020-21 exports have recovered and even registered an increase of 12.8% over the corresponding period of 2019-20. MPEDA has further reported that overall there has been a 6% decline in exports in value terms during 2020-21 and that in the first half of 2021-22 exports have recovered. (b) No formal assessment has been made by the Government about the losses that fisheries sector suffered due to COVID-19.(c)  Does not arise.(d) The Government immediately intervened to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 crisis by announcing a number of immediate relief measures to facilitate uninterrupted supply of inputs like seed and feed to the sector and to promote export. In order to mitigate hardship faced by fishers, fish farmers, and fish traders, Government of India permitted unhindered operations of the fishing and aquaculture industry including feeding, maintenance & harvesting in the farm, processing, packaging, cold chain, sale and marketing, hatcheries, feed plants, commercial aquaria and movement of inputs, fish/shrimp, fish products and workers. Besides, advisories were issued to State Governments and Union Territories (UTs) to include fish and shrimp in the list of commodities to be exempted from lockdown and also to allow movement of fish and fish products, of fish seed & feed for fish farmers/fishers and to allow operation of aquaculture farms and other commercial establishments like aquarium shop etc. In addition, the Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying has launched a flagship scheme namely: Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) as a part of Atmanirbhar Bharat COVID-19 relief package with an estimated investment of Rs. 20050 crores for implementation in all States/UTs over a period of 5 years starting from 2020-21. Under PMMSY, during 2020-21 to 2021-22, the Department of Fisheries, Government of India has accorded approval of project proposals to the tune of Rs. 5917.81 crore with a central share of Rs. 2209.11 crore to States/UTs and other implementing agencies. An amount of Rs. 1311.54 crore has been released to various States/UTs and other implementing agencies from 2020-21 to 2021-22 (till date).  All the efforts of Government have resulted in mitigation of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on fisheries sector and the sector has revived over the last several months.*****
