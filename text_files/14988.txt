ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (e): Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is imported under open general license on the terms and conditions mutually agreed upon between the buyers and sellers. LNG terminals arebeing developed on market principles by the entity based on its own techno-commercial consideration.Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) and GAIL both have signed Tolling Agreements with Dhamra LNG Terminal Pvt. Ltd. as per their own procedures for regas capacity of 3.0 Million Metric Tonne Per Annum (MMTPA) and 1.5 MMTPA respectively for 20 years. IOCL has informed that the tolling charges of Dhamra Terminal is comparable with any other LNG terminal of 5 MMTPA capacity irrespective of the developer and location and same holds true for its Ennore LNG terminal.Booking of regasification capacity in any LNG terminal is normally being done after considering location of terminal, availability of gas pipeline connectivity, reasonability of tolling services/charges and capturable gas demand in that catchment area. GAIL has executed a Tolling Agreement inline with its procedures to meet the supply commitments of customers located in the eastern parts of the country along Jagdishpur-Haldia/Bokaro-Dhamra Pipeline (JHBDPL) project. IOCL has also booked capacity at Dhamra Terminal after considering its captive requirement of Paradip, Haldia and Barauni refineries which are in close proximity of Dhamra LNG Terminal.IOCL has set up Ennore LNG Terminal at a Capital Cost of Rs. 4,500 crore near Chennai to meet the gas requirement of Tamil Nadu and adjoining districts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The supply of gas from Ennore LNG terminal to the gas demand centers of Eastern India would entail extra cost of infrastructure & transportation and has its own techno-commercial considerations.*****
