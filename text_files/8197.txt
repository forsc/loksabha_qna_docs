To supplement their efforts and to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources, the Government of India provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments through various schemes and programmes.The Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation (DoWR, RD & GR) has taken up measures to cover tribal areas with the irrigation projects and schemes being implemented under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY). Under the Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP), 21 out of the 99 prioritized projects benefitted the districts falling in tribal areas. The ultimate irrigation potential of these 21 projects is 10.73 Lakh hectare. Surface Minor Irrigation (SMI) and Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies schemes have been extended to tribal areas, Left Wing Extremist affected areas, drought prone areas with a more liberal funding pattern. Under the Ground Water Irrigation scheme, priority is being given to SC/ST and women farmers.*****
