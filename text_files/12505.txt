                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) to (f):	    A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.--2--  STATEMENT IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *121 FOR ANSWER ON 11.02.2020 REGARDING “ROAD CONNECTIVITY IN LWE AFFECTED AREAS”(a) to (f): Apart from the flagship schemes of the Government of India, two schemes namely Road Requirement Plan (RRP-I) and Road Connectivity Project in Left Wing Extremism Affected Areas (RCPLWEA) are under implementation specifically for LWE affected areas. RRP-1, launched in 2009, envisages construction of 5422 km of roads in LWE affected states. Of these, 54 roads with 1988 km were sanctioned for Chhattisgarh, which was about 27% of the total sanctioned for all the LWE affected States. Of this, only 1575 km length of roads is completed in Chhattisgarh as on 30.11.2019. During 2019-20, only 24.70 km road length could be completed. The remaining 413 km of road are yet to be constructed by the State. RCPLWEA, approved in December 2016, envisages construction of 5412 (340 roads) km of roads, including 891 km for Chhattisgarh. However, a total of 8214 km (802 roads) have been sanctioned based on the available resources. This includes 2479 km (291 roads) for Chhattisgarh. Till now 1429 km have been completed, which include 272.77 km length (02 roads) of Chhattisgarh. The district wise status is annexed. As regards to RRP-I, no proposal is pending with Government of India. At the time of approval the RCPLWEA envisaged construction of 48 roads with 891 km length --3--L.S.SQ.NO. 121 FOR 11.02.2020for Chhattisgarh. However, subsequently 291 roads with 2479 km length i.e. almost 3 times of the originally envisaged length have been sanctioned for Chhattisgarh. This is about 30% total length sanctioned for all the States and is 1588 km more than the originally approved length for Chhattisgarh. A proposal requesting for dropping of 35 roads and taking up 52 roads, in lieu of the dropped roads, has been received from the State in MHA on 24thJanuary, 2020. The additional proposals are considered based on the availability of spare resources and criticality of roads from operational purposes. *****
