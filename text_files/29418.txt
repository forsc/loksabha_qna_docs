ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)       (a) & (b)    During 2021 (till 21.11.21), a total number of 1,64,103 cases have been reported due to Dengue in the country, as against 2,05,243 in 2019. The Case Fatality Rate has been sustained at <1% since 2008.  It has further come down below 0.2% in 2018 and 0.1% in 2019, which has been maintained at this level since then. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the Dengue cases are rising in the Country.Government of India monitors availability of test kits, medicines for management of cases and insecticides for use as anti-larval and anti-adult vector control measures for dengue & other vector borne diseases in the States. No report of stock out received from any State.On receiving the reports of occurrence of Dengue cases in 2021, multidisciplinary Central Teams were deputed to 15 States and UTs of Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Uttarakhand, Delhi and Jammu & Kashmir from 28th August to 19th November 2021.  The teams observed that sufficient diagnostics kits, medicines, insecticides, fogging machines and funds were available with the State/UTs. The vector control measures and case management were also largely adequate. Central Teams have recommended that the states should take adequate proactive measures for source reduction and vector control, ensure early case detection and effective management of the cases.  (c )Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) continuously supports research on clinical, epidemiological, laboratory and basic research related to dengue viral disease, by intramural through ICMR Institutes and extramural funding by providing grants-in-aid given to projects in non-ICMR Institutes).  Vaccine Research: As per information available with ICMR, two companies in India, Panacea Biotech and Serum Institute of India have taken technology of the tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate from NIH/NIAID, USA and have completed phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in India and abroad. Both the companies are now intending to initiate phase 3 clinical trials in India. ICMR is not currently planning any study on malaria vaccine.
