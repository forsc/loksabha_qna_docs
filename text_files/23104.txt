ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a): IISER-Thiruvananthapuram started functioning from its campus in Vithura fully from November, 2018.(b)&(c): The institute is yet to exit from project mode. The reasons for the same include breakdown of initial contract with M/s Consolidated Construction Consortium Limited (CCCL), hard terrain of the region in which the institute is located, heavy rains for almost 7-8 months/year in the region, which preclude constructions and non-availability of adequate number of workforce.(d)&(e): Three departments of IISER Thiruvananthapuram have independent building viz. Chemistry, Biology and Physics. (f) to (h):  No, the institute is not in a position to accommodate all students on a single-occupancy basis if they join the residential campus during the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic. However, furnishing of 1000- Bed hostel is to be undertaken, post completion of the same the institute can accommodate all students on a single-occupancy basis if they join the residential campus during prevailing Covid-19 pandemic.*****
