ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) Under erstwhile National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), now subsumed under the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), the coverage was monitored in terms of habitations having provision of minimum 40 litre per capita per day (lpcd) of potable drinking water with sources at a reasonable distance. As reported by States/ UTs, as on 01.03.2020, 81.66% rural habitations having 77.34% population have provision of minimum 40 litre per capita per day (lpcd) of potable drinking water and 15.40% rural habitations having 19.37% population have service level of less than 40 lpcd potable water, whereas 2.94% rural habitations having 3.29% population with water sources having quality issues. State/ UT-wise details of coverage of rural habitations are placed at Annex I.(b), (c) & (e) Water is a State subject. Government of India supplements the efforts of States/ UTs by providing financial and technical assistance through the centrally sponsored programme Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM). It is States who plan, approve & implement drinking water supply & security schemes. Under erstwhile NRDWP, to encourage States to achieve drinking water security, upto a maximum of 10% of Central fund could be utilized under sustainability component. Further, in 2019-20, Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), a time-bound, mission-mode water conservation campaign was launchedwhich aims at making water conservation a ‘Jan Andolan’ through asset creation and communication campaign. Moreover, to enable every rural household in the country to have potable water at service level of 55 litre per capita per day (lpcd) through Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC)by 2024, Government of India, in partnership with the States, has launched Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) with an estimated cost of Rs. 3.60 lakh Crore.In consonance with 73rd Amendment to the Constitution of India, under JJM, the in-village water supply infrastructure including water resources and grey water management will be planned, implemented, managed, operated and maintained by the Gram Panchayat or it’s sub-committee/ users group i.e. Village Water & Sanitation Committee (VWSC) or PaaniSamiti. This would ensure that local community owns and manage the water supply system for long-term sustainability and drinking water security.State/ UT-wise details of coverage of rural habitations during the last three years are placed at Annex II.(d) Water being a State subject, individual projects for rural water supply, including projects for setting up of desalination plants, are not maintained/ approved at the Government of India Level.****
