The Central Government supplements the initiatives of the State Governments through various advisories and schemes for the capacity building of their LEAs.In order to make Internet Safe & Trusted for all its users, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has initiated many projects like Setting up of a Collaborative and Comprehensive Live Cyber Operations Specific Exercise Training Facility (CyberCloset) for Indian Cyber Space, Development of Cyber Forensic Training cum Investigation Labs in North-Eastern States and Cloud based centralized Cyber Forensics Lab Infrastructures and Capacity Development on Smart Device Forensics Investigations and Creation of Resource Centre for the North Eastern Police Forces.Further, to strengthen the mechanism to deal with the cyber crimes Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has taken steps for capacity building/ training of law enforcement personnel/ prosecutors/ judicial officers; improving cyber forensic facilities; etc. MHA has set up the ‘Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C)’ to deal with all types of cyber crime in the country, in a coordinated and comprehensive manner A state of the art National Cyber Forensic Laboratory has been established, as a part of the I4C, at CyPAD, Dwarka, New Delhi to provide early stage cyber forensic assistance to Investigating Officers (IOs) of State/UT Police. MHA has also set up a National Cyber Forensic Lab (Evidence) at Hyderabad for evidentiary purpose which will provide the necessary forensic support in cases of evidence related to cyber crime. A Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) platform, namely ‘CyTrain’ portal has been developed under I4C for capacity building of police officers/judicial officers through online course on critical aspects of cybercrime investigation, forensics, prosecution etc. along with certification. More than 11,200 Police Officers from States/UTs are registered and more than 2750 Certificates issued through the portal.
