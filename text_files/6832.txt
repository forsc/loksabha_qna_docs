Therefore any comparison with the Railway freight tariff structure shall not be accurate.(b)	No, Sir. Indian Railways’ freight business has increased by seven times approximately in the last fifty years i.e. from 167.39 million tonnes in 1970-71 to 1159.55 million tonnes in 2017-18. (c)    A number of steps have been taken by Indian Railways to increase its freight business. Major steps include adoption of rake load concept, containerization, designing new wagons with higher payload, Long Term Tariff Contract Policy, Own Your Wagon Scheme, Private Freight Terminal Policy and Freight Incentive Schemes.*****
