However, due to excess production of sugar than demand during the last few sugar seasons and similar projection of excess production during the current sugar season, prices of sugar remain subdued which adversely affected the liquidity of sugar mills. To improve the liquidity position of sugar mills and to enable them to make timely payments to sugar cane farmers, Central Government has taken various measures in the form of assistance schemes to sugar mills during the last 3 sugar seasons and the current sugar season 2020-21. In order to ensure that the assistance amount goes into the accounts of farmers against cane dues, the sugar mills have to open a no-lien account in a nationalized/cooperative bank and the assistance amount of Central Government is credited into that account. Thereafter, the banks credit the received assistance amount into the accounts of farmers on behalf of the sugar mills against cane dues payable and subsequent balance, if any, is credited into mills account.(c): 	No Sir.(d): 	No Sir.(e): 	Does not arise.****
