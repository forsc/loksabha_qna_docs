For ensuring supply of clean drinking water at stations as well as in trains, Ministry of Railways has issued instructions to  Zonal Railways to provide clean drinking water at railway premises by adopting “Uniform Drinking Water Quality Monitoring Protocol” issued by Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation in February’ 2013.  Drinking water supplied to the railway passengers at stations through drinking water taps is suitably treated, as per requirement, before the exit point of supply. Regular tests are conducted to ensure its quality. Besides this, sale of Rail Neer (Packaged Drinking Water) has been made mandatory in all trains running with pantry cars and all static catering units at 312 stations. In case of non-mandatory units (trains/stations), Packaged Drinking Water of other approved brands is permitted for sale. Presently, approximately 9.5 lakh litres of Rail Neer (Packaged Drinking Water) is being supplied to passengers on Indian Railways per day from 11 operational plants. In addition to above, 1962 Water Vending Machines (WVMs) have been installed at 685 Railway stations across the country to provide drinking water of prescribed standards at affordable rates.  ii.	Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited (IRCTC) has installed CCTV (Closed Circuit Television) cameras in the kitchens under its management. Live streaming is available in these kitchens on IRCTC’s website and Rail-Drishti portal of Railways (https://www.raildrishti.in). This enables close and live monitoring of the activities in the kitchens both by officials and the public. iii.	IRCTC has enabled Quick Response (QR) codes to be pasted on food casseroles at 27 Kitchens. iv.	IRCTC has upgraded 46 existing Kitchen Units during the last 02 years.v.
