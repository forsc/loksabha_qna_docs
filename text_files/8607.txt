                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(a) to (f) The Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), launched in 2014, inter-alia, envisaged universal access to banking facilities with at least one basic banking account for every household, financial  literacy,  access  to  credit,  insurance and pension.To further consolidate the gains made under PMJDY and to give impetus to the ongoing financial inclusion initiatives of the Government, the PMJDY program has been extended beyond 2018 with the focus of opening of accounts shifting from “every household” to “every un-banked adult” and making the scheme more attractive with the following modifications:  (i)  Existing OD limit revised from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 10,000;(ii) No conditions attached for active PMJDY accounts availing OD upto Rs. 2,000;(iii) Age limit for availing OD facility revised from 18-60 years to 18-65 years; and(iv) Accident insurance cover for new RuPay card holders raised from existing Rs.1 lakh to Rs. 2 lakhs for new PMJDY accounts opened after 28.8.2018.As informed by banks, achievements under PMJDY, as on 13.11.2019 are as follow:?	37.47 crore Jan-Dhan accounts have been opened with deposit balance of  Rs.106939.35 crore. ?	While women have 53% share (19.97 crore) in Jan-Dhan accounts, 59% (21.99 crore) Jan-Dhan accounts are in rural and semi-urban areas.?	29.69 crore RuPay debit cards have been issued to PMJDY account-holders.As informed by Reserve Bank of India (RBI), number of ATMs deployed by banks including White Label ATMs as on 30.6.2014 and 30.9.2019 is as under:Region	No. of ATMs deployed by banks including White Label ATMs as on	Percentage increase in the number of ATMs	30.6.2014	30.9.2019	Rural & Semi Urban Centres	71,814	1,08,356	50.9Urban  & Metro Centres	97,691	1,19,530	22.4Total	1,69,505	2,27,886	34.4Further RBI has informed that number of outstanding debit cards as in May 2014 and September 2019 were 40.17 crore and 83.55 crore respectively. As per RBI’s master circular on “Customer Services in Banks’’ dated 1.7.2015, banks have to ensure that a suitable grievance redressal mechanism exists for receiving and addressing complaints from their customers with specific emphasis on resolving such complaints fairly and expeditiously, regardless of source of the complaints. If the complaints are not redressed by the banks, customers can also approach the concerned Banking Ombudsman. Data on bank related complaints are not centrally maintained. Since the PMJDY scheme is implemented by banks, as and when any complaint is received in this regard, the same is forwarded to the concerned banks for their redressal, as per extant guidelines. Targets for Financial Inclusion plans are finalised by the concerned banks based on their Board approved policy. As informed by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), 5,772 claims have been paid to the PMJDY account holders under the accident insurance coverage available with RuPay debit card issued under PMJDY as on 22.11.2019.   State/UT-wise data on claims paid under the accident insurance cover linked with RuPay card is not centrally maintained in the Department.****
