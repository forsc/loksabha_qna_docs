As reported by field units, telecommunication systems in Marathwada region in Maharashtra is operating smoothly.(b)	The decrease in number of landline customers of Bharat Sanchar Nigam limited (BSNL) in the aforesaid region during the last 3 years is due to high penetration of mobile service over landline.
