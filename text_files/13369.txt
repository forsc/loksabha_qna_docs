                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (e) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.  ***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.2256 BY SHRI ADALA PRABHAKARA REDDY TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 04.03.2020 REGARDING THIRD RAILWAY LINE BETWEEN VIJAYAWADA TO GUDUR(a) The third line project between Vijayawada to Gudur of 287 Km has been sanctioned in 2017. Anticipated cost of the project is ?3246 crore. So far, an expenditure of ?1385 crore has been incurred on this project.  The project involve land acquisition of private land; 32.74 acres, Government Land: 6.40 acres and forest land of 1.23 acres. The land acquisition has been taken up by the State Government of Andhra Pradesh. Work has been taken up in available land.  (b) No, Sir.(c) Does not arise.(d) So far, an expenditure of ?1385 crore has been incurred on this project.  Budget Allocation:Average Annual Budget allocation for Infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/partly in Andhra Pradesh during 2014-19 has been enhanced to  2830 crore per year during 2014-2019 from ?886 crore per year during 2009-14 which is 319% of 2009-14. Total allocation of Budget for Infrastructure projects & safety works falling fully/ partly in State of Andhra Pradesh, in 2019-20 is  3885 crore which is 438% of  the average annual allocation of 2009-14. Commissioning of projects: During 2009-14, 363 Km (81 Km of New line, 144 Km of Gauge Conversion and 138 Km of Doubling projects) have been commissioned in the state at an average rate 72.6 km per year.  In 2014-19, 377 Km (258 Km of New Line and 119 Km of Doubling projects) have been commissioned in the state at an average rate 75.3 Km per year.  Thus, the commissioning  during 2014-19 was 104% of 2009-14. For early execution of projects, State Government should ensure depositing their share in time to Railways for cost sharing projects. Presently for all cost sharing projects with Government of Andhra Pradesh, around ?1411 crore is outstanding towards State Government share. This amount should be deposited by State Government to Railway quickly.   (e) The completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions, cooperation and zeal of State Government for early completion of project, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions  of working agencies/contractors etc. and all these factors vary from project to project and site to site and affect the completion time and cost of the project. Hence, the firm time line cannot be given at this stage.*****
