ANSWER




 MINISTER OF  PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a)&(b): 	During FY 2018-19, import of coking coal was 51.84 MT (Prov.). The  details of coking coal imported from Australia, Canada and the United States is given below:- Country	Imported Coking Coal (MT) in 2018-19 (Provisional)	Quantity	Percentage ShareAustralia	36.930	71.24Canada	4.294	8.28USA	4.133	7.97Others	6.481	12.50Total	51.838	100 (c)to(d): 	The entire demand of coking coal is not met from domestic production as the supply of high quality coal/ coking coal (low-ash-coal) in the country is limited and thus no option is left but to resort to import of coking coal. As per the import policy, coal is kept under Open General License (OGL) and consumers are free to import coal from the source of their choice as per their contractual prices on payment of applicable duty. Government does not interfere in the process of import of coal.  Hence, coking coal will continue to be imported as there is limited availability of coking coal in the country. Further, power plants designed on imported coal will also continue to import coal.   Reduction in Import of coal in the country is always a priority area of the Government. In order to increasing the availability of coking coal/thermal coal, following steps are taken by the Government:  •	Coal India Limited (CIL) has planned to increase coking coal production substantially. •	Notification of additional 2 coking coal grades viz. W-V & W-VI. •	New 9 coking coal washeries being set up by CIL by 2020-21. •	Long term Fuel Supply Agreements (FSAs) with Steel companies -10-15 years’ linkage to Steel Sector. •	Supply of washed coking coal to Steel sector proposed to be enhanced to meet the demand of that sector. (e): 	During 2018-19, the import of thermal coal from Australia was 23.52 MT. In order to increase domestic availability of thermal coal, the following steps are being taken:•	CIL and its subsidiaries are going for higher capacity mega mines (Capacities > 10 MTY) with high mechanization. •	CIL has already introduced state of the art technology to improve its work efficiency. High capacity Heavy Earth Moving Machinery (HEMMs) like 42 cum Shovel with 240 T Rear Dumper have been introduced for this purpose. •	Surface Miners have been introduced in opencast mines in a big way to improve operational efficiency & to cater environmental needs by CIL. During 2018-19, in CIL, around 50% of the opencast coal production was through Surface miners and is likely to further increase in subsequent years. ****
