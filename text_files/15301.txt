ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a) to (e) The guidelines on Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) provides for creation of durable community assets based on the locally felt needs which also includes non-conventional renewable energy systems/ devices, solar lighting systems, battery operated buses for government agencies  and ‘Gobar gas plant’  for community use etc.  The list of items permissible under MPLADS, which is not exhaustive but indicative, is available at Annexure IV E of Guidelines on MPLADS. At present there is no such proposal to include “Development of Solar Village” as a specific item in the said list. However, The MPLADS guidelines are amended from time to time to include works as per locally felt needs of the community and in line with advancements in technology etc.It is the prerogative of the Member of Parliament to recommend developmental works within the constituency in respect of any item,  listed in Annexure IV-E, without any financial ceiling subject to fulfilling other provisions of the guidelines on MPLADS. Accordingly, question of enhancement of funds for the purpose may not arise.                                                ****
