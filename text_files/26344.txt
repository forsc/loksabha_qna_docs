ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PETROLEUM & NATURAL GAS(SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) to (d): A statement is laid on the Table of the House.Statement referred to in reply to parts (a) to (d) of Lok Sabha StarredQuestion No. 194 asked by Shri B. N. Bache Gowda and Shri BhartruhariMahtab to be answered on 2nd August, 2021 regarding “Diversification ofImport of Crude Oil”.(a) To ensure security of crude supplies and to mitigate the risk ofdependence on crude from single region, Oil Public Sector Undertakings(PSUs) procure crude from countries located at various geographical locationsviz. Middle East, Africa, North America, South America, etc..(b) & (c) During FY 2019-20, before Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries (OPEC) imposed a cut, import of crude oil by Oil PSUs from MiddleEast Countries was 69.02% (88.9 Million Metric Tonne (MMT) out of totalimport of 128.8 MMT) but during FY 2020-21, import of crude oil from MiddleEast reduced to 63.49% (69.9 MMT out of total import of 110.1 MMT). Thisreduction in import of crude from Middle East is mainly on account of crude oilproduction cut by OPEC since May, 2020, as countries which are members ofOPEC, produce and export crude oil to buyer countries as per their agreedmodified quota of OPEC plus.(d) Oil PSUs are also sourcing crude oil from Guyana and USA. IOCL hasalso bought its first crude oil cargo from Guyana in July 2021and entered into aterm contract with USA for optional purchase of US grade crude oil. Indian OilCorporation Limited (IOCL) has signed a term contract with Rosneft, NationalOil Company of Russia, to source Urals grade crude.********
