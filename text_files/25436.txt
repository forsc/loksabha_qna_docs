                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE  ???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????	    (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	to (b): As per report on Land Use Statistics for 2017-18 (latest available), the details of cultivable land for the last five years are given in table below.                                                                                 (Million hectares)Year	Cultivable land2013-14	181.852014-15	181.832015-16	181.602016-17	181.132017-18	181.07The reduction in percentage of agricultural land has been mainly due to diversion of land for non-agricultural purposes such as urbanization, roads, industries, housing etc. While there is shift in agricultural land for non agricultural purposes, non-agricultural land is also being brought under agricultural uses.(c): 	 As per the Seventh Schedule of Constitution of India, land comes under the purview of State Governments and, therefore, it is for them to take suitable steps to control / restrict the loss of agricultural land. However, Government of India supplements the efforts of States, through appropriate policy measures. In order to check decline in the cultivable area in the country, under the National Policy for Farmers – 2007 (NPF-2007), State Governments have been advised to earmark lands with low biological potential such as uncultivable land, land affected by salinity, acidity, etc., for non-agricultural development activities, including industrial and construction activities. National Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy – 2007 (NRRP-2007) has also recommended that as far as possible, projects may be set up on waste land, degraded land or un-irrigated land and acquisition of irrigated, multi-cropped agricultural land for non-agricultural uses may be kept to the minimum and avoided, to the extent possible.Ministry of Rural Development is implementing an Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) for development of rainfed / degraded areas. The IWMP has been converted to the Watershed Development Component of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) from the financial year 2015-16 principally for development of rainfed portions of net cultivated area and culturable wastelands. The activities being undertaken through the watershed development projects inter alia include ridge area treatment, drainage line treatment, soil and moisture conservation, rain water harvesting, nursery raising, afforestation, horticulture, pasture development, livelihoods for asset less persons etc.In order to bring waste/degraded land into cultivation, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has developed several location specific bio-engineering measures to check soil erosion due to run-off of rain water, sand dune stabilization and shelter belt technology to check wind erosion, reclamation technology for saline, sodic, waterlogged and acid soils in the country. Agro forestry intervention has also been suggested. The ICAR also imparts training, organises Frontline Demonstrations (FLDs) etc. to educate farmers on all these aspects.*******
