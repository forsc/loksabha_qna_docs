As per All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report 2019-20, there are total 8985 Higher Education institutions in the State of Uttar Pradesh.(b) and (c)Ministry of Education does not provide financial assistance to Indian students for higher studies abroad. Students going abroad for pursuing higher education do not require any kind of permission from the Department of Higher Education. This Ministry facilitates offers of scholarships received from bilateral partner countries/institutions who then select students for the award of scholarship from those recommended students. All the expenses related with scholarship are borne by the bilateral partner countries.(d) As per AISHE report 2019-20, the total students’ enrolment in the country during the academic year 2019-20 was 3.86 Crore, whereas the no. of students went abroad is 2,59,655 during the year 2020.(e) Government of India is committed to provide world class education to the students in India itself. Efforts are made to not only retain the students passing out of the premier educational institutions in the country, but also to attract the non-resident Indians back to the Country. Under the Prime Minister’s Research Fellowship scheme, attractive fellowship is offered to selected students to pursue their Ph. D. in Indian Universities/ Institutions. Research Parks have been established in several institutes to augment the research ecosystem in the Country to enable the students to pursue their R&D interests in India. Global Initiative for Academic Network (GIAN) has also been initiated to tap the talent pool of scientists and entrepreneurs from abroad, including those of Indian origin, to augment the country’s existing academic resources. Emphasis is given on establishment of World Class Institutions for enabling higher education institutions in India to have world class academic and research facilities. Central Universities have opened International Students’ Office in their campuses. It has been proposed to conduct Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) in 25 cities abroad (24 countries), National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) in 13 countries, Central Universities Entrance Test (CUET) in 13 countries in the year 2022.(f) At present there is no such proposal to formulate any scheme to open campuses/centres of Allahabad University in foreign countries.***
