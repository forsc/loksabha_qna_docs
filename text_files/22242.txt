                                                        THE MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d) Under Digital India Programme, Ministry is implementing e-Panchayat Mission Mode Project (MMP) with the aim to transform the functioning of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), making them more transparent, accountable and effective as the crucial link in decentralized local self-governments. Funds are provided to National Informatics Center Services Inc. (NICSI) for Central-level support for maintenance of e-Panchayat applications, faculty support and programme management. So far, Rs. 17.68 cr. has been released to NICSI in the current year. The Ministry launched eGramSwaraj, a work-based Accounting Application for Panchayati Raj Institutions under the e-Panchayat MMP on 24th April 2020. This application encompasses all aspects of Panchayat functioning viz. planning, budgeting, accounting, monitoring, asset management etc, on a single digital platform including online payments. So far 2.47 lakh Gram Panchayats (GPs) for 2020-21 and 1.58 lakh GPs for 2021-22 have prepared and uploaded their Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs). 2.35 lakh GPs have closed their year books for the year 2019-20 and 1.92 lakh GPs have closed month books for 2020-21. Furthermore, under 14th Finance Commission, 1.03 lakh GPs and 1.43 lakh GPs have carried out online transactions during 2019-20 and 2020-21 respectively. Similarly, 1.08 lakh GPs have carried online transactions under XV Finance Commission in the current year. The Ministry constantly engages with the States for continuous improvement of the eGramSWARAJ Application.(e) eGramSwaraj has been integrated with Public Financial Management System (PFMS), called eGramSwaraj-PFMS Interface (eGSPI), for tracking fund flow under Central Finance Commission provided to the Panchayats and carrying out real time payments to service providers. eGSPI envisages to establish sound financial management system, enhance transparency and accountability of Panchayats. Further, for strengthening financial management of PRIs, Ministry also launched an application – AuditOnline, on 15th April 2020, for online audit of PRI accounts. This is in compliance with the XV Finance Commission recommendations of ensuring availability of audited accounts online.*****
