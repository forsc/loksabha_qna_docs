ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD))(a) & (b): Recently, Bhopal-Mumbai-Bhopal and Gwalior-Mumbai-Gwalior routes have been operationalized by Scheduled airline operators. After repeal of the Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation market has been deregulated. Consequently, airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type for selecting whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate across the country. Thus, it is up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and their commercial viability, in compliance with the relevant guidelines in this matter. However, Ministry regularly interacts with the stakeholders, including airlines, from time to time with an aim to promote air connectivity.
