                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a): 	The details of number of houses constructed under Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana - Gramin (PMAY-G) in the Districts of Darjeeling and Kalimpong since April, 2019 till date (08.12.2021) is given as under:Name of the District	Houses Constructed (in nos.)Darjeeling	               2,255 Kalimpong	               1,469 (b): 	Under PMAY-G, the target is the construction of 2.95 crore houses to achieve the objective of “Housing for All” in rural areas. Under PMAY-G, the beneficiaries have been identified based on the housing deprivation parameters prescribed under Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011. After due verification by the Gram Sabha and completion of Appellate Process Gram panchayat-wise Permanent Wait List (PWL) is prepared. The auto generated priority list of households from SECC, 2011 database was provided to the States/Union Territories (UTs) for conducting Gram Sabha meetings to finalize the PWL. As on 08.12.2021, a total of 2.15 crore households have been identified and included in PWL from SECC, 2011. Further, the details of such households who, though eligible for inclusion in PWL, but were left out from the SECC 2011 based PWL, have been captured in the Awaas+ Mobile App based Survey. The Survey was conducted during January, 2018 and 7th March 2019. In this exercise, the States/UTs have uploaded details of additional households. The beneficiaries from finalised Awaas+ lists are also being granted benefits under PMAY-G as per the approved guidelines, within a ceiling of 2.95 crore houses under PMAY-G. No applications from households are required under this scheme as beneficiaries are identified from the PWL of PMAY-G based on SECC 2011 and finalised Awaas+ list, thus online application service is not proposed. (c): 	Under PMAY-G, assistance is provided to construct houses with basic amenities in rural areas. Central Share of funds under the scheme is released to the States/UTs including the State Government of West Bengal. The Government does not support any scheme of the Govt. of West Bengal known as Bangla Awas Yojana. However, the Ministry has received complaints that the State Govt of West Bengal is using name of Bangla Awaas Yojana on PMAY-G houses. The complaints are being inquired into.********
