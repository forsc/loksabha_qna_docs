ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)	Yes Sir. Under Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) farm livelihood interventions are designed towards diversifying income sources, reducing fluctuation in income and assuring sustainable income along with food and nutritional security at the household level. Farm livelihoods intervention is touching women in Self Help Groups (SHGs) through one or more of its programmatic pillars viz. Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana (MKSP), Farm Livelihoods intervention under SRLM-Annual Action Plan, Farm Value Chain Interventions and Promotion of Organic Clusters.  Further, to address issue of nutritional security, Agri Nutri gardens are being established at SHG Households. So far, a total of 75.10 lakh Mahila Kisan households have been covered for promotion of Agri Nutri Gardens across the country. The Mission has adopted an innovative model by integrating livestock rearing along with Agri Nutri Garden to ensure supply of the required animal protein. Some of these have also been promoted through State level convergence with other schemes like Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Furthermore, Community Based Organizations (Self Help Groups, Village Organisations and Cluster Level Federations etc.) promoted under DAY-NRLM participate in Poshan Maah/Pakhwada for creating awareness about importance of nutrition and thereby promoting Agri Nutri Gardens as source of 365 days family nutrition. For the Financial Year 2021-22, a target of promoting 24.77 lakh Agri Nutri Gardens has been set for Mahila Kisan households. (b) 	Under DAY-NRLM, farm livelihoods interventions are being implemented in 614 districts across the country. Agri Nutri Garden is a part of these interventions. In Odisha, all 30 Districts have been covered under these interventions and the programme is being implemented through Odisha Livelihoods Mission (OLM). The Mission does not maintain the district wise data. However, the State wise available data is enclosed in Annexure.(c) 	DAY- NRLM is a demand driven programme. On the basis of the demand from the State, the funds are being released as per the approved Annual Action Plan. There is no separate fund allotted for Agri Nutri garden. Therefore, the question of fund allocation for Agri Nutri Garden component does not arise.  *******
