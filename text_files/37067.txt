                                                        ANSWERMINISTER FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING (SHRI PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a) to (c) Manufacturing, sale and distribution of drugs, including vaccines for veterinary use, is regulated under provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules thereunder through a system of inspection and licensing. Laboratories at Indian Council of Agricultural Research - Indian Veterinary Research Institute (ICAR-IVRI), Izatnagar and Chaudhary Charan Singh National Institute of Animal Health (CCSNIAH), Baghpat are recognized as Central Drug Laboratories for testing animal vaccines. Besides, Department has designated other laboratories of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) for testing of vaccines procured centrally. Availability of animals, often a challenge for testing veterinary vaccines, is ensured with support of State Governments, ICAR, veterinary universities, etc.Government has taken various measures to facilitate research and development and developed plans for faster quality testing mechanisms for animal vaccines. The erstwhile method for potency testing of vaccines, has been replaced using cell culture / embryonated eggs i.e. in vitro testing. Further, research for alternate laboratory animal models and other in vitromethods, continues for vaccine potency and safety testing of various vaccines.Government has taken various measures to ensure that animal vaccines meet quality control test standards including strengthening of existing Quality Control (QC) laboratories. Further, standards of QC testing are regularly revised.(d)	Government, under Livestock Health & Disease Control (LH&DC) scheme, supplements the efforts of States / UTs towards animal health by providing them financial assistance. To bring veterinary services at farmers’ doorsteps, the Central Government, from 2021-22, is providing 100% central funds towards procurement & customization of mobile veterinary units (MVUs). However, recurring operational expenditure would be shared with States in the ratio of 90:10 for North Eastern & Himalayan States; 60% for other States, and 100% for UTs.Each MVU will have one veterinarian, one para-veterinarian and one driver-cum-attendant. There is provision for operating these MVUs on PPP mode with the Government providing the infrastructure but manpower outsourced by implementing agency including cooperatives and milk unions etc.****
