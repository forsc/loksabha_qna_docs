ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI AND TRIBAL AFFAIRS(SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a)  Atal Bhujal Yojana is not being implemented in Rohtak Lok Sabha Constituency. While States for implementation of Atal Bhujal Yojana were selected by the Government of India, based on the criticality of groundwater situation, willingness and degree of preparedness; Districts, Blocks and Gram Panchayats were selected by the concerned States. (b)  Although, Atal Bhujal Yojana is not being implemented in Rohtak Lok Sabha Constituency, however, measures have been taken by Government of India for improving ground water level in Rohtak. Central Ground Water Board is periodically monitoring the ground water levels throughout the Country on a regional scale including Rohtak district, through a network of monitoring wells. During November 2020, the depth to water level in the Rohtak ranged from 0.4 to 14 metres below ground level (m bgl).  In a major part of the Rohtak, water level is in the range of 0 to 5 mbgl. The water level between 10 and 20 mbgl is also observed in few wells.In order to assess the decline in water level on a long-term basis, the water level data collected by CGWB during November 2020 has been compared with the decadal average (2010-2019). Analysis of water level data indicates that about 73% of the wells monitored have registered decline in ground water levels, mostly in the range of 0 – 2 m. Further, about 27% of the wells monitored have registered rise in ground water levels, mostly in the range of 0 – 2 m.The important measures taken by CGWB for sustainable management of Ground Water including improving the ground water level in Rohtak are –Contd...P/2//2//i.	 Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater- 2020 has been prepared by CGWB in consultation with States/UTs which is a macro level plan indicating various structures for the different terrain conditions of the country including estimated cost.  In Rohtak District, the Master Plan envisages construction of 7213 nos. of farm pond & 11745 nos. of roof-top rain water harvesting structures.ii.	CGWB has taken up Aquifer Mapping and Management Programme during XII Plan, under the scheme of Ground Water Management and Regulation.  The Aquifer Mapping is aimed to delineate aquifer disposition and their characterization for preparation of aquifer/ area specific ground water management plans with community participation.  The management plans for Rohtak district are shared with the State government agencies for taking appropriate measures / implementation. (c)   In view of reply to (a), the question does not arise.*****
