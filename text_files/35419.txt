For the period 2013-14 to 2020-21, collection of cess is as per Finance Accounts i.e. it gives figures for actual collection of cess. Utilisation is assumed as per actual expenditure in the schemes to be funded. Though actual expenditure of the Department of Health & Family Welfare is provided however health and education cess has been levied from 2018-19.(c) & (d):  The Health and Education Cess is the part of the Central Tax, which is not shareable with States. However, Central Government releases share in shareable Central Taxes/ Duties to State Governments as "Tax devolution" in accordance with approved recommendations made by the Finance Commission during its respective award period. Accordingly, Government of India has devolved the share in taxes to all States (including Telangana) from the year 2013-14 till date. There is no pendency as regards tax devolution to States (including Telangana).********************
