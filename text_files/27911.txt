                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND DAIRYING(SHRI PARSHOTTAM RUPALA)(a) & (b) Dairy Entrepreneurship Development Scheme (DEDS) has been discontinued from 2020-21 based on the recommendation of evaluation study conducted by NITI Ayog.(c) & (d) The Government of India during 2018-19 has announced extension of the facilities of Kisan Credit Card (KCC) to fisheries and animal husbandry farmers to help them meet their working capital needs. The KCC facility is to help fisheries and animal husbandry farmers to meet their short term credit requirements of rearing of animals, poultry birds, fish, shrimp, other aquatic organisms and capture of fish.Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying (DAHD), Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying has also established Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF) with a fund size of Rs. 15000 crore to incentivize investments by eligible entities like individual entrepreneurs, private companies, Micro Small and Medium Enterprises(MSMEs), Farmers Producers Organizations (FPOs) and Section 8 companies. Farmers can take advantage under AHIDF for establishment of silage, fodder block unit and total mixed ration plants for small to large quantity manufacturing of animal feeds and fodder.

Under the scheme, 50% capital subsidy is available for eligible entrepreneurs (Individual/SHGs/ FCO/ FPO/JLGs and section 8 companies).
