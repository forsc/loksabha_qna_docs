                                                        ANSWER                  MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT                                (SHRI FAGGAN SINGH KULASTE)(a)	Digital India Land Records Modernization Programme (DILRMP) is being implemented as a Central Sector Scheme with effect from 1st April, 2016 with 100 % funding by the Centre. The objective of DILRMP is to develop a modern, comprehensive and transparent land record management system with the aim to develop an Integrated Land Information Management System which will inter alia: (i) improve real-time information on land; (ii) optimize use of land resources;(iii) benefit both landowners and prospectors;(iv) assist in policy and planning;(v) reduce land disputes;(vi) check fraudulent/benami transactions ;(vii) obviate need of physical visits to Revenue/Registration offices  and (viii) enable sharing of information with various organization/agencies.(b)	Department of Land Resources is collaborating with Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Pune for a Multilingual land records software application to transliterate the Records of Rights to any of the 22   languages mentioned in Schedule VIII of the Constitution of India.(c)	DILRMP a Central Sector Scheme is being implemented through States/UTs.  Hence Detailed Project Report (DPR) is not required. Funds are released to States/UTs on receipt of proposals from them after examination and approval as per provisions of the DILRMP Guidelines.(d)	As per information received from Ministry of Panchayati Raj, due to the huge requirement for GIS manpower, more than 759 GIS Digitizers have been engaged at various feature extraction centres of Survey of India (SoI) for generating maps under SVAMITVA scheme.  As a result, numerous START-UPs and MSME service companies have started augmenting their GIS manpower bench strength to cater to these requirements.  Further, drone requirements for SVAMITVA scheme has boosted the Drone Manufacturing sector in India. Apart from this, SoI is also hiring drone services and trained drone pilots to augment the deployment of resources to meet the scheme targets. All these have contributed towards creation of employment opportunities.                                                   ****
