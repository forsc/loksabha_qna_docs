ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b) No Sir. India has underscored the importance of fulfilling the commitment of developed countries to achieve the goal of mobilizing USD 100 billion annually by 2020 and further scaling it up thereafter. India has stressed that the level of climate finance flows from developed countries to developing countries should be fixed at a higher level by 2023.(c) The Kyoto Protocol (KP) of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) provided that the developed country Parties included in Annex I must ensure that their aggregate anthropogenic carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of green house gases do not exceed their assigned amounts, with a view to reducing their overall emissions of such gases by at least five percent below 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008 to 2012. The targets were collectively complied with and achieved while United States of America (USA) did not ratify the KP and Canada withdrew from it.The Doha Amendments to the Kyoto Protocol, at the 18th COP brought in the Second Commitment Period of KP. The Doha Amendment provided that the developed country Parties included in Annex I must ensure that their aggregate anthropogenic carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of greenhouse gases do not exceed their assigned amounts, with a view to reducing their overall emissions of such gases by at least eighteen percent below 1990 levels in the commitment period 2013 to 2020. The Doha Amendment has not been ratified by requisite number of Parties till date to bring it into force. (d) & (e) As per India’s 2nd Biennial Update Report 2018, India has achieved emission intensity reduction of its GDP by 21% between 2005 and 2014, against the voluntary pledge to reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 20–25 % by 2020, compared with 2005 level.****
