ANSWER




MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a & b):   The total estimated coal resources in the country is 319.02 billion tonnes as per “The inventory of Geological Resources of Indian Coal” (as on 01.04.2018), prepared by the Geological Survey of India. Every year about 3 to 5 billion tonnes of proved (measured) resources are being added through fresh exploration to the Coal Inventory of India. If present rate of extraction prevails in India, coal will last for several decades.(c):  Despite the efforts made by coal sector, the country is not self sufficient because there is limited availability of coking coal in the country, which is essential input for steel making. Further, power plants designed on low ash imported coal will also continue to import coal for their requirements. (d):  The amount of coal imported in Million Tonnes by India during the last three financial years is as follows:Year	Imported Coal (Million Tonnes)	Value (in Rs. Crore)2016-17 	190.953	100231.3942017-18	208.272	138476.9772018-19	235.240	170880.738.*****
