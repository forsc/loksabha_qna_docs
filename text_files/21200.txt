SADANANDA GOWDA)(a) & (c): To make our country atmanirbhar in pharmaceuticals, Department of Pharmaceuticals has come up with following three schemes for promoting domestic manufacturing of pharmaceutical drugs including bulk drugs.(I)    Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for promotion of domestic manufacturing of critical Key Starting Materials (KSMs)/ Drug Intermediates (DIs) and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) In India: Under the scheme, financial incentive will be given for manufacturing of 41 Key Starting Materials (KSMs)/ Drug Intermediates (DIs) and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs). Incentives for incremental sales will be given to selected participants for a period of 6 years. The total outlay of the scheme is Rs. 6,940 crore. (II)     Scheme for Promotion of Bulk Drug Parks:  This scheme provides for grant-in-aid to 3 Bulk Drug Parks for creation of Common Infrastructure Facilities (CIF) with a maximum limit of Rs.1000 crore per park or 70% of the project cost of CIF, whichever is less. In case of North Eastern States and Hilly States (Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir and Union Territory of Ladakh) financial assistance would be 90% of the project cost. The total outlay of the Scheme is Rs. 3000 crore and the tenure of the Scheme will be five years (2020-21 to 2024-25).

The outlay of the scheme is Rs. 15,000 crore and three categories of pharmaceutical goods will be incentivized under the scheme based on their incremental sales.
