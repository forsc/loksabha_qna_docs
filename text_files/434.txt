                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (d):	Child Labour, bonded labour and forced labour are outcome of various socio-economic problems such as poverty, economic backwardness and illiteracy.           	For elimination of child labour, the Central Government has enacted the Child Labour (Prohibition & Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 which came into force w.e.f. 1.9.2016. The Amended Act inter-alia provides for complete prohibition of work or employment of children below 14 years in any occupation and process and prohibition of adolescents in the age group of 14 to 18 years in hazardous occupations and processes. The Amended Act also provides strict punishment for employers for violation of the Act and has made the offence cognizable. Contd..2/-::  2  ::            	The Government is also implementing the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme for rehabilitation of child labour. Under the NCLP Scheme, children in the age group of 9-14 years are rescued/withdrawn from work and enrolled in the NCLP Special Training Centres, where they are provided with bridge education, vocational training, mid-day meal, stipend, health care, etc. before they are mainstreamed into formal education system. Children in the age group of 5-8 years are directly linked to the formal education system through a close coordination with the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA).The bonded labour system has been abolished by law throughout the country with effect from 25th October, 1975 under the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Ordinance which was replaced by Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976. As and when existence of bonded labour is detected, such persons are identified for rehabilitation. The responsibility for identifying and rehabilitating the bonded labour lies with the respective State Governments. The Central Government provides funds to the State Governments in the form of reimbursement under “Central Sector Scheme for Rehabilitation of Bonded Labour – 2016”.******
