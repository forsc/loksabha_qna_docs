The composition and functions to be assigned to the DPCs are decided by the State Legislature.  No State/Panchayat has expressed its inability to Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) to utilize funds due to non-availability of District Plans. (e)		Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) guidelines for formulation of GPDP have been shared by the MoPR with the States/ Union Territories (UT) in 2018-19. The States/ UTs have been advised that on the basis of MoPR guidelines, State specific GPDP guidelines are to be issued by the respective States/UTs towards integration and consolidation of GPDPs into a comprehensive District Development Plan.  		MoPR has been implementing e-Panchayat Mission Mode Project (MMP) that seeks to transform the functioning of all the Panchayats, making them more transparent, accountable and effective as organs of decentralized self-governing institutions. Under e-Panchayat, a suite of core software applications has been developed to address various aspects of Panchayats’ functioning including planning, budgeting, implementation, accounting, monitoring, social audit and delivery of citizen services like issue of certificates, licenses, tax collection etc.*****
