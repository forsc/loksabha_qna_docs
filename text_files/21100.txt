ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) :  Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) introduced in the country from Kharif 2016 is a yield index based scheme whereas Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS) introduced alongwith with PMFBY is a weather index based scheme.  The basic difference between the PMFBY and RWBCIS is in its methodology for calculation of admissible claims to the farmers.   Under PMFBY, coverage and settlement of claims is made on the basis of shortfall in Actual Yield as compared to the Threshold yield.  Actual Yield is arrived at on the basis of yield data based on requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) in a defined Insurance Units (IUs) and submitted by the concerned State Government.  Threshold Yield for a crop in a notified insurance unit is the average yield of best 5 years out of past seven years multiplied by applicable indemnity level for that crop.   Farmers are indemnified to the extent/percentage of crop losses against the defined Threshold Yield multiplied by sum insured as notified by the State Government.   Contd….2/- 2 -On the other hand under RWBCIS, admissible claims are being calculated based on deviation from the prescribed/defined weather parameters.   As per provisions of the RWBCIS, if observed trigger value falls below or above the notified trigger value, then claims per unit are calculated depending upon index definition given in the term sheet. Hence, mainly food & oilseed and annual horticultural/commercial crops where requisite past  yield data based on authentic/scientific methodology is available, can be notified under PMFBY and crops specially perennial/horticultural crops for which yield data based on authentic / statistical methodology is not available can be covered under RWBCIS.  (b) : Yes Sir.(c) : Year-wise and State-wise details of farmer applicants enrolled under PMFBY and RWBCIS separately since inception of the scheme in Kharif 2016 to Rabi 2020-21 are at Annexure.(d) :  The scheme has been made voluntary for all farmers w.e.f. Kharif 2020 seasons.   Therefore, farmers are free to insure their crops as per their risk perception provided the crops and area is notified by the concerned State Government/UT Administration.  However, it is stated that coverage under the scheme has increased to 6 crore farmer applications even after withdrawal of scheme by some States.(e) :  Rs. 16000 crore have been proposed as Budget Estimate 2021-22 for these schemes in the Union Budget.
