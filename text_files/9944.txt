ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (IC) FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI SANTOSH KUMAR GANGWAR)(a) to (c):   Employment generation coupled with improving employability is the priority of the Government. Government has taken various steps for generating employment in the country like encouraging private sector of economy, fast-tracking various projects involving substantial investment and increasing public expenditure on  various employment generation schemes. 	The National Manufacturing Policy identifies employment intensive industries like textiles and garments, leather and footwear, gems and jewellery and food processing, etc. as special focus attention sectors. The policy provides special attention for Small Scale Industries as they offer employment opportunities both for self-employment and jobs across diverse geographies.  	ASPIRE (A scheme for promotion of Innovation, Rural Industry and Entrepreneurship) was launched to set up a network of technology centres and to set up incubation centres to accelerate entrepreneurship in agro-industry. The individuals trained under the ASPIRE scheme of Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (M/oMSME) can become agri- entrepreneurs/entrepreneurs and can seek financial support under different schemes of the Govt. including Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) under which loans are provided by banks and subsidy to the extent of 15-35% is given by the Government of India. Individuals can also seek employment in the related industry or can seek further higher skills/training.	The labour force surveys on employment and unemployment are conducted by National Statistical Office (NSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The last such survey, annual Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), was conducted during 2017-18. As per the results of PLFS, the estimated percentage distribution of  usually working persons by broad industry division on usual status (principal status + subsidiary status) basis in the country is given below:Broad Industry Division	Workers (in %)Agriculture, forestry and fishing	44.1Mining and quarrying	0.4Manufacturing	12.1Electricity, Water, etc.	0.6Construction	11.7Trade, Hotel & Restaurant	12.0Transport, Storage & Communications	5.9Other Services	13.2Source: Annual report  PLFS, 2017-18.*****
