                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (e):  A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.   ***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF STARRED QUESTION NO.52 BY DR. UMESH G. JADHAV TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 20.11.2019 REGARDING RAILWAY DIVISION AT GULBARGA (a) to (e): An announcement was made by the then Hon’ble Minister of Railways in February 2014 regarding creation of three new Railway divisions including Gulbarga. Gulbarga division was proposed to be formed by reorganizing and taking railway sections of adjoining Solapur, Guntakal, Secunderabad and Hubli divisions of Central, South Central and South Western Railway Zones respectively. The details of the sections which were proposed to be included in the proposed Gulbarga division are as follows: Wadi(including) - Vikarabad (excluding) (111.87 Route Kilometer (RKM)), Wadi(excluding) – Raichur(including) (107.48 RKM), Wadi(including) – Hotgi(excluding) (134.66 RKM) and Hotgi(excluding) – Bagalkot(including) (190.88 km). Further, following three sanctioned new railway lines were also proposed to become part of Gulbarga division in future once constructed and commissioned: Raichur (including) – Gnigera (excluding) (170 RKM), Gulbarga(including) – Khanapur(excluding) (104 RKM), Wadi(including) – Gadag(excluding) (252 RKM).  The Detailed Project Report (DPR) for setting up of the proposed Division at Gulbarga was received from South Western Railway and has been under examination in Ministry of Railways, and the work is not yet sanctioned.      Since setting up of new Divisions affects railway operations and efficiency and requires additional resources, the matter has been under examination in the Ministry. Recently in October 2019, a Committee of senior Railway Officers has been constituted to analyze and review afresh, the feasibility of creation of these three new divisions announced in 2014, including Gulbarga. Final decision in this regard would be taken after submission of the Report by the aforementioned Committee. ******
