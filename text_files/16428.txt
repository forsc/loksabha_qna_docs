ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a): The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, mandates the appropriate Government to provide free and compulsory elementary education to every child of the age 6 to 14 years in a neighbourhood school. Section 12(1)(c) of RTE Act, 2009 provides for admission of children belonging to weaker sections and disadvantaged groups in the schools specified in sub-clauses (iii) and (iv) of clause (n) of section 2 in Class I (or below) to the extent of at least 25 percent of the strength of that class.(b): All States and Union Territories (UTs) except the State/UT of Telangana, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh have notified the disadvantaged groups and weaker sections eligible for admission under Section 12(1)(c) of the RTE Act. Further, 17 States and UTs have started admissions in private unaided schools under Section 12(1)(c) of the RTE Act, 2009.(c): Under Samagra Shiksha, support is given to all States and UTs for various interventions including opening/upgradation of schools based on appraisal of proposals received from the States and UTs and as per the norms of the scheme.(d) to (f): As per NEP 2020, the current public (Government - Centre and States) expenditure on education in India has been around 4.43% of GDP (Analysis of Budgeted Expenditure 2017-18) and only around 10% of the total Government spending towards education (Economic Survey 2017-18). The  percentage of Schools with RTE compliant facilities as per UDISE 2016-17 was:<pre>Girls Toilet	Boys Toilet	Drinking Water 	RAMP	Boundary Wall	Playground 	Library 96.74	98.79	96.96	70.40	59.29	56.14	85.46</pre>In order to attain the goal of education with excellence and the corresponding multitude of benefits to this Nation and its economy, the National Education Policy unequivocally endorses and envisions a substantial increase in public investment in education by both the Central government and all State Governments. The Centre and the States will work together to increase the public investment in Education sector to reach 6% of GDP at the earliest. Further, it envisages financial support for various critical elements and components of education, such as ensuring universal access, learning resources, nutritional support, matters of student safety and well-being, adequate numbers of teachers and staff, teacher development, and support for all key initiatives towards equitable high-quality education for underprivileged and socio-economically disadvantaged groups.***
