SHRIKANT EKNATH SHINDE AND SHRI SRIRANGA APPA BARNE(a) to (e) Urban transport, which is an integral part of urban development, is a State subject. Hence, respective State Governments/Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) are responsible for planning and development of urban transport infrastructure including metro rail.   The Central Government considers financial assistance for metro rail proposals in cities or urban agglomerates, on the basis of the feasibility of the proposal and availability of resources, as and when posed by the concerned State Governments. Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has undertaken the task of standardizing specifications for Light Urban Rail Transit System named Metrolite to be adopted by the cities with lower projections of ridership as prime mode of mass transit system. The firming up of standard specifications requires extensive consultations with stakeholders. The specifications are issued after following the due process and approval of the competent body. *****
