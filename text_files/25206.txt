ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) Opening of new Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) is a continuous process. KVs are opened primarily to cater to the educational needs of the wards of transferable Central Government Employees including Defence & Para-Military personnel, Central Autonomous Bodies, Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and Central Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) by providing a common programme of education. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations and committing resources for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities found fulfilling the mandatory pre-requisite for opening of new KVs have to compete with other such proposals under the “Challenge Method”. However, KVs are not opened on the criteria of State-wise/ District-wise / Parliamentary Constituency-wise.(b) Yes, Sir. The matter for opening of KV in Cuddalore District, Tamil Nadu was raised by the Hon’ble Member of Parliament under ‘Rule 377’ and during the “Zero Hour” on 17/07/2019 and 24/06/2019 respectively.(c) Replies to both ‘Rule 377’ and “Zero Hour” have been sent to the Hon’ble Member of Parliament on 19/09/2019. The procedure for opening of a new KV under Civil Sector can be initiated once a proposal from the Secretary (Education) of the State Government of Tamil Nadu is received in the prescribed proformae of KVS fulfilling all requisite conditions and placed before the ‘Challenge Method’ Committee. The proposal for opening a new KV in Cuddalore, Tamilnadu has not been received in the prescribed format from the State Government concerned.*****
