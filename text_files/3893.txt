ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM & NATURAL GAS(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) & (b): Under the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) regime, one Pre-NELP (New Exploration Licensing Policy) and 3 NELP blocks have been awarded in the State of Andhra Pradesh, out of which only two NELP blocks are operational at present. These blocks have been allocated to Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Limited (OIL). For carrying out any exploration and development activity, Environmental Clearance (EC) and Forest Clearance are mandatory. The Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) is pre-condition for obtaining EC. EIA report identifies environmental aspects and impacts arising out of the proposed activity and proposes mitigation measures. During public hearing for EC, consultations are held with stakeholders, including local public. Directions of National Green Tribunal (NGT), if any, are complied with. However, no consultations are held with NGT.(c): No, Sir. Exploration and production activities are coexisting with agriculture not only in Tamil Nadu but in other parts of the country also. Exploration and production activities for hydrocarbons have to comply with Health, Safety and Environment protection related statutory guidelines. These clearances are obtained from different authorities. Exploration and production activities in the Cauvery Delta region are limited to production of conventional oil and gas resources. There are no Coal Bed Methane (CBM) /Shale gas activities going on in the State of Tamil Nadu. Further, ONGC has been carrying Exploration and Production activities in Tamil Nadu for more than 50 years and as such there is no adverse effect in respect of agriculture and ecology.(d) & (e): Seven Blocks have been awarded in the State of Tamil Nadu in various rounds of New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP), out of which only two blocks are operational. Two Contracts have been awarded through International Competitive Bidding under Discovered Small Field Bid rounds for which Petroleum Mining Lease (PML) is awaited from State Government. Further, three Blocks were awarded under Open Acreage Licensing Policy. The Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) is pre-condition for obtaining Environmental Clearance by the Contractor before carrying out any exploration and production activity.****
