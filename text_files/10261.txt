This monitoring of performance on QoS parameters is done by way of reporting of performances to TRAI by service providers through quarterly Performance Monitoring Reports (PMRs) and the performance is assessed for the service area as a whole.  As per PMR issued by TRAI for the quarter ending September 2019, BSNL is meeting all the benchmarks for basic (wireline), Cellular Mobile and broadband services in all of its Licensed Service Areas (LSAs) including Maharashtra, except for the parameter for call drops in West Bengal LSA.(c)	As per data collected from Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) and Department of Telecom (DoT) field units in 2019, out of total 40,959 inhabited villages (as per census 2011) in Maharashtra State, 37,970 inhabited villages are covered by mobile services. Mobile coverage in the uncovered villages is being provided by the Government and TSPs in a phased manner. The following projects are approved/ implemented by the Government for improving mobile connectivity in rural and remote areas in the country including Maharashtra State:i.	Under Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas Phase-I project, 65 mobile towers in Maharashtra state (Gadchiroli -42, Gondia- 17 and Chandrapur- 06) have been installed.ii.	Under LWE affected areas Phase-II project, the Government has approved installation of 125 mobile towers (Gadchiroli – 100, Gondia- 22 and Chandrapur – 03) in Maharashtra state. iii.	Under BharatNet Project, out of 27,909 Gram Panchayats (GPs) in Maharashtra state, 18,059 GPs have been connected by laying 46,906 Kilometers of Optical Fiber Cable (OFC), out of which 15,245 GPs have been made service ready. Additionally, BSNL has informed that in Maharashtra circle, 15,400 Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) are presently working. Additional 555 2G, 640 3G and 123 4G BTSs will be installed by 31.03.2020. (d) & (e)	BSNL has informed that due to poor financial condition and paucity of funds in BSNL, some BTSs get affected due to disconnection of electric supply and shortage of diesel. No case of theft is reported. BSNL always endeavours to improve its services and measures including round the clock maintenance of network, drive tests, data analysis and other corrective measures are undertaken.Further, the Cabinet in the meeting held on 23.10.2019 approved the revival plan for BSNL. With the revival plan, it is expected that BSNL will turn around and will be able to further improve services. The revival plan also includes administrative allotment of spectrum to BSNL for providing 4G services. ************
