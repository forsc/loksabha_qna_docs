                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (d):	Under the Samarth-Scheme for Capacity Building in Textiles Sector (SCBTS), Ministry of Textiles is promoting skill development in advance courses in textiles concerning apparel & garmenting, textiles processing and technical textiles segments. A target for imparting advance training in level 4 and above courses under the National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) protocol has been set for upskilling. As of now, 30 industry partners have already collaborated with Ministry of Textiles for imparting such training to 20,571 persons. So far, 3 training centres in Uttar Pradesh have been registered for conducting the upskilling training.   Besides, the government has approved the proposal for creation of National Technical Textiles Mission for a period of 4 years (2020-21 to 2023-24) with an outlay of Rs.1480 crores. Apart from other initiatives, the Mission also aims at promoting technical education at higher engineering and technology levels related to technical textiles and its application areas covering engineering, medical, agriculture, aquaculture and dairy segments.  Skill development is aimed to be promoted and adequate pool of highly skilled manpower resources aims to create for meeting the need of relatively sophisticated technical textiles manufacturing units.****
