ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):      Medicines are normally available at the Wellness Centres. The medicines which are not readily available through central procurement are procured through Authorized Local Chemist (ALC) and are supplied to CGHS beneficiaries.Anti-Cancer and such Restricted lifesaving medicines for CGHS beneficiaries are procured against individual prescriptions and are procured directly from supplier /authorized distributors.(b):      No such irregularities have been reported.Contd………-2-(c):    Yes, complaints have been received regarding delay in getting the indented medicines prescribed by the specialist doctor. The main reason for delay is that the Specialists of empanelled hospitals advise many medicines outside the CGHS list that require procurement from ALC resulting in increased number of medicines to be supplied.The ALCs are asked to supply the medicines in time by next working day and suitable penalties are imposed against erring ALCs.If medicines are required urgently for the beneficiaries, authority slips are issued to collect the medicines directly from ALC.(d):      Medical Stores Organization has finalized Rate Contract for 518 Medicines and indents are placed for bulk procurement so that the dependency on the ALCs shall be lessened.Additional Directors of CGHS have also been authorized to procure formulary generic medicines having no Medical Stores Organization Rate Contract at Jana-Aushadhi rates as an interim measure till 30th September 2019 to ensure that the medicines are provided immediately to the CGHS beneficiaries.……………………
