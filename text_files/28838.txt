ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES (SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL) (a) to (c):  Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) has been implementing Central Sector umbrella scheme-Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA Yojana (PMKSY) for overall growth and development of food processing sector of the country including in the state of Bihar. Under component schemes of PMKSY, MoFPI provides mostly credit linked financial assistance (capital subsidy) in the form of grants-in-aid to entrepreneurs for setting up of food processing / preservation infrastructure, which may include cold storages, to minimize post-harvest losses. Ministry does not provide financial assistance to set up standalone cold storage. PMKSY is not region or state specific but demand driven and financial assistance is provided to the eligible applicants selected on the basis of Expression of Interest (EoI) issued from time to time and there is no state wise/ district wise allocation of funds. The details of budget allocated and expenditure incurred under PMKSY during 2016-17 to 2021-22 is mentioned in Annexure-I. The details of infrastructure projects sanctioned so far under component Schemes of PMKSY in the state of Bihar including total project cost, grant-in-aid approved, grant released and total capacity of Cold Storage/ CA/MA Storage/ Frozen Store in the project are placed at Annexure II.                                                                               *****
