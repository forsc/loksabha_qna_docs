                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a):  Yes, Sir.  To enable an area based development approach for Scheduled Caste persons, the Pradhan Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana (PMAGY) was launched in 2009-10 with the aim of integrated development of villages having Scheduled Caste population of more than 50%. The vision of the Scheme is to develop the selected villages into model villages(Adarsh Grams) having all such infrastructure and basic services that are necessary for the residents to have a dignified living, creating thereby an environment in which everyone is enabled to utilise her/his potential to the fullest.(b):  Initially the Scheme was launched on a pilot basis during 2009-10 and under this phase 1000 villages were taken up in five States.   In 2014-15, the Scheme was further extended to cover another 1500 villages across 11 States.  In October, 2018, the Scheme was extensively revised to bring focus on important and critical monitorable socio-economic indicators under 10 domains namely, Drinking Water & Sanitation, Education, Health & Nutrition, Social Security, Rural Road and housing, Electricity and clean fuel, Agricultural practices etc., Financial inclusion, Digitization, Livelihood and Skill Development.Another 4094 new villages, along with 390 villages covered earlier in 2014-15, have been taken up in 2018-19 under the revised Scheme.(c):  Does not arise.****
