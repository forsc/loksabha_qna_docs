ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to d) The air pollution levels generally intensify in the winter season due to poor meteorological conditions such as lower wind speed and lower temperature resulting in temperature inversion. Further, burning of crop residue in the northern states also contributes to the air pollution. The AQI status of 46 representative cities in North India States during winter months (October 2019 to January 2020) is at Annexure. On the analysis of last five-year ambient air quality data (2014-2018), across the country, it is observed that most of the cities were within the National Standards with respect to parameters of SO2 and NO2. With respect to PM10 and PM2.5, 18 and 12 cities respectively showed decreasing trend. In reference to Delhi, there has been an overall improvement in air quality of Delhi in 2019 as compared to that of 2016. The number of ‘Good to ‘Moderate’ days has increased to 182 in 2019 as compared to 108 in 2016.(e) The Government has taken several steps to combat air pollution which inter alia, includes notification of National Ambient Air Quality Standards, revision of emission standards for industrial sectors from time to time, setting up of monitoring network for assessment of ambient air quality, introduction of cleaner / alternate fuels like gaseous fuel (CNG, LPG etc.), launching of National Air Quality index, leapfrogging from BS-IV to BS-VI fuel standards, notification of Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules, Notifications of 6 waste management rules covering solid waste, plastic waste, e-waste, bio-medical waste, C&D waste and hazardous wastes issued in 2016, banning of burning of biomass, streamlining the issuance of Pollution Under Control Certificate, issuance of directions under Section 18(1)(b) of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and under Section 5 of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for controlling air pollution, installation of on-line continuous (24x7) monitoring devices by major industries, notification of Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) for Delhi and NCR, Comprehensive Action Plan (CAP) for air pollution control in Delhi and NCR, formulation of National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), organization of clean air campaigns, etc,***
