                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a)  Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna (PMGSY-I) was launched as a one-time special intervention to provide rural connectivity, by way of a single all-weather road, to the eligible unconnected habitations of designated population size (500+ in plain areas and 250+ in North-Eastern States, Himalayan States and Himalayan Union Territories as per 2001 census) in the core network for uplifting the socio-economic condition of the rural population. Relaxation has been provided to the Desert Areas (as identified in the Desert Development Programme), the Tribal (Schedule V) areas and Selected Tribal and Backward Districts (as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs and Planning Commission) and unconnected habitations in these areas with a population of 250 persons and above in the Core Network as per Census 2001 are eligible for connectivity under the scheme. In the critical Left Wing Extremism affected blocks (as identified by Ministry of Home Affairs), additional relaxation has been given to connect habitations with population 100 persons and above as per 2001 census.  As the programme unfolded, a need was felt for consolidation of the existing Rural Road Network to improve its efficiency not only as a provider of transportation services, but also as a vehicle of social and economic development. Accordingly, in the year 2013, PMGSY-II was launched for upgradation of selected Through Routes and Major Rural Links (MRLs) with a target to upgrade 50,000 Km in various States and Union Territories.  Subsequently, in 2016, Road Connectivity Project for Left Wing Extremism (LWE) Affected Areas (RCPLWEA) for construction/upgradation of strategically important roads was launched in the 9 LWE affected states, as a separate vertical under PMGSY.  In the year 2019, Government launched PMGSY-III for consolidation of 1,25,000 Km Through Routes and Major Rural Links connecting habitations, inter-alia, to Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs), Higher Secondary Schools and Hospitals.  Currently, works under PMGSY-I and II are going on in the State of West Bengal. The funds for the implementation of the scheme are released by the Ministry to the State as a whole. The release of funds to the State for implementation of PMGSY is done on the basis of the proposal received from the State and depends, inter-alia, on works in hand, execution capacity of the State and unspent funds available with the State. During the last five years details of fund released to the State of West Bengal is as given below:- Year	                            Central share of fund released                                       (Rs. in crore)2016-17	                                   819.182017-18	                                  1058.3532018-19	                                  1426.982019-20	                                   348.252020-21	                                   969.312021-22 (as on 15.12.2021)	            0Total	                                  4622.073 District-wise expenditure (including state share) during the last five years and the current year is given in Annexure.
