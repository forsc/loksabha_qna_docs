ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS [SHRI V MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (g) Government has briefed the members of the international community on the facts relating to Jammu & Kashmir and also shared perspectives on the Citizenship Amendment Act 2019.As a result of Government’s efforts, countries have shown understanding that matters related to Jammu & Kashmir, which is an integral part of India, are internal to India; and that Pakistan sponsored cross-border terrorism has been posing a grave threat and affecting the lives of the people of India, including in Jammu & Kashmir. Countries have called on Pakistan to not allow its territories to be used for terrorism in any manner. There is also appreciation of the Indian position that the Citizenship Amendment Act 2019 is an affirmative action meant to address the long standing predicament of the vulnerable sections living in India; and that it does not impact in any manner on the status of any citizen of India or deprive any Indian of any faith of her or his citizenship. These countries have expressed faith that Indian democratic practices and institutions are equipped to deal with issues that may arise in implementation of the decisions taken by the Indian Parliament.Spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in a press briefing note on 13 December 2019 made inaccurate and unwarranted references to the Citizenship Amendment Act 2019.  Government immediately registered its protest with the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and clearly conveyed that the legislation is a humanitarian measure and is in line with India’s international human rights obligations.Government completely and unequivocally rejected any efforts to internationalize the issues which are internal to India, in particular on laws passed by the Parliament of a sovereign nation. The Government has also taken note of some statements made by China, Malaysia and Turkey on the issue of Jammu & Kashmir. It has been conveyed that India expects these countries to not comment on the internal affairs of India; respect India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity; and develop a proper understanding of the issue.
