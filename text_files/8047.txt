ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) to (b)	Land for the development and maintenance of National Highway is acquired under Section 3 of the National Highways (NHs) Act, 1956. Once a land is notified under Section 3D of the NHs Act, 1956, the land vests with the Central Government free from all encumbrances.(c) to (d)	No, Sir. There is no proposal under consideration to amend 	Section 3 of the NHs Act, 1956(e) to (f)	No, Sir. The Central Government (i.e. the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways) appoints the Competent Authority for Land Acquisition (CALA) in exercise of its powers under Section 3(a) of the NHs Act, 1956, who takes all action for acquisition of land under the NHs Act, 1956. Acquisition of land for the required Right of Way of a National Highway, causes minimal displacement and dislocation of the affected persons. As such, the number of "Displaced families" requiring "Resettlement and Rehabilitation" is very small. However when need arises, the CALA determines the compensation in accordance with the First Schedule, Rehabilitation and Resettlement in accordance with the Second Schedule and Infrastructure amenities in accordance with the Third Schedule of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (RFCTLARR) Act, 2013.*****
