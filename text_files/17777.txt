                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) & (b):	The names and quantum of various agricultural products purchased along with with their prices during the last three years, district-wise in Karnataka are at Annexure-I to Annexure-IV.(c):	Government fixes Minimum Support Prices (MSP) of 22 mandated agricultural crops on the basis of recommendations of Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP), after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned & other relevant factors. In addition, MSP for toria and de-husked coconut is also fixed on the basis of MSPs of rapeseed & mustard and copra respectively. While recommending MSPs, CACP considers important factors like cost of production, overall demand-supply conditions, domestic and international prices, inter-crop price, terms of trade between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, the likely effect on the rest of the economy, besides ensuring rational utilization of land, water and other production resources and a minimum of 50 percent as the margin over cost of production. MSP is determined for the country as a whole and not region or state-specific. Region specific parameters are kept in view by the CACP while formulating price policy for agricultural commodities. Details of MSP since 2018-19 is at Annexure-V.
