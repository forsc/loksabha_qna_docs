As regards domestic investment, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation maintains the details of Gross Capital Formation. A statement indicating quarter-wise details of foreign direct investments inflow in India from the quarter ending December 2017 to quarter ending March 2019 and the Gross Capital Formation for the years   2015-16 to 2017-18 is at Annexure-I.
