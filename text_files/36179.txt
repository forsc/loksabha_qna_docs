Eligible beneficiaries can avail the benefit of PMAY-U through four verticals, i.e. Beneficiary-led Construction or enhancement (BLC); Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP);‘In-Situ’ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) and Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS)., Central assistance is released to States/UTs at the rate of ? 1.00 lakh per house under ISSR component, ? 1.50 lakh per house under AHP and BLC components for construction of houses and interest subsidy upto ? 2.67 lakh under CLSS is provided to eligible beneficiaries through Central Nodal Agencies for acquisition of houses by purchase/ re-purchase or construction of houses and for incremental housing. Under PMAY-U, a total of 3,80,664 houses involving Central Assistance of ? 6,239.61crore have been sanctioned in the State of West Bengal during the last three years and the current year; year-wise and vertical-wise details of houses sanctioned are as under:            Houses sanctioned (Nos.)FY        BLC	        AHP	ISSR	    CLSS2018-19	  1,28,443	1,056	0	    11,3882019-20	  54,139	192	0	    15,3502020-21	  1,02,185	2,074	0	    26,7002021-22	  27,902	0	0	    11,235                                    *****
