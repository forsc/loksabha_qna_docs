                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE(a) to (d): To prevent gender discrimination in lending, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) vide its Master Circular on “Loans and Advances – Statutory and other restriction” dated 1.7.2015, has issued Guidelines on Fair Practices Code for Lenders, which include inter alia that banks must not discriminate on grounds of sex, caste and religion in the matter of lending, however, it does not preclude banks from participating in credit-linked schemes framed for weaker sections of the society. RBI has further advised that Boards of banks and financial institutions should lay down a clear policy on Fair Practices Code based on aforementioned RBI guidelines in respect of all lending. Further, banks provide loans based on assessment of credit-worthiness of prospective borrowers, guided by their Board-approved loan policy framed within RBI guidelines.With regard to data on number of loan application and sanctions pertaining to single-women and single-men, RBI has informed that it does not maintain gender specific data.***
