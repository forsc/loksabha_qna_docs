                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a):	National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) compiles and publishes information on crimes in its publication “Crime in India”. Published reports are available till the year 2018. The State/Union Territory-wise data in respect of cases reported under Total Crimes against Scheduled Castes (SCs) for the year 2018 is at Annexure-I. (b) & (c):	‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibilities to maintain law and order, protection of life and property of the citizens including investigation  and  prosecution of crime  against  women  and children rest -2-L.S.US.Q.NO.3862 FOR 17.03.2020with the respective State Governments. The State Governments are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provisions of laws.	However, the Government of India is committed to ensure protection of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (PoA Act) has been amended in 2015 to make it more effective. The amendments include new offences, expanded scope of presumptions, institutional strengthening, which inter-alia includes establishment of Exclusive Special Courts and specification of Exclusive Special Public Prosecutors to exclusively try the offences under the PoA Act to enable expeditious disposal of cases, power of Special Courts and Exclusive Special Courts to take direct cognizance of offence and as far as possible, completion of trial within two months from the date of filing of the charge sheet, establishing rights of victims and witnesses, and strengthening preventive measures. Further, Section 18 Of the PoA Act was amended by the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2018 (No. 27 of 2018) and enforced on 20.08.2018, and now conduct of a preliminary enquiry before registration of an FIR, or to seek approval of any authority prior to arrest of an accused, is no longer required. The Ministry of Home Affairs has issued an advisory dated 26.09.2018 requesting all States/UTs for the implementation of these provisions in letter and spirit, which is available at www.mha.gov.in. 	*******
