                                                        (a):	As on 10.03.2021, Ayushman Bharat  - Pradhan MantriJan Arogya Yojana is not being implemented in National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, Odisha, Telangana, and West Bengal States.(b):	The Government of NCT of Delhi had announced during the budget session of 2020 that AB-PMJAY would be implemented in the State. However, no further action has been intimated by them regarding the same. AB-PMJAY was being implemented in the State of West Bengal from 23rd September 2018 till 10th January 2019 for which an amount of Rs. 31.28 crore was released as Central share of the scheme related expenses. However, State government decided to withdraw from the implementation of the scheme on 10th January 2019. As regards to Odisha and Telangana, constant discussions are ongoing with the respective State Government to convince them to implement the AB-PMJAY.(c) & (d):	Public health being a State subject, the final decision regarding the implementation of AB-PMJAY rests with the concerned State government. Several efforts have been made including visits to meet the leadership at the State level of the non-implementing States to implement AB-PMJAY. Further, Hon’ble Minister for Health & Family Welfare has also written to the Chief Ministers of these State requesting them to implement AB-PMJAY.
