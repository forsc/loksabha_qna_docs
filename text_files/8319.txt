                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (d) “Public Health & Hospital” being a State subject, the primary responsibility of development of healthcare facility all over the country including in rural, tribal and hilly areas lies with State/UT Governments. To supplement the efforts of State Governments of improving the healthcare services, particularly in rural areas including hilly & tribal areas, National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in 2005. NRHM has been subsumed as a Sub Mission of the overarching National Health Mission (NHM) with the National Urban Health Mission as the other Sub Mission. Under the National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their health care systems including for setting up/upgrading public health facilities and augmenting health human resource on contractual basis for provision of equitable, affordable healthcare to all its citizens particularly the poor and vulnerable population including tribal population based on requirements posed by the States in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs). Under NHM, tribal areas already enjoy relaxed norms for setting up public health facilities including “time to care” norm for setting up sub health Centres in tribal areas within 30 minutes of walk from habitation and relaxed norm for Mobile Medical Units for tribal areas; extra one MMU if it exceeds 30 patients per day against 60 patients per day in plain areas for bringing healthcare delivery to the doorsteps of the population.Further, all tribal majority districts whose composite health index is below the State average have been identified as High Priority Districts (HPDs) and these districts receive more resources per capita under the NHM as compared to the rest of the districts in the State. These districts receive higher per capita funding, have enhanced monitoring and focused supportive supervision and are encouraged to adopt innovative approaches to address their peculiar health challenges. As per Rural Health Statistics the change in health facilities in Tribal areas versus All India between 2005 and 2018 is given as below:Type of Facility	All India	Tribal Areas	RHS2005	RHS2018	RHS2005	RHS2018   CHCs	3222	5624	643	1017PHCs	23109	25743	2809	3971SCs	142655	158417	16748	28091Total	168986	189784	20200	33079increase in Total facilities	12.30%	63.75%……………
