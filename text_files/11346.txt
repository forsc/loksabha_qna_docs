ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (b): The roads under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) are being constructed and measured as per the Specifications for Rural Roads of Ministry of Rural Development published by Indian Roads Congress (IRC) in 2014, the Standards prescribed in Rural Roads Manual IRC-SP: 20, published by IRC and other relevant IRC guidelines in respect of geometric Design Standards, Pavement Design and construction specifications as per the requirements of site condition. As an important step to achieve quality output for each road under the Programme, proper survey and adequate investigations are stipulated.  A Detailed Project Report (DPR) is a pre-requisite for project clearance.  At the time of DPR preparation transect walk is also done with the Panchayat and community members along the proposed alignment of the road. Independent scrutiny of the DPRs to ensure the adequacy of designing and project preparation is carried out by prominent institutions of Engineering and Technology in the country, identified as State Technical Agencies (STAs). The proposals of the State are then put up before the Empowered Committee chaired by Secretary of Department of Rural Development, for its consideration. The proposals approved by the Competent Authority are conveyed to the State Government for execution.As per the PMGSY Programme Guidelines, ensuring the quality of the road works is responsibility of the respective State Governments which are implementing the Programme. The Ministry of Rural Development/ NRIDA issue from time to time general guidelines on quality control and prescribe Quality Assurance Handbook for Rural Roads to regulate the quality control processes, at work level. There is a a very well structured three-tiered Quality Control mechanism for ensuring construction of quality road works and durability of road assets under PMGSY.  Under the first tier, the Programme Implementation Units (PIUs) are required to ensure process control through mandatory tests on material and workmanship at field laboratory.  The second tier is a structured independent quality monitoring at the State level through State Quality Monitors (SQMs) to ensure that every work is inspected at initial stage, middle stage and final stage of the construction.  Under the third tier, independent National Quality Monitors (NQMs) are deployed for random inspection of road works to monitor quality and also to provide guidance of senior professionals to the field functionaries. Whenever, a work is reported deficient by NQMs, on account of both structural and non-structural defects, the PIU ensures that the contractor replaces the material or rectifies the workmanship, as the case may be. The action taken report (ATR), for each such work, is verified on ground by the State Quality Monitors (SQMs). Thereafter, the State Quality Coordinator (SQC) examines the ATR for each such work and furnishes the compliance report regularly through programme Management Information System-Online Management, Monitoring and Accounting System (OMMAS). To fast track the compliance on NQM observations, provisions have been made to upload and monitor the action taken report for each work through web based programme MIS- OMMAS. Close monitoring has improved the quality of projects and  a consistent decline in overall ‘unsatisfactory’ percentage of completed and ongoing projects has been observed during the last three years. (c): The year-wise details of road works sanctioned during the last three years and current year are given at Annexure-I.(d): The District-wise list of roads sanctioned under PMGSY are available at www.omms.nic.in ? Progress Monitoring ? Physical Progress of works.*****
