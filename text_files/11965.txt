ANSWER




                                                        (a) & (b)   Yes Sir. The idea of development of Machilipatnam Port was first conceived in the year 2008. Initially, the project for development of Machilipatnam Port was entrusted to the Special Purpose Vehicle(SPV) ”Vajra Sea Port Ltd.” led by M/s MAYTAS infra Ltd. However due to financial inability of MAYTAS infra , M/s Navayuga Engineering Company Ltd was inducted as lead promoter in place of MAYATAS and a revised concession agreement was concluded with the new SPV “Machilipatnam Port Ltd” promoted by the consortium led by Navayuga Engineering Company Ltd on 07.06.2010.In spite of constant endeavors by the State Government, the developer could not show any progress in the commencement of Port development. Therefore, Government of Andhra Pradesh has cancelled the revised concession agreement concluded with M/s Machilipatnam Port Ltd.Now, Government of Andhra Pradesh has nominated Infrastructure Corporation of Andhra Pradesh (INCAP), a Nodal Agency for providing transaction advisory services for development of Non-Major Port in the State and to examine study and furnish a detail report to Government to take forward the development of Port of Machilipatnam. (c)  At this Stage no fund has been allocated by Government of India for the project.                                            *****
