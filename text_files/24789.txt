All Food Business Operators (FBO) doing any kind of food business as defined under Section 3 (1) (n) of the FSS Act, 2006 w.r.t the foods defined under Section 3 (1) (j) of FSS Act, 2006, have to comply with the provisions of FSS Act, 2006, Rules and Regulations made there under.

To check the compliance of the provisions of FSS Act, 2006, Rules and Regulations made there under, regular surveillance, monitoring, inspections and random sampling of both packed and un-packed food products are  carried out by food safety officers of States/UTs. The samples of food are sent for analysis in the food laboratories notified by FSSAI to ascertain its compliance. In cases where samples are found not conforming with the provisions of the Act and the Rules and Regulations made there under, penal action is initiated under the provisions of the FSS Act, 2006.(d):	As per details received from States/UTs,  including Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, State/UT wise consolidated report on food samples analyzed, found non- conforming and action taken against the defaulting Food Business Operators for the year 2020-21 is enclosed at Annexure.
