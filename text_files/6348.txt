ANSWER




                                                        (MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE)(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a)   Yes, Sir.  (b) & (c)     Under the new system, it has been mandated that no communication shall be issued by any Income Tax Authority relating to assessment, appeals, orders, (statutory or otherwise), exemptions, enquiry, investigation, verification of information, penalty, prosecution, rectification, approval etc. to the assessee or any other person, on or after the 1st day of October, 2019 unless a computer-generated Document Identification Number (DIN) has been allotted and is duly quoted in the  body of such communication. The objective is to ensure proper audit trail of all such communications. Till 11.11.2019, 5.33 crore communications with DIN have been issued by the Income Tax Department. (d)   Yes, Sir.  Adequate infrastructure has been created for successful running of DIN.  Necessary changes have been made in the Income Tax Department’s systems, processing centers, applications and softwares.  Adequate computer infrastructure is available with the officers for this purpose.  Moreover, necessary training and technical assistance has been provided to officers and staff of the Department through workshops, webcasts, video conference etc. (e)   The Government has taken continuous initiatives for digitizing interactions with the tax payers which has helped in increasing transparency, efficiency and accountability.  Majority of return filing and rectification applications are through e-filing. An integrated platform called Income Tax Business Application (ITBA) for electronic conduct of various functions/proceedings has been implemented.  E-proceedings are conducted in all types of cases barring a few exceptions.   Process automation in routine and compliance functions has also been carried out.  Recently, government has launched a randomized, faceless, e-assessment scheme to obliterate the interface between the assessor and the assessed and ensure complete transparency and accountability.
