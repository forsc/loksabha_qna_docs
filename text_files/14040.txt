ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) to (d): As on 01.03.2020, against a sanctioned strength of 24 there is a vacancy of 11 Judges in Telangana High Court and, against a sanctioned strength of 94 judges, there are 23 vacancies of Judges in the Bombay High Court.	As per the Memorandum of Procedure, for the  appointment of Judges of High Court, the Chief Justice of the High Court is required to initiate the proposals in consultation with two senior-most Judges from amongst the eligible candidates from the  Bar and concerned State Judicial Service six months prior to the occurrence of vacancies.	Filling up of vacancies is a continuous, integrated and collaborative process between the Executive and the Judiciary. It requires consultation and approval from various constitutional authorities both at the State and Centre level. Hence, the time frame for filling up vacancies of Judges cannot be indicated. While every effort is made to fill up the existing vacancies expeditiously, vacancies do keep on arising on account of retirement, resignation or elevation of Judges and increase in Judge Strength.
