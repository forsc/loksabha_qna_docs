                                                        THE MI NISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCESHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) to (c) & (e) To ensure availability of banking outlet (Bank branch/Business Correspondent (BC)) within 5 kilometers of all inhabited villages, the Government has launched a Geographic Information System (GIS) based app., namely, Jan DhanDarshak app (JDD app) developed by National Informatics Centre (NIC).  Banks have been provided login credentials to upload the GIS location of their branches, Business Correspondents and ATMs on the app. As per data uploaded by the banks on JDD app, out of the 5.54 lakh mapped villages on the app, 5.53 lakh villages (99.93%) are having bank branch or BC within 5 kilometers distance.As per extant guidelines dated 18.5.2017 on rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has granted general permission to domestic Scheduled Commercial Banks  (excluding Regional Rural Banks), to  open banking outlets at anyplace in the country, without seeking prior approvalof RBI in  each case, subject to at least  25 percent  of the total number  of  banking outlets  opened  during a financial  year being in  unbanked  rural centres i.e. centres having population less than 10,000 (Tier 5 and Tier 6 centres). A ‘Banking Outlet’ for a Domestic Scheduled Commercial Bank, a Small Finance Bank and a Payment Bank is a fixed-point service delivery unit, manned by either bank’s staff or its BC.Further, ten Small Finance Banks and six Payment Banks have been licensed by RBI for providing banking services across the country including the rural centres. In pursuance of RBI guidelines, rolling out of banking outlets in uncovered areas is a continuous process and looked after by State Level Banker’s Committee (SLBC), in consultation with the concerned State Government, member banks and other stakeholders.Banks, inter-alia, consider proposals for opening banking outlets in the light of RBI’s instructions, their business plans and their commercial viability. To further assess the viability for opening a banking outlet, banks carry out survey as required.(d) As informed by SLBC Haryana, all the Gram Panchayats and Blocks in the State are covered with banking servicesby bank branches / BCs.**
