ANSWER




MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) and (b):	The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has introduced the following changes in the examination pattern to be effective from the session 2019-20 with an aim to discourage students from rote learning and to develop critical thinking and reasoning abilities:<pre>?	Reduction in Number of Questions:- CBSE has curtailed the number of questions asked in the examination for all major subjects. This has been reflected through the Sample Question Papers available at the Boards website. This will ensure that students don’t find the paper to be too lengthy to complete in the stipulated time of 3 hours. ?	More Internal Choices:- The Board also provided internal choices for students in at least 33% questions in all major subjects. ?	Increase in Number of Objective Type Questions and reduction in Descriptive (subjective questions):- Objective Type Questions, which are essentially 1 mark questions, will be around twenty five percent in all major subjects from 2020 examination. This will reduce subjectivity on the part of examiner. However, in order to promote creativity, the marking schemes of CBSE specially directs all evaluators to award full marks to alternative innovative descriptive answers that are otherwise correct. ?	Internal Assessment in All Subjects:- In order to make assessment holistic and continuous, CBSE has extended internal assessment to all subjects for Class 10 and Class 12. Internal Assessment will amount to 20 marks in total in subjects where there is no practical assessment.(c) and (d):	As far as CBSE is concerned, the Board has taken many measures to make students stress free especially with reference to classroom transaction, Board examinations and to ensure quality education. Some of these measures are as under:?	Introduction of Experiential Learning from 2019-20 onwards:- In order to promote self-thinking, creativity and effective study skills among students and to make them lifelong learners, CBSE has introduced Experiential Learning from 2019-20 session onwards. Accordingly, the schools will plan the curricular activities in such a way which enable students to connect the content of their learning areas and subjects with their own lives and the world around them. Schools use multiple ways to teach a subject to suit the different learning style of learners. The teacher pupil ratio in CBSE schools has been as low as 1:30 to make student friendly teaching learning possible.?	Two Level Examination in Mathematics:- As per National Curriculum Framework (NCF), not only would the two levels of examinations cater for different kinds of learners and allow different levels of testing, it would also reduce overall student stress levels. Keeping in view the above aspect and as evidenced by the Board results, the Board has decided to introduce two levels of examination in Mathematics for the students of Class X who are going to appear in the Board examination for the academic session ending March 2020 onwards.?	Mandatory Sports:- In order to promote life skills and values education, CBSE has integrated Health and Physical education with academics. Every school has to provide one period per day for sports which leads to better stress management for children and also creates a better environment for learning. ?	No Homework and No School Bags till class II:- In addition to above provision, CBSE has also published guidelines on Alternative to Homework for classes’ I-VIII.?	Proscription of Corporal Punishment:- The Board has banned corporal punishment in the schools affiliated to it.(Cir July 20, 2002).?	Guidelines for prevention of Bullying and Ragging:- The Board has published the guidelines for prevention of Bullying and Ragging in Schools vide circular no 17/2015 March 9, 2015.?	Restructuring the question papers:- The Board has introduced a component of twenty percent internal assessment in all the subjects including humanities subjects to make examinations more relevant and practical based instead of theory oriented which results in rote learning and cause stress. The question paper will also have 33 percent options and more questions on higher order thinking skills in comparison questions based on rote memorization. This will ensure a shift from content based testing to problem solving and competency based testing.?	Change in Marking Scheme:- This year the marking scheme prepared for the evaluators highlighted that priority has to be given to creative, correct and relevant answers given by students other than the ones mentioned in the Marking Scheme.  This has been done to encourage students to have better conceptual understanding and to be able to overcome issues related to rote-learning and rote-evaluation.?	Additional time to read question papers:- 15 minutes of additional time to students, during Board examination, for reading the question paper before they begin to write the answers.?	Provision of pre and post examination telecounselling:- CBSE provides pre and post examination telecounselling facilities through centralized toll free helpline. CBSE experts also answer queries of students through weekly question answer columns published in national newspapers. Students can also log on to www.cbse.nic.in, and interact on exam related issues. The Board has published material on how to be stress free and various techniques to avoid stress. This is available at http://www.cbse.nic.in/examstress.htm. CBSE approached parents through a letter before Board examination 2019 and requested them to ensure that there should not be any stress or anxiety conveyed to the child from their side.?	Availability of Counselor & Wellness Teacher:- As per the affiliation Bye-laws of the CBSE every Secondary and Senior Secondary school shall appoint a person on full time basis for performing the duties of Counselor & Wellness Teacher.</pre>*****
