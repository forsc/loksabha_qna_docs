ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STEEL		   (SHRI RAM CHANDRA PRASAD SINGH)(a)&(b): Yes, Sir.  A framework policy for Steel Clusters has been drafted. A token amount of Rs.1 Lakh has been allocated in FY 2020-21 and 2021-22 for this purpose.(c)&(d): The entire demand of coking coal is not met from domestic production as the supply of high-quality coal/ coking coal (low-ash-coal) in the country is limited. Accordingly, the Indian steel Industry has been largely dependent on imported coking coal. Most of the coking coal produced domestically in the country has high ash content making it redundant in   manufacture of steel which resulted in import of 51.83 MT in 2019-20 and 51.20 MT in 2020-21 of coking coal. Following steps have been taken towards enhancing availability of steel grade coal in the country:-(1)	Coking coal mission has been launched to increase in the coking coal production from present 45 MT to 140 MT by 2029-30.  (2)	A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed on 14.10.2021 by the Minister of Steel, Government of India and the Minister of Energy, Russian Federation on cooperation regarding coking coal, which is used in steel making. The MoU will benefit the Indian steel sector by diversifying the sources of coking coal which may lead to reduction in input cost for the steel players due to long term commitment of supply of high-quality coking coal to India.  Contd……2/--: 2 :-(e)	The amount of money spent by Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) for procurement of steel grade coal (including PCI) from foreign contractors since the year 2014 to 2022, year-wise are given below:-Financial Year	2014-15	2015-16	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21	2021-22 (till Feb.’22)Expenditure  (Rs. Crore)	12745	10448	13871	20543	23704	21551	16059	27476(f)&(g): No, Sir.  No new Steel Cluster has been approved for the State of Andhra Pradesh.
