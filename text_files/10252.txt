ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a) to (d) :  Theft / pilferage of coal are carried out stealthily and clandestinely. Illegal mining of coal is reported to be carried out mainly from abandoned mines, shallow coal seams situated at remote/isolated places from the mines and are scattered over a large area. As suchit is difficult to assess and specify the exact quantum of coal stolen and losses incurred on account of theft/pilferage. Further, this is a Law & Order problem which is a State subject, hence primarily; falls under the domain of the State/District administration to take necessary deterrent action to stop/curb illegal mining of coal. However, as per raids conducted by security personnel as well as joint raids with the law and order authorities of the concerned State Government, the quantity of coal recovered, its approximate value and FIR lodged during 2018-19, company-wise and State-wise is given below: Theft/Pilferage of coal subsidiary-wise and state-wise (Provisional):CIL’s subsidiaries	State	Qty.
