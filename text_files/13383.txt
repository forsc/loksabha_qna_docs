                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (c):  No, Sir. There is no dispute between the Railway and Implementation agency. There are 3 Road over Bridges (ROBs) proposed for construction around Katakhal i.e. ROB at Km 7/2-3 between Panchgram-Katakhal, ROB at Km 10/8-9 between Katakhal-Salchapra and ROB at Km 13/2-3 between Katakhal-Salchapra. These works will be done by State Government of Assam at their own cost. Further action is to be taken by State Government of Assam. No action is pending at Railway side.(d): There is Level Crossing (LC) No. 1/BS near Badarpurghat which falls on National Highway (NH).  As per Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between Ministry of Railways and Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), MoRTH/ National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) will replace all LCs on National Highways corridors by ROBs/RUBs on single entity basis at their own cost. Hence, the ROB is to be constructed by MoRTH/ NHAI.*****
