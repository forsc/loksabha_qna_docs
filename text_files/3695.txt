SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (c):	Under the Central Sector Scheme “Silk Samagra” implemented by Government of India through Central Silk Board with a total outlay of Rs. 2161.68 crore for three years (2017-2020) for development of sericulture in the Country including the state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), with an objective to scale up production by improving the quality and productivity. The scheme comprises four (4) major Components viz. R & D, Seed, Coordination & Marketing and Quality Certification Systems/Brand Promotion, which are interlinked and aimed at a common goal. The scheme also comprises various beneficiary oriented components to support Mulberry, Vanya and Post Cocoon Sectors. These interventions cover the major areas viz.

In respect of Jammu & Kashmir, based on the proposal received from the State sericulture Department, Govt. of J&K, CSB has released /spent Rs.464.85 lakhs and Rs.631.88 lakhs respectively during the years 2017-18 and 2018-19, towards implementation of various beneficiary oriented components under Silk Samagra. To cater to the research, training and extension needs of Jammu & Kashmir, CSB has set up Central Sericultural Research and Training Institute (CSR&TI) at Pampore, Srinagar, J&K during 1994, to revive earlier activities of the CSB in the state. The institute is actively involved in Research & Development and human resource development through its network of 2 Regional Sericulture Research Stations (RSRS) and 8 Research Extension Centers, of which one RSRS at Jammu, two RECs at Barnoti and Lamberi are functioning. Besides, P4 Basic Seed Farm (BSF) Manasbal located in the state of J&K is catering R&D and extension needs. High yielding silkworm hybrids viz., Dun 17 x Dun 18, Dun 6 x Dun22, SH6 x NB4D2, SOH1 and improved mulberry varieties viz., S140, S146 and PPR1 have been developed by CSR&TI Pampore to increase the farmers’ income through sericulture.  CSB is promoting bivoltine production program extending technical support through 6 clusters (including 2 mega clusters), besides extending state of the art of soil testing facilities. Due to the continuous efforts of the Institute and technology intervention, the average yield of bivoltine cocoons has been enhanced from 27 Kg/100 DFLs (1994) to 46.81 Kg/100 DFLs (2018-19).*****
