Further, Department of Land Resources (DoLR), MoRD is implementing Watershed Development Component (WDC) of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) which is principally for development of rainfed portions of net cultivated area and culturable wastelands. The details of the funds sanctioned/allocated/released and utilized under various rural development and poverty alleviation schemes of MoRD during each of the last three years, separately in each of the North-Eastern (NE) States, Karnataka particularly in Davangere district, Tamil Nadu particularly in Cuddalore district, Rajasthan particularly in Ajmer, Jaipur and Rajsamand districts, wherever applicable scheme-wise, are given at Annexure – I.

Social Audits are also conducted by some Schemes like Mahatma Gandhi NREGS and PMAY-G.
