ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) & (b):	National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) compiles crime statistics reported to it by States and Union Territories (UTs) and publishes the same in its annual publication ‘Crime in India’. The latest published report is of the --2--L.S.US.Q.NO. 1178 FOR 09.02.2021year 2019. State/UT-wise details of number of victims trafficked, including women and children; number of victims rescued; number of victims provided rehabilitation and number of victims, including women and children rescued from forced labour during the last three years (2017, 2018 and 2019) are given in Annexure-I, II, III and IV(A)(B) and (C). (c): 	The Ministry of Women and Child Development implements a comprehensive central scheme namely, ‘Ujjawala’ for prevention of trafficking, rescue, rehabilitation, re-integration and repatriation of victims of trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation. The target groups and beneficiaries of this scheme are women vulnerable to trafficking and those who are victims of trafficking. Under the Ujjawala Scheme, Protective and Rehabilitative Homes have been set up in States, where basic amenities such as food, clothing, medical care, legal aid, vocational training and education facilities are provided to victims as a rehabilitation component. In order to assist the State Governments in the task of rehabilitation of identified and released bonded labourers, the Ministry of Labour & Employment has implemented a ‘Central Sector Scheme for Rehabilitation of Bonded Labourer, 2016’. Financial assistance is provided for rehabilitation of a rescued bonded labourer at the rate of rupees one lakh for adult male beneficiary,   Rs. 2  lakh  for  special  category beneficiaries such as children --3--L.S.US.Q.NO. 1178 FOR 09.02.2021including orphans or those rescued from organized & forced begging rings or other forms of forced child labour, and women and  Rs. 3 lakh in cases of bonded or forced labour involving extreme cases of deprivation or marginalization such as transgenders or women or children rescued from ostensible sexual exploitation such as brothels, massage parlours, placement agencies etc., or trafficking, or in cases of differently-abled persons or in situations where the District Magistrate deems fit. The financial assistance for rehabilitation is 100% funded by the Central Government.(d) & (e):	‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects as per the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. Prevention and combating the crime of human trafficking is the primary responsibility of State Governments who are competent to take appropriate action as per extant provisions of law. However, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has been supplementing the efforts of State Governments by undertaking various initiatives and measures. MHA has recently provided financial assistance of about Rs 100 crores to all States and UTs, including Border Security Force (BSF) and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) for strengthening existing Anti Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs) and setting up new AHTUs, covering all districts of the country, including border areas. Further, MHA provides financial assistance to States and UTs for holding regular ‘Judicial Colloquiums’ and ‘State  level  conferences’  to   sensitise  judicial  and police officials as also--4--L.S.US.Q.NO. 1178 FOR 09.02.2021other stakeholders for providing updated information on various provisions of law; and for generating awareness about issues relating to human trafficking. MHA also issues various advisories to States and UTs from time to time on preventing and combating human trafficking in an effective manner. These advisories are available on MHA’s website. Through the National Investigation Agency (Amendment) Act, 2019, the ‘Schedule’ of NIA Act, 2008 was amended and the National Investigation Agency was authorized to investigate cases of human trafficking under Sections 370 and 370A of Indian Penal Code. Besides this, for addressing the transnational issues of human trafficking, bilateral Memorandums of Understanding have been signed with Bangladesh, UAE, Cambodia and Myanmar; and multilateral instruments on human trafficking have been also been signed and acceded to by India.  ******
