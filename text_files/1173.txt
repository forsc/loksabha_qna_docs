ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) to (d)  The Government vide, G.S.R 490(E) dated 24.05.2018 has notified mass emission standards for flex-fuel Methanol M15 or M100 and Methanol MD 95 vehicles. M-15 is a blend of 15 % methanol and 85 % Gasoline. Use of blended fuel M-15 in BS-IV cars can result in lowering down greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by about 5 to 10 percent thereby improving air quality. M-15 fuel blending is available as an option and there is no proposal to make such blending mandatory in the near future.*******
