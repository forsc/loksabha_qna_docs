                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????      (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d): The primary responsibility for disaster management rests with the State Governments.  The State Governments provide financial relief to the affected people in the wake of notified disasters from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), already placed at their disposal. However, in the event of disaster of a severe nature, additional financial assistance is extended from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), as per the laid down procedure, which includes an assessment based on the visit of an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT). The financial assistance includes agriculture input subsidy as one of the components. The State Government of Kerala was allocated Rs.335.20 crore (Rs.251.20 crore as central share & Rs. 84.00 crore as state share) under SDRF during 2021-22. The entire central share of SDRF was released to the State.IMCTs were deputed for assessment of damages in four States and one Union Territory (UT), which were affected by heavy downpour in October-November 2021. Based on the reports of IMCTs and recommendations of the Sub-Committee of National Executive Committee (SC-NEC), the financial assistance was approved by the High Level Committee (HLC) from NDRF for States and from Union Territory Disaster Response Fund (UTDRF) for UT, subject to adjustment of 50% of balance available in SDRF/UTDRF. Details are as under:Name of State/ UT	Name of Calamity	Area of crops affected (33% & above)(In Lakh Hectare)	Amount approved by HLC(Rs. in Crore)Andhra Pradesh	Flood	2.38	351.53Karnataka	Flood	6.42	492.39Tamil Nadu	Flood	0.83	352.85Uttarakhand	Flood/Landslide	0.54	187.18Puducherry (UT)	Flood	0.82	17.86 (e) to (g): The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)  is being regularly reviewed in consultation with stakeholders to address the challenges faced in its operational implementation.  Accordingly, after detailed discussions with various stakeholders, the operational guidelines of the scheme were revised and revamped with effect from Rabi 2018 season and Kharif 2020 season respectively. The major improvements made include making the scheme voluntary for all farmers, compulsory use of atleast 0.5% of the gross premium collected by insurance companies for Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities; penalty provision for delay in settlement of claims by insurance companies & late release of share by States; intensive use of technology,   change in financial sharing pattern from 50 : 50 between Central and State Government in North Eastern Region (NER) to 90 : 10; long term i.e. 3 year contract to insurance companies; freedom to States to choose risk cover as per requirements; etc.The rationalization/revisions/improvements in the crop insurance schemes and consultations with stakeholders are continuous process. Decisions on suggestions/ representations/ recommendations/studies are taken from time to time in consultation with stakeholders. *******
