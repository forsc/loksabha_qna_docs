ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SUSHRI PRATIMA BHOUMIK)(a)	Prior to 2019-20, there were six components/sub-schemes under the Scheme for Implementation of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (SIPDA) namely, Creation of Barrier Free Environment, Accessible india Campaign (AIC), National Action Plan for Skill Development for PwDs, Composite Regional Centres (CRCs), District Disability Rehabilitation Centre (DDRCs) and the Unique Disability Identification (UDID) Project. From 2020-21, two major sub-components of the SIPDA scheme, namely Composite Regional Centers (CRC) and District Disability Rehabilitation Centre (DDRCs), were removed and clubbed with National Institutes and Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS), respectively.  The notional Budget allocation for these two major scheme was Rs.77.50 crores. In 2019-20, minor sub-schemes of Awareness Generation and Publicity (AGP), Research on Disability Related Technology, Product and Issues, In-service Training and Sensitization of key functionaries of Central & State Governments, Local Bodies and Other Providers, Incentive Scheme for providing Employment to Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) in the Private Sector were added to the umbrella scheme of SIPDA. From 2020-21, Media, Financial Assistance for Existing Deaf Colleges in Five Regions of the Country, Support for Establishment /Modernization / Capacity Augmentation of Braille Presses Scheme, State Spinal Injury Centre (SSIC) and Indian Spinal Injury Centre (ISIC) were added as sub-schemes of SIPDA. The notional budget allocation for these minor sub-schemes together over financial years 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 is Rs.42.50 crores.As such, the Budget Allocation of SIPDA for the period from FY 2016-17 onwards is as under:Financial Year	Budget estimates(Rs. in crores)2016-17	193.002017-18	207.002018-19	300.002019-20	315.002020-21	251.502021-22	209.77(b) The amount spent under each sub-scheme of SIPDA in the last three years and current year is enclosed at Annexure.(c) No, Sir.(d) Not applicable.(e) Each sub-scheme under the umbrella SIPDA scheme has its own set of objectives and guidelines for which notional budget allocation is made. The component/sub-scheme wise notional allocation of BE has been made effective since 2018-19. The Central Sector Schemes under SIPDA are demand based and dependent on receipt of sufficient proposals, complete in all respects, from the implementing agencies. Non-receipt of complete proposals and documents for any of the sub-schemes under SIPDA results in non utilization of the notionally allocated budget under these sub-schemes. In such circumstances, notional budget allocation under these sub-schemes can be utilized for other sub-schemes under the overall budget allocation of the umbrella SIPDA scheme for optimal utilization of the allocated budget. *****
