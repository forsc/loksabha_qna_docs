                                                        ANSWER MINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)  (a)	&(b)   Poshan Abhiyaan, a multi-ministerial convergence mission, was launched to focus on converting the agenda of improving nutrition into a Jan Andolan  involving panchayati raj institutions/village organizations, etc. Community Mobilization and Behavioral Change is an important component of the Abhiyaan. (c) Except West Bengal, all States/UTs implement the POSHAN Abhiyaan scheme. The COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact since most of the activities under the programme are community based events. The  restrictions placed on movement on goods, services and manpower  had a significant impact on the roll out of components like technological capacity building training, training, organization of CBEs, etc. resulting in lower fund utilization. (d)  Government  has engaged with State Governments through sustained reviews to ensure that targets are achieved and funds are utilized.                                                                  ******
