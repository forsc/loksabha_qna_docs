ANSWER




                                                        (a)       Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) promotes establishment of model training centres in every district of the country known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK). As on 31.12.2021, 813 PMKKs have been allocated across the country. (b)       Out of total allocated PMKKs, 719 PMKKs have been established covering 620 districts in 33 States/UTs. As on 31.12.2021, 16.61 lakh candidates have benefitted under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) through PMKKs including 4.47 lakh candidates during 2020-22 across the country including rural areas. (c) and (d)      The delay in setting up of remaining allocated PMKKs was majorly due to COVID-19 induced lockdown and restrictions. Presently, as there are some ease in restrictions, the Training Partners have been advised to initiate/complete the establishment process. Further, National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) under the aegis of the Ministry is making efforts for establishment of remaining allocated PMKKs.
