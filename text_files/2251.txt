ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a): Yes Sir, an enhanced Aviation Security Fee (ASF) is being levied at the rate of Rs.150/- per embarking domestic passenger( earlier  Rs.130/- ) and USD 4.85 per embarking international passenger ( earlier USD 3.25 ) w.e.f. 1st July 2019. The enhancement has been done for meeting the deficit in cost of deployment of Central Industrial Security Force(CISF) .(b):   As increase in Aviation Security Fee (ASF) is nominal, there will be no significant impact on passengers.(c): Yes, CISF caught 08 cases of gold smuggling in 2019 at Delhi airport.(d):  Yes, Sir. Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) is having outstanding dues on cost of deployment of CISF amounting to Rs. 549.49 crore as on 31.08.2018 due to deficit in Passenger Service Fee(Security Component) [PSF(SC)] collections. (e) The Ministry has issued various orders/circulars detailing the specific items for incurring expenditure from PSF(SC) funds collected by airport operators. The PSF(SC) accounts of the airport operators are subject to audit by Comptroller and Auditor General.(f) & (g): Yes, Sir. The PSF (SC), now Aviation Security Fee (ASF), has remained unchanged since 2001. As on 31.12.2018, there was a deficit of Rs.730.91 crore in PSF(SC) collections and expenditure incurred therefrom. The Aviation Security Fee has been, therefore, increased to bridge the funding gap taking into consideration the enhanced security deployment requirements and increase in the cost of security at the airports. ;The matter was deliberated in a High Level Committee and based on the deficit, the rates have been increased. A decision to pool entire collection in a single account has also been taken.
