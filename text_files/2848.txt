ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) & (b):	 The average income of agricultural households in the country is estimated by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) through the ‘Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Households’ conducted from time to time. As per the results of the latest such survey conducted in 2013, all-India average monthly income per agricultural household from various sources is estimated to be Rs.6426. Contd…2/--2-(c):	Yes, Sir the Government has been focusing on reorienting the agriculture sector by shifting towards an income-centric approach, rather than a production-centric approach. Towards this end, various schemes/programmes are being promoted and implemented through the State Governments. These include, inter alia, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY); Soil Health Card (SHC) Scheme; Neem Coated Urea (NCU); Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY); National Agriculture Market scheme (e- NAM); Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY); National Food Security Mission (NFSM); Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA); Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH); National Mission on Oilseeds & Oilpalm (NMOOP); National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA); National Mission on Agricultural Extension & Technology (NMAET) and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY). Besides, Government has adopted the principle of fixing Minimum Support Prices (MSP) at a level of 50 per cent over the all-India weighted average cost of production of crops.Moreover, with a view to provide income support to all farmers’ families across the country, the Central Government has started a new Central Sector Scheme, namely, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN). The Scheme aims to provide a payment of Rs. 6000/- per year, in three installments of Rs. 2000/- each to the farmers, subject to certain exclusions relating to higher income groups.  (d) & (e):	Since the last survey on income of agricultural households was conducted in 2013, the extent of increase in income during the last three years is not known. However, Government has decided to conduct the next ‘Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Households’ during NSS 77th round (January 2019- December 2019) with reference to the agricultural year July 2018-June 2019 to provide a comprehensive assessment of the situation of agricultural households in the country, including their income and expenditure.(f):	The Government had constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee in April, 2016 to examine issues relating to ‘Doubling of Farmers Income’ and recommend a comprehensive strategy to achieve the same. The Committee has submitted its Report to the Government in September, 2018.  The Committee recognises agriculture as a value led enterprise and has identified seven major sources of growth, viz., improvement in crop productivity; improvement in livestock productivity; resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; increase in the cropping intensity; diversification towards high value crops; improvement in real prices received by farmers; and shift from farm to non-farm occupations.   ********
