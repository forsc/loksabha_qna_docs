                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICS AND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNING (RAO INDERJIT SINGH) (a) to (c) The cumulative figures of funds that remained unspent under Members of Parliament Local AreaDevelopment Scheme (MPLADS) during the last five, (including West Bengal)are as follows:Position as on      Funds  Released	     Expenditure       Unspent fund                     (in Rs. crore)           (in Rs. crore)    (in Rs. crore)31.03.2015	       36007.25	                32373.12	   4857.5131.03.2016	       39509.25	                35997.90	   4950.3431.03.2017	       43008.75	                39904.26	   5029.3131.03.2018	       46512.75	                43980.55	   4877.7131.03.2019	       50462.25	                48997.07	   4103.9704.03.2020	       53704.75	                51267.75	   5275.24      Given the nature and dynamics of the scheme, unspent balances are bound to exist at any given point of time, as the funds released under the scheme are non- lapsable and the funds received by a district in a particular year can be utilized in the subsequent financial year(s) also. Moreover, unspent balance is not an unused fund but also includes the funds in pipeline for implementation of ongoing works.(d) Yes Sir, provisions exist on the MPLADSportal for the district authorities to provide work-wise, MP-wise and year-wise details on progress of projects regularly.                                              *****
