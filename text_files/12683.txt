                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a): 	Under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme, all the landholding farmer families subject to certain exclusion criteria of higher income status are provided Rs. 6000/- per annum in three equal installments, every four month.  The identification of eligible farmer families and uploading their details on the exclusive web portal www.pmkisan.gov.in rests with the concerned State/UT. The data of beneficiaries uploaded by the State / UT Governments undergoes a multi-level verification and validation by various concerned agencies, including the banks.  Thereafter the benefit is successfully transferred into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. (b) & (c): 	Under the Kisan Credit Card Scheme, timely and adequate crop loans are extended to farmers including small and marginal farmers. Government has launched a campaign for saturation of all PM-Kisan beneficiaries with KCC from 08-02-2020. Banks have been advised to map the existing beneficiaries of PM-Kisan and KCC holders and uncovered PM-Kisan beneficiaries and initiate steps to bridge the gap.(d): 	      Yes Sir. Farmers are able to purchase agricultural inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides etc. under Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme. Beneficiaries under KCC in Satna District as on 30.09.2019 are 1,22,744. (e) & (f):   The details  of  small and marginal farmers of Satna District of Madhya Pradesh under Interest Subvention Scheme is not available. Incorrect claims/discrepancy in calculation of Interest Subvention noticed during inspection/test checks are rectified by obtaining revised claims or ensuring refund of ineligible claim amount. However, disaggregated data is not maintained.                    716 farmers have joined the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan-Dhan Yojana as on 10.02.2020 in Satna District of Madhya Pradesh. No irregularity has been reported in implementation of the scheme. ********
