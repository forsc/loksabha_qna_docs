ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) to (d): As per the provisions of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, it is the duty of the respective State and Union Territory Government which is the appropriate Government under the RTE Act to provide free and compulsory elementary education to every child of the age 6 to 14 years in a neighbourhood school. In pursuance of Section 6 of the RTE Act, the respective State and Union Territory (UT) Government have notified areas or limits of their neighbourhood norms in their State RTE Rules, factoring in their State specific condition, for opening of schools. The Department of School Education & Literacy, Ministry of Education, through integrated centrally sponsored scheme of Samagra Shiksha provides support to the States and UTs for implementing the various provisions of the RTE Act, including opening/ strengthening of schools. On the basis of the Annual Work Plan & Budget received from State Government for various activities, Project Approval Board (PAB) approves opening of new schools to the State Government for implementation of Samagra Shiksha. As on 15.03.2022, status of schools under Samagra Shikhsa in the State of West Bengal is as below:<pre>Schools	Approved	FunctionalPrimary	16655	16590Primary to Upper Primary	10087	7842Secondary	7	0</pre>Proposals for opening of new Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) are considered only when received in the prescribed proforma from the District Administration through the State Government concerned. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities for opening of new KVs also have to compete among other proposals under the “Challenge Method”. At present, 62 KVs are functioning in the State of West Bengal.	The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme provides for opening of one Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country for providing good quality education to children predominantly from the rural areas. Opening of new JNVs is a continuous process which depends on the availability of suitable land by the concerned State Government free of cost for construction of school buildings and the required temporary accommodation (free of rent) to start the Vidyalaya. However, actual sanction and opening of the JNV depends on the availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority. At present, there are 19 functional JNVs sanctioned in the State of West Bengal.*****
