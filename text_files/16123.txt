                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR TOURISM (INDEPENDENT CHARGE)(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL)(a):	With the global spread of Coronavirus and the travel advisories issued by the Government restricting/prohibiting travel from affected countries, the impact on the tourism sector will be significant. However it is an evolving situation and it is not possible for the Ministry of Tourism to undertake a study now to assess the impact on the sector. Provisional data of Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTA) during January and February 2020 and those for the corresponding months of the previous year are given below:<pre>	January2019	February2019	January2020	February2020FTA	11,03,380	10,87,694	11,18,150	10,15,632</pre>(b) and (c):		The Ministry of Tourism, under its scheme of Domestic Promotion and Publicity including Hospitality (DPPH), implements various measures for promotion of tourism in the country and as part of its on-going activities, releases print, electronic and online media campaigns, to promote various tourism destinations and products in the different States and Union Territories of the country including Andhra Pradesh. Promotions are also undertaken through the website and Social Media accounts of the Ministry. In addition, the Indiatourism Offices in India undertake various promotional activities with the objective of showcasing the tourism destinations and products of the country and increasing tourist visits to the different States/Union Territories of the country. In addition, with a view to enhancing local tourism in the country, Ministry of Tourism works closely with related Ministries and Departments, State Governments/UT Administrations and private industry stakeholders on a regular basis and through an Inter-Ministerial Coordination Committee for Tourism Sector (IMCCTS) constituted under the Chairmanship of the Cabinet Secretary to address issues related to the development of tourism. *********
