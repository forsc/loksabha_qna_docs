ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)	The Central Government has various schemes to facilitate setting up Common Effluent Treatment plants (CETPs) across the countryfor treatment of effluents generated from industrial units located in clusters.Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change was implementing a schemeto fundsetting up of CETPs for treatment of effluents generated from Small Scale Industries located in clusters from year 1991. However, this scheme has been discontinued from 2017-18. Setting up of CETP is also being undertaken by Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises through a cluster development approach strategized to help Micro and Small Enterprises, by Ministry of Textiles under the Integrated Processing Development Scheme (IPDS) for textile processing sectorand by Ministry of Jal Shakti through NMCG programme in Ganga Basin.(b)	There are about 196 CETPs operating across the countryand about 80 CETPs are under construction / proposal phase. State/UT-wise details of CETPs under operation / construction/proposal phaseincluding Madhya Pradesh are at Annexure-I. Presently, 03 CETPs are operating in Madhya Pradesh, with designed capacity of 9.4 MLD. One CETP in Meghnagar, District - Jhabua with a designed capacity of 0.4 MLD is under construction.Under IPDS, 9 CETP projects have been sanctioned in the State of Rajasthan (5 CETPs), Gujarat (1 CETP), Tamil Nadu (2 CETPs) and Telengana (1 CETP). (c) Common Effluent Treatment Plant is considered as a cost effective andviable treatment solution, to overcome the constraints associated with the effluent treatment in the small and medium industries at individual levels. CETP also facilitates in reduction of number of discharge points in any industry estate for better enforcement and also to make available the skilled manpower for proper treatment of effluent. It is also helpful in organizing the disposal of final effluent and sludge and improving upon the possibilities of recycle/reuse.*****
