ANSWER




MINISTRY OF HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a) to (b): Yes, Sir. The Central Government has launched an Integrated Scheme for SchoolEducation- Samagra Shiksha, from 2018-19 which subsumes the erstwhile centrally sponsoredschemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) andTeacher Education Scheme (TE). It is an overarching programme for the school education sectorextending from pre-school to class XII and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable qualityeducation at all levels of school education. The Scheme for school education ‘SamagraShiksha’ envisages the ‘school’ as a continuum from primary, upper primary, secondary tohigher secondary levels. It has been observed that separate schemes have created an artificialdivide of levels i.e., elementary and secondary within the “School Education Sector”. This mayhave led to a duplication of efforts towards implementing similar interventions and achievingsimilar objectives. A single programme will lead to an optimal utilization of budgetaryallocations and effective use of human resources and institutional structures.(c) & (d): Education is in the Concurrent List of the Constitution, a majority of the schools areunder the jurisdiction of respective States and Union Territories (UT). Hence, the recruitment,service conditions and redeployment of teachers and other staff are primarily in the domain ofrespective State Governments and UT Administrations. As per information received from StateGovernment of Karnataka, the State Government Order has specified the posts for the office ofthe State Project Director, District office, and Block office. As per the Karnataka GovernmentOrder, 150 District Primary Education Programme (DPEP) posts and 743 outsourced posts havebeen continued under Samagra Shiksha.****
