(a)	whether the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd. (NPCIL) has so far not set up a facility for storage of radioactive spent nuclear fuel at Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP);(b)	if so, the details thereof along with the reasons therefor; and(c)	the fresh steps taken by the Government to set up the ‘away from reactor’ facility for safe storage of spent nuclear fuel at KKNPP at the earliest?






ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES & PENSIONS AND PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR.JITENDRA SINGH):    (a)&(b)The scheme of storage of spent (used) fuel in a nuclear power plant is two-fold.  The first place of storing spent fuel is located within the reactor building/service building, generally known as the spent fuel storage pool/bay and the other is the storage facility located away from the reactor called the ‘Away From Reactor’ (AFR) Spent Fuel Storage Facility, within the plant premises. The spent fuel is shifted to the AFR when the capacity of the spent fuel storage pool / bay is exceeded. Thus it is not needed from day one of the nuclear plant operation but can be set up when the need arises. The spent fuel at Kudankulam Units 1&2 is presently being stored in the Spent Fuel Storage pools located in the reactor buildings and the AFR is now proposed to be constructed at the site.(c)	Presently the process of obtaining statutory environmental clearance for setting up the AFR facility is underway. The construction of the AFR will be started after obtaining all statutory and regulatory clearances.  *****
