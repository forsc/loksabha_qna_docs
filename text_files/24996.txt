ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) and (b)As per the World Meteorological Organization, average global temperature for 2015-2019 is estimated to be 1.1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial(1850-1900) level. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences, in line with rising temperatures across the globe, all India mean temperature has risen by nearly 0.7degree Celsius during 1901 to 2018. Furthermore, based on India Meteorological Department (IMD) data, linear trends over the period 1951-2015 show a decrease in annual as well as seasonal summer rainfall over the Madhya Maharashtra region. Long-term (1901-2002) multiple data sources and methods also reveal that droughts are becoming much more regional in recent decades, and an increase has been observed in the duration, severity and spatial extent of droughts over central Maharashtra. However, there is no established study for India providing a quantified contribution of climate change triggering extreme heat, rain and drought. While many studies monitor disasters such as drought, heat, and floods, the science of attribution of these changes particularly to climate change is far more complex and currently an evolving subject. Such changes as observed may also arise from a number of causes, including the inherent variability in the climate systems that are common in the biosphere and the geosphere. Most studies so far have relied on mathematical modelling of climate change impacts but these are yet to be empirically verified. (c) and (d)The Government stands committed to combating climate change through its several programs and schemes. This includes implementation of the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), which comprises missions in specific areas of solar energy, energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan ecosystem, sustainable habitat, green India, and strategic knowledge on climate change. The NAPCC provides an overarching framework for all climate actions. Thirty-three States/Union Territories have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) in line with NAPCC taking into account the State specific issues relating to climate change. These SAPCCs outline sector-specific and cross-sectoral priority actions, including adaptation. The Government is also implementing the scheme, ‘National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change’ to support adaptation measures of States/UTs in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate Change. The State of Maharashtra has prepared the Maharashtra State Adaptation Action Plan on Climate Change which focuses on eight key sectors i.e. agriculture, water, health, forests, rural development, urban development, disaster management and energy.******
