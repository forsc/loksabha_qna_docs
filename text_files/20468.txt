All channels are required to adhere      to the said Programme Code which contains a wide range of parameters.

Complaints were received in the Ministry about the media coverage of death of Shri Sushant Singh Rajput. The complaints were forwarded to News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) which is a self-regulatory body in respect of their member news broadcasters. NBSA issued an Advisory on 13.08.2020 to all its member channels regarding coverage of that case by member broadcasters, highlighting specific guidelines covering reportage and the manner in which media should report on cases of suicide.  NBSA also examined various complaints referred to it and vide its Order dated 06.10.2020, took penal action against member channels to air apology, censure, warning and fine.*********
