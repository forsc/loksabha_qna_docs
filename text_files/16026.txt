                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b):	Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying haveinformed that no complaint of adulteration in the quality of ghee, curd, butter and milk supplied by the Delhi Milk Scheme has been received during the Financial Year 2018-19.(c): 	FSSAI has formulated science based standards for various food products, including milk products. The enforcement and implementation of Food Safety and Standards (FSS) Act, 2006 and Rules and Regulations made thereunder primarily rests with the State/UT Governments. I.	In order to ensure the availability of safe food products, including milk and milk products, to the consumers and for keeping a check on adulteration, regular surveillance, monitoring and inspections are being carried out by the Officials of Food Safety Departments of the respective States/UTs to check compliance of the provisions laid down under Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and the Rules and Regulations made thereunder. In cases where the samples are found to be non-conforming, penal action is taken against the defaulting Food Business Operators (FBOs). II.	A Risk Based Inspection System (RBIS) has been introduced with higher frequency of inspection for high risk category food products like Milk and milk products.III.	FSSAI advised the State Food Safety authorities from time to time to  (a)  maintain a strict vigil on milk chilling units to eliminate the chances of adulteration or production of any spurious milk entering into the milk value chain (b) intensify surveillance during festive seasons when demand of milk and milk products increases (c) keep a strict vigil by regularly drawing food samples from all sources viz. manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers and take strict action against the offenders  under the provisions of FSS Act, 2006 (d)generate local intelligence regarding the malpractices which expectedly will be more prevalent at local levels (e) strengthen testing and enforcement infrastructure both physical as well as human to ensure that a strict surveillance is maintained to check the malpractices of adulteration effectively.  IV.	FSSAI has developed and released a harmonized Scheme of Testing and Inspection (STI) to be adopted by dairy processing plants for the purpose of monitoring and self compliance throughout their production chain in order to strengthen their internal controls. All dairy processing plants are required to maintain appropriate records of testing. V.	FSSAI has notified more laboratories to strengthen the food testing ecosystem. At present there are 246 primary food testing laboratories in the country under network of FSSAI and 18 appellate labs.  58 Mobile food testing labs have been provided to 31 States to strengthen testing facilities even in remote areas.VI.	To build up trust of consumers in safety and quality of milk and milk products, consumer awareness and engagement programs are organised throughout the country. This includes dissemination of details about Detecting Adulterants with Rapid Testing (DART) book and magic box containing sample tests to be performed at home to check adulteration in milk and Consumer guidance note on milk products which have been uploaded on FSSAI website i.e.www.fssai.gov.in. Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying has informed that Milk and Milk Products supplied by DMS to the consumers are tested as per the quality standards of milk and milk products specified in Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards and Food Additives) Regulations, 2011 made there under. Further, in order to ensure that milk products supplied to the consumers are of good quality. DMS has a valid licence under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. DMS is also having ISO 22000-2005 Certification for Food Safety Management System along with Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) to ensure reduction and elimination of food safety risks as a mean to protect consumers. Further, the Milk Products after manufacturing are tested in Quality Control Laboratory (QCL) of DMS for ensuring their quality standards in compliance to Food Safety and Standards Regulation, 2011 before supplying to the Consumers.
