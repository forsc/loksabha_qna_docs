                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a) ‘Sports’ being a State subject promotion of sports, including among rural youth, is the responsibility of States/Union Territory Governments. Central Government supplements efforts of theState/Union Territory Governments by providing assistance through National Sports Federations, training in Sports Authority of India (SAI) Centres and support under Khelo India Scheme. Scouting and nurturing of talent, including from rural areas, and organisation of competitive events under Khelo India Scheme help promotion of sports among rural youth.(b) & (c) Media rights were given for Khelo India Games for 5 years to Star Sports in January, 2018. Viewership of Khelo India Games, 2019 was 98.4 million. This reflects increased public interest in sports. Initiatives undertaken under Khelo India Scheme to popularize sports include Khelo India Mobile App, early scouting of sporting talent and its nurturing, bridging gaps in infrastructure, providing training facilities to sports persons and organization of Khelo India competitions.(d) While ‘Sports’ being a State subject promotion of sports, including establishing training centres and agencies at district level, is the responsibility of State/ UT Governments, Central Government is supporting 10 Regional Centres, 4 Educational Institutions and 273 Training Centres of Sports Authority of India . These cater to talented sports persons, including those from rural areas.(e) & (f) Sports being State subject Central Government does not monitor Sports Federations at State/ District/ Sub District level.
