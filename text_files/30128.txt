The National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) currently mandates a coverage of upto 75% of the rural population and upto 50% of the urban population, which at Census 2011 comes to 81.35 crore persons. Presently, approx 79.53 crore persons are covered under NFSA. Identification of beneficiaries under the Act is a continuous process.
