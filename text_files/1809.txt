ANSWER




MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) & (b): 	There have been some reports of CPI(Maoist) inducting children in their outfit in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, using them for cooking, carrying daily use materials and collecting information regarding movement of Security Forces. They are also imparted military training.        (c):	State Governments initiate legal action in such cases under the provisions of Indian Penal Code and Juvenile Justice Act, 2015. To combat  the  LWE  menace  in  a  holistic  manner,  Government  of  India formulated a National Policy and Action Plan in January 2015, which envisages a multi pronged approach comprising security measures, development measures, ensuring Rights and Entitlements of local communities etc. The steadfast implementation of the policy has resulted in consistent decline in LWE violence and influence of CPI (Maoist).******
