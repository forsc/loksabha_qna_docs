ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) to (c) A statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****      STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (c) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *407 TO BE ANSWERED ON THURSDAY, 31.03.2022 ON “TOXIC SUBSTANCES IN GROUND WATER”.(a) & (b) Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) generates ground water quality data annually on a regional scale through ground water quality monitoring throughout the country. This monitoring indicates the occurrence of fluoride, arsenic, nitrate, iron and heavy metals beyond the BIS (Bureau  of Indian Standards) permissible limits for human consumption in isolated pockets in certain parts of the country including Uttar Pradesh. Details in this regard are given at Annexure I.  Consumption of arsenic beyond permissible limits may lead to arsenicosis, development of black-brown skin pigmentation (melanosis), hardening of palm and soles (keratosis), skin cancer etc. In addition,consumption of fluoride beyond permissible limits may lead to dental fluorisis, skeletal fluorisis and non-skeletal fluorisis including anemia etc. Water being State subject, initiatives on water management including taking corrective action related to ground water quality in the country is primarily States’ responsibility. However, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in association with State Pollution Control Boards/Pollution Control Committees (SPCBs/PCCs) is implementing provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control) Act, 1974 & the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to prevent and control pollution.  Adverse effects of the groundwater contamination can be addressed to a large extent if safe water is made available to public. The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation (DoDW&S) had launched a National Water Quality Sub-Mission (NWQSM) on 22nd March, 2017 as a part of National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP), which has now been subsumed under Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), to provide safe drinking water to 27,544 arsenic/fluoride affected rural habitations in the country. JJM, being implemented in partnership with States since August, 2019, aims to provide potable tap water supply of prescribed quality to every rural household in the country by 2024. Under JJM, while allocating the funds to States/ UTs in a particular financial year, 10% weightage is given to the population residing in habitations affected by chemical contaminants including arsenic and fluoride, as on 31st March of the preceding financial year. Since, planning, implementation and commissioning of piped water supply schemes based on a safe water source likely to take time, purely as an interim measure, States/ UTs have been advised to install community water purification plants (CWPPs) in such habitations, to provide potable water to every household at the rate of 8–10 litre per capita per day (lpcd) to meet their drinking and cooking requirements. (c)  CGWB has constructed several exploratory and observation wells in the country tapping the arsenic safe deeper aquifer zones delineated through exploration aided detailed aquifer mapping under National Aquifer Mapping programme.  Successful wells have been handed over to the State Governments for utilization. Further, the groundwater quality information generated by the CGWB on yearly basis is also shared with States/UTs for their corrective action while making available drinking water to the public.In addition, CGWB is providing technical assistance to the States by sharing the cement sealing technology for tapping contamination free aquifers in Gangetic flood plains including West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh. *** ANNEXURE IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (A)& (B) OF STARRED QUESTION NO.*407 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 31.03.2022 REGARDING “TOXIC SUBSTANCES IN GROUND WATER”.States Wise Number of Partly Affected Districts with different Contaminants in Ground Water of IndiaS.No.	State/ UT	Salinity (EC above 3000 micro mhos/ cm)(EC : Electrical Conductivity)	Fluoride(above 1.5 mg/l)	Nitrate(above 45 mg/l)	Arsenic(above 0.01 mg/l)	Iron(above 1mg/l )	Lead (above 0.01 mg/l)	Cadmium (above 0.003 mg/l)	Chromium (above 0.05 mg/l)1	Andhra Pradesh	12	12	13	3	7			2	Telangana	8	10	10	1	8	2	1	13	Assam		9		19	18			4	Arunachal Pradesh					4			5	Bihar		13	10	22	19			6	Chhattisgarh	1	19	12	1	17	1	1	17	Delhi	7	7	8	2		3	1	48	Goa					2			9	Gujarat	21	22	24	12	10			10	Haryana 	18	21	21	15	17	17	7	111	Himachal Pradesh			6	1				12	Jammu & Kashmir		2	6	3	9	3	1	13	Jharkhand		12	11	2	6	1		14	Karnataka	29	30	29	2	22			15	Kerala	4	5	11		14	2		116	Madhya Pradesh	18	43	51	8	41	16		17	Maharashtra	25	17	30		20	19		18	Manipur		1		2	4			19	Meghalaya		1			6			20	Nagaland		1			1			21	Odisha	17	26	28	1	30			122	Punjab	10	19	21	10	9	6	8	1023	Rajasthan	30	33	33	1	33	3		24	Tamil Nadu	27	25	29	9	2	3	1	525	Tripura					4			26	Uttar Pradesh	13	34	59	28	15	10	2	327	Uttarakhand			4		5			28	West Bengal	6	8	5	9	16	6	2	229	Andaman& Nicobar	1				2			30	Daman & Diu	1		1	1				31	Puducherry			1						Total	Parts of 248 districts in 18 states & UTs	Parts of 370districts in 23 states & UTs	Parts of 423districts in 23states & UTs	Parts of 152 districts in 21 states & UTs	Parts of 341 districts in 27 states & UTs	Pb in parts of 92 districts in 14 states	Cd in parts of 24 districts in 9 states	Cr in parts of 29districts in  10 states*****
