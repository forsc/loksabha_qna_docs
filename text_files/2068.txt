(b) and (c):  The demand pattern on Indian Railways is not uniform and it varies during peak and lean seasons across different sectors and routes. The demand for travel surges specially during the peak season like summer holidays, festivals etc. In order to meet the travelling needs of passengers, Indian Railways introduces new trains and extends/increases the frequencies of existing trains. Further, to cater to the extra rush of passengers during festivals, holidays etc., special trains are operated and temporary augmentation of trains undertaken factoring the pattern of traffic, operational feasibility and availability of resources.  This is an ongoing and continuous process. Accordingly, during the year 2018-19, 106 pairs of trains have been introduced and 487 coaches have been utilized for permanent augmentation. Further, to cater to the rush of passengers during peak season, summer vacation, festival etc., 34237 special train trips have been operated and 72618 coaches have been attached on temporary basis, during 2018-19.  *****
