                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) to (b) Promoting growth of the economy has always been the utmost priority of the government. There is expansion of employment opportunities and formalization of the economy as reflected in the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) membership. As per press release of the EPFO dated 20th February, 2020, provisionally there was a net addition of 65.03 lakh payroll subscriber during 2019-20 (till December, 2019), as compared to 61.12 lakh in 2018-19 (April to March). Government has implemented several major structural reforms in recent years to bolster growth and in turn create jobs. These, inter-alia, include Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to strengthen the financial system, Goods and Services Tax (GST) to simplify the indirect taxation regime, Make-in-India programme to boost domestic manufacturing capacity through liberalization of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), the corporate tax rate cut to 15 per cent for new domestic manufacturing companies and Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) Trinity towards greater transparency, efficiency and financial inclusion. The Government has also launched the National Infrastructure Pipeline on 31st December, 2019 of Rs. 103 lakh crore.Further, Government has taken various steps for generating employment in the country like encouraging private sector of economy, fast-tracking various projects involving substantial investment and increasing public expenditure on schemes such as Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) and Deendayal Antodaya Yojana National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM). The Government has also launched various schemes to promote the entrepreneurship, skilling and employment through measures such as Startup India, Mudra Scheme, Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana (PMRPY), National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) etc. In addition, flagship programmes of the Government such as Digital India, Swachh Bharat Mission, Smart City Mission, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, Housing for All, Infrastructure development and Industrial corridors have the potential to generate productive employment opportunities. (c) to (d) Yes Madam. The details of the 16-point plan for agriculture in the Union Budget, 2020-21 are at Annexure.(e) There is a substantial increase in allocation for agriculture and allied activities, irrigation and rural development to about Rs. 2,83,202 crore in 2020-21(Budget Estimates) from Rs. 2,49,910 crore in 2019-20 (Revised Estimates).***** AnnexureAnnexure referred to part (c) and (d) of the Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.1762 on “Creation of Jobs” due for answer on 02.03.2020The details of 16-point plan for agriculture as specified in the Para No. 23 of Budget Speech 2020-21of the Hon’ble Finance Minister are as follows:23.	Adopting sustainable cropping patterns and bringing in more technology are integral to our plan.  All this and more can be achieved through working with and in cooperation with the States.  The following 16 action points indicate our focus:23 (1). We propose to encourage those State governments who undertake implementation of following model laws already issued by the Central government: a)	Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act, 2016b)	Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2017; andc)	Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 201823 (2).	 Water stress related issues are now a serious concern across the country. Our government is proposing comprehensive measures for one hundred water stressed districts. 23 (3).	 In the Budget speech of July 2019, I had stated that “annadata” can be “urjadata” too. The PM-KUSUM scheme removed farmers’ dependence on diesel and kerosene and linked pump sets to solar energy. Now, I propose to expand the scheme to provide 20 lakh farmers for setting up stand-alone solar pumps; further we shall also help another 15 lakh farmers solarise their grid-connected pump sets. In addition, a scheme to enable farmers to set up solar power generation capacity on their fallow/barren lands and to sell it to the grid would be operationalized. 23 (4).	 Our government shall encourage balanced use of all kinds of fertilizers including the traditional organic and other innovative fertilizers. This is a necessary step to change the prevailing incentive regime, which encourages excessive use of chemical fertilizers. 23 (5).	India has an estimated capacity of 162 million MT of agri-warehousing, cold storage, reefer van facilities etc.  NABARD will undertake an exercise to map and geo-tag them.  In addition, we propose creating warehousing, in line with Warehouse Development and Regulatory Authority (WDRA) norms. Our government will provide Viability Gap Funding for setting up such efficient warehouses at the block/taluk level.  This can be achieved, where States can facilitate with land and are on a PPP mode. Food Corporation of India (FCI) and Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) shall undertake such warehouse building on their land too.23 (6). As a backward linkage, a Village Storage scheme is proposed to be run by the SHGs.  This will provide farmers a good holding capacity and reduce their logistics cost.  Women, SHGs shall regain their position as “Dhaanya Lakshmi”.23 (7). To build a seamless national cold supply chain for perishables, inclusive of milk, meat and fish, the Indian Railways will set up a “Kisan Rail” – through PPP arrangements. There shall be refrigerated coaches in Express and Freight trains as well. 23 (8). Krishi Udaan will be launched by the Ministry of Civil Aviation on international and national routes. This will immensely help improve value realisation especially in North-East and tribal districts. 23 (9). Horticulture sector with its current produce of 311 million MT exceeds production of food grains.  For better marketing and export, we propose supporting States which, adopting a cluster basis, will focus on “one product one district”. 23 (10). Integrated farming systems in rainfed areas shall be expanded. Multi-tier cropping, bee-keeping, solar pumps, solar energy production in non-cropping season will be added. Zero-Budget Natural Farming (mentioned in July 2019 budget) shall also be included.  The portal on “jaivik kheti” – online national organic products market will also be strengthened. 23 (11). Financing on Negotiable Warehousing Receipts (e-NWR) has crossed more than Rs. 6000 crore. This will be integrated with e-NAM.  23 (12). Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) and cooperatives are active in the agriculture credit space.  The NABARD re-finance scheme will be further expanded.  Agriculture credit target for the year 2020-21 has been set at Rs.15 lakh crore. All eligible beneficiaries of PM-KISAN will be covered under the KCC scheme. 23 (13). Our government intends to eliminate Foot and Mouth disease, brucellosis in cattle and also peste des petits ruminants (PPR) in sheep and goat by 2025.  Coverage of artificial insemination shall be increased from the present 30% to 70%. MNREGS would be dovetailed to develop fodder farms. Further, we shall facilitate doubling of milk processing capacity from 53.5 million MT to 108 million MT by 2025. 23 (14). Blue Economy: Our government proposes to put in place a framework for development, management and conservation of marine fishery resources.  23 (15). Youth in coastal areas benefit through fish processing and marketing.  By 2022-23, I propose raising fish production to 200 lakh tonnes. Growing of algae, sea-weed and cage Culture will also be promoted. Our government will involve youth in fishery extension through 3477 Sagar Mitras and 500 Fish Farmer Producer Organisations. We hope to raise fishery exports to Rs. 1 lakh crore by 2024-25. 23 (16). Under Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana for alleviation of poverty, 58 lakh SHGs have been mobilised. We shall further expand on SHGs.  *****
