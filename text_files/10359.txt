ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS,  HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a)	Sir, total numbers of complaints against Telecom Service Providers are as under:1.	Complaints received by TRAI:<pre>Year 2016	Year 2017	Year 2018	Year 2019 (Jan. to November)19819	21332	32265	26402</pre>TSP wise details are enclosed at Annexure-I.2. Complaints received by Government:<pre>Year 2016	Year 2017	Year 2018	Year 2019 (Jan. to November)60241	69406	54257	44890</pre>TSP wise details are enclosed at Annexure-II.(b) to (f)	TRAI Act,1997 does not envisage handling of individual consumer complaints by TRAI.  However, complaints received in TRAI are forwarded to concerned service provider for appropriate action.  TRAI has mandated all Telecom Service Providers to establish a two-tier complaint/grievance redressal mechanism for handling consumer complaints.  In terms of this mechanism, a consumer can lodge service related complaints at the complaint centre of their Telecom Service Providers (TSPs). In case complaint is not redressed satisfactorily by the service provider at the complaint centre, an appeal can be registered with Appellate Authority of the TSPs.(g)  	In case a grievance is not redressed even after exhausting the procedure as prescribed by TRAI, the complainant may approach Public Grievance Cell of Department of Telecommunications (DoT) along with all documentary evidence(s) for non-redrassal of his grievance at concerned Service Provider level. Complainant may submit grievance in either of the following ways:(i) by hand  (ii)  post (iii) fax (iv) phone Or (v) CPGRAMS Web Portal-  URL : http://www.pgporal.gov.in.The complaints so registered in DoT are forwarded to the concerned service provider/subordinate organization(s) with an advice to take appropriate action in the matter and to inform the complainant regarding the action taken towards the redressal of grievance.  All the complaints received in DoT are  monitored in a transparent, user friendly and structured manner by DoT staff and officers.  DoT also provides an option to the complainant to raise his/her grievance through social media like twitter. Apart from above DoT  also took initiative to bring telecom consumers under the ambit of Consumer Protection Act, 2019.Further, DoT  is also considering to set-up Telecom Ombudsman for addressing the  telecom consumer grievances.
