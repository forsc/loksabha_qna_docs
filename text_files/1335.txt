ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE  IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO) (a) & (b) The details of some of the major weather extremes in India in the recent years, as reported under second Biennial Update Report (2018), are at Annexure-I. As per the information received from National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), no centralized data on deaths due to extreme weather conditions in the states/ union territories is maintained. Each state has its own State Disaster Management Authority to deal with such events.(c) The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has carried out a study titled “Climate Change and India: A 4X4 Assessment - A Sectoral and Regional Analysis for 2030s”. The study projects impacts of climate change in 2030 on four key sectors of Indian economy, namely, agriculture, water, forests and human health in four regions of India, viz. the Himalayan region, the Western Ghats, the Coastal region and the North-Eastern Region.(d) The NDMA has issued several disaster specific guidelines for managing extreme weather-related disasters such as cyclones, floods and heat wave. Further, India Meteorological Department (IMD) has modernized its observation system by installing a network of doppler weather radars, automatic weather stations, automatic rain gauge stations, etc. for monitoring abnormal weather patterns. IMD has also upgraded its forecasting skills so that advance warning can be provided to concerned agencies to tackle the adverse impacts of extreme weather events.The Government is implementing National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which comprises of missions in specific areas of solar energy, energy efficiency, water, agriculture, Himalayan eco-system, sustainable habitat, green India and strategic knowledge on climate change. Most of these Missions, inter-alia, focus on climate change adaptation. Thirty two States/Union Territories have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) in lines with NAPCC taking into account State’s specific issues relating to climate change. These SAPCCs inter-alia outline sector specific and cross sectoral priority actions including adaptation. The Government is also implementing the scheme, “National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change” to support adaptation measures of States/UTs in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate Change.  	***
