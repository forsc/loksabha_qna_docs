The e-Migrate system, Pre-Departure Orientation Programme, MADAD portal, Indian Community Welfare Fund, Pravasi Bharatiya Sahayata Kendras Helplines at Indian Missions and Posts, Shelter Homes, etc. are some of the mechanisms to expeditiously assist Indian workers abroad. In addition, the Government signed Labour Employment and Cooperation agreements with major destination countries, including Gulf countries, and holds Joint Working Group meetings, to ensure redressal of grievances and protection of rights of Indian workers.During Covid-19 pandemic, the Government engaged counterparts at the Ministerial level to protect the interests of Indian workers, both in livelihood and health.

Further, they coordinated the repatriation of Indians stranded abroad under the VBM.
