Under the scheme, assistance is extended to sericulture stakeholders for the beneficiary oriented components like, raising of Kissan Nursery, Plantation with improved Mulberry varieties, Irrigation, chawki rearing centres with incubation facility, construction of rearing houses, rearing equipments, door to door service agents for disinfection and input supply, support for Improved reeling units like Automatic Reeling units, multiend Reeling machines, Improved Twisting machines and support for post yarn facilities for quality Silk and fabric production.North East Region Textile Promotion Scheme (NERTPS): Under this scheme, 38 Sericulture projects are being implemented in all North Eastern States in the identified potential districts under three broad categories viz., Integrated Sericulture Development Project (ISDP) and Intensive Bivoltine Sericulture Development Project (IBSDP) and Aspirational Districts.   Total cost of these projects is Rs. 1,107.90 crores, of which GoI share is Rs.956.01 crore.  Objective of these projects is to establish sericulture as viable commercial activity in North Eastern Region by creating necessary infrastructure and imparting skills to the locals for silkworm rearing and allied activities in the value chain. (e):	Silk Cocoons being an agricultural based commodity, a number of factor such as climate (rainfall, drought etc.), pest and disease incidences (which affect the production and quality of cocoon), demand for silk products, international prices of silk etc. affect the cocoon prices.  As marketing of cocoon and raw silk comes under the State subject as per concurrent list, few States provide price incentive to farmers for their cocoon produce (through regulated cocoon markets), whenever there is a fluctuation in cocoon prices.  The cocoons are being transacted in Cocoon Markets established and run by the State governments. The traditional silk producing States like Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal follows open auctions between farmers and the reelers as mode of disposal. The marketing of these commodities is purely done by the State. Whenever there is wide fluctuation/stress in the market prices of cocoons, few concerned State Government supports farmer by providing price incentives.  Further, in tasar silk sector, Central Silk Board operates floor price to stabilized cocoon price in the market through Raw Material Bank (RMB) to fetch remunerative price for farmers.(f):		For improving quality and productivity of domestic silk, Central Silk Board has taken following steps:-i.	A restructured Central Sector Scheme “Silk Samagra” is being implemented for development of sericulture in the country, which mainly focuses on improving quality and productivity of domestic silk thereby reducing the country’s dependence on imported silk. ii.	Under North East Region Textile Promotion Scheme, 38 Sericulture projects are being implemented in all North Eastern States in the identified potential districts under three broad categories viz., Integrated Sericulture Development Project (ISDP), Intensive Bivoltine Sericulture Development Project (IBSDP), Eri Spun Silk Mills and Aspirational Districts.iii.	To produce import substitute Bivoltine silk in the country, Research & Development has been focused to evolve productive bivoltine hybrids and package of practices for production.  iv.	Strengthening the Research & Development system to improve the levels of cocoon production and productivity to develop improved mulberry/ host plant verities, silkworm hybrids and technology packages. v.	Cold Storage facilities and Bivoltine grainages have been strengthened to produce, store and supply quality Bivoltine silkworm seed.vi.	For production of 3A-4A grade raw Silk from the bivoltine cocoons, Automatic Reeling Machines (ARM)/Units have been established in the country. vii.	Central Silk Board and State Governments mobilize additional funds for sericulture development through convergence by availing the schemes such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Gurantee Act (MGNREGA), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) etc., being implemented by various other Ministries of Govt. of India to create required infrastructure at stakeholder’s level.
