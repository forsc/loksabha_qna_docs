MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (c): The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has informed that to promote agriculture sector through Education, 63 State Agricultural Universities, 3 Central Agricultural Universities, 4 Deemed to be Universities and 4 Central Universities with agriculture faculty are working in the country.ICAR has also informed that in order to promote agricultural education and attract students in agricultural education, various National/International scholarships are provided to students at different levels.Further, the National Education Policy, 2020 envisions that both capacity and quality of agriculture and allied disciplines must be improved in order to increase agricultural productivity through better skilled graduates and technicians, innovative research, and market-based extension linked to technologies and practices. The preparation of professionals in agriculture and veterinary sciences through programmes integrated with general education will be increased sharply. The design of agricultural education will shift towards developing professionals with the ability to understand and use local knowledge, traditional knowledge, and emerging technologies while being cognizant of critical issues such as declining land productivity, climate change, food sufficiency for our growing population, etc.*****
