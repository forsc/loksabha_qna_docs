                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE ???? ??? ????? ?????? ?????? 	(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d) :  No State-wise/district-wise allocation and release is made under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY).  Being a Central Sector Scheme, funds towards committed liabilities of Government on account of premium subsidy are released to the Central nodal agency, which in turn transfers the funds to the concerned insurance companies.  Total claims of Rs. 2813.43 crore have been paid to 37.45 lakh famers till Kharif 2020.This Department is regularly monitoring the implementation of PMFBY including timely settlement of claims through weekly video conference of stakeholders; one to one meetings with insurance companies/States etc. However, settlement of claims sometimes gets delayed due to reasons like delayed transmission of yield data by States to insurance companies; late release of their share in premium subsidy by some States, yield related disputes between insurance companies and States, non-receipt of account details of some farmers for transfer of claims to the bank account of eligible farmers and National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) related issues, erroneous/incomplete entry of individual farmers data on National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP), delay in remittance of farmers share of premium/non-remittance of farmers share of premium to concerned insurance company etc.  Further, penalty provisions for late settlement of claims by insurance companies and late release of funds by State Governments have also been stipulated under the revised/revamped operational guidelines of the scheme.  Insurance companies have to pay penal interest @12% per annum to the farmers for the period beyond the stipulated period in the PMFBY Guidelines from the date of receipt of final yield data from the State Government and completion of crop damage survey.State Governments have been reminded from time to time regarding payment of State’s pending share in premium subsidy.    *****
