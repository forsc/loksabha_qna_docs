ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                                 (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a):   Since ‘Land’ and ‘Colonisation’ are State subjects, the data of the homeless people living in the slums in Indian cities are available with the concerned States/Union Territories (UTs). However, as per Census of India, 2011, the number of people living in the slums in Indian cities is 6,54,94,604. The State/Union Territory (UT)-wise details of population of people living in the slums are at Annexure-I. (b) to (d): ‘Land’ and ‘Colonisation’ being State subjects, it is the responsibility of the State/UT Governments to frame policies and implement schemes for providing housing. However, the Government of India through various programmatic interventions has been assisting States/UTs both technically and financially to address their housing shortage. In this regard, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has been implementing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Urban (PMAY-U) Mission since June 2015 to provide Central Assistance to States/UTs for providing all weather pucca houses to all eligible urban households including slum dwellers by the year 2022. ‘In-situ’ Slum Redevelopment (ISSR) component under PMAY-U Mission mandates to use land as a resource for providing houses to slum dwellers. This approach aims to leverage the locked potential of land under slums to provide houses to the eligible slum dwellers by bringing them into the formal urban settlement. The States/UTs have undertaken demand survey for assessing actual demand of housing under the PMAY-U Mission. The validated demand for the entire Mission period is around 112.24 lakh and so far, 103.62 lakh houses have been sanctioned against the target set of 97.22 lakh up to the year 2019-20. The target achieved in terms of houses sanctioned is well ahead of the target set under PMAY-U Mission. The year-wise details of target set by the Government and the target achieved during each of the last six years from 2014 to 2019 under PMAY-U Mission are at Annexure-II.                                *****
