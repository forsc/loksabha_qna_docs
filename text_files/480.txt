                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (c):	A statement is laid on the table of the House.***** Statement referred to in reply to Parts (a) to (c) of Lok Sabha Starred Question No. 53 due for answer on 25.06.2019(a) to (c):	Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is a one-time special intervention to provide rural connectivity, by way of a single all-weather road, to the eligible unconnected habitations in the core network with a population of 500 persons and above (Census 2001) in plain areas.  In respect of North Eastern States (i.e. Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura) and Hill States ( i.e. Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Uttarakhand), the Desert Areas (as identified in the Desert Development Programme), the Tribal (Schedule V) areas and Selected Tribal and Backward Districts (as identified by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the erstwhile Planning Commission), the objective is to connect eligible unconnected habitations with a population of 250 persons and above (Census 2001).  In the critical 267 Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected blocks (as identified by MHA), additional relaxation has been given to connect habitations with population 100 persons and above (2001 census).Further, the Government launched a new intervention in the scheme namely PMGSY-II in the year 2013-14 for consolidation of total 50,000 Km existing Rural Road Network to improve its overall efficiency as a provider of transportation services for people, goods and services.  The State of Uttar Pradesh has already been sanctioned its full entitlement under PMGSY-I and PMGSY-II.The information in respect of PMGSY roads are maintained Block-wise/District-wise and not Parliamentary Constituency-wise. Misrikh Parliamentary constituency comprises five Legislative Assembly segments viz.
