ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a):	The number of cases pending in various High Court and subordinate courts across the country, State/UT-wise is at Annexure –I and Annexure – II respectively. (b):	Against the sanctioned strength of 1098 Judges in High Courts, 694 Judges are working leaving 404 vacancies.  The sanctioned strength, working strength and vacancy position in respect of High Courts is at Annexure-III. (c):	As per procedure prescribed in the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), for appointment of Judges in the Higher Judiciary, prepared in pursuant to the Supreme Court Judgement of October 6, 1993 (Second Judges Case) read with their Advisory Opinion of October 28, 1998(Third Judges Case), the initiation of appointments of Judges of the High Court vests with the Chief Justice of the High Court. The Government considers only those names which are recommended by the High Court Collegium and the Supreme Court Collegium. Filling up of vacancies in the High Courts is a continuous, integrated and collaborative process between the Executive and the Judiciary. It requires consultation and approval from various constitutional authorities both at state and central level. While every effort is made to fill up the existing vacancies expeditiously, vacancies of Judges in High Courts do keep on arising on account of retirement, resignation or elevation of Judges and also due to increase in the strength of Judges.From 01.05.2014 to 14.12.2021, 44 Judges were appointed in Supreme Court. 690 new Judges were appointed and 583 Additional Judges were made permanent in the High Courts. 120 Judges have been appointed in High Courts during the period 01.01.2021 till date. 167 proposals are pending/under process with the Supreme Court Collegium and Government. There are 237 vacancies for which recommendations have not been received from High Courts.  During the period 01.01.2021 till date, 12 Judges have been appointed in the Kerala High Court and 03 proposals are at different stages of consideration.Under Article 235 of the Constitution of India, the administrative control over the members of district and subordinate judiciary in the States vest with the concerned High Court. Further, in exercise of powers conferred under proviso to Article 309 read with Articles 233 and 234 of the Constitution, the respective State Governments, in consultation with the High Court, frames the Rules and Regulations regarding the issue of appointment, promotion, reservations and retirement of Judicial Officers in the State Judicial Service.  Hence, in so far as recruitment of judicial officers in the States is concerned, respective High Courts do it in certain States, whereas the High Courts do it in consultation with the State Public Service Commissions in other States. The Union Government does not have a role under the Constitution in the selection and appointment of judicial officers in District/ subordinate judiciary. The Supreme Court, in its orders of 04th January, 2007 in Malik Mazhar case, has devised a process and time frame to be followed for the filling up of vacancies in subordinate judiciary which stipulates that the process for recruitment of judges in the subordinate courts would commence on 31st March of a calendar year and end by 31st October of the same year. The Supreme Court has permitted State Governments / High Courts for variations in the time schedule in case of any difficulty based on the peculiar geographical and climatic conditions in the State or other relevant conditions. 	Further, in compliance of the above directions of the Supreme Court, Department of Justice forwarded a copy of the Malik Mazhar judgement to Registrars General of all High Courts for necessary action. Department of Justice is writing from time to time to Registrars General of all High Courts to expedite the filling up of vacancies in subordinate judiciary mandated by Malik Mazhar case. In September, 2016, Union Minister of Law & Justice wrote to the Chief Ministers of States and the Chief Justices of High Courts to enhance the cadre strength of the District and Subordinate Courts and provide physical infrastructure to the State judiciary. The same was reiterated in May, 2017.  The sanctioned strength of judges in District and Subordinate Courts increased from 19,518 in the year 2014 to 24,485 as on 30.11.2021.  In August, 2018, in the context of increasing pendency of cases, the Union Minister of Law & Justice has written to all Chief Justices of High Courts to monitor the status of the vacancies regularly and to ensure proper coordination with the State Public Service Commission to fill up vacant posts as per time schedule prescribed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the Malik Mazhar Sultan case. The filling up of vacancies is also being monitored by the Supreme Court in a suo-motu Writ Petition (Civil) No. 2 of 2018.******** Annexure - ISTATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PART (A) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3348 FOR ANSWER ON 17.12.2021 REGARDING PENDING CASES IN HIGH COURTS AND SUBORDINATE COURTS.Sl.
