                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	 Based on the experience of past crop insurance schemes and with a view to include more risks under crop insurance and making it more affordable to the farmers etc., Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) and Restructured Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS) have been introduced for implementation in the country from Kharif 2016 season. The scheme is available for all cultivable areas including rural areas. However, the scheme is voluntary for the States. The concerned State Government notifies the areas and crops in their States under the Scheme. The State Government of Maharashtra is notifying all the districts having rural areas under the PMFBY/ RWBCIS.(c) & (d):	  As per provisions of the scheme State Government digitized the notification including villages/areas, crops, premium rates etc. on the National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP). Only those farmers, whose villages/areas are notified and accordingly digitized on portal, can enroll themselves on the crop insurance portal and were able to deposit their premium online on the portal. However, there is no provision under the scheme to provide assistance/grant to those farmers who did not insure themselves under the scheme due to non-notification of crops/villages and further non-digitisation of villages/crops on NCIP.********
