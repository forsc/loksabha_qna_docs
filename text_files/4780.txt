The monitoring data of CPCB are provided to this Ministry for assessment and taking projects of pollution abatement under National River Conservation Plan (NRCP).

Under NRCP, total 26 schemes have been sanctioned at a cost of Rs. 20.16 crores in 6 different towns of Madhya Pradesh State and Central funds amounting to Rs. 12.46 crores released to the State Government for implementation of pollution abatement works for rivers namely Tapi, Wainganga and Narmada. Sewage treatment capacity of 7.95 million litres per day has been created. ******
