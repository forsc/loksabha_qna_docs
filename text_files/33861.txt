Government has decided to advance the target of 20% ethanol blending in petrol from 2030 to 2025. Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) was launched on 1st October, 2018 aiming to establish an ecosystem for production of CBG from various waste/biomass sources in the country.  SATAT has envisaged developing 5000 CBG plants with total CBG production capacity of 15 Million Metric Tonne Per Annum (MMTPA) i.e. equivalent to 54 MMSCMD of gas by 2023-24        The Central Government reduced the Central Excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs. 5 and Rs. 10 per litre respectively effective from 4 November, 2021. The measure was aimed to give a further fillip to the economy and to boost consumption and keep inflation low, thus helping the poor and middle classes. Following this reduction in Central Excise duty, many States/UTs have also reduced the VAT on petrol and diesel. x-x-x-x-x
