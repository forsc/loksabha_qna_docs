Profitability/loss of the CPSE is not a relevant criteria.(c) The approved procedure and mechanism for strategic disinvestment of CPSEs allows investors to express interest in response to the Expression of Interest (EoI) documents.

The procedure stipulates confidentiality with regard to the identity of the bidders till completion of the procedure. *****
