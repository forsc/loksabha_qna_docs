He also provided photographs of two persons, which were later found to be of Chhota Rajan and Munna Bajrangi, to be printed on one sheet each of My Stamp. The proponent had given his Aadhaar Card as the proof of his identity. Hence, on production of photographs and the proof of identity of the proponent, the counter assistant prepared one My Stamp sheet each with the given two photographs.(c) & (d) 	Yes, Sir.
