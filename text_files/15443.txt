ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS [SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN] (a) 	According to available information, Maldives-China FTA,  that was signed in December 2017 has not been annulled so far.(b) & (c) 	India’s relations with other countries stand on their own footing and are independent of relations of those countries with third countries. In case of Maldives, our relations are guided by the “Neighbourhood First” policy of the Government of India. The Government of Maldives also follows an ‘India First’ policy. Over the past 15 months, the bilateral relationship between India and Maldives has seen a rapid strengthening across all dimensions. Regular high level exchanges including 4 meetings between PM Modi and President Solih have anchored this turnaround. The comprehensive development assistance package announced during the visit of President Solih to India in December 2018 has been fully activated. More than 18 MoUs signed during this period are at various stages of implementation. In addition, a number of infrastructure and capacity building programs are being implemented by Government of India. India is committed to further deepening of this bilateral relationship. ***
