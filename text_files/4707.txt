ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) FOR NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND POWER AND MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP (SHRI R. K. SINGH)(a) to (f)  As per a study conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai in association with CRISIL Risk and Infrastructure Solutions Limited in December 2014, the tidal power potential of the country is estimated at around 12,455 MW. The potential areas with low/medium tidal wave strength are in the Gulf of Khambat, Gulf of Kutch & southern regions in Gujarat, Palk Bay-Mannar Channel in Tamil Nadu, and Hoogly river, South Haldia & Sunderbans in West Bengal. The earlier efforts for harnessing tidal power were not successful due to high capital cost ranging from Rs. 30 crore to Rs. 60 crore per MW. At present, due to very high capital cost, the Government of India has not formulated any policy for production of electricity from tidal energy.*****
