Pilot projects of these on few selected sections (1839 Route km) have also been undertaken.  Once successful, these shall be adopted on large scale on Indian Railways. (d) and (e)	In addition to Keyman’s daily patrol, Ultrasonic Flaw Detection (USFD) technology is being extensively used in Indian Railways to detect flaw in service rails, welds and take remedial steps accordingly.Similar technologies are used in other countries for detection and identification of flaws in rails. *****
