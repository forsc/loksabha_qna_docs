                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE????????????????????????		(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (d): Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) is a demand driven scheme.  Further, the scheme is voluntary for the States/UTs as well as the farmers.  Therefore, keeping in view the utilisation of funds during 2021-22, funds are made available during 2022-23. Further additional funds can be allocated as per requirement.	The Per Drop Per more Crop (PDMC) is being implemented as a component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMSKSY).  It has been decided to continue the PDMC scheme under Annual Action Plan component of Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana – Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied Sectors Rejuvenation (RKVY – RAFTAAR) from the year 2022-23.  A budget provision of Rs. 4079.55 crore has been made for PDMC scheme under the Annual Action Plan (Cafeteria component of RKVY-RAFTAAR.	However, any change in allocation under these schemes will not hinder the target achievement as more funds, if required are being provided at Revised Estimatesstage.*****
