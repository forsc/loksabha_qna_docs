                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):	8 beaches in India have got Blue Flag Certificate in October 2020.The details are as follows:Sr. No.	Name of the Beach	Name of the State/UT1	Shivrajpur	Gujarat2	Ghoghla	Diu, (Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu)3	Kasarkod	Karnataka4	Padubidri	Karnataka5	Kappad	Kerala6	Rushikonda	Andhra Pradesh7	Golden	Odisha8	Radhanagar	Andaman & Nicobar Islands(b):	Pollution of beaches and waterways is one of the concerns of tourists visiting beaches. Beaches particularly adjacent to river mouths, municipality run off creeks, close to urban settlement/industries exhibit relatively higher pollution. A study by National Center for Coastal Research (NCCR), Ministry of Earth sciences (MoES), on qualitative analysis of litter in different beaches along the east and west coast of India finds that the plastic litter from tourism varies from 40% at Elliot’s Beach, Chennai to 96% at Gopalpur Beach, Odisha.(c) to (e): MoEFCC has notified Solid Waste Management (SWM) Rules, 2016 and Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016 as measures for prevention, control and environment friendly management of waste. MoEFCC has provided assistance in development of environment friendly infrastructure and support systems at 10 beaches namely; Ghoghla (Diu), Shivrajpur (Gujarat), Kasarkod & Padubidri (Karnataka), Kappad (Kerala) Kovalam (Tamil Nadu), Eden (Puducherry), Rushikonda (Andhra Pradesh), Golden (Odisha) and Radhanagar (Andaman & Nicobar Island).These beaches are notified zones for "No Plastic", "No Dumping", "No Driving" and promotes “ZERO WASTE" "ZERO POLLUTION" concept. MoEFCC had organized a nationwide campaign #IAMSAVINGMYBEACH for creating awareness on beach cleaning and aesthetic management.  In addition to this, Ministry organised a week-long intensive beach cleaning-cum awareness drive named as “Swachh-Nirmal Tat Abhiyan” from 11th to 17th November 2019 at 50 beaches in 10 Coastal states/UTs.There is no competition for ranking of beaches in the world. ***
