The list of Universities/Institutions selected for funding of Departments of Sports Science are as follows:i)	Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, Punjabii)	National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, Telanganaiii)	Annamalai University, Chidambaram, Tamil Naduiv)	Central University of Rajasthan, Ajmer, Rajasthanv)	University of Calcutta, Kolkata, West Bengalvi)	Rajiv Gandhi University, Doimukh, Arunachal PradeshThe list of Medical Colleges selected of Departments of Sports Medicine are as follows:i)	King George Medical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradeshii)	Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak, Haryanaiii)	Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, Bengaluru, Karnatakaiv)	Regional Institute of Medical Sciences, Imphal, Manipurv)	Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh(b)	The Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) is a flagship athlete-centric programme of the Ministry for providing assistance to India’s top athletes in their preparations for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Under TOPS Core Group athletes are identified from various sports disciplines who have the potential of winning an Olympics/Paralympics medal. To be considered for selection under TOPS, an athlete must fall under one of the following three categories: •	Medal Hope - Athletes deemed medal probable for Olympic or Paralympic Games.•	Potential Finalist - Athletes deemed probable for reaching finals of their Olympic events, where medals are deemed an unrealistic target presently.•	Others - Athletes who can achieve India’s best result in the discipline, considering last three editions of the Olympic or Paralympic Games. Apart from the above, the methodology used to determine the above is sports specific and data-driven with due consideration of relevant subjective factors. This broadly covers the following: i)	Current performance;ii)	Past performance;iii)	Performance in comparison to Global performance trends;iv)	Current age in comparison to High performance age;v)	Global competitors’ analysis;vi)	Performance progression rate;vii)	World Rankings & National Ranking.Further, all the newly inducted TOPS Core and Development Group Athletes have to undergo Pre-Induction/Participation Screening Tests and Sports Specific Scientific Tests. The tests vary with each sports discipline and the purpose of undergoing the same is to provide data to athletes, coaches and support staff to manage their training schedule, requirements from the health perspective and injury prevention. Proper intervention based on test results allows the athletes to adjust their focus leading to enhanced performance.***
