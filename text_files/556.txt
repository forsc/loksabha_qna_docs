ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	 The price of agricultural produce is dependent on variety of factors at any given point of time like demand and supply of the produce, climatic conditions, perishable nature of produce and availability of transport.  The quality parameters also play an important role in the price of a commodity and procurement under Minimum Support Price (MSP) is subject to certain quality parameters. (c):	      Under the present procurement mechanism, Government agencies procure the notified agricultural produce of Fair Average Quality (FAQ) at Minimum Support Price (MSP) from farmers in consultation with the concerned State Government, as per prescribed guidelines.  However, if farmers get better price in comparison to MSP, they are free to sell their produce in open market. The Government has increased the Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for all notified Kharif & Rabi Crops and other commercial crops for the season 2018-19 with a return of at least 50 percent over cost of production. To ensure remunerative prices to farmers for their produce, the Government of India has launched an umbrella scheme ‘Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA)’.  Under PM-AASHA, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW),    Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, implements the Price Support Scheme Contd…2/--2-(PSS) for procurement of pulses, oilseeds and copra. For oilseeds, DAC&FW also implements Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS).  However, States/UTs have options to choose either PSS or PDPS in a given procurement season with respect to a particular oilseed crop for the entire State. Besides, DAC&FW also implements Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme (PPSS) for oilseeds on pilot basis and States have the option for implementation of PPSS in district/selected APMCs of the district involving the participation of private stockiest. Further, under PM-AASHA, procurement of paddy, wheat and coarse grains are done by Department of Food & Public Distribution through Food Corporation of India (FCI). Further, Cotton and Jute are procured by the Ministry of Textiles through Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) and Jute Corporation of India (JCI) respectively as per extant guidelines. ********
