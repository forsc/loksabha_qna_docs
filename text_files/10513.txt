ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) and (b): There are 43 unserved and underserved RCS Airports awarded to Selected Airline Operators (SAOs) under the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) where RCS operations have commenced. State-wise details of such RCS Airports including Karnataka is attached as Annexure A. RCS - UDAN is market driven scheme. The interested airlines based on their assessment of demand on particular routes submit their proposals at the time of bidding under RCS - UDAN. List of routes  awarded under UDAN connecting the State of Karnataka is at Annexure-B.;(c): After repeal of the Air Corporation Act in March 1994, the Indian domestic aviation market has been deregulated. Consequently as a result, airlines are free to induct capacity with any aircraft type for selecting whatever markets and network they wish to service and operate across the country subject to compliance with the Route Dispersal Guidelines (RDG). Thus, it is up to the airlines to provide air services to specific places depending upon the traffic demand and their commercial viability, in compliance with the RDG.
