KISHAN REDDY)(a)	A comparison of crime rate (Crime Rate=Number of cases reported/Mid-Year projected population in lakhs) of various crime heads on crimes against women in the last three years shows no uniform trend. However, the Ministry has taken several steps to spread awareness amongst the citizens, sensitization of police officers at various levels, issuance of advisories for compulsory registration of FIRs and penal provisions for non-registration of FIRs etc. This has improved reporting of crimes against women. --2--L.S.US.Q.

(c)	As per available information, Ministry of Women and Child Development is undertaking Mahila Shakti Kendra Scheme. This scheme was approved in November, 2017 as a centrally sponsored scheme to empower rural women through community participation.
