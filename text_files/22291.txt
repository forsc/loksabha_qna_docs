ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) to (d): ‘Police’ and ‘Public Order’ are State subjects under the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The responsibility to maintain law and order, protection of life of citizens, including investigation and prosecution of crime against children, rests with respective State Governments, who are competent to deal with such offences under the extant provisions of laws. National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) compiles crime statistics reported to it by States and Union Territories (UTs) and publishes the same in its annual publication ‘Crime in India’. The latest published report is of the year 2019. Specific data in respect of business of selling of minors by kidnapping them is not maintained centrally. However, data on the number of children trafficked as reported by States and UTs shows no uniform trend. Data in respect of selling of minors for prostitution shows a declining trend. -2-L.S.US.Q NO. 3350 FOR 16.03.2021The Government of India attaches high importance in addressing crime against children and has been supplementing the efforts of State Governments by way of providing them financial assistance to establish and strengthen the infrastructure in combating crime at various levels in the States as well as by providing them regular guidance and advice through various advisories, guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) issued from time to time. A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for tracing missing children, prepared by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, has been circulated to all States and UTs for dissemination to all stakeholders such as Police, Child Welfare Committees (CWCs), Juvenile Justice Boards (JJBs) etc. This SOP lays down uniform guidelines for expediting the search and rehabilitation of a missing child all over the country.For providing outreach services to missing children and needy children, the Ministry of Women and Child Development operates Child Helpline No. 1098, which is operational 24/7. Apart from this, Railway Childlines at major railway platforms are also being operated to provide assistance to any needy child. The Ministry of Women and Child Development has also developed a national tracking system for missing and vulnerable children namely TrackChild portal, which has been implemented across the country. It also launched the ‘Khoya-Paya’ portal in 2015, which is an enabling platform, where citizens can report missing children as well as sightings of their whereabouts without losing much time.-3-L.S.US.Q NO. 3350 FOR 16.03.2021Further, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has recently released Rs. 100 crore from Nirbhaya Fund for strengthening/ setting up Anti Human Trafficking Units in all districts of the country for preventing and combating the trafficking in persons, including women and children. MHA also issues regular guidelines and advisories to the States and UTs with the advice to evolve a coordination mechanism among various departments of States and UTs.  States have also been advised to hold awareness campaigns at all levels in the State as this will help in identification, tracing and recovery of missing and trafficked victims.  ******
