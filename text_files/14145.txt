                                                        ???????? ??? ?????? ?????? (???? ????? ????) THE MINISTER OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI  PIYUSH GOYAL)(a): 	Setting up of industries is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments and Union Territories. Central Government does not have independent policy regarding setting up of new industries in the country. All matters relating to revival / restructuring / disinvestment including closure of sick CPSEs and restarting of closed CPSEs / units of CPSEs or to making them profitable are dealt by their administrative     Ministries / Departments. Furthermore, the Reserve bank of India has issued a ‘Framework for Revival and Rehabilitation of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Under this Framework, banks have been advised to identify incipient stress in the MSME accounts and refer it to the Committees formed under the Framework for suitable Corrective Action Plan viz. rectification, restructuring and recovery.(b) & (c): 	Orient Paper Mills, Brajrajnagar had requested for concessions and waiver of demands of the old disputed issues and to provide law and order protection to enable cleaning up of the site to facilitate proper assessment and submission of a concrete proposal for revival. There is no provision for rehabilitation of sick industries in the State of Odisha. The production activity of Bhaskar Textile Mills, Jharsuguda has been ceased w.e.f May, 1998. Liquidation process of the mill is under adjudication in the Company Court of Hon’ble High Court of Orissa.The Spinning Mill at Bargarh i.e. Orissa Weavers Cooperative Spinning Mills Ltd., is under the privatization process. The properties of the unit is seized/ attached by different Financial Institutions and Statutory authorities.********
