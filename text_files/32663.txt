ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (d)  Representations, including that from the   Hon’ble Member of Parliament, for extension of 12655/12656 Ahmedabad-Chennai Navjeevan Express upto Rajkot have been received. These requests have been examined but not found feasible due to operational constraints including inadequate lie-over at Ahmedabad.  The existing lie-over period of the train is 03 hrs 35 minutes which is insufficient for extension of the train upto Rajkot.  However, Ahmedabad-Rajkot sector is, presently being well served by 34 pairs trains.  Besides, extension of train services is an on-going process on Indian Railways subject to operational feasibility and commercial justification.*****
