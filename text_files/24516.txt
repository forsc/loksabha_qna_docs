ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????   (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b) :  The Government constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee in April, 2016 to examine issues relating to “Doubling of Farmers Income” and recommend strategies to achieve the same.   It submitted its final Report to the Government in September, 2018 containing the strategy for doubling of farmers’ income by the year 2022. After acceptance of the DFI Committee recommendations, the Government has constituted an ‘Empowered Body’ to review and monitor the progress. The DFI strategy, as recommended  by Niti Aayog, include  seven sources of income growth viz., (I) improvement in crop productivity; (II) improvement in livestock productivity; (III) resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; (IV) increase in the cropping intensity;(V) diversification towards high value crops; (VI) improvement in real prices received by farmers; and (VII) shift from farm to non-farm occupations. Agriculture being a State subject, the State Governments undertake implementation of programs/schemes for the development of the sector. Government of India supplements the efforts of the State Governments through various schemes/ programs. These schemes/ programs of the Government of India are meant for the welfare of farmers by increasing production, remunerative returns and income support to farmers. A list of initiatives taken by the Government are at Annexure-I. (c): 	The New Farm laws viz, “The Farmers'' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020”,  “The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement On Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020” and “The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020,  are intended to provide an ecosystem where the farmers can enjoy the freedom of choice relating to sale of farmers'' produce which facilitates remunerative prices to farmers through competitive alternative channels for selling their produce. Farm laws provide additional marketing opportunities outside the APMC market yards such as farm-gates, cold storages, warehouse, silos, etc. to help farmers get better remunerative prices due to additional competition.“The Farmers'' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020” is intended to promote competition and transparency in trade by way of facilitation of trade in trade area for facilitating remunerative prices to farmers. The Farming agreement i.e “The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement On Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020” will enable scaling of investment by industry for production and processing of high value agriculture produces and give fillip to exports.  The framework will also mitigate the risks for the farmers, enhance their income and will put in place an effective and conducive policy regime for agreements. “The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020”, encourages investment in supply chain and marketing infrastructure including that in storage facilities to create rural employment.  Further, the new Pesticide Management Bill, 2020 was introduced in the Rajya Sabha for expanding the holistic administration and management of pesticides. (d) : The steps taken by the Government for improvement in employment opportunities is at Annexure II.
