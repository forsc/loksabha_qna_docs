(b) & (c): The job cards of those who seek employment on that basis, are counted among active job cards. Separate active job cards are not issued.  In an active job card for a household, there can be more than one active worker because of which, the number of active workers can be more than the number of active job cards. The details of active job cards and active workers under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA in the financial years 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 is given below: Financial Year (FY)	                 2019-20	  2020-21	     2021-22Number of active job cards (in Crore)	   8.12	           9.45	              9.81Number of active workers (in Crore)	  15.03	          15.11	             15.11  (d) & (e): Fund release to States/UTs is a continuous process and Central Government is committed in making funds available keeping in view the demand for work. The Ministry seeks additional funds as and when required for meeting the demand for work on the ground.  If the proposal for 2nd Tranche is submitted after 1st October, then the Audit Report and Audited Utilization Certificate (UC) of the previous financial year is also required to be submitted. The funds can only be released after receipt of Audited UC and Audit report of previous financial year. Some of the States are delaying the submission of Audit reports and other required documents for funds release resulting in overall delay of fund release.As per the provision of the Act, the beneficiaries are entitled to get wage payment within 15 days of closure of Muster Roll of the work. Government of India has also issued a detailed SOP to the State to ensure timely wage payment. **********
