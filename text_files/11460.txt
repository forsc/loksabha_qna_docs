                                                        A N S W E R MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) & (b): The Department in association with all States/UTs is implementing a scheme on ‘End-to-End Computerization of Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) Operations’ including automation of Fair Price Shops (FPSs) to bring transparency and efficiency in the allocation and distribution of highly subsidised foodgrains to beneficiaries covered under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA). So far, nearly 88% FPSs in the country have been automated by installing ePoS devices at FPSs. A statement showing State/UT wise total number of FPSs is annexed.............2/--2-	As regard financial assistance to States/UTs, ‘The Food Security (Assistance to State Governments) Rules 2015’ under NFSA provides for reimbursement of an additional dealer margin to States/UTs at the rate of Rs.17 per quintal of foodgrains distributed through the ePoS devices, to meet up the expenditure incurred towards the purchasing cost, operational/ running/ maintenance expenses of ePoS devices and incentives for their use. Such expenditure would be shared between Centre and State/UT Governments on 75:25 basis for 23 Special Category States/UTs and on 50:50 basis for 13 General Category States/UTs. So far, this Department has released a total of about Rs. 100 Crore to concerned States under NFSA during the current financial year.(c): 	To sustain the reforms brought in by the scheme on ‘End-to-End Computerization of TPDS Operations’ and to introduce new reforms, the Department in association with States/UTs is implementing another scheme namely “Integrated Management of Public Distribution System (IM-PDS)” w.e.f. April 2018 with a total outlay of Rs. 127 Crore. The main objective of the scheme is to introduce nation-wide portability of ration card holders under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), through ''One Nation One Ration Card'' system. This system enables the migratory ration card holders/beneficiaries to lift their entitled foodgrains from any Fair Price Shop (FPS) of their choice in the country by using their existing/same ration card issued in their home State/UT after biometric/Aadhaar authentication on electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices installed at the FPSs. So far this facility is available in 12 States.**** AnnexureANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) & (b) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.300 DUE FOR ANSWER ON 04.02.2020 IN THE LOK SABHA.Status of End-to-End Computerization of PDS Operations Scheme as on 14.01.2020Sl.
