ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI (SHRI BISHWESWAR TUDU)(a) & (b)  Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in association with the State Pollution Control Boards/Committees in different States/Union Territories (UTs) have been monitoring the water quality of rivers and other water bodies through a network of  monitoring stations under the National Water Quality Monitoring Programme. Based on water quality monitoring results, pollution assessment of rivers has been carried out by CPCB from time to time. As per the last report published by CPCB in September 2018, 351 polluted stretches were identified on 323 rivers based on monitoring results in terms of Bio-chemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), an indicator of organic pollution. State-wise details of polluted river stretches are given at Annexure-I. (c) to (e)   Cleaning/rejuvenation of rivers is an ongoing activity. It is the responsibility of the States/UTs, Local Bodies and industrial units to ensure required treatment of sewage and industrial effluents to the prescribed norms before discharging into river and other water bodies, coastal waters or land to prevent and control of pollution therein. For conservation of rivers, this Ministry has been supplementing efforts of the States/UTs by providing financial and technical assistance for abatement of pollution in identified stretches of rivers in the country through the Central Sector Scheme of NamamiGange for rivers in Ganga basin and the Centrally Sponsored Scheme of National River Conservation Plan (NRCP) for other rivers. Contd...P/2//2//Proposals for pollution abatement works in the towns along polluted river stretches are received from the States/UTs from time to time for consideration under NRCP and sanctioned based on their prioritization, conformity with NRCP guidelines, availability of plan funds, etc. NRCP has so far covered polluted stretches on 34 rivers in 77 towns spread over 16 States in the country with the project sanctioned cost of Rs.5961.75 crore, and inter-alia, a sewage treatment capacity of 2677 mld has been created. Under Namami Gange programme, a total of 353 projects, including 157 projects for sewage treatment of 4952 mld and sewer network of 5212 kms., have been sanctioned at a cost of Rs.30458 crore.  State/UT-wise details of rivers covered under NRCP, Namami Gange and Ganga Action Plan (GAP) are given at Annexure-II. In addition, sewerage infrastructure is created under programs like Atal Mission for Rejuvenation & Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and Smart Cities Mission of Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs.  	As per the Provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution), Act 1974, industrial units are required to install effluent treatment plants (ETPs) and treat their effluents to comply with stipulated environmental standards before discharging into river and water bodies. Accordingly, CPCB, State Pollution Control Boards/Pollution Control Committees monitor industries with respect to effluent discharge standards and take action for non-compliance under provisions of these Acts.Besides, in compliance of the orders of National Green Tribunal (NGT) in Original Application No.673/2018 regarding rejuvenation of polluted river stretches in the country, States/UTs are required to implement approved action plans for restoration of the polluted stretches in their jurisdiction as identified by CPCB and published in their report of 2018, within the stipulated timelines. As per the orders of NGT, regular review on implementation of action plans is undertaken in the States/UTs and also at Central level.  *****  ANNEXURE- IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) & (b) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3125 TO BE ANSWERED ON THE 16.12.2021 REGARDING ‘STUDY OF POLLUTION IN RIVERS’.State / UTs Wise Polluted River StretchesS.No.	Name Of State	Name Of Polluted River Stretches	Number1	Andhra Pradesh	Kundu, Tungabhadra, Godavari, Krishna, Nagavali	52	Assam	Bharalu, Borsola, Deepar Bill, Digboi, Kamalpur, PanchnaiBrahamputra, Kharsang, Pagldia, Barak, Baroi Bega, Beki, Bhogdoi, Boginadi, Borbeel, BordoibamBeelmukh, Burhidihing, Dhansiri, Dikhow, Dikrong, Diplai, Disang, Gabharu, Holudunga, Jai Bharali, Jhanji, Kalong, Kapili, Killing, Kohora, Kulsi, Malini, Mora Bharali, Parashali, Puthimari, Ranga, Samaguri, Sankosh, Silsako, Sorusola, Son, Sonai, TengaPukhuri	443	Bihar	Sirsia, Farmar, Ganga, Poonpun, Ram Rekha, Sikrahna	64	Chhattisgarh	Hasdeo, Kharoon, Mahanadi, Seonath, Kelo	55	Daman, Diu and Dadra Nagar Haveli	Damanganga	16	Delhi	Yamuna,	17	Goa	Sal, Mandovi, Talpona, Assonora, Bicholim, Chapora, Khandepar, Sinquerim, Tiracol, Valvant, Zuari	118	Gujarat	Amlakhadi, Bhadar, Bhogavo, Khari, Sabarmati, Vishwamitri, Dhadar, Triveni, Amravati (Tributary Of Narmada), Damanganga, Kolak, Mahi, Shedhi, Tapi, Anas, BalehwarKhadi, Kim, Meshwa, Mindhola, Narmada	209	Haryana	Ghaggar, Yamuna	210	Himachal Pradesh	Sukhana, Markanda, Sirsa, Ashwani, Beas, Giri, Pabbar	711	Jammu & Kashmir	Devika, Banganga, ChuntKol, Gawkadal, Tawi, Basanter, Chenab, Jhelam, Sindh	912	Jharkhand	Garga, Sankh, Subarnarekha, Damodar, Jumar, Konar, Nalkari	713	Karnataka	Arkavathi, Lakshmantirtha, Malprbha, Tungabhadra, Bhadra, Cauvery, Kabini, Kagina, Kali, Krishna, Shimsha, AsangiNalla, Bhima, Kumardhara, Netravathi, Tunga, Yagachi	1714	Kerala	Karamana, Bharathapuzha, Kadambayar, Keecheri, Manimala, Pamba, Bhavani, Chitrapuzha, Kadalundy, Kallai, Karuvannur, Kavvai, Kuppam, Kuttiyady, Mogral, Periyar, Peruvamba, Puzhackal, Ramapuram, Thirur, Uppala	21   15	Madhya Pradesh	Chambal, Khan, Kshipra, Betwa, Sone, Gohad, Kolar, Tapi, Bichia, Chamla, Choupan, Kalisot, Kanhan, Katni, Kunda, Malei, Mandakini (Mp), Newaj, Parvati, Simrar, Tons, Wainganga	2216	Maharashtra	Godavari, Kalu, Kundalika, Mithi, Morna, Mula, Mutha, Nira, Vel, Bhima, Indrayani, Mula-Mutha, Pawana, Wainganga, Wardha, Ghod, Kanhan, Kolar (Mah), Krishna, Mor, Patalganga, Pedhi, Penganga, Purna, Tapi, Urmodi, Venna, Waghur, Wena, Bindusar, Bori, Chandrabhaga, Darna, Girna, Hiwara, Koyna, Pehlar, Sina, Titur, Amba, Bhatsa, Gomai, Kan, Manjeera, Panchganga, Panzara, Rangavali, Savitri, Surya, Tansa, Ulhas, Vaitarna, Vashisti	5317	Manipur	Nambul, Imphal, Iril, Khuga, Khujairok, Lokchao, Manipur, Thoubal, Wangjing	918	Meghalaya	Umkhrah, Umshyrpi, Kyrhukhla, Nonbah, Umtrew, Lukha, Myntdu	719	Mizoram	Tiau, Tlawng, Tuipui, Tuivawl, Chite, Mat, Saikah, Tuikual, Tuirial	920	Nagaland	Dhansiri, Dzuna, Chathe, Dzu, Dzucha, Sano	621	Odisha	Gangua, GuradihNallah, Kathajodi, Nandirajhor, Daya, Kuakhai, BanguruNallah, Bheden, Brahamani, Budhabalnaga, Kusumi, Mahanadi, Mangala, Nagavalli, Nuna, Ratnachira, Rushikulya, Sabulia, Serua	1922	Puducherry	Arasalar, Chunnambar	223	Punjab	Ghaggar, Satluj, Kali Bein, Beas	424	Rajasthan	Banas, Chambal,	225	Sikkim	ManeyKhola, Rangit, Ranichu, Teesta	426	Tamil Nadu	Cauvery, Sarabanga, ThirumanimUthar, Vasista, Bhavani, Tambirapani	627	Telangana	Musi, Manjeera, Nakkavagu, Karakavagu, Maner, Godavari, Kinnersani, Krishna	828	Tripura	Burigaon, Gumti, Haora, Juri, Khowai, Manu	629	Uttar Pradesh	Hindon, Kalinadi, Varuna, Yamuna, Gomti, Ganga, Ramganga, Betwa, Ghaghara, Rapti, Sai, Saryu	1230	Uttarakhand	Bhela, Dhela, Suswa, Kichha, Kalyani, Ganga, Kosi, Nandour, Pilkhar	931	West Bengal	Vindhadhari, Mahananda, Churni, Dwarka, Ganga, Damodar, Jalangi, Kansi, Mathabhanga, Barakar, Dwarakeshwar, Kaljani, Karola, Mayurkashi, Rupnarayan, Silabati, Teesta	17Grand Total :	351   ANNEXURE- IIANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (c) & (e) OF LOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3125 TO BE ANSWERED ON THE 16.12.2021 REGARDING ‘STUDY OF POLLUTION IN RIVERS’.
