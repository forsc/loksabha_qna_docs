ANSWER




                                                        (a)to (e):	Ministry of Tribal Affairs has not launched any specific training programme for Scheduled Tribes. However, the Ministry is implementing Van Dhan Vikas Karyakram with a view to target livelihood generation for tribals by harnessing the wealth of forest i.e. Van Dhan. The programme aims to tap traditional knowledge and skill sets of tribals by adding technology & IT to upgrade it at each stage and to convert the tribal wisdom into a viable economic activity to  help them becoming self reliant and entrepreneurs. Under this Karyakram, tribal community owned Minor Forest Produce (MFP) centric multi-purpose Kendras are set-up in tribal dominated districts. The Kendras act as common facility centres for procurement and value addition to locally available Minor Forest Produce. Value addition of raw produce results in enhancing the value of the MFP and consequently the income of the gatherers. Van Dhan Vikas Karyakram is primarily the training and development of value chain. The cumulative status of establishment of VDVKs including the state-wise funds sanctioned for the same is at Annexure 1.The Ministry of Tribal Affairs revised Minimum Support Price (MSP) for Minor Forest Produce (MFP) guidelines on May 1 2020 thereby increased the MSP of 48 MFPs and subsequently 37 new items were included in the list of MFPs thereby making the total number of MFPs under the scheme to 87 to protect the tribes from exploitation and make them self-reliant. Details of items for which MSP has been declared is at Annexure 2.Under the scheme of Institutional Support for marketing of Tribal Products/Produce, TRIFED procures goods produced by tribals and markets the same through its network of retails outlets ‘TRIBES INDIA’ and other online platforms like GeM, Amazon etc. The year wise procurement made by TRIFED in the last three years under the scheme is given below:Year	Purchase (in lakhs)2017-18	1631.692018-19	3842.122019-20	5094.65Besides, through the scheme of ‘Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS)’ and Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution financial assistance is provided in the form of an additive to State Governments based on their proposal for various tribal development initiatives, including Skill Development / Vocational Training activities to make them self-reliant and entrepreneurs. The selection of the interns is done by the State Governments. The details of the funds allocated for Skill Development/ Vocational Training activities in these programmes during last three years and current year is as tabulated below:(Rs. in lakh)Name of Scheme / Programme	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21(as on 03.02.2021)Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS)	13921.10	12265.20	6888.65	7113.78Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution	1719.83	5642.46	1571.04	798.17Annexure 1Annexure 1 referred in reply to part (a) to (e) of Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No.2272 for 08.03.2021 regarding “Training Programme to Tribal Population”Status of establishment of VDVKs till date (Cumulative since 2018-19)Sl.
