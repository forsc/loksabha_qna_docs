ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	The main salient features of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) are given as under: -i.	Adult members of a rural household, willing to do unskilled manual work, may apply for registration in writing or orally to the local Gram Panchayat.ii.	The Gram Panchayat after due verification will issue a Job Card free of cost within 15 days.iii.	The worker has a right to demand and receive work within 15 days of the receipt of the application or the date of the demand in case of advance application, whichever is later, as mandated by the Act.iv.	In case employment is not provided within fifteen days from the date of registration of the demand for work or the date from which work has been demanded in case of advance applications, whichever is later, the worker is legally entitled to a daily unemployment allowance.v.	Preparation of Labour Budget (LB) is an essential annual work plan document that entails planning, approval, funding and project execution modalities.vi.	The shelf of projects for a village will be recommended by the gram sabha and approved by the zilla panchayat. At least 50% of works will be allotted to Gram Panchayats for execution.vii.	Permissible works predominantly include water and soil conservation, afforestation and land development works.viii.	A 60:40 wage and material ratio has to be maintained at the district level. No contractors and labour displacing machinery is allowed.ix.	The Central Government bears 100 percent wage cost of unskilled manual labour and 75 percent of the material cost including the wages of skilled and semi-skilled workers.x.	Social Audit has to be done by the Gram Sabha.xi.	Grievance redressal mechanisms have to be put in place for ensuring a responsive implementation process.xii.	All accounts and records relating to the Scheme should be available for public scrutiny.(b):	Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (MGNREGA) is a demand driven wage employment programme. Hence, no State/UT- wise allocation of fund is made. Fund release to States/UTs is a continuous process and Central Government is committed in making funds available keeping in view the demand for work. States/UT-wise details of central fund released and expenditure reported by State Governments in Management Information System (MIS) including Tamil Nadu under the MGNREGA during the last three years and current financial year 2019-20 (as on 19.07.2019) are given at Annexure-I.(c):	The Act covers all rural areas of the country. The details are as under:  States/UTs	                                   34Total number of districts	                  691Total number of blocks	                        6,921Total number of Gram Panchayats	             2,62,652As per the information shared by Tamil Nadu, all village Panchayats except Balamore village Panchayat in Kanniyakumari district are covered under this Scheme.(d) & (e):	No, Sir. MGNREGS is implemented in rural areas of the country. No caste based instruction is made under the Scheme.(f):	No, Sir.(g) & (h):	The Ministry along with the States/UTs has been making concerted efforts for improving the timely payment of wages. States/UTs have been advised to generate pay orders in time. This has resulted in considerable improvement in the status of timely generation of pay order and leading to improvement in actual time taken to credit wages in the workers account. During the current financial Year 2019-20 (as on 19.07.2019), 98% pay orders have been generated within the stipulated 15 days. The delay in payment of wages are due to implementation issues in the States which include inadequate staffing, non-timely recording and reporting of attendance, measurement, data entry, generation of wage list, Fund Transfer Order (FTO), etc.*****
