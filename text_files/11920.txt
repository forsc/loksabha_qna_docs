ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)  Ground water levels in various parts of the Country are declining because of continuous withdrawal due to reasons such as increased demand of fresh water for various uses, vagaries of rainfall, increased population, industrialization & urbanization etc.The Dynamic Ground Water Resources of the country are being periodically assessed jointly by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) and State Governments. As per the 2017 assessment, out of the total 6881 assessment units (Block/ Taluks/ Mandals/ watersheds/ Firkas) in the country, 1186 units have been categorized as ''Over-exploited'' where the Annual Ground Water Extraction is more than Annual Extractable Ground Water Resource. State-wise details in this regard are given in Annexure-I.(b) & (c)  Government of India launched Jal Shakti Abhiyan (JSA), a time bound campaign with a mission mode approach intended to improve water availability including ground water conditions in the water stressed blocks of 256 districts in India. In this regard, teams of officers from Central Government along-with technical officers from Ministry of Jal Shakti were deputed to visit water stressed districts and to work in close collaboration with district level officials to undertake suitable interventions. Further, JSA led to huge awareness generation among stake- holders/people. Water being a State subject, initiatives on water management including conservation and water harvesting/awareness generation etc in the Country is primarily States’ responsibility. Other important measures including framework for sustainable ground water resources management in the country are at the following URL: http://mowr.gov.in/sites/default/files/Steps to control water depletion Jun2019 .pdf.  ***** ANNEXUREAnnexure referred to in reply to parts (a) to (c) of Unstarred Question No. 871 to be answered in Lok Sabha on 06.02.2020 regarding “Over-Exploited of Groundwater”.State-wise Categorization of Over-Exploited Blocks/Mandals/Talukas in IndiaS.
