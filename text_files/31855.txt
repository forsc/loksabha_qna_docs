ANSWER




(a)       As per recently released National Family Health Survey-V (2019-21) data, 57.0 percent women in the age group of 15-49 years are estimated to be anaemic in the country. The details on State/UT-wise, including Bihar, prevalence of anaemia are placed at Annexure-I. The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare under the National Health Mission is implementing ‘Anaemia Mukt Bharat Strategy’ in all 36 States/UTs. (b)       No, Sir. Does not arise. (c)       The Year-wise and State/ UT-wise details of number of beneficiaries enrolled and total amount disbursed for maternity benefit under the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) since inception and till 22.11.2021 is at Annexure-II.  (d)       The PMMVY is reviewed periodically through Video Conferences with States/UTs and through National and Regional level workshops for its successful implementation. The operational difficulties faced by the States/UTs in implementation of the scheme, as and when reported, are addressed through mutual/ technical discussions. The Ministry also celebrates ‘Matru Vandana Saptah’ every year to intensify implementation of the scheme and create a healthy competition amongst States/ UTs. States/ UTs undertake various IEC and Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) activities such as, prabhat pheri, nukkad natak, newspaper advertisement, airing radio jingles, selfie campaign, door to door campaign, community programmes at field functionary levels etc. ****** Annexure-IStatement referred to in reply to part (a) of the Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 3283 for answer on 17.12.2021 raised by Dr. Mohammad Jawed and Shri Janardan Singh Sigriwal regarding ‘Study on Impact of PMMVY’State/UT-wise prevalence of Anaemia as per National Family Health Survey-5 (2019-21)Sl.
