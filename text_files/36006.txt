  MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a):       Total land acquired by Coal India Limited and its subsidiaries for different coal mining activities during last three years are as under:- Year	Acquisition of Land (Fig in Ha)2018-19	1720.352019-20	489.372020-21	1731.85 (b):       The total number of Project Affected People shifted in last three years are as under:- Year	No. of Project Affected People Shifted2018-19	6552019-20	28982020-21	1084 (c) &(d):          The benefits extended to the land owners under R&R Policy of CIL and certain modification by the respective subsidiaries read with all three Schedules of RFCTLARR Act, 2013 are as under:- (1).       Land compensation is provided as per legal norms, based on mode of acquisition. In case of land acquired under Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957 (mostly in case of subsidiaries of CIL) compensation is determined in line with the provisions of First Schedule of RFCTLARR Act, 2013.(2).       Cost of the Houses – As per valuation of the Appropriate Authority. (3).       Employment – one employment for every 02 acres of land for all subsidiaries except Mahanadi Coalfields Limited (MCL) where employment is provided as per R&R Policy of Odisha Government. (4).       One time cash compensation in lieu of Employment. (5).       Household plot to the displaced family at R&R site made by the subsidiaries.(6).       One time monetary compensation in lieu of plot.(7).       Cattle-shed allowance. (8).       Shifting allowance.(9).       Minimum agriculture wages for a period of one year.(10).     Annuity as per CIL’s Annuity Scheme, 2020 for small holders of land.             Employment against land acquisition in subsidiaries of CIL are given below:- Financial Year	Number of employment against land acquisition2018-19	19292019-20	16902020-21	19922021-22 (till Jan., 22)	1290 (e):       Subsidiaries of CIL are following R&R Policy of CIL along with some subsidiary wise modifications, considering the unique conditions and are providing direct employment to the land losers at the rate of one employment for every 02 acres of land either in descending order of land lost or under package deal concept, where small land owners are allowed to club their small portion of land to make 02 acres of land for one employment of their nominee. The land looser has the option for availing R&R benefits passed by the Collector of the State or CIL’s R&R Policy 2012 and South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL) and MCL are following the R&R Policy of their respective states, i.e. MCL is following Odisha State Government R&R Policy 1989, 1998 & 2006 and SECL is following MP R&R Policy 1991 & 1995. Post notification of RFCTLARR (Removal of Difficulties) Order 2015, it has been decided that all the subsidiaries are to adhere to the provisions of First, Second and Third Schedule of RFCTLARR Act 2013 for the land acquired under CBA (A&D) Act 1957. Further, Subsidiary Companies Boards have been authorised to approve necessary modifications in the R&R Policy with reference to unique conditions prevailing at the concerned subsidiaries as the policy is not exhaustive.”  (f):      Following are the few challenges faced by subsidiaries of CIL while rehabilitating the displaced persons:1.	Building consensus among villagers regarding rehabilitation site finalization.2.	Resistance from host community regarding development of rehabilitation site.3.	Reluctance of villagers to relocate near the host community.4.	Difficulty in obtaining Government land for rehabilitation site.   (g) to (i):         No cases are pending in Subsidiaries of CIL except in Central Coalfields Limited (CCL) where 103 employments are under scrutiny and few cases at Western Coalfields Limited (WCL) due to ownership dispute in court and dispute among the family members regarding share in ancestral property resulting into non-consensus on finalizing nominee for employment.However, Rehabilitation and Resettlement is a continuous process. As the mines progress, PDF (Project Displaced Families) and PAF (Project Affected Families) list are prepared and accordingly, R&R benefits are provided as applicable. ***
