While women has 53% share in Jan-Dhan accounts, 59% Jan-Dhan accounts are in rural and semi-urban areas.?	29.65 crore RuPay debit cards have been issued to PMJDY account-holders.?	Around 8 Crore PMJDY accounts are receiving Direct Benefit Transfers (DBTs) credits. ?	Inter-operable Banking Correspondents (BCs) have been deployed in 1.26 lakh Sub Service Areas (rural areas), each catering to 1000-1500 households.State/UT-wise number of PMJDY accounts, deposit balance and RuPay cards issued to PMJDY account-holders are provided in the Annexure.(c)	and (d) As per Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Master Circular dated 1.7.2015 on Customer Service in banks, savings accounts (including PMJDY accounts) are treated as inoperative/dormant if there is no transaction in the account for over a period of two years.Further, as per RBI’s circular on ‘Financial Inclusion - Access to Banking Services – Basic Savings Bank Deposit Accounts’, dated 10.6.2019, all banks are advised that the holders of BSBD account (including account opened under PMJDY) are not eligible for opening any other savings bank deposit account in that bank.*****
