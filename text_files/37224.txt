This scheme also endeavours to set the benchmark price and quality of yarn in the open market so that prices remain within reasonable limits and consistent supply and quality parameters are maintained in the market, thus helping to arrest profiteering by the intermediaries.In addition to the above,•	To support direct product selling to handloom customers, marketing expos and events are organised.

So far about 1.5 lakh weavers have been on-boarded on the GeM portal. •	Weavers are facilitated to sell their products online and 23 e-commerce platforms have been associated by Ministry of Textiles under a policy framework.•	For export promotion of handloom products, Handloom Export Promotion Council has been organizing International Fairs.
