The scheme envisages following Information Technology (IT) interventions to facilitate AT&C losses reduction:(i)	Smart Metering:Smart Metering of Consumers and System Metering (i.e. metering of Feeders and Distribution Transformers) is one of the major components under the scheme to facilitate automatic measurement of energy flows and energy accounting as well as auditing without any human intervention.  The scheme envisages that along with installation of prepaid Smart Metering and the associated Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), installation of communicable System meters at Feeder and Distribution Transformer level will enable proper energy accounting for identification of theft prone pockets and high loss areas. (ii)	Advanced ICT including AI and ML based solutions:The scheme envisages leveraging Artificial Intelligence to analyse data generated through IT/OT devices including System Meters, prepaid Smart meters to prepare actionable MIS from system generated energy accounting reports so as to enable the DISCOMs take informed decisions on loss reduction, demand forecasting, asset management, consumer analytics and for other predictive analysis. (iii)	Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Distribution Management System (DMS) in urban areas(c) & (d) :	Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) has recently notified the Conduct of Energy Audit in Distribution Companies Regulations, 2021, which entail a progressive move towards IT enabled Energy Accounting methodology.
