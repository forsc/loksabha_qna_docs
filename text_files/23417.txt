Schedule-l of the Act envisages distribution of Millets (nutri-cereals / coarsegrain) at highly subsidized rate of Re.1 per kg. 	Nutri-cereals (including millets) are already a part of Public Distribution System (PDS). The procurement, storage and distribution of nutri-cereals by States/UTs is done under Decentralized Procurement (DCP) system. Under this, any State/UT intending to distribute millets under PDS is allowed to procure it from farmers at Minimum Support Price (MSP) under central pool subject to prior approval from Govt of India on the detailed procurement plan prepared by State Governments in consultation with Food Corporation of India so as to ensure that the procured quantity is distributed under PDS in that State only. Subsequently, the allocation of approved quantity of millet for distribution under PDS is made by this Department, while ensuring that the overall quantity of rice, wheat and millets has to be within the upper ceiling fixed in respect of each State/UT under NFSA. Responsibility for distribution of foodgrains/ nutri-cereals within the State/UT rests with the concerned State/UT Govt.*****
