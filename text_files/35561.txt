As reported by States/UTs in their respective Annual Work Plan and Budget, 2021-22, 97.01% of habitations in the country are covered under upper primary schools, as per their notified neighbourhood norms. The habitations that remain uncovered are mostly small or sparsely populated in difficult areas where opening of school is not feasible for which there is a provision of giving transport and escort facility and opening of residential schools and hostels.Under the centrally sponsored scheme of Samagra Shiksha, financial assistance is provided to the States and UTs for implementation of various interventions including upgradation/ opening of new schools. This is based on the annual plans prepared by the States and UTs as per their requirements/ priority and is reflected in their respective Annual Work Plan and Budget (AWP&B) Proposals. These plans are then appraised and approved/estimated by the Project Approval Board (PAB) in the Department of School Education & Literacy in consultation with the States and UTs as per the programmatic and financial norms of the scheme, and physical and financial progress of the State for the interventions approved earlier.*****
