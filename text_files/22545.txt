ANSWER




                                                        a) and (b):   Yes, Sir. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT), Ministry of Communications has issued new guidelines on 5th November, 2020 to reduce the compliance burden for both BPO and other IT enabled service providers. These guidelines have done away with the registration requirement for Other Service Providers (OSPs). It has further limited the scope to cover only entities that are providing voice based BPO services. Pure data / internet (non-voice) based IT companies have now been kept outside the scope of the new regime, leading to significant reduction in cost of doing business for such service providers. Further, the guidelines have also removed several onerous provisions related to furnishing Bank Guarantees by the OSPs towards enabling work from home, providing relief to the entities providing voice-based services. Additionally, the guidelines have also enabled companies to adopt hybrid working models by enabling ‘Work from Anywhere’ in the country. (c) to (e):     The industry is required to comply with the new guidelines for OSPs, which is based on self regulation by the OSPs. However, OPSs are required to maintain a copy of  Call Detail Records (CDRs), Usage Detail Records (UDR), system logs etc. to be furnished and provided to DoT/Security Agencies, as and when required. In case of violations, appropriate action under the provisions of the Indian Telegraph Act and/or other applicable laws will be pursued.    *******
