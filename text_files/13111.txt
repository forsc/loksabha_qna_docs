ANSWER




(a):	The Indian Pharmaceutical industry is 3rd largest in the world by the volume and 14th largest in terms of value. India exported medicines worth US $ mn 14389 in Financial Year 2018-19. India also exported Bulk Drug/Drug Intermediates worth US $ 3911 in Financial Year 2018-19. However, the country also imports various Bulk Drugs/Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) for producing medicines. Two-thirds of the total imports of Bulk Drugs, Drug Intermediates is from China. The details of India’s imports of Bulk Drugs, Drug Intermediates (including from China) are as under:Years	Total import(US $ mn)	Imports from China(US$ mn)	Percent of Import from China2018-19	3560.35	2405.42 	67.56%(b): No, Sir. (c): At present, we have sufficient stock of medicines.(d):  Yes, Sir. If the epidemic of Corona virus in China continues to disrupt manufacturing of APIs/KSMs in China, then there is an apprehension that the supplies of APIs/KSMs from China might be disrupted.(e):	Department of Pharmaceuticals has constituted a Committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Eshwara Reddy, Joint Drugs Controller, Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) to address the issue of drug security in the country in the context of novel coronavirus outbreak in China. Based on the recommendations of the Committee, the department has issued necessary instructions to National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) and State Governments to ensure adequate supply of APIs and formulations at affordable prices in the market and to prevent black-marketing, illegal hoarding, creating artificial shortages in the country. In this regard, Department of Pharmaceuticals has written to DGFT to restrict exports of 13 API and formulations. NPPA has also written to Chief Secretaries of States with copies to Principal Secretaries Health and State Drug Controllers requesting them to closely monitor the production and availability of APIs and formulations to prevent the black marketing and hoarding in their States and UTs as well as to ensure that there is no violation of provisions of Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 2013 with regard to compliance of ceiling prices/ permissible increase in prices of scheduled/ non-scheduled formulations respectively.xxxxx
