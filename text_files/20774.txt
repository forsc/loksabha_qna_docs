                                                        ANSWER MINISTER FOR WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)  (a)  As on 29.01.2021, maternity benefits amounting to Rs.7995.65 crores (including Central and State share) have been paid to more than 2.40 crores eligible beneficiaries under Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) since inception of the scheme. (b) & (c)  No Mother and Child Protection Cards are issued under PMMVY scheme.  (d) The average time taken for disbursal of funds once a beneficiary is registered on Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana-Common Application Software (PMMVY-CAS) is 35.14 days. (e)  The PMMVY scheme guidelines provide for payment of maternity benefits to eligible beneficiaries within 30 days from the date of registration on PMMVY-CAS. Around 23% of total applications received took more than 30 days for payment of maternity benefits to  beneficiaries on account of corrections required in the applications and due to delays in release of State share. Therefore, time taken to process applications depends on how fast States respond. *****
