ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                                 (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) & (b).	Government of Telangana had requested, vide three communications dated 28.12.2020, to provide financial assistance for implementation of various sewerage and septage management projects of Urban Local Bodies (ULB), development of sewer network infrastructure for Liquid Waste Collection at Hyderabad Urban Agglomeration and Strategic Nala Development Project of Hyderabad.  Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) supplements the infrastructure development efforts of States in the sectors of water supply and sewerage and septage management etc. through its flagship Missions from time to time.  Sewerage and Septage management is one of the priority sector of Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme of the Ministry, launched on 25 June 2015 in 500 selected cities across the country.  Twelve towns/cities of Telangana, including Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, have been selected under AMRUT, for which, SAAPs amounting to ?1,666.26 crore, including committed Central Assistance of ?832.60 crore, was approved by this Ministry for the entire Mission period. As on date, entire Central outlay available under AMRUT hasalready been allocated amongthe States/Union Territories (UTs) and no untied fund is available under the Mission. Therefore, it was not feasible to support the proposal of Government of Telangana under AMRUT.                                            *****
