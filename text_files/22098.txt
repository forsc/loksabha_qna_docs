(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a): 	Under “The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020” the State Governments may notify a Registration Authority to provide for electronic registry for that State that provides facilitative framework for registration of farming agreements.  Further the constitution, composition and functions of the Registration Authority and the procedure for registration shall be such as may be prescribed by the State Government.  The Act has been recently enacted, the information about the number of farming agreements entered into, under the Act is not maintained centrally.(b) & (c):	  As per the reports of the State Government of Karnataka, M/s. Swastya Farmers Company (FPO) has purchased 1000 quintals of Sona Masoori rice from the farmers for a transaction value of Rs.19,50,000/- at the rate of Rs.1950/- per quintal.(d):	There is no impact on APMC mandis as farmers/FPOs have a choice to sell in APMC mandis as well, if they provide remunerative prices of Farmers’ produce. Further, the newly enacted Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 provides a legal framework for farming agreements to protect the interest of farmers.(e):	Does not arise in the view of above.*****
