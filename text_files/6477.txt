ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b): 	The income of agricultural households in the country is estimated by National Statistical Office (NSO) through the ‘Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Households’ conducted from time to time. The first such survey was conducted in rural parts of the country during NSS 59th round (January 2003- December 2003). Thereafter, a repeat survey was conducted during NSS 70th round (January 2013- December 2013).  As per the Survey results, although not strictly comparable, the average monthly income per agricultural household in Maharashtra is estimated to have increased from Rs. 2463 in 2003 to Rs. 7386 in 2013.  This translates to about 4.7 per cent growth at constant prices (adjusted for inflation).  Since the last survey on income of agricultural households was conducted in 2013, the extent of increase/decrease in income during the last five years is not known. (c): 	Government had constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee in April, 2016 to examine the issues relating to ‘Doubling of Farmers Income’ and recommend a comprehensive strategy to achieve the same. The Committee has submitted its Report to the Government in September, 2018 which is available on the Department’s website at http://agricoop.nic.in/doubling-farmers. The Committee recognises agriculture as a value led enterprise and has identified seven major sources of growth in farmers’ income, viz., improvement in crop productivity; improvement in livestock productivity; resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; increase in the cropping intensity; diversification towards high value crops; improvement in real prices received by farmers; and shift from farm to non-farm occupations. On an ongoing basis, Government has been reorienting its Schemes and Programmes implemented by the State Governments, including Maharashtra on the lines of interventions suggested by the Committee on Doubling of Farmers Income.The Centrally Sponsored Schemes implemented in Maharashtra are: Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY); National Food Security Mission (NFSM); NFSM Oilseeds & Oil Palm; Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH); Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY); Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY); National Project on Management of Soil Health & Fertility (NPSH&F); Rainfed Area Development; Sub-Mission on Agro Forestry (SMAF); National Bamboo Mission; Sub-Mission on Seed & Planting Material (SMSP); Sub- Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM); and National E-Governance Plan in Agriculture (NEGP-A). ********
