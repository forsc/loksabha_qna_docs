                                                        ):  In the post COVID-19 global business and trade environment, there are many changes that represent challenges and opportunities for India. Global companies are looking to diversify their manufacturing locations to mitigate the supply chain risks. To utilize these opportunities and establish India as a global leader in electronics manufacturing, Government of India launched Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing, Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) and Modified Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC 2.0), which are aimed at “Atmanirbhar Bharat – A self-reliant India” under the aegis of National Policy on Electronics 2019 (NPE 2019).Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing was notified on 1st April, 2020. The Scheme extends an incentive of 6% to 4% on incremental sales (over base year) of goods under target segments that are manufactured in India to eligible companies, for a period of five (5) years subsequent to the base year (FY 2019-20).16 companies have been approved under the first round of PLI Scheme for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing.Second round of the PLI Scheme for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing was launched on 11.03.2021 for incentivising Electronic Components. The second round extends an incentive of 5% to 3% on incremental sales (over base year i.e. 2019-20) for goods manufactured in India and covered under the target segment, to eligible companies, for a period of four (4) years. 16 companies have been approved under the second round of PLI Scheme for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing.In accordance with the announcement made by Hon’ble Union Finance & Corporate Affairs Minister on 28.06.2021 to provide relief to companies approved under the PLI Scheme that were affected by disruption in production activities on account of COVID-19 pandemic related lockdown, restrictions on movement of personnel, delays in installation of relocated plant and machinery and disruption in supply chain; the tenure of the PLI Scheme for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing has been extended by one year i.e. from 2024-25 to 2025-26 with the approval of the Empowered Committee (EC). The notification in this regard was issued on 23.09.2021.However, the base year for the purpose of the PLI Scheme for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing remain the same, i.e. FY 2019-20, for computation of incremental investment and incremental sales of manufactured goods.For the first round of the PLI Scheme for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing, approved companies were allowed to choose a period of any 5 consecutive years between FY 2020-21 and FY 2025-26 to achieve threshold targets for incremental sales of manufactured goods. Incentives for Year 1 have been made applicable from 01.08.2020 or 01.08.2021 depending on the choice of Year 1 (i.e FY 2020-21 or FY 2021-22). 15 out of 16 approved companies have opted for FY 2021-22 as Year 1.Similarly, for the second round of the PLI Scheme, companies approved under the Scheme were allowed to choose a period of any 4 consecutive years between FY 2021-22 and FY 2025-26 to achieve threshold targets for incremental sales of manufactured goods. Incentives have been made applicable from 01.04.2021 or 01.04.2022 depending on the choice of Year 1 (i.e FY 2021-22 or FY 2022-23). 9 out of 16 companies have opted for FY 2022-23 as Year 1 and rest of the companies have opted to continue with FY 2021-22 as Year 1.(b):   The state-wise list of the companies approved under the PLI Scheme for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing is annexed.(c):    A total budget outlay of INR 40,995 crore has been approved for the PLI Scheme for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing. No disbursement has been made under the aforesaid PLI Scheme so far.********Annexure-1List of Companies approved under First Round of PLI Scheme for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing for Mobile Phones and Specified Electronic Components Sl.
