The approach is to build capacity on small amounts of learning at a time, until all skills, understanding and actions have been put into regular practice, and have been internalized by the functionaries and a supportive supervisory mechanism is put in place. Till date, around 10.22 lakh frontline functionaries have been successfully trained and about 8.3 lakh Anganwadi Workers/ Anganwadi Helpers have been trained for uploading the ICT application and for feeding quality data. **
