                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH) (a) & (b) :	Yes, Sir. Some power plants have been designed to operate on imported coal. As per data available with the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), the details of coal based thermal power plants designed to operate on imported coal are given at Annexure.  In addition, some power plants use imported coal for blending with domestic coal.(c) & (d) : 	The variable charge of a thermal power plant depends upon various factors like price, gross calorific value and transportation cost of imported and domestic coal. The power purchased by Distribution licensee for supply to consumers is based on the merit order despatch system. Accordingly, the cheapest power is scheduled first and the costliest may or may not get scheduled and is dependent upon the electricity demand of the consumer.******************
