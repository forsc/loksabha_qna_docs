Appointed Date of the project was 03.06.2014. The construction period was 30 months, i.e. upto 28.11.2016.

As per accident data analysis from the police record, accidents are mostly occurring on the stretches due to over speeding and drunken driving.(d) and (e)		Penalty is being levied on Concessionaire due to delay in completion of four laning work as per provisions of Concession Agreement.	*****
