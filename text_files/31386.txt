ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS(SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI) (a) to (c) Development of National Highways (NHs) is a continuous process and the Ministry takes up NH projects based on the requirements of traffic density, inter se priority, requirements of connectivity and the availability of resources. As a part of this ongoing development process, the Ministry plans to construct about 36,500 km of National Highways in the next three years from 2021-22 to 2023-24, it has fixed a target of 12,000 Km for construction in the Country during the current financial year, to be met from the ongoing NH projects in different States/UTs. Details of ongoing NH projects in the Country including road widening projects in Maharashtra and Odisha are placed at Annexure-I. (d) A time limit of 2-3 years is generally kept for completion of NH projects.(e)The cost of ongoing projects may increase due to site/local/project specific factors or other factors including price escalation during the project time cycle. In BOT projects, there is no cost overrun due to time overrun as escalation cost is absorbed by the Concessionaire. In other projects, if delay is attributable to the Contractor, damages are imposed and price escalation is not paid. If delay is attributable to the Project Authority, price escalation is paid as per contract conditions, and the actual amount of price escalation and inter-alia the actual increase in project cost, if any, is known only on actual completion of the project and final settlement of bills.
