Survey of India (SoI) under Department of Science & Technology (DST) has taken up the work of digitally mapping the entire country being done as per National Map Policy-2005 under "Generation of High Resolution National Topographic Database (HRNTDB)" scheme during next three financial years from 2020-2021, using:1)	High Resolution Satellite Imagery (HRSI) (Sub - meter Imagery): 22.5 lakh sq km.2)	Drone/Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) (Professional Survey Grade): 10 lakh sq km.Work components in the scheme are:i.	Ground Control Points provisioning/Data Capturing ii.	Geo-referencing/Data Processing iii.	Feature Extraction iv.	Ground validation/Attribute Collectionv.
