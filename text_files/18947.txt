ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION ANDELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) & (b)	No, Sir. The frequency assignment for Captive Mobile Radio Trunking Services (CMRTS) is a two step process. In the first step, the end-user (the applicant) signs a license agreement with DoT for provisioning of CMRTS. In the second and final step, the applicant places his spectrum requirement with Wireless Planning and Coordination Wing (WPC Wing), DoT. WPC Wing carries out technical analysis and thereafter assigns the appropriate number of frequencies and, if possible, in the frequency band requested by the applicant. In this context, it may be added here that Gujarat State Police has already completed that first stage of CMRTS licensing by entering into agreements with DoT for Ahmedabad, Vododara, Surat, Rajkot and Gandhinagar district. However, the Gujarat State Police has not yet placed its request for spectrum for the CMRTS in the aforesaid cities as yet. Whenever such request is made, the same will be considered as per the extant rules. (c) & (d)	The Gujarat State Police has paid spectrum charges up to March, 2020. The Gujarat State Police will be assigned frequencies for CMRTS in Ahmedabad, Vododara, Surat, Rajkot cities and Gandhinagar district, when it makes requisite applications to this effect to DoT and payment of applicable spectrum charges.************
