(b): Government has taken a number of steps to improve mobilization of savings including opening up of 37.95 crore accounts under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana and mobilizing bank deposits amounting to Rs. 1.13 lakh crore, up to 22.1.2020. Further, Rs. 9.19 lakh crore has been transferred directly into the accounts of beneficiaries under Direct Benefit Transfer, which would promote account-based transactions and at the same time enable accumulation of savings and interest thereon as deposits in banks.

In addition, over 1.26 lakh Bank Mitras have been deployed for branchless banking in rural areas.
