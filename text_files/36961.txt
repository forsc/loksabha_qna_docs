                        Will the Minister of





ENVIRONMENT,  FORESTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE


                        be pleased to state:-















(a) 	whether it is a fact that the environmentalists have expressed concern over amendments to the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 as it prioritizes intellectual property and commercial trade at the cost of the Act’s key aim of conserving biological resources;(b) 	whether it is a fact that the Bill will undo all the efforts made in the last few years to implement the Biological Diversity Act;(c) 	whether the changes do not increase the stake of local communities in sustainable growth; and (d) 	whether it is also true that the amended Bill will benefit the traditional medicine manufacturers, seed sector and industry and researchers and if so, the details thereof?






ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (d) The proposed amendments to the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 aim to enable fast-tracking of research, patent application process, transfer of research results while utilising the biological resources available in India. Therefore, the efforts towards the implementation of the Biological Diversity Act, would remain intact and even more effective, including further strengthening the Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) as communities would continue to get benefits through the provisions of Access and Benefit Sharing. The amendments provide exemption to seed companies or farmers who have an approval or a right granted under the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Act, 2001.For IPR and research activities, only registration process has been introduced for Indian controlled entities, to make the process simpler. However, when these entities go in for commercialization, they will have to seek approval from NBA/SBB, as the case may be.***
