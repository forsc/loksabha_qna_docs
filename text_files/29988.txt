ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES (SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a) & (b): There is no shortage of coal in the country. Due to increased demand of power, less power generation by imported coal based power plants and some interruption in supply of coal due to heavy rains, the coal stock at the power plants depleted to 7.2 MT (sufficient for 4 days) as on 8th October, 2021. Subsequently with increased coal supplies, the coal stock has started increasing and has now reached 17.53 MT (sufficient for 9 days) as on 30.11.2021.  Coal India Limited (CIL) has dispatched around 54 Million Tonnes (MT) more coal during April - October’21 in comparison to the same period of last year. CIL has dispatched 291.72 MT coal during this period, against 237.75 MT during the same period of last fiscal. As per Central Electricity Authority (CEA) generation report during the period of April to November, 21 the coal based power generation is 671.85 BU, against 588.26 BU during the same period of the last fiscal, which is 14.2 % higher.  (c) In view of the above, this does not arise.  ****
