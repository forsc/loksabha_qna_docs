These recruitment agencies conduct recruitment as per the recruitment rules framed and notified for each service/post. No centralized data of recruitment examinations conducted by these recruitment agencies is maintained.2.

Direct recruitment by the UPSC is done through 16 open competitive examinations annually as well as by selection3.	Staff Selection Commission (SSC) is responsible for recruitment to Group B (non-Gazetted) posts, Group B (Gazetted) posts, as are exempted from consultation with UPSC, and Group C posts in various Ministries/Departments of the Government of India and their attached and subordinate offices. The SSC conducts 7 mandated recruitment examinations, as also recruitment/examinations on Memorandum of Understanding-basis for the Central Armed Police Forces and some other departments.4.	Preliminary examinations conducted by the UPSC and SSC comprise multiple-choice objective type question papers in Hindi and English, wherein the candidate has to tick mark the appropriate answer. However, in the Civil Services (Mains) Examination conducted by UPSC, the candidate has the option to write his answers in any regional language, except in case of language and literature paper. The SSC also conducts Paper-II of Multi-Tasking (Non-Technical) Staff Examination in all the languages included in the Eighth Schedule.5.	Recruitment to junior level posts in the Indian Railways is done through a Computer Based Test by 21 Railway Recruitment Boards (RRBs) located all over the Country.
