ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI) (a) & (b):   Indian pepper is facing competition in the international market from other major pepper producing countries like Vietnam, Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia etc. India produced 61000 MT pepper in the year 2020 which accounted for about 10% of total global production. Indian pepper is one of the most expensive varieties of pepper in the World market.           Various export promotion programmes are being implemented through the Spices Board to assist exporters in boosting export of spices and spices products, including pepper. Besides encouraging adoption of scientific practices, the Spices Board focuses on ensuring quality and food safety in the entire spices supply chain. The major thrust areas are trade promotion, product development & research, infrastructure development, promotion of Indian spice brands abroad, setting up common infrastructure for cleaning, grading, processing, packing and storing of spices in major spice growing/marketing centres, organizing Buyer Seller Meets etc. Special programmes are also undertaken for the development of the spices sector in the North Eastern Region.(c) to (e):   There was an increase in import of pepper from Sri Lanka in the year 2017-18. Due to various measures taken by the Government, import of Pepper from Sri Lanka has been showing declining trend since 2018-19. The quantum of import of pepper has reduced from 13673.95 MT in 2017-18 to 5178.89 in 2019-20.          Government had fixed a CIF value of Rs.500/- per kg. as the Minimum Import Price for black pepper vide Notification of Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) dated 6/12/2017. Subsequently, an amendment was brought in the Minimum Import Price (MIP) notification by making import of pepper at or above Rs.500/- per kg. free and import below Rs.500/- per kg prohibited vide DGFT Notification dated 21/3/2018. Moreover, the Government imposes a duty of 70% on import of pepper from all countries other than those covered under Trade Agreements and the Advance Authorization scheme.	Further, on the request of the Government of India, Government of Sri Lanka has introduced a new procedure to prevent issue of Certificates of Origin for third-country black pepper shipments destined to India. ****
