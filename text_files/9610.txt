ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) & (b) The government is aware that several private institution and universities, while adapting different methodologies, different data set and giving different weightages to the parameters are ranking the countries.  The data used for ranking is extracted primarily from satellite imageries, which are not validated by proper ground truthing. Further, the methodology for ranking needs to be peer reviewed.On the analysis of last five-year ambient air quality data (2014-2018), across the country, it is observed that most of the cities were within the National Standards with respect to parameters of SO2 and NO2. With respect to PM10 and PM2.5, 18 and 12 cities respectively showed decreasing trend. In reference to Delhi, there has been an overall improvement in air quality of Delhi in 2019 as compared to that of 2016. The number of ‘Good to ‘Moderate’ days has increased to 175 in 2019 as compared to 108 in 2016.Further, the Central Government launched National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) as a long-term, time-bound, national level strategy to tackle the air pollution problem across the country in a comprehensive manner with targets to achieve 20 % to 30 % reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations by 2024 keeping 2017 as the base year for the comparison of concentration. Under NCAP, 102 non-attainment cities have been identified based on ambient air quality data for the period 2011 – 2015 and WHO report 2014/2018. The city specific Action Plans have been prepared and approved for ground implementation for all 102 non-attainment cities.(c)	State-wise details of funds released to various Agencies since last ten years for ambient air quality monitoring under National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP) is given at Annexure-I.(d)	 Several studies have been conducted to identify major air pollution sources and their contributions to ambient air pollution levels in the country and it reveals that Transport, Industries, Agriculture Burning, Residential, Dust [Soil, Road & Construction], etc. are the main contributors to PM10 andPM2.5 concentrations.  ***
