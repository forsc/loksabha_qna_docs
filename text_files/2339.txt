ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b) Ground water levels in various parts of the Country are declining because of continuous withdrawal due to reasons such as increased demand of fresh water for various uses, vagaries of rainfall, increased population, industrialization & urbanization etc. Extraction of ground water from the aquifers exceeding its annual replenishment is one of the reasons for decline in ground water levels.  Water being a State subject, efforts to conserve and manage ground water is primarily States’ responsibility. Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) has been constituted under Section 3(3) of the ‘Environment (Protection) Act, 1986’ for the purpose of regulation and control of ground water development and management in the Country. CGWA grants No Objection Certificates for ground water abstraction through guidelines which are modified from time to time.As per information received from the State Government of Tamil Nadu, to prevent illegal extraction of Groundwater in the State, the State Government has formed a committee vide Government order No. 276, Public Works (R2) Department, dated 17.10.2018. Further, CGWA has also appointed the District Magistrate / District Collector of each Revenue District and Regional Directors of CGWB as Authorized Officers, who have been given the power to enforce compliance of NOC conditions. *****
