THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI SOM PARKASH)(a) & (b):	Yes Sir. Both the campaigns aim to lower dependency on imports and boost domestic production of goods/services. The Government has implemented major reforms in the last one year to boost domestic manufacturing and industrial production.  Government of India has issued the Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order, 2017 (PPP-MII Order, 2017), as amended on 16.09.2020, to encourage further participation of locally manufactured goods, services and works in government procurement. Department of Expenditure (DoE) has also amended Rule 161(iv) of General Financial Rules, 2017 on 15.05.2020 mandating that Global Tender Enquiry (GTE) shall not be invited for tenders up to Rs. 200 Crores. However, in exceptional circumstances, where the Ministry feels that there are special reasons for GTE, prior approval of competent authority as notified by DoE shall be sought. In order to enhance India’s manufacturing capabilities and exports- Atmanirbhar Bharat, the Government has approved the introduction of Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme in ten sectors i.e. Advance Chemistry Cell (ACC) Battery, Electronic /Technology Products, Automobiles & Auto Components, Pharmaceuticals drugs, Telecom & Networking Products, Textile Products: MMF segment and technical textiles, Food Products, High Efficiency Solar PV Modules, White Goods(ACs and LED)  and Specialty Steel. Department for Promotion of Industry & Internal Trade (DPIIT) has identified 24 focus sectors in which India can truly become self-reliant by strengthening domestic manufacturing which will translate into more employability, greater potential for exports with a higher share in the global market and a sound manufacturing domestic base within the country to meet its own demands. (c):     	25% import reduction from 405,334 US$ million to 304,561 US$ million has been recorded in QE commodity groups during 2020-21 (April, 2020 to January 2021) over the corresponding period of 2019-20 (April, 2019 to January 2020). Commodity Group-wise details placed at Annexure.******
