ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) and (b) With a vision to digitalize Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) for empowering rural India, Ministry has developed a suite of Core Common Applications under e-Panchayat Mission Mode Project (MMP) to address all aspects of Panchayat functioning including planning, budgeting, implementation, accounting, monitoring and delivery of citizen centric services like issue of certificates, licences, etc to make them more transparent, accountable and effective as organs of decentralized self-governing institutions. Further, in order to strengthen e-Governance in PRIs, a Simplified Work Based Accounting Application for Panchayati Raj – eGramSwaraj (egramswaraj.gov.in) has been developed amalgamating functionalities of planning, monitoring, accounting and online payments. (c) to (e) Panchayat being a State subject, the responsibility of governance of Panchayats rests with State Governments. Hence, appropriate actions on complaints relating to Panchayats including misuse of funds is the responsibility of State Governments. No such record is maintained centrally.*****
