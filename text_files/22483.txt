ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY ANDCONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) and (b) During the lockdown period Shramik special trains were operated by Indian Railways to evacuate stranded persons to their respective states. These trains were “trains on demand” run based on the demands by State Governments; no tickets were directly sold to the passengers by Indian Railways. The schedule of these trains were decided in co-ordination with the State Governments and adequate information was provided to State Governments to ferry passengers to and from Railway Stations. Further, with effect from 12th May, 2020 operation of limited number of special Rajdhani Express trains was started.  For such trains, on Indian Railways system, an integrated helpline information number of 139 is functional and which picks up information from National Train Enquiry System (NTES) for answering queries on train related information.       In order to make enquiry service more effective, the NTES through, which the information is disseminated, has been completely integrated with Control Office Application distributed over all Divisions to capture information of trains at each station which is then updated in the NTES. With this integration, it has become feasible to give updated information regarding train running, on near real-time basis along with other train related enquiry.       Moreover, the public is informed through Press Notification, Print & Electronic Media and Social Media, if any new/special train is started or any train is cancelled. An app called NTES has also been developed and information related to train services including Cancelled/ Rescheduled / Diverted trains is uploaded in this app.      Besides, proper training, from time to time, is imparted to staff concerned to ensure dissemination of correct information to the passengers. *****
