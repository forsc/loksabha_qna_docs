                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	The Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Gurantee Scheme (MGNREGA), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), Deen Dayal Upadhayay – Gramin Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana – Gramin (PMAY-G), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) and Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana(SAGY) to bring about overall improvement in the quality of life of the people in rural areas, strengthening of livelihood opportunities, promoting self-employment, skilling of rural youths, infrastructure development, provision of social assistance and other basic amenities.  (b) & (c):  National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) has the provision of Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) with the sole objective of giving low cost fund support to State Governments and State owned Corporations for quick completion of ongoing projects in the rural sector relating medium and minor irrigation, soil conservation, watershed management and other forms of rural infrastructure.Ministry of Rural Development was sanctioned a NABARD loan of Rs. 18,500 crore in the year 2007-2008 for construction / upgradation of rural roads under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), which was fully repaid by the Ministry.The construction of rural roads under PMGSY under any budgetary provision is regularly monitored by way of Regional Review Meetings (RRMs), Performance Review Committee Meeting (PRC), Pre-empowered Committee and Empowered Committee Meetings with the States. At district level, the District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee (DISHA) headed by a Member of Parliament (LS) monitors the implementation of various schemes of Government of India including PMGSY. In addition to this, review meetings are also held by Secretary/Additional Secretary, Ministry of Rural Development with Chief Secretaries of the States. For effective monitoring of roads works constructed under PMGSY, an On-line Management, Monitoring and Accounting System (OMMAS) (www.omms.nic.in) has also been developed. A three tier quality control mechanism viz. Programme Implementation Unit (PIU), State Quality Monitors (SQM) and National Quality Monitors(NQM) is envisaged under the PMGSY for ensuring construction of quality roads works.  Further the government has also initiated a project to use geo-informatics using satellite imagery, on a real time basis, to verify the progress of implementation of PMGSY as reported electronically by the States.  *****
