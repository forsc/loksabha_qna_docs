                                                        MINISTER OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):	As per Management Information System (MIS), the details of expenditure on unskilled wage under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) during the last three financial years and current financial year 2019-20 (as on 13.11.2019) is as under: Financial Years	                     Expenditure on unskilled wage                                           (Rs. in crore)2016-17	                                40720.452017-18	                                43125.242018-19	                                47172.352019-20 as on 13.11.2019	        30092.31(b):	Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is a demand driven wage employment programme. It provides livelihood security i.e., fall back option for livelihood for the rural households when no better employment opportunity is available. The demand for work is influenced by various factors such as rain-fall, availability of alternative and remunerative employment opportunities outside Mahatma Gandhi NREGS.(c)&(d):	The Ministry, under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS receives complaints of irregularities/corruption and embezzlement including diversion of funds, under/non-payment of wages, lack of transparency etc. Since the responsibility of implementation of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is vested with the State Governments/UTs, complaints received in the Ministry are forwarded to the concerned State Governments/UTs for taking appropriate action. Steps have been taken to strengthen transparency and accountability which include geo-tagging, Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), National electronic Fund Management System (NeFMS), Aadhar Based Payment System (ABPS), Software for Estimate Calculation using Rural rates for Employment (SECURE) and establishment of independent social audit units and appointment of Ombudsmen in the States. Performance Review Committee meetings of the Ministry, Common Review Missions and regular video conferencing on specific issues are also important tools of Monitoring. State specific reviews of States are also undertaken from time to time. Officers of the Ministry and National Level Monitors also visit various districts to oversee the performance of Mahatma Gandhi NREGS. As per Centralized Public Grievance Redressal and Monitoring System (CPGRAMS), the status of corruption and cases of other irregularities under Mahatma Gandhi NREGS during the last four years (from 2015-16 to 2018-19) is given below:Category	                              Received	 Disposed     PendingCorruption and cases of other irregularities 	705	   556	       149****
