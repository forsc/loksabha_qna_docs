ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (c) As per Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs Annual Report for the year 2016-17, it is estimated that the total generation of solid waste is approximately 1,50,000 T/day. Out of the total, approximately 90% (1,35000 MT/day) is collected. Out of the collected waste, 20% (27,000 MT/day) is processed and the remaining 80% (10,8000MT/day) is going to the dump sites. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) conducted study in 60 major cities of India and estimated that around 4059 ton per day of plastic waste is generated from these cities. Extrapolating this it is estimated that around 25,940 ton per day of plastic waste is generated in the country. The CPCB in 2005 estimated 1.47 lakh ton of e-waste in the country. As per the United Nations University report, “The Global E-Waste Monitor 2017”, 20 lakh ton of e-waste generation was reported in the country in 2016. As per information available with CPCB 69,414 MT of e-waste was collected, dismantled and recycled during 2017-18. The inventory of e-waste generation state wise has not been completed for all the states and only six states namely Goa, J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Punjab have completed the inventory of e-waste generation. Quantity of hazardous waste generation in the country was around 7.17 million ton during 2016-17, of which 3.68 million ton (49.46%) was recycled. The quantum of waste deposited into landfills have not been estimated. The state wise generation of solid waste, hazardous waste, e-waste and city wise generation of plastic waste is enclosed at Annex I.(d)&(e) For sound management of various type of wastes, the Government had comprehensively revised and notified various waste management rules in 2016 on hazardous waste, E-waste, solid waste, plastic waste, construction & demolition waste and bio-medical waste. The rules emphasize on recycling and material recovery and provide for technological options for management of such wastes. The recycler/ operator/ generator may opt for any recycling/ resource recovery technological options, after due evaluation by prescribed authorities viz. State Pollution Control Boards/Committees, Central Pollution Control Board, Local Bodies.CPCB has published guidelines for environmentally sound recycling of commonly recyclable hazardous wastes (such as used/waste oil, zinc dross, copper dross, used lead acid battery, etc. CPCB has prepared 52 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for utilization of 40 different types of hazardous wastes after conducting trial runs. The CPCB in its guidelines for collection, segregation & disposal of plastic waste has prescribed for technological solutions including utilization of plastic waste in road construction, co-processing in cement kilns, conversion of plastic waste into refused derived fuel (RDF) and disposal of plastic waste through Plasma Pyrolysis Technology. Similarly, the Biomedical Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016 prescribe segregation, collection, pre-treatment followed by channelization of waste plastic, glass and metals to authorized recyclers as well as disposal of infectious incinerable bio-medical waste through   incineration. Further, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is undertaking research and development projects for e-waste recycling/recovery and has set up the following demonstration/ pilot projects:•	Demonstration plant at Bangalore on “Environmentally Sound Methods for Recovery of Metals from Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) – Phase II” operated by Centre for Materials for Electronics Technology (C-MET), Hyderabad and E-Parisara, Bengaluru.•	Pilot plant at National Metallurgical Laboratory (NML), Jamshedpur involving physical separation and chemical leaching methods for recycling/recovery of electronic waste;•	Demonstration plant at Central Institute of Plastics Engineering & Technology (CIPET), Bhubaneswar on converting plastics from e-waste to virgin master batch for use in value added products. The process is capable of converting about 76% of waste plastic into master batch.***
