                                                    (a)      the efforts made by the Government to reduce the number of rat hole mining incidents;(b)       whether the Government has made any provision for financial assistance in this regard; and(c)       whether the Government has been successful in reducing the number of accidents due to such mines?






ANSWER




 MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a to c) Rat hole mining is illegal and illegal mining is a law & order issue, which is a State subject, hence primarily falls under the domain of the State/District administration to take necessary deterrent action. No rat holes mining is being done in any coal mine of Coal India Limited and its subsidiaries. All the coal mining operations of Coal India Limited and its subsidiaries are being done scientifically and methodically by adopting the appropriate technology and mining method after obtaining the mandatory working permissions from the Directorate General of Mines safety (DGMS). * * * *
