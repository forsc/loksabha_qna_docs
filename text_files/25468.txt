                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a): 	Under Public Distribution System (PDS) reforms, the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan for nation-wide portability National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013 ration cards is enabled in 33 States/UTs, covering almost 86.7% NFSA population (about 69 Crore NFSA beneficiaries) in the country. Delhi being the latest to enable the same from July 2021. Further, regular follow up has been done with 3 remaining States/UT of Assam, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal to enable the ONORC plan for the benefit of migrant NFSA beneficiaries..........2/--2-(b): 		In view of the COVID-19 related difficulties, all State/UT Governments have been requested to ensure distribution of both NFSA and PMGKAY foodgrains from all FPSs, on all days of the month and for extended hours/duration of the day for staggered and ensured distribution to all NFSA beneficiaries with all COVID safety protocols and COVID appropriate behavior at all FPSs and places of PDS operations. The lifting of foodgrains under the PM-GKAY Phase-III is completed by States/UTs, while almost 93% of Phase-III distribution is also achieved so far. Further, PM-GKAY Phase-IV is valid up to November 2021 and as per extant norms the States/UTs are required to complete the lifting of foodgrains for a distribution month up to the end of the respective month itself. (c): 		During the COVID-19 crisis, to ensure that no poor, needy and vulnerable beneficiary in the country suffer on account of non-availability of foodgrains, the Department under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PM-GKAY) had allocated nearly 322 LMT and 278 LMT foodgrains in the year 2020 and 2021 respectively, for free of cost distribution to all NFSA beneficiaries during the 8 months period in 2020 (from April to November 2020) and 7 months period in 2021 (from May to November 2021). These additional foodgrains are distributed to all beneficiaries over and above their regular monthly NFSA foodgrains. Further, States/UTs are also advised to make special efforts to encourage migrant NFSA beneficiaries to use the facility of ration cards portability under the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan.  ***
