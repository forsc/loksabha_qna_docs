ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF PLANNINGAND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF STATISTICSAND PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION                                 (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	Yes Sir. Under the Aspirational Districts Programme, 112 districts, across 26 states and 1 union territory, were selected based on a Composite Index of backwardness created from the database in the public domain. Out of the 112 districts, 35 districts were recommended by the Ministry of Home Affairs on the basis of their being adversely affected by the Left Wing Extremism. The list of data sets and the weights attached to them for selection of districts is attached at Annexure - I. While selecting the districts, it was also ensured that at least one district is selected from every State (except for Goa) and many districts are not selected from the same State. After selection, the list was shared with the respective State Governments with a request to recommend any change based on any objective criteria. Subsequently, these were incorporated while finalizing the list.    (b)	The Aspirational Districts Programme being a governance measure for greater efficiency, large infusion of additional fund from Government of India, is not envisaged. The programme aims at effective convergence of the existing Centre and State Government Schemes, in these Districts through collaboration between Centre, State, District Administration and the citizens. Under the Programme, each Aspirational District is monitored on 49 indicators, entailing 81 data points, across 5 sectors – Health & Nutrition, Education, Agriculture & Water Resources, Financial Inclusion & Skill Development and Basic Infrastructure. However, in order to promote the spirit of competition between the Districts, Government of India implements a special initiative under which additional allocation is being provided to the Aspirational Districts on the basis of performance. Every month, districts are assessed on the basis of monthly incremental progress and the best performing Districts in overall terms and in each of the five sectors are identified. The first and second rankers in overall terms are awarded Rs. 10 cr and 5 cr respectively. The first ranker from each of the five sectors is awarded Rs. 3 cr each. Therefore, every month, Rs. 30 cr is utilised from the JICA funds and given to these Aspirational Districts. As on date, total around Rs. 230 crores has been sanctioned to 81 Aspirational Districts in FY 2019-20 and FY 2020-21 for undertaking projects across the five focus sectors and meeting critical gaps.  This includes 7 districts in Bihar as given below under answer (c) The projects are under various stages of implementation.(c)	Thirteen Districts were identified from the State of Bihar under the Aspirational Districts Programme. The list of these districts is attached at Annexure – II. The following districts in Bihar have been sanctioned additional allocation on the basis of their performance in monthly rankings:District	Amount eligible for allocation (in Rs.)	Amount Sanctioned(in Rs. Cr)Begusarai	5 crores	5Gaya	3 crores	2.93Jamui	3 crores	3Nawada	3 crores	1.14Araria	1 crore	0.97Purnia	3 crores	2.63Katihar	3 crores	3(d)	While shortlisting the Aspirational Districts, the districts of Srikakulam and Gopalganj did not fall within the 112 districts based on Composite index of backwardness. Based on data set available in Jan 2018, the overall ranking in terms of backwardness of Srikakulam was 9th among 13 districts in Andhra Pradesh and Gopalganj was 30th among the 32 districts in Bihar.  Since 29 districts were relatively more backward than Gopalganj in Bihar, hence the district was not selected.  No recommendation for inclusion of Gopalganj district and Srikakulam district was received from the State Government. (e)	After selection of districts, the Aspirational Districts Programme calculates and maintains ranking of only 112 Aspirational Districts. Ranking of other Districts are not calculated under the programme. (f)	While Sitamarhi, Araria, Purnia, Katihar, Begusarai, Khagaria and Sheikhpura districts were chosen on the basis of their ranking in the Composite Index of Backwardness, the remaining six namely Aurangabad, Banka, Gaya, Jamui, Muzaffarpur and Nawada were also selected due to them being most affected by the Left Wing Extremism. As stated above, as per the available data sets enumerated in Annexure-I and their value as on January 2018, other districts were relatively poor performing than Gopalganj.                                     ***** Annexure – IList of data sets and weights used for selection of Aspirational DistrictsDATABASES	SECTOR	WEIGHTLandless households dependent on Manual labour (Socio Economic Caste Census – Deprivation 7)	Deprivation(25 %)	25%Ante natal care (National Health and Family Survey (NHFS) - 4)  Health & Nutrition(30 %)	7.5%Institutional delivery (NHFS-4) 		7.5%Stunting of children below 5 years (NHFS-4) 		7.5%Wasting in children below 5 years (NHFS-4) 		7.5%Elementary dropout rate (Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE) 2015-16) Education(15 %)	7.5%Adverse pupil teacher ratio (U-DISE 2015-16)		7.5%Un-electrified households (Ministry of Power)  Infra (30 %)	7.5%Households without individual toilets (Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation) 		7.5%Un-connected PMGSY village (Ministry of Rural Development)  		7.5%Rural Household without access to water (Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation) 		7.5%Total 		100% Annexure – IIList of 13 Aspirational Districts in BiharSl.
