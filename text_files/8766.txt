(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	Though there is no proposal to amend the basic features of the PM-Kisan Scheme, many procedural changes / interventions have been made in the implementation of scheme in accordance with the provisions of the Operational Guidelines of the Scheme from time-to-time. Some important procedural changes / interventions are enumerated below:i.	Special identification procédures have been devised for the States of Manipur and Nagaland in view of the community  based land ownership in these states. ii.	Special identification procédure has been devised for the State of Jharkhand which does not have updated land records, as for many decades the mutation of land records on the basis of succession have not been recorded. iii.	The benefit of the Scheme has also been extended to forest dweller tribals who have been given ‘Pattas’ under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006. iv.	All land holding farmer families who are Non-resident Indians (NRIs) in terms of the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 have been excluded from the benefit under the Scheme.v.	The Common Service Centres (CSCs) have also been authorized to do registration of the farmers for the Scheme upon payment of fees. vi.	An exclusive ‘Farmers Corner’ has been provided in the PM-Kisan Web-portal through which the farmers can do their self-registration. Farmers can also edit their names in PM-Kisan database as per their Aadhaar card through the Farmers Corner. Farmers can also know the status of their payment through the Farmers Corner. The village-wise names of the beneficiaries are also available in the Farmers Corner.******
