                                                        MINISTER OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE AND CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS(SHRI MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a)	& (b):	 Urea is provided to the farmers at a statutorily notified Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of Rs.242 per 45 kg bag (exclusive of charges towards neem coating and taxes as applicable). The difference between the delivered cost of urea at farm gate and net market realization by the urea units is given as subsidy to the urea manufacturer/importer by the Government of India. Therefore, urea is supplied to all farmers at the subsidized rates. Government has implemented Nutrient Based Subsidy Policy w.e.f. 1.4.2010 for Phosphatic and Potassic (P&K) Fertilizers.  Under the policy, a fixed amount of subsidy, decided on annual basis, is provided on subsidised P&K fertilizers depending on their nutrient content. Under this policy, MRP is fixed by fertilizer companies as per market dynamics at reasonable level which is monitored by the Government.At present, Government is giving subsidy on 24 grades of P&K fertilizers. The name of the fertilizers under NBS scheme are attached as Annexure A.(c) & (d): The Department of fertilizers has successfully implemented Direct Benefit Transfer system across all States/U.Ts by 1st March 2018. Under the fertilizer DBT system, 100% subsidy on various fertilizer grades is released to the fertilizer companies on the basis of actual sales made by the retailers to the beneficiaries. Sale of all subsidised fertilizers to farmers/buyers is made through Point of Sale (PoS) devices installed at each retailer shop and the beneficiaries will be identified through Aadhaar Card, KCC, Voter Identity Card etc.ANNEXURE – AThe name of the fertilizers under NBS schemeSl.No	P&K Fertilizer grades under NBS	     Sl.No	             P&K Fertilizer grades under NBS1	DAP : 18-46-0-0	                       13	             NPK 16-16-16-02	MOP : 0-0-60-0	                       14	             NPS 16-20-0-133	SSP : 0-16-0-11                        15	             NPK 14–35–144	NPS 20–20–0-13	                       16	             NPS 24-24-0-8* (Subsidy on                                                                      Sulphur is not paid)5	NPK 10–26–26-0	                       17	             MAP : 11-52-0-06	NP 20-20-0-0	                       18	             TSP : 0-46-0-07	NPK 15–15–15	                       19	             NPK 12–32–168	NP 24-24-0-0	                       20	             NPK 14–28–149	AS: 20.5-0-0-23	                       21	             NPKS 15-15-15-0910	NP 28–28–0-0	                       22	             NP 14-28-0-011	NPK 17–17–17	                       23	             NPK 8-21-2112.
