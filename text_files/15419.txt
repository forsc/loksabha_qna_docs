ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) 	As per the information available with the Ministry, 27,242 Indians have died abroad, including those working there during the last three years and this year. Country-wise detailed list is given at Annexure.  (b) to (d)	The process of transportation of mortal remains to India involves various steps, most of which are to be undertaken by the local authorities in the country concerned. The following are the steps involved in transportation of mortal remains from a foreign country, viz.Medical report / death certificate issued from the hospital concerned;Police report (with English translation, if report is in some other language), in case of accidental or unnatural death;Consent letter from next of kin of the deceased for local cremation / burial / transportation of mortal remains; Clearance and arrangements for embalming of mortal remains from the authorities concerned in the foreign country;Clearance from local immigration/ customs department.Clearance from Indian customs authorities.These procedures differ somewhat from country to country and therefore there is no fixed time frame for eventual transportation. Government of India attaches high priority to addressing and resolving the issue pertaining to Transportation of Mortal remains of Indian nationals who die abroad. Our Missions/ Posts liaise with the foreign officials concerned to expedite procedures for the repatriation of mortal remains to India and extend all possible assistance to the family of the deceased. Generally, the transportation of mortal remains is quicker in cases of natural deaths in comparison to the cases of unnatural deaths, due to local procedures involved in those countries for investigating the cause of death in case of unnatural death.***
