ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI  R.K. SINGH)(a) :		The total requirement of coal and gas for the power plants (Coal based as well as Gas based) monitored in Central Electricity Authority (CEA), State-wise and plant-wise including in Maharashtra, during 2021-22,  is given at Annexure.(b) :		The details of total coal receipt (Domestic as well as Imported coal) by coal based power plants as well as gas receipt/consumed by gas based power plants during last 3 years and the current year (Apr’21- Jun’21) are as under: 	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21	2021-22          (Apr- June)Total coal Receipt (Domestic + Imported)(Million Tonnes)	643.7	638.7	596.3	171.7Total Gas Receipt      (in MMSCMD*)	30.99	29.50	30.08	25.91*MMSCMD: Million Metric Standard Cubic Meter per day. (c) & (d) :	The receipt of coal has registered a slight decline during the last three years. However, during 2020-21 the decline was more due to the effect of COVID-19 pandemic prevailing in the country. Moreover, the share of power generation from non-fossil fuels (renewable energy) has also been increasing consistently over the years resulting into reduction in share of power generation from fossil fuels and also leading to reduction in plant load factor of coal based power plants. The gas consumption by gas based power plants is almost consistent at about 30 MMSCMD.(e) :		In order to address the issues of coal supplies to power sector, an Inter-Ministerial Sub Group comprising of representatives from Ministry of Power, Ministry of Coal, Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Shipping, CEA, NTPC and Coal India Limited (CIL)/ Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) meet regularly to take various operational decisions for meeting any contingent situations relating to Power Sector including critical coal stock position in power plants.Further, the Government has taken the following steps to help the plants to meet their requirement of coal and gas:(i)	Government in May, 2016 allowed flexibility in utilization of domestic coal by State/Central Gencos amongst their generating stations to reduce the cost of power generation by using coal in most efficient plants as well as by saving in transportation cost. The States may also transfer their linkage coal to Independent Power Producers (IPPs) selected through bidding process and take equivalent power.(ii)	Rationalization of linkage sources of State/Central Gencos and IPPs with a view to optimize transportation cost has been allowed.(iii)	Government has introduced a scheme SHAKTI (Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyala (Coal) Transparently in India)-2017, to provide coal linkages to the power plants which do not have linkage.  As per amendment in Shakti Policy dated 25.03.2019, Coal linkage is also allowed for short term   sale of power in Day Ahead Market (DAM) through power exchanges or in short term through a transparent bidding process through Discovery of Efficient Energy Price (DEEP) portal.(iv)	Domestic gas is being allocated to the gas based power generating stations as per the availability of domestic gas in the country. Imported RLNG (Regasified Liquefied  Natural Gas)  is kept under Open General License (OGL) and gas based power plants are free to import RLNG on mutually agreed terms and conditions.(v)	Government has taken several steps to enhance exploration & production of natural gas in the country such as Discovered Small Field Policy, Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy, Policy for Extension of Production Sharing Contracts, Policy for early monetization of Coal Bed Methane etc.***********
