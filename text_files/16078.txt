                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF WOMEN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT(SHRIMATI SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) to (d):	The percentage of women (in the age group of 20-24 years), who were married before the age of 18 years, has  reduced from 47.4% in 2005-06 as per National Family Health Survey(NFHS)-3 to 26.8% in 2015-16 as per the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-4.  As per National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) Report, State-wise number of child marriages reported in the country during the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 is at Annexure.	The Government of India has enacted the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 in order to prohibit child marriages rather than only restraining them. The States/UTs are being pursued from time to time for effective implementation of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. Ministry of Women and Child Development, Government of India regularly sends out letters to States/UTs to increase alertness to prevent underage marriages during festivals such as Akshaya Tritiya/Akha Teej etc. 	The practice of Child Marriages is largely due to the prevailing social customs, tradition, illiteracy, poverty, low status of women in society and lack of awareness. These issues cannot be tackled by legislative interventions alone. The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) scheme envisages education of girls and reduce dropouts, thus delaying their marriage. A significant part of the BBBP advocacy campaign is focused on creating awareness on and discouraging the practice of child marriage. This is a continuous process and Government undertakes media campaigns and outreach programmes to address the issue of child marriage.
