                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR POWER, NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR SKILL DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP( SHRI  R.K. SINGH)  (a) & (b) : 	Yes, Sir.  Power theft leads to loss of revenues to the Power Distribution utilities and thereby impairs their ability to supply uninterrupted, quality power supply to consumers. The aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses of state power distribution utilities in the country in FY 2018-19 was 22.03%. (c)  to (e) : 	There are specific provisions in the Electricity Act 2003 (section 126 and sections 135 to 140) relating to theft and unauthorized use of electricity including stiff penal provisions and speedy trial for such offenses by Special Courts (Part XV of the Electricity Act 2003). Government of India has provided assistance to the States under the schemes Deen Dayal Gram Jyoti Yojana and integrated power Development Scheme for strengthening of the distribution network with the aim of reducing theft and AT&C losses.*******
