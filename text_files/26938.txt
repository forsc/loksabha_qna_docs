The projects are taken up on the basis of remunerativeness, last mile connectivity, missing links and alternate routes, augmentation of congested/ saturated lines, socio-economic considerations etc. depending upon throw forward of ongoing projects, overall availability of funds etc. Presently, 35 Projects (16 New Lines, 2 Gauge Conversion and 17 Doubling), costing `91,137 crore for 6,142 km length falling fully/ partly in Maharashtra are under different stages of planning/ approval/ execution, out of which 906 km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `18,008 crore has been incurred upto March, 2021.
