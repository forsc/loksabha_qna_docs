MURALEEDHARAN](a)	As per the Government of Sri Lanka’s statistics, 8,83,185 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) who are predominantly Tamil speaking have been resettled  in Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka since 2011. This constitutes 97% of the total IDPs displaced due to three decade long internal conflict. 35,926 IDPs remain to be resettled. Government of Sri Lanka is taking measures to rehabilitate them at the earliest. (b)	Government of India, in consultation with the Government of Sri Lanka, has undertaken a number of projects for rehabilitation of the IDPs which include provision of family packs, roofing sheets, cement bags, agricultural starter packs, bicycles, tractors, seeds, boats, fishing nets as well as setting up of fishnet factory, industrial estate in Atchuvely among others in addition to 46,000 houses for them. Government of India has also committed to undertake further people oriented community development projects for the people of the region on the request of Government of Sri Lanka. (c) to (f)	Indian Housing Project, for construction of 50,000 houses worth INR 1372 Crore in grants, is the major initiative aimed at rehabilitation of the affected population. Of the 50,000 houses committed, 46000 housing units were meant for the IDPs in the Northern and Eastern provinces and they have been completed and handed over to the beneficiaries. The remaining 4000 housing units were earmarked for the estate workers in the plantation areas and are nearing completion. The provision of 10,000 bicycles to the returning IDPs in the Northern Province was completed in February 2013 at a cost of INR 2.70 crore. Currently, several projects under grant assistance including the construction of Jaffna Cultural Centre at a cost of around INR 80 crore, construction of new classroom buildings for 27 schools, 3000 rainwater harvesting units and development of Palaly Airport in the Northern Province and construction of Hospital buildings for Batticaloa Teaching Hospital, auditorium in the Eastern University and sanitation units/toilets in Batticaloa district in Eastern Province among others are under progress and the projects are expected to be completed soon. In addition, Government has undertaken restoration of arterial railway lines, connecting the North and the South under Indian Line of Credit.  Financial assistance for Upgradation of Kankesanthurai (KKS) Harbour is also being provided.  ***
