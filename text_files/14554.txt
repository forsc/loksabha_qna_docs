                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)  to (d):	According to Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), no time trend study has been conducted to find out reported increase in prevalence of Kidney Disease. However, it is estimated that every year about 2.2 lakh new patients of End Stage Renal Disease get added in India.As per National Cancer Registry Programme of Indian Council of Medical Research, the estimated incidence of cancer cases in Bihar was 1.31 lakh in 2016, which increased to 1.45 lakhs in 2018.  Under Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Programme (PMNDP), State Governments are supported for providing dialysis services free of cost to the poor under the Umbrella of the National Health Mission(NHM).  Such support is based on the proposals received from States in their annual Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs).As per available information, the dialysis services are being provided in 17 districts out of total 38 districts in Bihar with 66 Haemodialysis machines. To enhance the facilities for tertiary care of cancer, the Central Government is implementing Strengthening of Tertiary Care for Cancer Scheme. The scheme envisaged setting up of 20 State Cancer Institutes (SCIs) and 50 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres (TCCCs). Setting up of 19 State Cancer Institutes and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres have been approved under the scheme, including State Cancer Institute at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), Patna.  State/UTs-wise list of approved SCIs and TCCCs is at Annexure.   Further, Oncology is also one of the focus areas in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar in Haryana and strengthening of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata, are also steps in the same direction.
