ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI THAAWAR CHAND GEHLOT)(a)	to (c) A statement is laid on the table of the House Statement referred to in reply to part (a) to (c) of the Lok Sabha Starred Question No.  156 raised by Shri Feroze Varun Gandhi, regarding “Reservation for Differently Abled Persons” for answer on 02.07.2019(a)	& (b) As per Section 33 of the erstwhile Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 (the PwD Act, 1995), every appropriate Government was required to earmark not less than 3% of the vacancies for persons with disabilities in Government establishments. The PwD Act, 1995 has since been repealed and the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act, 2016) has come into force from 19.04.2017. As per Section 34(1) of the RPwD Act, 2016, every appropriate Government is required to earmark not less than 4% of the total number of vacancies in the cadre strength in each group of posts meant to be filled with persons with benchmark disabilities in Government establishments.      So far as Central Government establishment is concerned, in terms of the provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016, Department of Personnel and Training has issued a circular on 15.01.2018 specifying 4% reservation in vacancies for persons with benchmark disabilities.   State Governments are the appropriate Government with respect to their establishments in the States. State-wise data regarding employment of persons with disabilities by the States is therefore not compiled in the Ministry. (c)  The Expenditure Finance Committee has, in-principle, recommended the proposal for establishment of Centre for Disability Sports at Shillong, Meghalaya. The Government of Meghalaya has allotted 50 acres of land free of cost for the purpose.Government of Meghalaya has also agreed to provide interim accommodation for setting up of Composite Regional Centre in the State. *****
