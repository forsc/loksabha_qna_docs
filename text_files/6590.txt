Against this, as on 30.09.2019, steel silos of 7.25 LMT capacity have been created. The State-wise details of the number of silos sanctioned (work awarded) and constructed as on 30.09.2019 are at Annexure. The silo developers for construction are selected through tender process. Subsequently, in the Concession Agreement signed between the Authority (i.e. Food Corporation of India/State Government Agencies) and the Concessionaire (developer), timelines are specified for completion of construction of steel silos and non-adherence to these timelines leads to imposition of penalty on the concessionaire. Therefore, this process of construction of steel silos has an in-built feature of specified timelines to complete the construction of steel silos.****ANNEXUREANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF THE UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.346 DUE FOR ANSWERED ON 19.11.2019 IN THE LOK SABHA.The State-wise details of number of steel silos sanctioned (work awarded) and completed are as given below (as on 30.09.2019):Agency	State	Sanctioned(work awarded)	CompletedFood Corporation of India (FCI)	Assam	01	-	Bihar	12	-	Delhi	01	-	Gujarat	05	-	Haryana	06	-	Maharashtra	01	-	Punjab	08	03	Uttar Pradesh	10	-	West Bengal	01	-State Governments	Madhya Pradesh	09	09	Punjab	31	03Total	85	15*****
