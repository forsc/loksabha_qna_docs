ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE (a) & (b):	Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is introduced by a Central Bank. Government has received a proposal from Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in October, 2021 for amendment to the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 to enhance the scope of the definition of ‘bank note’ to include currency in digital form.RBI has been examining use cases and working out a phased implementation strategy for introduction of CBDC with little or no disruption. (c) & (d):	Introduction of CBDChas the potential to provide significant benefits, such as reduced dependency on cash, higher seigniorage due to lower transaction costs, reduced settlement risk. Introduction of CBDC would also possibly lead to a more robust, efficient, trusted, regulated and legal tender-based payments option. There are also associated risks which need to be carefully evaluated against the potential benefits.
