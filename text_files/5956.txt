The demand validated and reported by States/UTs under PMAY(U) to this Ministry so far is around 112 lakh.  This validated demand can increase in coming years based on the demand survey conducted by the States/UTs. PMAY(U) aims to provide houses to all eligible beneficiaries by the year 2022, based on such demand surveys.(d):	No, Sir.                        ****
