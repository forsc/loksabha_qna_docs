                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT IN REPLY TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO 91 FOR ANSWER ON 08.02.2022 REGARDING RENEWAL OF LICENCES UNDER FCRA(a) to (c):	No, Sir.  In fact, about 5800 FCRA registered associations had not submitted their applications for renewal within stipulated time in accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010. FCRA registration of these associations has  thus deemed to have ceased as per section 12 of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 read with rule 12 of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Rules, 2011.  In view of Covid-19 pandemic, the Government has given certain relaxations to NGOs so that welfare programmes and Covid related relief works are not affected. Main relaxations in this regard include the following:-(i) Validity of registration certificate of NGOs expiring between 29.09.2020 to 31.12.2021 had been extended till 31.12.2021. The validity has been further extended with certain conditions upto 31.03.2022.(ii) Time period to file Annual Returns for year 2019-20 was extended by six month i.e. till 30.06.2021.(iii) FCRA associations were allowed to receive foreign contribution in their old main FCRA account upto 30.06.2021.(d) & (e):	Section 32 of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 provides  for  revision  by  the  Central  Government of any order passed in a proceeding against any association registered under the Act. The application for revision is considered and disposed of on merits under the above provision of the Act. Since November, 2021 the FCRA certificate of Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), New Delhi and Missionaries of Charity (MoC), Kolkata was renewed by way of revision.*****
