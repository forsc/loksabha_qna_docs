                                                        (a)	The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has launched a Portal for Affordable Credit and Interest Subvention Access (PAiSA), on November 26, 2018 for online credit of interest subvention to individuals/ groups/ Self Help Groups who have availed bank loans for setting up self-employment ventures or  micro-enterprises  under  Self  Employment    Programme (SEP) component of the “Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM)”. The Portal aggregates banks, States and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) on a single platform, facilitating real time exchange of information, and provides a simple mechanism to process interest subvention on monthly basis through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) mode. So far, a total of 28 States/UTs and 144 Banks are on-boarded on the Portal. Since inception of the Portal, 1,23,391 number of beneficiaries of the Mission have received interest subvention amounting to Rs. 40,04,59,470/-till November 21, 2019. Statement showing state-wise details of interest subvention paid through PAiSA Portal is annexed. (b) & (c) This Ministry is implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, namely, “Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM)” to reduce poverty and vulnerability of urban poor households by enabling them to access gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities, for improvement in their livelihoods on a sustainable basis. The mission also aims at building strong grassroot level institutions for the urban poor. Further, the mission aims at providing shelters equipped with essential services to the urban homeless. In addition, the Mission also aims at addressing livelihood concerns of the urban street vendors by facilitating access to suitable spaces, institutional credit, social security, etc.                             *****
