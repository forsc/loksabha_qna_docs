ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.***** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 2808 BY SHRI M. SELVARAJ TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 10.07.2019  REGARDING LAYING NEW TRACK BETWEEN THIRUTHURAIPOONDI-VELANKANNI(a) to (d): No work of new line is sanctioned  from Tiruturaipundi to Velankanni. However, two separate new line works namely Nagapattinam-Velankanni (10 Km) & Nagapattinam-Tiruturaipundi (43 Km) were sanctioned as material modification to Tiruchchirappalli-Nagore gauge conversion project.  The details of these 02 new lines works is as under:-1.	Nagapattinam-Velankanni new line (10 Km) was sanctioned during 1999-2000 and after completion of construction work, the section has been commissioned.2.	Nagapattinam-Tiruturaipundi new line work (43 Km) was sanctioned during 2008-09 at a cost of ` 126.14 crore and works related to land acquisition, earthwork and bridge works have been taken up wherever the land is available.	The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground & over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological & topographical conditions of area, law & order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic considerations, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions of working...2/--2-agencies/contractors etc. and all these factors affects the completion cost of the project, which is finally worked out at the completion stage.In the overall interest of the Nation and to ensure that projects are completed in time without cost overrun, lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, Divisional level, Zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and concerned authorities to resolve the pending issues that are obstructing the progress of projects.To ensure that projects are completed even before time, Railway has adopted the concept of incentives to the contractor in the form of bonus clause in contracts which will further enhance the pace of execution of projects.        For important projects, capacity enhancement projects, last mile connectivity etc. institutional financing has been done by arranging loan of  ` 1.5 lakh crore, which has increased Railways’  capacity for committed fund provision for essential projects.Since complete encumbrance free land has still not been handed over by State Government to the Railways, therefore, no confirmed time frame can be fixed for completion of projects at this stage. Nevertheless, an expenditure of ` 637.74 crore has been incurred on Tiruchchirappalli-Nagore gauge conversion project including above mentioned material modifications upto March 2019 and an outlay of ` 40 crore has been provided during 2019-20.*****
