                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c):   Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) forwarded, for comments of this Ministry, the Tamil Nadu Admission to MBBS and BDS Courses Bill, 2017 and the Tamil Nadu Admission to Post Graduate in Medicine and Dentistry Bill, 2017 as passed by the Legislative Assembly of the State of Tamil Nadu and submitted for assent of the President. The said Bill sought to provide for exemption to the State of Tamil Nadu from the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to undergraduate and postgraduate medical / dental courses. Since, the provisions of the proposed Bills were in direct contravention of Section 10D of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 and of the Dentists Act, 1948 which prescribe conducting of a uniform entrance examination i.e. NEET for admission to medical / dental courses, this Ministry did not agree with the proposed Bill and conveyed their comments to MHA. Further, the MHA also forwarded, for comments of this Ministry, the Indian Medical Council (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Ordinance, 2017 and the Dentist (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Ordinance, 2017 submitted by the State of Tamil Nadu, for the similar purpose, for obtaining previous instructions of the President for its promulgation. The proposed Ordinances were also not supported by this Ministry.
