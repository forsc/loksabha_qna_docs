ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c): There are over 20 Central Ministries/ Departments including the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) which are involved in the implementation of over 40 skill development schemes for meeting the needs of various sectors of the economy including the manufacturing sector. MSDE is implementing the following schemes viz. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) and National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) for short-duration skill training; and Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS) through the Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) and Crafts Instructor Training Scheme (CITS) through 33 National Skill Training Institutes (NSTIs) for long-term training. Short-term trainingUnder PMKVY, short-duration training is provided through three routes, namely Short-Term Training (STT) for fresh skilling of school / college drop outs and unemployed youth; Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) to recognize the existing skills through orientation; and Special Projects to address skilling requirements of the vulnerable groups. From 2016-17 to 2020-21 (up to 19.01.2021), 106.96 lakh candidates have been trained across all three formats in job roles pertaining to various sectors including 31.93 lakh candidates trained in the manufacturing sector. During this period, 18.95 lakh candidates from STT and Special Projects training routes have been reported placed in various sectors including 5.34 lakh candidates in manufacturing sector jobs. RPL orients candidates and does not mandate placements. In addition, under the fee-based market-led model of the National Skill Development Corporation, 24,025 trainings and 7,973 placements have been done in manufacturing since inception of this model in 2014-15. Under NAPS, the number of candidates trained since 2016-17 for various job roles including manufacturing sector job roles is 9.60 lakh. This scheme does not have placement as a criteria.   Long-term trainingUnder CTS, the number of candidates trained since 2016-17 for various job roles in 137 trades including manufacturing sector job roles is 52.98 lakh. This scheme does not have placement as a criteria. Under CITS, the number of persons who have received skill training during the last ten years and 2020-21 is 2.36 lakh. After completion of CITS training, the trained individuals can be employed as Crafts Instructor in ITIs in their corresponding trades/ sectors and can also join the industry as Technicians.
