ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a):	The agricultural price policy of the Government is aimed at providing remunerative price to farmers. For this purpose, Government declares Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for 22 mandated agricultural crops and fair and remunerative price(FRP) for sugarcane which account for 99 percent of the agricultural production (does not include horticulture) in the country. As productivity level, cost and returns vary in the country depending on agro-climatic conditions, MSPs are being fixed after providing for a 50% margin over all India weighted average cost of production. A statement showing cost, MSP and returns of 22 mandated agricultural crops for last 3 years is at Annex -I.Contd….2/--2-Government also implements Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) for horticultural crops which are perishable in nature and some agricultural crops which are not covered under the MSP on the request of State/UT Government concerned. The objective of intervention is to protect the growers of these commodities from making distress sale in the event of a bumper crop during the peak arrival period when the prices tend to fall below economic levels and cost of production. (b):	The prices of agricultural produce are determined by supply and demand conditions in the market on a day-to-day basis. Wholesale  prices of agricultural produce tend to fall immediately after harvest due to increase in market arrival of new crops in a lumpy manner. However, retail prices of milled agricultural products are generally much higher than MSP. Details of MSP and retail prices of foodgrains are given at Annex 2.(c) & (d):	Government receives representations from time to time on various issues concerning agriculture sector. Government is committed to farmer’s welfare and towards this objective it has changed its strategy from being production centric to an income centric one. Accordingly, Government has increased MSPs for all mandated crops with a return of at least 50 percent over all India weighted average cost of production for the season 2018-19.Apart from increasing MSPs, Government has taken several steps to provide remunerative prices to farmers for their produce which include undertaking procurement through designated procurement agencies, implementing e-National Agriculture Market (e-NAM), enacting the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2017 and promoting Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs).The Government is working on a market architecture, so as to ensure that farmers get remunerative prices on their produce.  These include setting up of Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs) so as to promote 22,000 number of retail markets in close proximity of farm gate; competitive and transparent wholesale trade at APMC through e-NAM; and a robust and pro-farmer export policy. The Umbrella Scheme ‘Pradhan Mantri  Annadata  Aay  SanraksHan  Abhiyan’ (PM-AASHA) announced by the government is also a progressive step in this direction. The Umbrella Scheme consists of three sub-schemes i.e. Price Support Scheme (PSS), Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) and Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme (PPSS) on a pilot basis.Interim Union Budget 2019 had announced a historic programme namely “Pradhan Mantri KIsan SAmman Nidhi (PM-KISAN)”. Under this programme, landholding farmer families will be provided direct income support at the rate of Rs. 6,000  per year. The PM-KISAN scheme aims to supplement the financial needs of the farmers in procuring various inputs to ensure proper crop health and appropriate yields, commensurate with the anticipated farm income at the end of the each crop cycle.
