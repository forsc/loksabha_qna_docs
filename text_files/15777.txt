                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a)   Flood Management including erosion control falls within the purview of the States. The flood management & anti-erosion schemes are planned, investigated and implemented by the State Governments with own resources as per priority within the State. The Union Government only renders assistance to States which is technical, advisory, catalytic and promotional in nature. The State Government of Uttar Pradesh has informed that in the District Bijnaur of Uttar Pradesh, Flood Control and Anti-Erosion Scheme to protect villages Ghauspur, Sukhapur, Kudanpur, Mirzapur, Simli, Rajarampur, Raghunathpur, etc. located on left bank of river Ganga has been contemplated by State Government within an estimated cost of Rs.6113.80 Lakhs.(b) & (c)  The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component and 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). The Pre-feasibility reports of all the 30 links have been completed and circulated to party States. The Feasibility Reports of 14 links under Peninsular Component and 2 links under Himalayan Component have been prepared. Under the NPP, four priority links have also been identified for preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPR) under the Peninsular Rivers Component viz; Ken-Betwa link project (KBLP), Damanganga-Pinjal link project, Par-Tapi-Narmada link project and Godavari-Cauvery link project. Basfed on the concurrence of the concerned States, DPRs of KBLP, Damanganga-Pinjal link project and Par-Tapi-Narmada link project, have been completed and sent to concerned States.Further, draft DPR of Godavari-Cauvery link project consisting of three links viz; Godavari (Inchampalli/Janampet) – Krishna (Nagarjunasagar), Krishna (Nagarjunasagar) – Pennar (Somasila), Pennar (Somasila)-Cauvery (Grand Anicut) link projects, has been completed and circulated to party States in March 2019.Government has taken up the Inter Linking River (ILR) programme in a consultative manner and accorded high priority. The implementation of National Perspective Plan would give benefits of 25 million ha of irrigation from surface waters, 10 million ha by increased use of ground waters, raising the ultimate irrigation potential from 140 million ha to 175 million ha and generation of 34 million KW of power, apart from the incidental benefits of flood control, drought mitigation, navigation, water supply, fisheries, salinity and pollution control etc.*****
