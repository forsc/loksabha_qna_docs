ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)   (a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.******STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 3726 BY SHRI RAHUL KASWAN TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 11.12.2019 REGARDING PRIORITY IN RESERVATION UNDER SPECIAL QUOTA(a) and (b): In order to meet the urgent travel requirements of High Official Requisition (HOR) holders (which includes Central Government Ministers, Judges of Hon’ble Supreme Court/High Courts of various States), Members of Parliament and other emergent demands, who are on the waiting list, a limited number of berths/seats have been earmarked as Emergency Quota in different trains and in different classes. The quota is released by the Railways in accordance with the priority as per warrant of precedence and well-established practice being followed since long.  At the time of allotment of berths/seats, emergency quota is first allotted for self travel of HOR holders/Members of Parliament, etc., strictly as per their inter-se seniority in warrant of precedence. Thereafter, other requisitions received from various quarters including those from Members of Parliament are considered and the remaining quota is released taking into account various factors like official status of passengers travelling, nature of urgency like travelling on government duty, bereavement in the family, sickness, job interview, etc. While the requests received from HOR holders/Hon’ble Members of Parliament for their self travel are complied with, in case of requests forwarded by them for other than self travel, at times, it is not feasible to accommodate all such requests when the demand exceeds the availability.(c): With a view to avoid misuse of facility of release of accommodation out of Emergency Quota by unscrupulous elements, the emergency quota is released based on written requests received from authorized officials in original  and through fax after due verification.  No instructions for accepting such requests through       e-mail or Whatsapp have been issued by Ministry of Railways. (d): Does not arise. *****
