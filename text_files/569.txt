                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a):       Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) has developed cost effective, location specific scientific technologies for supplemental/lifesaving irrigation in dryland/rainfed situations including drought affected areas.          The farmers are given advisories for adoption of modern agronomic practices like raised bed sowing, alternate furrow irrigation, furrow irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, drip irrigation, mulching, Direct Seeded Rice (DSR), System of Rice Intensification (SRI), laser land leveling, adoption of drought tolerant varieties, and  diversifying cropping pattern with low water requiring crops like pulses, oilseeds, maize and agro-forestry. Trainings and Field Level Demonstrations etc. are conducted to educate farmers on all these aspects.             ICAR has also developed and demonstrated climate resilient technologies under “National Innovations on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA)”. In addition, 648 District Agricultural Contingency Plans have been developed for preparedness and real time implementation in the events of weather aberrations and extreme climatic events including drought.  Contd…2/--2-(b):	      Water Resources Projects are planned, funded, executed and maintained by the State Governments themselves as per their own resources and priority. In order to supplement their efforts, the Ministry of Jal Shakti provides technical and financial assistance to State Governments to encourage sustainable development and efficient management of water resources through various schemes and programmes, such as, Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) etc. under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY).  During 2016-17, ninety-nine(99) Major/Medium irrigation projects under PMKSY-AIBP having ultimate irrigation potential of 76.03 lakh ha have been prioritized in consultation with States, for completion in phases upto December, 2019 along with their Command Area Development & Water Management (CADWM) works. Out of these projects, 59 projects are benefitting/partially benefitting the drought prone areas. Ultimate potential of these projects is 47.03 lakh ha out of which 25.56 lakh ha was created upto 2015-16 and further a potential of 3.12 lakh ha and 6.18 lakh ha was created during 2016-17 and 2017-18 respectively through these 59 projects.              Besides, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare is implementing Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) component of PMKSY which focuses on enhancing water use efficiency at farm level through Micro Irrigation technologies viz. Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation. An area of 36.20 lakh ha has been covered under Micro Irrigation in the country from 2015-16 to 2018-19.**********
