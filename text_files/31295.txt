ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF JAL SHAKTI  (SHRI GAJENDRA SINGH SHEKHAWAT)(a)	to (d)   A statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****   STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF STARRED QUESTION NO.*274 TO BE ANSWERED ON 16.12.2021 IN LOK SABHA REGARDING “RESTORATION OF WATER BODIES” ASKED BY SHRI RAMESH BIDHURI AND SHRI JAYANT SINHA, HON’BLE M.P., LOK SABHA. (a) & (b)  A scheme titled Repair, Renovation and Restoration (RRR) of Water Bodies is being implemented under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana - Har Khet Ko Pani (PMKSY – HKKP). Objectives of the scheme include expanding cultivable area under assured irrigation by improvement and restoration of water bodies thereby increasing the tank storage capacity and revival of lost irrigation potential, improving water use efficiency, ground water recharge, increased availability of drinking water, improvement of catchment of tank commands, and development of tourism & cultural activities, etc.From XIIth Plan onwards, 2,218 water bodies with an estimated cost of about Rs. 1,910 crore have been included under RRR of water bodies scheme from various States. Total expenditure reported on these projects till March, 2021 is Rs. 963.82 crore, for which central assistance of Rs.469.68 crore has been released during this period. Out of these 2,218 water bodies, works in 1,591 water bodies have been completed till March, 2021.However,  no proposal for projects pertaining to NCR or Jharkhand have been received for inclusion under the scheme.(c)  Water being a State subject, it is for the State Governments concerned to take up schemes related to water bodies, including those for cleaning of traditional water bodies. Role of Government of India is limited to providing technical support and, in some cases, partial financial assistance under the existing schemes. In order to supplement the efforts of State Governments in this regard, Government of India has taken up a number of measures.Under RRR of water bodies scheme under Har Khet Ko Pani, work in some of the projects also includes cleaning of traditional water bodies. For the period April 2016 to March, 2021, a 924 projects have been included for repair, renovation and restoration of water bodies, under the scheme. Rs. 279.14 crore has been spent on these projects during April 2016 to March, 2021, against which central assistance of Rs.178.1 crore has been released during this period. Out of these, work for RRR of 428 water bodies has been completed during April, 2016 to March, 2021. However, none of these projects pertains to NCR or Jharkhand.Rejuvenation of water bodies, including cleaning of traditional water bodies, is also a component under water supply sector of Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme under Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs. Such projects with total estimated cost of Rs. 1,878.19 crore are ongoing/completed and 106 water bodies have been rejuvenated under this scheme. While there is no project under AMRUT from NCR, details of projects from Jharkhand under this scheme, are as below:  	Sr. No.	Name of City	Project Title	Cost (Rs. in crore)	Mile Stone	No of Water Bodies Rejuvenated1	Ranchi	Ranchi Water Supply (Ph-I)	266.15	Ongoing	42	Adityapur	Adityapur Water Supply Project	326.55	Ongoing	33	Chas	Chas Water Supply Project	129.29	Ongoing	34	Giridih	Giridih Water Supply Project	36.32	Completed	35	Dhanbad	Dhanbad Water Supply (Ph-I)	159.31	Ongoing	76	Hazaribag	Hazaribag Water Supply Project	416.56	Ongoing	4  (d)   Water being a State subject, it is for the State Governments concerned to take up programmes and schemes for prevention of encroachment of its water bodies. However, in order to supplement the efforts of State Governments, Government of India has taken up a number of important measures in this regard.In 2019, Jal Shakti Abhiyan was launched by the Government. This was followed in 2021, by “Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch The Rain” (JSA: CTR) campaign, taken up in all districts of the country, including NCR and Jharkhand. Focused interventions under these annual campaigns taken up by the Government of  India and the State Governments, inter-alia, include renovation of traditional and other water bodies/ tanks, enumeration, geo-tagging and making inventory of all water bodies, and removal of encroachments of tanks/ lakes, and de-silting of tanks.  *****
