Regular surveillance, monitoring, inspection and random sampling of food products including packaged drinking water is being done by the Officials of Food Safety Departments of the respective States/ UTs to check compliance of the standards laid down under Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and the rules and regulations made thereunder.
