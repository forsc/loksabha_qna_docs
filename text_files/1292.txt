ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)(a) & (b): Yes Sir. The Government sets up Urban Haat in big towns/metropolitan cities to provide direct marketing facilities to handicrafts artisans. The financial ceiling for Urban Haat is Rs. 300 Lakhs for each unit in which 80% of the admissible amount is borne by the Office of the Development Commissioner (Handicrafts) and 20% is contributed by the implementing agency. The land is also provided by implementing agency.  35 Urban Haats have been constructed throughout the country.(c) to (f): The proposals for setting up  Urban Haats for Sikar and Alwar were received from the state of Rajasthan. A PAMC meeting was held on 21.05.2013 under the Chairmanship of Development Commissioner (Handicrafts), wherein the proposal for construction of Sikar Urban Haat could not be considered as the State Government of Rajasthan had already been constructing Urban Haat at Sikar. Further, the land proposed by Implementing Agency for setting up Urban Haat at Alwar was not found suitable by the Committee. Accordingly, the implementing agency was requested to propose new venue for setting up Urban Haat at Alwar. At present, three Urban Haats are functional in Rajasthan at Ajmer, Jodhpur and Jaipur. ********
