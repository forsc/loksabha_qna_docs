                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ?? ????? ?????? ??????		               (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	Yes, Sir. The Government has been regularly assessing the services offered and work done by the Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs). The work of KVKs is assessed and reviewed every year by organizing Zonal Review Workshops. Besides, the Government also conducted Third Parties Evaluation through National Institute of Labour Economics Research and Development (NILERD) an autonomous organization of NITI Aayog and International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). The highlights of studies by NILERD and IFPRI are as follows:KVK Impact Study by NILERD in 2015:•	Each KVK covers 43 villages and 4300 farmers. 80% of villages covered by KVK are 10 km away from KVK.  •	Off campus activities are more than on campus activities.•	96% farmers’ requests were attended by KVKs. •	42% technologies adopted by farmers resulted in higher productivity, 33% resulted in high harvest income and 20% resulted in drudgery reduction.•	On an average each KVK trained about 100 persons annually on agri-prenureship.  About 25% of the persons trained started self-employment ventures.•	80% farmers modified their agricultural pattern related to diversified seeds planting technique, fertilizers, pesticides, machinery and irrigation use.•	KVKs have an edge over other organizations providing technology services.KVK Ranking Study by NILERD in 2018•	43% KVKs are in ‘A’ category, 48% in ‘B’ category, 8% in ‘C’ category and 1% in ‘D’ category. •	‘C’ & ‘D’ categories are attributed to vacant staff position and new and under established infrastructure.Study on KVK by IFPRI in 2019:•	KVKs’ efforts generated an additional net farm income of Rs. 3568 per hectare. •	Cost Benefit ratio is 1:7.8. Thus, the rate of return on expenditure on KVK is very high. The access of KVKs has increased from 1% in 2003-04 to 5.34 in 2013-14.•	One farmer trained by a KVK disseminates technology/knowledge to 30 fellow farmers.(b) to (d):	Yes, Sir.
