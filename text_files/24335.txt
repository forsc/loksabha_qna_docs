ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI) (a) to (d):	A total of 22 languages of India are specified under the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India. As per the information received from the Registrar General of India, the number of persons and the percentage of people who speak the 22 specified languages under Eighth Schedule of the  Constitution  of India as per  Census 2011 is at Annexure.  Further, as-2-L.S.US.Q. NO.364 FOR 20.07.2021 per Census 2011, Rajasthani is grouped as a mother tongue under Hindi and is spoken by 2,58,06,344 persons.(e) & (f):	There have been demands from time to time for inclusion of Rajasthani in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution. As the evolution of dialects and languages is a dynamic process, influenced by socio-cultural, economic and political developments, it is difficult to fix any criteria for languages, whether to distinguish them from dialects, or for inclusion in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution. The earlier attempts, through the Pahwa (1996) and Sitakant Mohapatra (2003) Committees, to evolve such fixed criteria have been inconclusive. Government of India is conscious of the sentiments and requirements for inclusion of other languages in the Eighth Schedule. Such requests have to be considered keeping in mind these sentiments, and the other relevant considerations. *********
