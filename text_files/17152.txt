As such, the number of cases that involved violence on healthcare professionals working for Covid-19 patients, is not available centrally.(c)  Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 has recently been amended by an Ordinance promulgated on 22.04.2020 to provide safety to the healthcare service personnel who are at the forefront in the fight against Covid-19 pandemic. Stringent provisions laid down in the Ordinance to act as effective deterrents are as under:-?	making acts of violence cognizable and non-bailable offence;?	commission or abetment of acts of violence shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three months, but which may extend to five years, and with fine which shall not be less than fifty thousand rupees, but which may extend to two lakh rupees;?	for causing grievous hurt, punishment shall be with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months, but which may extend to seven years, and with fine which shall not be less than one lakh rupees, but which may extend to five lakh rupees;?	in addition, the person convicted shall also be liable to pay compensation to the victim, and twice the amount of fair market value of the damaged property or the loss caused, as determined by the Court;   Public health and hospitals being a State subject, it is the responsibity of the States/UTs to implement the provisions of the Ordinance.(d) & (e) Ministry of Home Affairs has requested State Governments / UT Administrations to appoint Nodal Officers at State / UT level and at District level, who would be available 24*7 to redress any safety issue on the functioning of medical professionals. They should also take immediate and strict action in case any incident of violence takes place.In addition to this, States / UTs have been requested to widely publicize details of preventive measures taken and appointment of Nodal Officers, amongst the medical fraternity, including the local chapters of the IMA, as well as to the public at large, to ensure compliance at ground level.  A copy of the D.O. letter dt. 22.04.2020 issued by the Home Secretary, in this regard, can be accessed at the following link:-https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/DO%20Lr.%20Dt.%2022.4.2020%20to%20Chief%20Secretaries%20Administrators%20DGPs%20reg.%20security%20to%20healthcare%20professionals.pdf      (f) & (g) Public health and hospitals being a State subject, the matter of providing compensation for damage to vehicles and property of healthcare workers during the pandemic is to be considered by the States/UTs and as such, data in this regard is not maintained centrally. The number of Covid-19 affected healthcare workers in the country, is also not maintained centrally.
