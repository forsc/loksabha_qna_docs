BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a) to (e) :The Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) aims at correcting regional imbalances in the availability of affordable tertiary healthcare services and to augment facilities for quality medical education in the country. The scheme has two components- setting up of new AIIMS and upgradation of existing Government Medical Colleges.  Setting up of 22 new AIIMS has been approved under the scheme, including AIIMS at Raebareli and Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh.

Separately, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare administers a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for ‘Establishment of new Medical Colleges attached with existing district/referral hospitals’ with preference to underserved areas, where there is no existing Government or private medical college. Under this scheme, Government of India has approved establishment of 157 new medical colleges in three phases. Out of these, Letters of Permission (LoP) to start undergraduate medical courses have been given by the National Medical Commission for 70 medical colleges, which have become functional. In Uttar Pradesh, 27 medical colleges have been approved under the scheme, including at Bulandshahar, and  13 of the approved medical colleges have become functional.   ****
