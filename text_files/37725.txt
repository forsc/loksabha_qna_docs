ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF POWER AND NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY (SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) to (d) : 	Government of India launched the Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) in December, 2014 under which Distribution Infrastructure projects for strengthening of sub-transmission and distribution networks in urban areas metering of distribution transformers / feeders / consumers in the urban areas, IT enablement works; Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP); smart metering; Gas Insulated Sub-stations (GIS); and, Real Time Data Acquisition System (RT-DAS) were executed.So far, projects worth Rs.30,522 Crore [with Government of India (GoI) Grant of Rs.19,139 Crore] have been sanctioned under IPDS covering project components outlined herein, of which GoI grant of  Rs.17,058 Crore has been released to States/UTs. The State-wise sanctions and disbursements made under IPDS including the State of Gujarat are at Annexure-I. 		Under IPDS, Central funding is being provided for strengthening of sub-transmission & distribution  networks in the urban areas and metering of distribution transformers/feeders/consumers for reduction of Aggregate Technical & Commercial (AT&C) losses. Funds have also been sanctioned under IPDS for underground (UG) cabling and Aerial Bunched (AB) cables and metering, which help in reducing AT&C losses.Under IPDS, System Strengthening and Distribution (ST&D) projects covering 547 Circles in 33 States/UTs were taken up. Out of these, the distribution system strengthening works in 546 circles have been successfully completed. The status of state-wise implementation of IPDS system strengthening projects is at Annexure-II.Apart from IPDS, the Government have recently launched a Reforms based results-linked Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) for Distribution Utilities and a scheme for additional borrowings, both of which have linked financial incentives to reform in the areas of AT&C losses reduction and reliability of power supply. Reforms and financial incentives have been made inextricably linked to release of funds to Distribution Utilities and States in this regard.*************
