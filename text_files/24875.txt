Health being a State subject, primary responsibility to ensure availability of public health facilities lies with the State Government. The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare administers a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for “Establishment of new medical colleges attached with existing district/referral hospitals” to provide financial support to the States / UTs for establishment of medical college by upgrading the district hospitals in districts which do not have either a government or a private medical college. Fund sharing between the Central Government and States is in the ratio of 90:10 for NE/special category States and 60:40 for other States.  In three Phases of the said  Scheme, a total of  157 medical colleges have been sanctioned in the Country out of which, 47 have become functional. Under Phase I of the Scheme, three medical colleges at -Purnia, Saran and Samastipur districts of  Bihar  were sanctioned at a cost of Rs. 189 crore each. In Phase II of the Scheme, five medical colleges at - Sitamarhi, Jaanjharpur, Siwan, Buxar and Jamui  districts of Bihar were sanctioned at a unit cost of Rs. 250 crore each. The entire Central Share for Phase I and Phase II colleges has been released to the State Government in respect of  the colleges sanctioned (Details are at Annexure-II). Further, all the States/UTs were requested for proposals in respect of establishment of medical colleges under Phase-III of the Scheme. However, no proposal was received from the State Government of Bihar under Phase-III.
