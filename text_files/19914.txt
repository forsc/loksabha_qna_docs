                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY & DAIRYING(DR. SANJEEV KUMAR BALYAN)  (a) 	National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) has informed that dairy cooperatives have a processing capacity of 858.46 LLPD (as on March 2020). State wise processing capacity is given at Annexure I.  Further, according to the report of “Study On Demand Of Milk And Milk Products In India” conducted by NDDB through Nielsen during 2019, per capita consumption of milk and milk products  is 320 (ml/ day). State-wise per capita consumption is given at Annexure – II. (b) 	Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has informed that:FSSAI carried out a National Milk Safety and Quality Survey in 2018-19 in the country covering all States and UTs. A total of 6,432 samples of milk were collected both from the organised as well as non-organised sectors for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. The survey results did not support the perception of large scale adulteration of milk in the country.  With regards to milk adulteration, only 12 out of 6,432 samples of milk (0.19%) were found adulterated. Six samples were found adulterated with hydrogen peroxide, three with detergent, two with urea and one sample was found to have neutralizers.  These figures do not include samples found sub-standard. (c) The details of steps taken by the Government to prevent adulteration are attached at Annexure III.
