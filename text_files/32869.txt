                                                                    THE MINISTER OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                 (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) : Government has launched revised protocol, ‘Azadi@75 Star Rating Protocol of Garbage Free Cities (GFC) - Toolkit 2022'', for rating garbage free cities. The simplified toolkit is expected to serve as the guiding framework for cities in their journey towards becoming ‘Garbage Free’.The new GFC protocol gives progressive weightage to key components such as source segregation, waste processing & dumpsite remediation. Additionally, new components such as sale of waste by-products, Information Education Communication (IEC), Capacity Building (CB) and digitally enabled processes have also been introduced in the revised protocol. Further details on the subject may be accessed from the following link :https://sbmurban.org/storage/app/media/GFC-Toolkit-2022_Final.pdf(b) : As per the Management Information System (MIS) reports filled by the cities and duly approved by the State Governments, 77,961 out of 89,112 wards (87.48 per cent) in the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) are practising 100% source segregation of garbage.   However, the numbers of wards practising 100% source segregation is steadily increasing with the progress of the Mission.(c & d) : Segregation of garbage at source is key to sustainable solid waste management and hence requires to be monitored. In view of its importance, a high weightage is assigned to source segregation under ‘Azadi@75 Star Rating Protocol of Garbage Free Cities- Protocol 2022’, i.e., 13.5% for 1 and 3 Star and 9.3% for 5 and 7 Star applicant cities. Behavioural change and public participation is fundamental to sanitation. Since launch of the Mission, various initiatives have been taken up by the Union Government to engage with State Governments and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) for promoting citizen involvement to improve sanitation. Also, dashboard monitoring on the Swachhatam Portal clearly reflects performance of States and cities in key parameters, including source segregation. Through continuous advocacy, capacity building programmes, reviews and field visits, Government of India has been promoting citizens and cities to improve source segregation. In addition, this has also been included as a key component of ‘Azadi@75 Star Rating Protocol of Garbage Free Cities (GFC) - Protocol 2022''. It is also a key parameter in the annual Swachh Survekshans which determines the ranking of cities.(e) to (g) : Under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and AMRUT 2.0, Government of India supports State Governments and ULBs to manage waste water by setting up of sewers and Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). Water and Sanitation are State subjects under the seventh schedule of the Constitution. Therefore, constructing, operating & monitoring STPs and to upkeep water bodies is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments. However, Union Government supplements the efforts of the States through AMRUT and AMRUT 2.0.Under AMRUT, ULBs/States can take up projects related to construction of new STPs, augmentation of STPs as well as rehabilitation of old/non-functional STPs. As per clause 7.3 of AMRUT Mission guidelines, all AMRUT projects are required to have provision of minimum 5 years Operation and Maintenance (O&M) being funded through suitable revenue stream. In order to make these projects self-reliant and cost effective, under AMRUT 2.0, projects being proposed in State Water Action Plan (SWAP) shall have O&M for at least five years to be funded by way of levy of user charges, other revenue streams and through an appropriate cost recovery mechanism by the ULBs. Also, smart solutions like Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA) etc. have been given due weightage under projects for better monitoring during operational period of project. Under Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (SBM-U) 2.0, ULBs with population less than 1 lakh will be eligible for financing the infrastructure for waste water management.                                       *****
