MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a) & (b):	National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) compiles prison statistics in its publication “Prison Statistics India”.  Published reports are available till the year 2016.  State-wise details of incidents of clashes/group clashes, firing in jails, jail break, injuries and killings in jails across the country, during the years 2014, 2015 and 2016 are given in Annexure I, II, III, IV and V.   Prison/Jail-wise details in this regard are not maintained by the NCRB.-2/…-2-LS.US.Q.NO.486 FOR 25.06.2019 (c) to (e) :  As per Entry 4 in List-II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, ‘prisons’ and ‘persons detained therein’ are State subjects. Custodial management, prison discipline, security and safety of prisons and inmates is the responsibility of respective State Governments.  The State Governments are competent to take appropriate action against delinquent officials and inmates as per law.  The Ministry of Home Affairs circulated the Model Prison Manual 2016 to all States and UTs in May 2016 which has chapters on various aspects of prison administration and prison management.  The Ministry of Home Affairs has also issued various advisories in this regard to all States and UTs from time to time.
