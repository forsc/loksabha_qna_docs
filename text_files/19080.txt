The Government is constructing 6,368 houses with infrastructure facilities as part of six Light House Projects (LHPs) in six cities across the country for urban poor, the details in this regard are at Annexure. These projects are deploying different new construction technologies identified and selected through Global Housing Technology Challenge (GHTC) organised in March, 2019. These technologies ensure cost effective, green, resource efficient, climate resilient, sustainable and rapid construction. They are termed Light House Projects which will act as Live Laboratories for adoption of innovative construction technologies through wide dissemination to students, faculties, builders, technical professionals, practitioners in public/private sector and other stakeholders involved in such construction through site visits, periodic interactions, webcasting etc. These LHPs are being constructed in a challenge mode which are likely to be completed within a time period of 12 months.                                               *****
