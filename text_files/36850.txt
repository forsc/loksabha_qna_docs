ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR FINANCE (SHRI PANKAJ CHAUDHARY)(a)	The 15th Finance Commission has recommended that during the first year 2021-22 of the award period 2021-22 to 2025-26, the relative weightage for assessment of city performance on air quality will be based on four parameters as given below:(i)Strengthening of the pollution monitoring mechanism; 		(ii)Source-wise cause analysis for air pollution;(iii)Progress on action plans and compliance of statutory guidelines;  (iv)Quantification of air quality improvement.After 2021-22, for all the remaining four years of the award period, the entire weightage will be on the fourth parameter of quantification of improvement in air quality.  Quantification of improvement in air quality has two parts, namely, reduction in particulate matter (PM10) and increase in the good days according to improvement in the air quality index (AQI) from the base year 2019-20.  Management of open waste burning and combustion at landfill sites will constitute an integral part of the air quality improvement index. The performance of the 42 Million-Plus City/agglomeration (Cities/UAs) are assessed and funds awarded based on the parameters fixed by the 15th Finance Commission in Annexure 7.8, 7.8 A and 7.8 B of Chapter -7, Volume-II of the Final Report.  15% and above reduction in the concentration of Particulate Matter (PM10) and 15% increase in the good days according to improvement in the air quality index in a year over the base year  2019-20 makes  Cities/UAs entitled for the full grant and any decrease in the performance factor gets reflected in the fund allocation in a manner prescribed by the 15th Finance Commission.  (b)	During the Interim Award year of 2020-21, 15th Finance Commission recommended Ambient air quality grant was released to the States for air quality improvement measures including capacity building in the recommended 42 Million Plus Cities/UAs as well as for meeting the additional needs of the State Pollution Control Boards to appropriately assist the local bodies in monitoring ambient air quality.  However, due to spread of COVID-19 Pandemic, activities envisioned got disrupted and subsequently delayed. Performance Assessment of the year 2020-21(extended upto 31st August, 2021) has been completed for all the recommended Cities/UAs.  Out of 42 recommended Cities/UAs, 24 Cities/UAs have shown performance of 15% and above over the base year or are equal or below the National Air quality Standards and have secured full grant as recommended by the 15th Finance Commission for the year 2021-22.  Remaining Cities/UAs  have achieved below 15% performance and secured less grants in the proportion as recommended by the 15th Finance Commission. (c) to (d) 15th Finance Commission recommended Ambient air quality grant allocated  for the 42  Million Plus Cities/UAs for the years 2020-21 and 2021-22 along with funds utilized on release upto 27-3-2022 to all these Cities/UAs including to the Cities/UAs  of the State of Gujarat is given in the Annexure.*******
