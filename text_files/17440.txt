As on date, 10 centres have imparted training to more than 8000 persons in Darbhanga district. In addition, Ministry has promoted establishment of model and aspirational skill centres known as Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra (PMKK) in every district of the country for imparting skill training. The Ministry, through National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) provides capital expenditure upto 75% of the project investment as well as operational support to each PMKK. A PMKK has been established in 2017 in Darbhanga district of Bihar with financial assistance of Rs. 70 lakh and is functioning presently.(b)       The State/UT-wise number of allocated & established PMKKs and candidates trained, certified and placed in PMKKs is given at Annexure.(c) and (d)      Yes. The Ministry through National Skill Development Corporation, intends to establish PMKKs in every district of the country. As on date, 812 PMKKs have been allocated in 707 districts. Out of allocated PMKKs, 738 have been established.            In order to ensure involvement and awareness of the local public representatives in the establishment and functioning of PMKKs, the following measures are being taken in accordance with the PMKK Guidelines/Launch Manual:•	District/ Constituency wise details of the allocated and established PMKKs are uploaded on NSDC website•	State Engagement Officers of NSDC periodically meet the authorities with project updates and seek advisories•	Post the allocation of PMKKs, Training Partners identify the suitable location to set up the PMKK and finalizes the job roles for imparting the training in consultation with the local authorities•	To ensure effective mobilization of candidates, Training Partners distribute leaflets/pamphlets advertising PMKK/PMKVY scheme and conduct Rozgar melas/placement drives in districts with support of local MP / local MLA / District Magistrate / Panchayati Raj Members, etc.•	The PMKVY scheme (under which PMKK is established) is included as one of the items of review under the District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee (DISHA) set up by the Ministry of Rural Development. (e)       Under the Centrally Sponsored State Managed (CSSM) component of PMKVY, funds amounting to Rs. 21.44 Cr. have been released to State of Karnataka in FY 2016-17. No funds have been released subsequently due to non receipt of utilization certificate for the earlier released funds.
