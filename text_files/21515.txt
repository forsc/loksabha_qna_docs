ANSWER




                                                        ): The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India has initiated the ‘Digital India’ programme with the vision to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge-based economy by ensuring digital access, digital inclusion, digital empowerment and bridging the digital divide. Digital India is an umbrella programme that covers multiple projects of various central Ministries/Departments & States/UTs. Each project has its own budgetary requirement and accordingly project-plan has been charted out by the implementing Ministry/departments and budget details are being maintained by concerned Ministries/Departments & States/UTs.Some of the key initiatives taken by the Government under Digital India programme across the country including state of Uttar Pradesh are as follows: •	Common Services Centre (CSC): The Common Services Centres are service (Government to Citizen & Business to Citizen) delivery centres. Common Services Centres are internet enabled centres operated by local entrepreneur, called Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs) and provide eServices to rural citizens. As on January, 2021, 3.73 Lakh Common Services Centres are functional including 2.78 lakh CSCs at Gram Panchayat levels. In the state of Uttar Pradesh, 76,444 CSCs are functional, out of them, 57,913 CSCs are functional at GP level.•	Digital Village: MeitY has also initiated the ’Digital Village Pilot Project” in October, 2018. 700 Gram Panchayats (GPs)/Village with atleast one Gram Panchayat/Village per District per State/UT are being covered under the project. The digital services being offered are Health, Education, Skill Development, and Financial Inclusion including Government to Citizens Services (G2C), Business to Citizen (B2C) Services. 75 villages from Uttar Pradesh have been covered under the project “Pilot Project- Implementation of Digital Village.”•	e-District Mission Mode Project (MMP): e-District project has been implemented at district and sub-district levels of all States/UTs, benefitting all citizens by delivering various e-Services such as Certificates (Birth, Caste, Death, Income and Local Resident), Pension (Old Age, Disability and Widow), Electoral, Consumer Court, Revenue Court, Land Record and services of various departments such as Commercial Tax, Agriculture, Labour, Employment Training & Skill Development etc. e-District services have been launched in 705 districts across 28 States/   5 UTs. 258 e-services have been launched in all 75 districts of Uttar Pradesh.•	Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyaan(PMGDISHA): MeitY is also implementing a scheme titled “Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA)” to usher in digital literacy in rural India by covering 6 crore rural households (one person per household). So far, training has been imparted to 3.65 crore candidates and out of this more than 2.67 crore candidates have been certified. The scheme is applicable to all rural areas of the country including state of Uttar Pradesh.  In the Uttar Pradesh, around 1,17,66,647 candidates have been registered and 1,00,33,606 candidates have completed the training out of which 74,11,882 have been duly certified.(b):  MeitY has conducted third party evaluation for Electronic Governance scheme under Digital India Programme”. The study was initiated in January 2020 by the Centre for Innovations in Public Systems (CIPS), Hyderabad, Telangana and submitted final report in October, 2020. Driven through technology, e-Governance is transforming citizen services by providing access to information, integrating various systems and services between government and citizens, thereby empowering and enhancing citizen’s social, environmental and economic values. Following are the key findings of the study with respect to availing services online:•	Eighty-Eight percent of the sample beneficiaries (accessed any e-service) of the study indicated that the cost associated with availing services online has significantly reduced compared to the manual system. This implies a reduction in the costs related to the number of trips made, out-of-pocket expense per trip, abolition of intermediaries etc.•	Ninety-Two percent of the sample beneficiaries of the study indicated that ease of accessing services online has significantly improved. This may be attributed to the availability of wider range of service delivery channels (mobile, portal, kiosks etc.) and extended hours of availability of service at these channels.(c)  and  (d): The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has not made any formal assessment to measure the extent of adoption of digital technologies in the state of Uttar Pradesh and NER.  However, the statistics of e-transactions on e-Taal platform (https://etaal.gov.in/) gives an indication of increase in digital penetration and usage of e-Government tools in India. More than 622 crore e-transactions have been recorded for 3,956 services during the year 2020. Number of    e-transactions during the last 3 years in the State of Uttar Pradesh and NER is as follows.States	Number of e-Transactions (in Crore)	2018	2019	2020Uttar Pradesh	34.68	39.91	38.39Arunachal Pradesh	0.35	0.41	0.40Assam	3.76	6.27	4.51Manipur	0.23	0.27	0.26Meghalaya	0.39	0.30	0.27Mizoram	0.21	0.20	0.25Nagaland	0.23	0.26	0.29Sikkim	0.09	0.11	0.10Tripura	0.36	0.60	0.49*******
