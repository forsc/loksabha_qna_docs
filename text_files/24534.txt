(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	Some of the farmers’ unions have been protesting against newly enacted Farm laws and their main demands of agitating farmers’ unions regarding the three farm laws, were for their repeal viz. “The Farmers'' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020”, “The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement On Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020” & “The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020”. Various efforts have been made by Government to end the protests.	Government engaged itself actively and constantly with the agitating farmers unions to end the protests and so far, 11 rounds of discussions/talks were held between the Government & agitating farmers unions to resolve the issues. Details of the meetings are at Annexure-I. 	Giving top priority to the interest of farmers, Government vide letter dated 09th December, 2020 addressed to Farmer Unions, explained point  by  point,  how  the concerns expressed by the farmers were being taken care of in the proposal of the Government of India.  Government also proposed to constitute a small group consisting with representative of farmers’ unions, which can deliberate on Farm Laws clause-wise in a time bound manner and can also consider other issues related to farmers, which representatives of farmers’ unions have not agreed.	However, Farmer Unions never agreed to discuss the farm laws excepting for demanding their repeal.	Government is always open to discussion with farmers Union and will remain open to discussion with agitating farmers to resolve the issue. (c) & (d): 	As reported by data provided by Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices(CACP), the details is at Annexure-II. (e):	 The Government has adopted several developmental programmes, schemes, reforms and policies that focus on higher incomes for the farmers. All these policies & programmes are being supported by higher budgetary allocations, non-budgetary financial resources by way of creating Corpus Funds like Micro Irrigation Fund and Agri-marketing scheme to strengthen eNAM and GrAMs, as also in the Ministry of Animal Husbandry, Dairy and Fisheries to promote dairy and fishery sectors. There have been several reforms to unleash the potential and these include Market Reforms like Model APLM (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2017; Establishment of Gramin Agriculture Markets (GrAMs); Agri-Export Policy, 2018; The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2020; The Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act.  2020; Amendments to Essential Commodities Act, 1955; Promotion of 10,000 FPOs with necessary financial support under Atma Nirbhar Package (Agriculture)and Supplementary Income transfers under PM-KISAN; Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (PMFBY); Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY); Increase in Minimum Support Price (MSPs) for all Kharif & Rabi Crops ensuring a minimum of 50 percent of profit margin on the cost of production; Har Med Par Ped; Bee-Keeping; Rashtriya Gokul Mission; Blue Revolution; Interest Subvention Scheme; Kisan Credit Card (KCC) that now offers production loan to even dairy & fishery farmers besides agricultural crops etc.	The latest major intervention includes the ‘Atma Nirbhar Bharat – Agriculture’ which includes comprehensive market reforms and creation of ‘Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF)’ worth Rs. 1 lakh crores. This Fund is in synch with the needed transformation of the agriculture sector, particularly at the post-harvest management stage.
