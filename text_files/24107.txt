MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) and (b): Budgetary allocation for various Schemes and Non-schemes of both the Departments (D/o of School Education & Literacy and D/o Higher Education) of Ministry of Education for 2021-22 is Rs. 93,224.29 crores. Various schemes/projects/programmes run by Ministry of Education proposals are being aligned with National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020). In the light of NEP 2020, specific budgetary allocation have been made in Budget 2021-22 for new initiatives such as Academic Bank of Credit, Indian Knowledge System, Bhartiya Bhasha University and institute of Translation, Multidisciplinary Education and Research Improvement in Technical Education – EAP (MERITE), etc for the Financial Year 2021-22.(c): Budget Estimate of Ministry of Education for 2020-21 was Rs. 99,311.52 crores which was revised to Rs. 85,089.07 crores. Budget Estimate for 2021-22 is Rs. 93,224.29 crores, which is an increase of 9.6% over RE 2020-21.(d) and (e): A number of action points/activities for implementation in school education as well as higher education are mentioned in the National Education Policy 2020. NEP 2020 provides different timelines as well as principles and methodology for its implementation. As per NEP 2020, implementation of the Policy requires multiple initiatives and actions, which will have to be taken by multiple bodies in a synchronized and systematic manner. In this direction, Ministry and other implementing agencies under its purview have already started taking initiatives towards implementation of NEP 2020. Further, Ministry of Education has communicated to all States/UT Governments and GoI Ministries/Departments to take appropriate measures for implementation of NEP 2020.*******
