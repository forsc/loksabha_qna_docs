ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF TEXTILES(SMT. SMRITI ZUBIN IRANI)\(a)  to (c):	The Indian textile industry is the second largest manufacturer and exporter in the world. The share of textile and clothing (T&C) in India’s total exports stands at a significant 13% in 2017-18. India has a share of 5% of the global trade in textiles and apparel. Further, the Indian Textile Industry has inherent linkage with agriculture and with the culture and traditions of the country making for its versatile spread of products appropriate for both domestic and the export markets. The textile industry contributes to 7% of industry output in value terms, 2% of India’s GDP and to 15% of the country’s export earnings. As such, there appears no concrete report for decline in the textiles and handloom/handicrafts industries.Government is implementing various policy initiatives and schemes for supporting the development of textile industry. These schemes and initiatives which promote technology upgradation, creation of infrastructure, skill development and sectoral development in the textile sector, create a conducive environment and provide enabling conditions for textile manufacturing in the country. In order to support the growth and modernization of the textile sector including Handlooms and Handicrafts in the country, the government has been implementing several schemes, such as the Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (A-TUFS), Schemes for the development of the Powerloom Sector(Power-Tex), Schemes for Technical Textiles, Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP), Scheme for Additional Grant for Apparel Manufacturing Units under SITP (SAGAM),  SAMARTH- The Scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector (SCBTS), Jute (ICARE- Improved Cultivation and Advanced Retting Exercise), Integrated Processing Development Scheme (IPDS), Silk Samagra, Integrated Wool Development Programme (IWDP), North East Region Textiles Promotion Scheme (NERTPS), Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (ROSCTL) etc. The Government had also approved a special package for textile sector with an outlay of Rs. 6000 crores to boost employment generation and exports particularly in Garmenting and Made-ups.In order to encourage and develop handloom and handicraft sectors, the government has been implementing several key programmes and schemes for these sectors. For the handloom sector, which is an unorganised sector, development support is provided under National Handloom Development Programme , Handloom Weavers’ Comprehensive Welfare Scheme (HWCWS), Comprehensive Handloom Cluster Development Scheme and Yarn Supply Scheme (YSS) for basic inputs, looms and accessories, design development, infrastructure development, marketing of handloom products etc. For the Handicrafts sector, Government is implementing the National Handicraft Development Programme and the Comprehensive Handicrafts Cluster Development Scheme for providing support on design, technology upgradation, infrastructure development, research and development, market support etc. to handicrafts clusters in the country.  These schemes include subsidies and incentives for the growth of the textile sector.*****
