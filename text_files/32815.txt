ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR TEXTILES  (SMT. DARSHANA JARDOSH)(a) to (c):	The Government has approved setting up of 7 (Seven) PM Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM MITRA) Parks to develop world class infrastructure including plug and play facility with an outlay of Rs.4445 Crore for a period of seven years upto 2027-28. The PM MITRA Parks Scheme shall be implemented on pan-India basis and there is no specific outlay for any state. The salient features of PM MITRA Park Scheme are:- (i) willing state governments to have ready availability of contiguous and encumbrance-free land parcel of 1000+ acres for being eligible. (ii) it is envisaged to be on Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode. (iii) there is a provision of Development Capital Support (DCS) @30% of the project cost with a maximum support of Rs.500 Cr and Rs.200 Cr per park for Greenfield and Brownfield PM MITRA Park, respectively. The DCS is for creation of core Infrastructure. (iv) there is provision of Rs.300 Cr per park for incentivizing the industries to set up their units in the park. There is a provision to use 10% of the park’s area for Commercial Development (CD) and revenue stream from CD may help maintenance of common assets and facilities. Priority will be given to Technical Textiles, Man-Made Fibre and textile machinery. The states have been invited to file applications by 15.03.2022 for setting up PM MITRA park.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ***
