ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a) to (d) Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited has informed that various types ofassets are being provided to the Retail Outlet (RO) dealers by Public Sector OMCs forwhich a recovery is being made in the form of License Fee Recovery (LFR) or ServiceStation License Fee (SSLF). This LFR is irrespective of the investment made in aparticular outlet and is levied on per KL sales of the RO. Average investment in assetsprovided by the Public Sector OMCs is reckoned for arriving the Single Recovery Rateper KL which is applicable separately for products (MS & HSD), depending upon thetype of Retail Outlets i.e. Company Controlled “CC/A” site & Dealer Controlled “DC/B”site on pan India basis.-2-The investment in the Company Controlled (CC) sites is higher as the OMCs areproviding land and infrastructure along with equipment like Dispensing pumps,underground product storage tanks etc. However, in the Dealer Controlled (DC) sites,the investment of OMCs is limited to provision of equipment like Dispensing pumps,underground product tanks etc,. LFR applicable for Company controlled and Dealercontrolled sites is thus different.The dealer’s obligation to pay LFR/SSLF is included as one of the clauses in thestandard Dealership Agreement.(e) to (f) EM locks are provided by the Public Sector OMCs as it is a critical componentof security locking arrangement of a Tank lorry delivering product at Dealer’s premises.EM locks are integrated with the software and central server to grant OTP basedauthorization at customer premises upon arrival. Thus EM locking system has aninterface with Public Sector OMCs Vehicle tracking system and ERP system which isutilized for ensuring secured delivery of petroleum products to customer premises.The VSAT at RO is also provided by Public Sector OMCs. The VSAT cannot beprovided directly by the dealer at his expense as centralized procurement by OMCsensures the required licensing, technical specifications for sustained real time datatransfer to OMCs server with desired cyber security customized as per theoperational/system requirements.****
