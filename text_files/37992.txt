ANSWER




                                                        (a) &(b)	Yes Sir. The Economic Survey of India (ESI) 2021-22 refers to Annual PLFS Reports, which show that vocational/ technical training is increasing across both males and females, though the percentage of females is less than that of males.Table : Distribution of Persons received formal vocational/technical training (in percent)Period Labour Force Survey (PLFS)	All India (Age Group- 15-59 years)	Male	Female	TotalPLFS 2017-18	2.3	1.7	2.0PLFS 2018-19	2.8	2.0	2.4PLFS 2019-20	3.5	2.9	3.2Source: Period Labour Force SurveysHowever, vocational/technical training is becoming  an aspirational achievement for women who are coming out in higher numbers than ever before to get  themselves trained in vocational/technical training and going into self-employment, or going as an employee, or going into entrepreneurship.(c)& (d)	Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing various programmes to encourage skilling (including vocational/technical training) and entrepreneurship in the country which aims at stimulating employment opportunities among women of various socio-economic levels and different age groups. Inclusive skill development, with the objective of increased women participation for better economic productivity is one of the focus areas of the National Policy on Skill Development & Entrepreneurship, 2015.In Jan Sikshan Sansthan scheme, focus is given to Women, SC, ST, OBC and Minorities. The Third-Party Evaluation study report conducted by Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA) during 2020-21 has shown that this scheme is very effective for empowerment of women since the representation of women is around 80%. The Directorate General of Training (DGT) of MSDE, under its Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS), meant for the Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) has imparted long-term vocational training. The government has made a provision of 30% reservation of seats for women candidates all over the country in Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) and Industrial Training Centers (ITCs). The vocational training to women, is implemented through a network of 19 National Skill Training Institutes for Women (NSTI-W). Special Provisions are also made to support the female candidates in Common Norms governing implementation of skilling schemes of the Government of India. It may also be pointed out here that vocational/technical training does not encompass the entire gamut of skilling and the Government has many initiatives for skilling the women through different schemesand running courses favoured by women for skilling themselves, some of which are mentioned above.  (e)	The Government is aware of such findings as reported in the Economic Survey of India 2021-22, reproduced from the annual  Periodic labour Force Survey (PLFS) Reports 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20, on the basis of surveys conducted by Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI). No specific reasons are cited in this survey and it is seen that the survey is presenting estimates in terms of formal vocational/technical training.(f)	Under Skill India Mission, MSDE is delivering skills through various skill development schemes/programmes viz. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS), Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) and Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS) through Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) for entire India including rural population. Since 2015-16, more than 351 lakh candidates have been trained by MSDE under these schemes including those from rural areas. Apart from MSDE, Ministry of Rural Development is running schemes viz. DeenDayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) and Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETI) Scheme. RSETI, an initiative of Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) to have dedicated infrastructure in each district of the country to impart training and skill up gradation of rural youth geared towards entrepreneurship development. RSETIs are managed by banks with active co-operation from the Government of India and State Governments. DDU-GKY is a part of the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM), tasked with the dual objectives of adding diversity to the incomes of rural poor families and cater to the career aspirations of rural youth. From 2018-19 to 2020-21, total 10,42,838 candidates have been trained. DDU-GKY is uniquely focused on rural youth between the ages of 15 and 35 years from poor families. As a part of the Skill India campaign, it plays an instrumental role in supporting the social and economic programs of the government like the Make In India, Digital India, Smart Cities and Start-Up India, Stand-Up India campaigns. From 2018-19 to 2020-21, total 5,26,975 candidates have been trained The Central Government and Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare have introduced various central schemes / programmes to impart and promote skilling in agriculture through Agriculture Skill Council of India. Imparting of skills is essential to improve on the traditional agriculture skills, as also, to infuse new skill sets and techniques for sustainable growth and development. The skills in farming agriculture are imparted to the rural youths and farmers in agriculture and allied sectors including women in Agriculture Sector. Focussed agriculture segments: Agriculture Crop Production, Seed Industry Segment, Farm Mechanisation & Precision Farming, Production Horticulture, Amenity Horticulture and Landscaping, Post – Harvest, Supply Chain Management, Animal Husbandry, Dairy Farm Management, Poultry Farm Management, Fisheries and other allied segments.Currently, MSDE is delivering skills through more than 718 PMKKs, 304 JSSs, 14, 722 ITIs to rural and urban population. The Jan Sikshan Sansthan (JSS) initiative is one such step in the direction of realizing the unique demographic potential of urban slums and rural India. The main target of the JSS is to impart vocational skills to the non-literates, neo-literates and the person having rudimentary level of education of 8th standard i.e., upto class 12th in the age group of 15-45 years with due relaxation in case of “Divyangjan” and other deserving cases. The scheme is women dominated and catering to the mandated target group. Under the Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) scheme, the Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) engaged as the JSS go to the rural areas for outreach programmes for skill training. More than 50% of JSS beneficiaries are from rural areas and it has many number of skill training programme in agriculture and related areas. Further, District Skill Committees (DSCs), under the guidance of respective State Skill Development Missions (SSDMs), are playing a key role in addressing the skill gap and assessing demand at the district level including in rural areas. The DSCs have been entrusted with the development of District Skill Development Plans (DSDPs) to promote decentralized planning and implementation at the grassroots. To build capacity of the DSCs and to help them manage skill development planning and program delivery, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) attaches Mahatma Gandhi National Fellows with the district administration. The Fellows are posted as part of their academic programme in premier management institutes, which has an in-built component of on-ground practical experience. So far, more than 510 DSDPs have been received from 31 States/ Union Territories. The DSDPs identify sectors in which employment opportunities and demand for skilling exists. These activities are performed under the World Bank assisted programme Skill Acquisition and Knowledge Awareness for Livelihood Promotion (SANKALP) for strengthening of skilling institutions.
