The District is working on various projects in Financial Inclusion. Balangir, Dhenkanal, Kalahandi, Kandhamal, Nabarangapur, Nuapada, Koraput and Malkangiri have secured good ranks across various sectors and have become eligible for additional allocation. As per the scheme guidelines, districts are to prepare list of innovative projects. Accordingly, at present these districts are formulating project proposals in the areas under focus in the programme Viz. Health, nutrition, school education, agriculture, financial inclusion, skill development etc.  (c)	Currently there is no proposal to include more districts in the list of Aspirational Districts. However, all the States have been advised to replicate the template of the Aspirational Districts Programme at District and Block level.
