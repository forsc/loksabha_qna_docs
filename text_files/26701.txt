The overarching goal of the NPMF, 2017 is to ensure the health and ecological integrity of the marine living resources of India’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) through sustainable harvests for the benefit of present and future generations of the nation. The overall strategy of the NPMF, 2017 is based on seven pillars, namely sustainable development, socio-economic upliftment of fishers, principle of subsidiarity, partnership, inter-generational equity, gender justice and precautionary approach. These seven pillars are to guide the actions of various stakeholders in meeting the vision and mission set for the marine fisheries sector of the country.The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying is implementing a flagship scheme namely Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) with an estimated investment of Rs.20,050 crore for a period of 5 years from financial year 2020-21 to 2024-25 in all States/Union Territories (UTs). The welfare related activities supported under the PMMSY primarily include (i) insurance cover for fishers, fish farmers, fish workers, (ii) insurance for fishing vessels, (iii) livelihood support and nutritional support for socio-economically backward active traditional fishers during fishing ban/lean period, (iv) supply of boats and nets to traditional fishermen, (v) supply of safety kits for traditional and motorized fishing vessels, (vi) supply of communication and Potential Fishing Zones devices for motorized boats, (vii) support for acquisition of technologically advanced fishing vessels for traditional fishermen, (viii) Up-gradation of existing fishing vessels, (ix) Open sea cage culture, ornamental fisheries, seaweed cultivation for creating alternative employment opportunities to coastal communities, (x) development of integrated modern fishing villages, (xi) development of fishing harbours, landing centres, cold chain facilities, transport vehicles, marketing etc. to facilitate the fishermen for smooth operation of fishing activities and augment financial returns.Under the PMMSY financial support is provided during fishing ban/lean period in the form of livelihood and nutritional support for socio-economically backward active traditional fishers’ families for conservation of fish resources. Under this component, Governmental financial assistance of Rs.3000/- per enrolled fisher is shared in the ratio of 50:50 between Centre and general States, 80:20 between Centre and North Eastern and Himalayan States while 100% Central assistance for UTs. Besides, the beneficiary contributes Rs.1500/- annually and the total accumulated amount of Rs.4500/- annually is disbursed to the enrolled beneficiary by the respective State/UT at the rate of Rs.1500/- per month during the fishing ban/lean period.****
