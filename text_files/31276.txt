So far an expenditure of              ` 1,165 crore has been incurred on the project. An outlay ` 336 crore has been provided for the project for Financial Year 2021-2022.

Electrification works on balance sections are under different stages of execution and planned for completion on mission mode in phased manner.The completion of any Railway project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, priority of project, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site due to climatic conditions etc.  All these factors affect the completion time of the project.
