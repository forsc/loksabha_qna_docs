                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI G. KISHAN REDDY)(a):	National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) compiles data on human trafficking reported to  it by States and Union Territories (UTs) and publishes the same in its-2/...-2-LS.US.Q.NO.3791 FOR 17.03.2020annual publication ‘Crime in India’. The latest published report is of the year 2018. As per the published report of NCRB for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018, State/UT-wise details of cases of human trafficking reported including women and children  are given in Annexure-I.  District-wise data of cases in which women and children were trafficked during the years 2017 and 2018 is given in Annexure-II. NCRB has started collecting this data since 2017.  Specific data on traffickers is not maintained by NCRB. However, State/UT-wise number of persons convicted for the offence of human trafficking during the years 2016 to 2018 are given in Annexure III. (b): 	The Ministry of Home Affairs has provided financial assistance to States for setting up Anti Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs) in 332 districts. State-wise details are at Annexure-IV. (c):	Specific information on registration of FIRs is not maintained by NCRB. (d):	As per information provided by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, details of Child Care Institutions (CCIs), along with children residing therein, during the year 2019-20 are given in Annexure-V. District-wise information is not available. Number of victims of child trafficking living in CCIs is not maintained separately.

Prevention and combating the crime of human trafficking is the responsibility of State Governments concerned, who are competent to deal with the offence of human trafficking under extant provisions of law. However, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) supplements the efforts of State Governments by taking various initiatives and measures. MHA has provided financial assistance to States for setting up 332 Anti Human Trafficking Units in various districts of States. MHA also provides financial assistance to States and UTs to hold ‘Judicial Colloquiums’ and ‘State level conferences’ to sensitize judicial officers, police officials and other stakeholders about various provisions of law relevant to trafficking and their role in curbing trafficking. MHA has also issued various advisories to States and UTs from time to time on preventing and combating human trafficking. These advisories are available at MHA’s website www.mha.gov.in. Through the recent National Investigation Agency (Amendment) Act 2019, the Schedule of the Act has been amended and National Investigation Agency has been empowered to investigate cases under Section 370 and 370A of Indian Penal Code, relating to Human Trafficking. The Government has also approved financial assistance to States and UTs for setting up/strengthening Anti Human Trafficking Units (AHTUs) in all Districts of States and UTs at a cost of Rs.100 crore under Nirbhaya Fund.
