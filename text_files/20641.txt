ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) & (b): No such event with the name ‘digital conclave’ has been held.  However, the review meetings and webinars are held routinely with State Governments and Stakeholder institutions, organizations and experts. The meetings at the National and Regional levels are organized as and when required in the field of Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs).  These meetings are being organized to improve the knowledge of health care professionals involved in care of people with Non Communicable Diseases. These efforts have got an impetus with the use of digital systems- increasing outreach, enhancing convenience and enabling a larger body of professionals to benefit from knowledge dissemination.
