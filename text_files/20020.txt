                                                        ANSWERMINISTER FOR CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS (SHRI D. V. SADANANDA GOWDA)(a) Yes, Sir. Standards of major chemicals & petrochemicals are formulated by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and most of the standards are presently voluntary in nature. However, sometimes, inferior and spurious chemicals are imported into India, which do not meet the quality requirements as per BIS standards. To improve quality of chemical products, Government has initiated an exercise to make BIS standards as mandatory under Section 16 of BIS Act, 2016, so that both domestic manufacturers and overseas suppliers meet the BIS standards and supply quality chemicals.-2-(b),(c) & (d) So far, the Government has made BIS Standards mandatory for 34 chemicals & petrochemicals. The details of 34 chemicals & petrochemicals for which standard have been made mandatory is attached at Annexure.****AnnexureList of chemicals & petrochemicals which BIS standard have been made mandatorySl.
