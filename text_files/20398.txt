These stations cover 20 major interstate river basins & 25 States/Union Territories & National Capital Territory of Delhi. As per CWC, during the last 3 years, in addition to the flood prone states of Assam, Bihar& Uttar Pradesh, instances of extreme floods were witnessed in the states of Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh & Rajasthan due to ‘excess’ to ‘large excess’ rainfall in these states combined with extremely heavy rainfall in short duration.(b)	  CWC has taken initiative to adopt all the latest technology including remote-sensing, Geographical Information System (GIS), Internet, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in development/ running/ formulation and calibration of Mathematical models for flood forecasting and for providing Inundation Alerts which are closely at par with international standards. CWC is formulating 3 day advisories of flood using Satellite based real time rainfall estimates and 3 day rainfall forecast through Numerical Weather Prediction models being shared by IMD on a seamless fashion.
