ANSWER




THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF TEXTILES  (SMT. DARSHANA JARDOSH) (a) to (e):	Funds are allocated Scheme-wise on pan-India basis. Funds under various schemes of Ministry of Textiles is not allocated state-wise. Further, textile sector is largely an unorganized sector which is also scattered in rural areas of the country. Hence, no specific data of textile units in Chhattisgarh is available. 	The role of the government is to create a conducive environment and provide enabling conditions for textile manufacturing in the country through its various textile schemes viz. Scheme for Integrated Textile Park, Integrated Processing Development Scheme, Group Workshed Scheme, Common Facility Centre and Amended Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (A-TUFS), Schemes for the development of the PowerloomSector(Power-Tex), National Technical Textiles Mission,  SAMARTH- The Scheme for Capacity Building in Textile Sector (SCBTS), Comprehensive Handloom Cluster Development Scheme (CHCDS), Silk Samagra, Rebate of State and Centre Taxes and Levies (ROSCTL) etc. The Government is supporting the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPVs) formed by the Textile entrepreneurs and individual textile units for development of common infrastructure, common facilities, Group Worksheds and Installation of Technologically upgraded machineries in the form of subsidies under these schemes.	The above schemes are aimed at promotion/upgradation of textile industries/units all over the country including State of Chhattisgarh. ***
