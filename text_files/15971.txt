ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (e): The import and export of hazardous and other waste is regulated according to the provisions of Hazardous and Other Waste (Management and Transboundary Movement)Rules 2016. The Ministry has not granted any permission for import of chemical waste in the country in past three years. Illegal import of waste is seized and confiscated as per Customs Act, 1962.The disposal of seized and confiscated chemical waste is done as per Hazardous and Other Waste management Rules 2016. The prohibited category of waste is either re-exported, if permissible, or destroyed at the risk, cost and the consequence of the importer. The regulated category of waste is permitted for recycling and reprocessing within the permissible parameters by specified agencies authorized by State Pollution Control Boards/Pollution Control Committees(SPCBs/PCCs) for storage and disposal of wastes.Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has prepared a Disposal Manual 2019 for the disposal of goods that are seized/confiscated, unclaimed/ uncleared and covered by time-expired bonds. The Disposal Manual, 2019 lists all previous Instructions/Circulars and eliminates obsolete provisions and revises certain monetary limits, thereby, making the process of disposal more efficient and effective. In addition,interdictions are placed in the Risk Management System (RMS) of CBIC to interdict all bills with declared wastes covered in Part D of Schedule III of the Hazardous and Other Waste (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules 2016. Synonyms of Other wastes are collated and are updated into the RMS for better interdictions of such material. Adequate compulsory compliance requirements are also placed in the RMS to guide the field officers. These interdictions match approximately 6000-6200 bills and hit approximately 3700-4000 bills in a month.*****
