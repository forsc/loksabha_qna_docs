The pilot programme aims to create a new ecosystem based on building competencies of institutions by providing them mentoring support.

In addition to fellowship programmes, DST also provides support for development of research infrastructure and creation of state-of-the-art research laboratories under ‘Consolidation of University Research through Innovation and Excellence in Women Universities (CURIE) Programme’ to enhance women’s participation in S&T domain. Further, women scientists and technologists are also encouraged to avail capacity building programmes related to R&D, entrepreneurship, managerial skills and leadership under ‘National Programme for Training of Women Scientists & Technologists working in Government Sector’.DST has also started a new scheme “Vigyan Jyoti” for girl students of Class 9-12 to encourage them to pursue education and career in science and technology particularly in areas where women are under represented. During 2019-20, Phase-I of Vigyan Jyoti has started in 50 districts of the country. `	Department of Biotechnology (DBT) is also implementing ‘Biotechnology Career Advancement and Re-orientation Programme (BioCARe)’ to encourage women scientists in Biotechnology research. Similarly, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) also has ‘Biomedical Research Career Programme’ for women scientists. Further, University Grants Commission (UGC) also has ‘Post-Doctoral Fellowship for Women’ to provide financial support to emerging women scientists.                                                       *****
