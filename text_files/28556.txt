ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT(SHRI RAMESWAR TELI)(a):	 The Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) has constructed 160 hospitals which are being run either by ESIC or by the State Governments.    (b):	 ESIC hospitals are constructed on the basis of the number of insured persons covered under the ESI Act, 1948 in a catchment area of 25 km radius from the location of the hospital.  As per norms, 50,000 insured persons are required for setting up of a 100 bed ESI hospital. Since Darbhanga has 6932 insured persons, it does not qualify the norm for setting up of an ESI hospital.  At present, primary care services at Darbhanga  are being provided through Insurance Medical Practitioner (IMP) and secondary care services are being provided  through tie-up hospital.                                                      ********
