                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE(SHRI PANKAJ CHAUDHARY)(a) to (g):  Certain representations have been received in this regard. GST rates are prescribed on the recommendation of the GST Council.  In 45th meeting, the Council recommended for revising the rates of GST on garments, textiles and footwear to correct inversion in GST rates on these items. However, subsequently, representations were received by the Government requesting not to implement these rate changes. The Council took note of these representations and in its 46th meeting, dated 31st December, 2021, recommended to defer the decision to change the rates in textiles. Consequently, the existing rates in textile sector would continue beyond 1st January, 2022. As regards handloom textiles, the issue of reduction of GST Rate on Handlooms was placed before the Council in its 21st meeting dated 9th September, 2017 and 28th meeting dated 21st July, 2018. The Council did not recommend any change in rates.******
