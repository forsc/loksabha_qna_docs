It provides livelihood security i.e., fall back options for livelihood for the rural households when no better employment opportunity is available. It also needs to be mentioned that the the Program is mandated to provide employment to an individual to the extent of the entitlement of the household within 15 days of such demand or such other further date from which the employment is demanded.
