                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMERCE & INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL)(a) & (b): Yes, Sir.  All unmanned level crossings (UMLCs) on Broad Gauge (BG) route on Indian Railway have been eliminated by 31.01.2019.  (c)  to (e ): As on 01.04.2020, 37  Road over Bridges (ROBs), 115 Road Under Bridges (RUBs) in Jharkhand and 2 ROBs and 27 RUBs in Jammu  & Kashmir, are  at  various  stages  of  implementation.  Construction  of ROB/RUBs depends upon the consent of State Government for closure of LCs and cost sharing, wherever applicable,  availability of encroachment free land for approach roads, technical feasibility, shifting of utilities,  allocation of adequate funds by State agencies, public support etc.  Therefore, it is not feasible to fix timelines for completion of these ROB/RUBs.*****
