ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[SHRI V. MURALEEDHARAN](a) to (d)	India and Nepal enjoy unique, centuries-old civilizational ties based on shared history, culture, and deep-rooted people-to-people contacts. The two countries have a large canvass of bilateral cooperation in diverse sectors including strengthening of cultural linkages. With a view to promoting cultural exchanges, the two sides entered into agreements for the establishment of twining city relationship between three pairs of cities in India and Nepal, namely: Varanasi-Kathmandu, Bodh Gaya-Lumbini, and Ayodhya-Janakpurdham. The bilateral Joint Working Group for cooperation in the tourism sector has agreed inter alia for promoting the development of joint Buddhist and Ramayana circuits in the two countries. In May 2018, the Prime Ministers of India and Nepal launched the India-Nepal Ramayana Circuit, for which, the Indian side offered a grant of INR 100 crore for the development of Janakpur and its environs, and the two Prime Ministers flagged off the inaugural direct bus service between Janakpur and Ayodhya.In addition, the Government has provided assistance for the construction and restoration of several religious and cultural heritage monuments/sites in Nepal such as the Nepal-Bharat Maitri Pashupati Dharamshala in Kathmandu and the Lumbini Museum. ***
