                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS &ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (e)	 A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT TO BE LAID ON THE TABLE OF LOK SABHA IN RESPECT OF PARTS (a) to (e) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 483 FOR 6TH APRIL, 2022 REGARDING “MOBILE TOWERS CONNECTED TO OPTICAL FIBRE”.(a) 	Sir, Telecom Service Providers fiberise their Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) installed on mobile towers and 7,93,551 BTSs have been connected by optical fibre in the country as on 01.02.2022. The State wise percentage of BTSs connected with Optical Fibre is given at Annexure.(b) to (e) 	The BTS used to provide mobile communications belong to the Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) and the decisions to connect them through fibre or other means including microwave is taken by TSPs based on various techno-commercial considerations including network capacity required at that particular location. The major obstacle in fiberisation of Telecom Towers, as reported by TSPs, are high charges, complex process and delay involved in getting Right of Way (ROW) permissions due to non-alignment of ROW Policy of States with Indian Telegraph Right of Way Rules, 2016 notified by the Central Government.	Government is facilitating the TSPs for laying optical fibre by means of addressing RoW challenges and creating a collaborative institutional mechanism between Centre, States and Local Bodies for Common Right of Way, standardization of costs and timelines for approval, and removal of barriers for grant of approvals. So far, 32 States/Union Territories have largely aligned their State RoW Policy with Indian Telegraph RoW Rules, 2016. DoT has taken up the development of a Centralized online portal for RoW permissions.
