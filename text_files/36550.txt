ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS [SMT. MEENAKASHI LEKHI](a)	No. However, a team of MEA officials was deployed at the Moldova-Ukraine border to facilitate the evacuation of Indian nationals from Ukraine further through Romania. (b) & (c)	Kyiv and Kharkiv were active conflict zones and were facing shelling and aerial strikes. Evacuation from Kyiv and Kharkiv was particularly challenging as the students had to be moved out from their shelters towards the western borders of Ukraine. Our Embassy in Ukraine along with the help of education consultants and the Rectors of Ukranian universities facilitated the movement of the stranded Indians from Kyiv by buses and trains. Many students from Kharkiv were advised to move to Pesochin in view of anticipated escalation of hostilities as it was deemed a safer zone and for a subsequent ferrying by buses to the western borders. Special teams of diplomats were sent to Ukraine and to the borders with neighbouring countries to facilitate the evacuation process. The Indian Embassy’s constant coordination with Ukrainian authorities also contributed to train and bus arrangements in many cases. ***
