                                                        MINISTER OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI RAMVILAS PASWAN)(a) to (d):  The National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) has been successfully implemented in all 36 States/UTs in the country. The Act is being operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and State/Union Territory (UT) Governments. With an intended coverage of 81.35 crore, the Act provides for coverage of upto 75% of rural population and upto 50% of urban population for receiving highly subsidized foodgrains under Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), thus covering about two-thirds of the total population. Coverage under the Act is substantially high to ensure that all the vulnerable and needy sections of the society get its benefit. Beneficiaries covered under NFSA are entitled to receive foodgrains at Rs.1/2/3 per kg for coarsegrains/ wheat/ rice respectively. No proposal to amend the Act or the food subsidy schemes is presently under consideration of the Government.****
