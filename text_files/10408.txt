                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF LAW & JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND  ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a) to (c): Justice Malimath Committee observed that the victims were deprived of their legal rights and did not have a significant role in the criminal proceedings in India. The Committee recommended two types of rights to victims: (i) participation in criminal proceedings; and (ii) right to compensation for the damage and interim relief. Following changes in the Criminal Procedure Code have been made giving some rights to victims in criminal proceedings:1.	Section 357A provides for compensation scheme for the victim or his dependents, who have suffered loss or injury as a result of the crime and who, require rehabilitation.2.	Section 357C provides for treatment of victims (of certain offences) free of cost.3.	Section 372 provides that the victim shall have a right to prefer an appeal against any order passed by the Court acquitting the accused or convicting for a lesser offence or imposing inadequate compensation.
