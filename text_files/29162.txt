                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE (SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a) & (b): The Registry of Supreme Court of India has compiled  data on the status of judicial infrastructure and court amenities including size of court room, basic medical facilities, drinking water with purifiers, library and toilets.  As per this data, 26% court complexes do not have separate ladies toilet.(c) to (e):  Yes, Sir. A proposal has been received from the Chief Justice of India for setting up of National Judicial Infrastructure Authority of India (NJIAI) for arrangement of adequate infrastructure for courts, as per which there will be a Governing Body with Chief Justice of India as Patron-in-Chief. The other salient features in the proposal are that NJIAI will act as a Central body in laying down the road map for planning, creation, development, maintenance and management of functional infrastructure for the Indian Court System, besides, identical structures  under all the High Courts. The primary responsibility of development of Infrastructure facilities for judiciary rests with the State Governments.  To augment the resources of the State Governments, the Union Government has been implementing a Centrally Sponsored Scheme for Development of Infrastructure Facilities in district and subordinate courts by providing financial assistance to State Governments / UTs in the prescribed fund sharing pattern. The Scheme is being implemented since 1993-94. Till date the Central Government has sanctioned Rs. 8709.77 crore under the Scheme to States/UTs. The scheme has been extended from time to time.  Under this scheme funds are released by the Central Government for construction of court buildings and residential accommodations for Judicial Officers of District and Subordinate Judiciary. The Government has extended the above scheme for a further period of five years from 01.04.2021 to 31.03.2026, with a total budgetary outlay of Rs.9000 crores, including Central share of Rs.5307 crores. The scheme components have been expanded, to also cover the construction of toilets, digital computer rooms and Lawyers’ Hall in the district and subordinate courts and Rs. 47.00 crore have been approved for the construction of Toilet complexes in the District and Subordinate Courts. As per information made available by the High Courts, 20,565 Court Halls and 18,142 Residential Units are available in the District and Subordinate Courts as on 31.10.2021. Moreover, 2841 Court Halls and 1807 Residential Units are under construction.********
