ANSWER




 MINISTER OF  PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a)to(b): Demand of coal is higher than the current level of supply of coal in the country. In order to bridge the demand-supply gap of coal, all efforts have been made to increase domestic availability of coal. Coal production has increased from 565.77 MT in 2013-14 to 730.35 MT (Prov.) in 2018-19. Absolute increase in all India coal production from 2013-14 to 2018-19 is 164.58 MT as compared to an increase of coal production of 73.01 MT between 2008-09 and 2013-14. In view of increased production, coal imports fell from a level of 217.78 MT in 2014-15 to 203.95 MT in 2015-16 and 190.95 MT in 2016-17. However, thereafter Import of coal increased to 208.27 MT in 2017-18 and further to 235.24 MT in 2018-19. During the year 2018-19, as against a total actual demand of coal of 969.46 MT, the domestic supply was 734.23 MT (Provisional), coal import was 235.24 MT (Provisional) and the value of the imported coal was Rs.170881 crores.  (c)to(d): The Plants designed and dependent on imported coal are importing coal to meet their requirement. Further, some domestic coal based plants also import coal for blending purposes. In addition, costal power plants import coal considering their cost economies. These imports are likely to continue in the near future. The price of coal depends upon various factors such as quality of coal, international price, country of source etc. and therefore, the future cost of imported coal cannot be estimated.(e): As the coal import comes under Open General License (OGL), Ministry of Coal does not interfere in   the import of coal by domestic consumers or its transportation.****
