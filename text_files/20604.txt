                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (I/C) FOR NEW & RENEWABLE ENERGY, POWER and MoS for  SKILL DEVELOPMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP(SHRI R.K. SINGH)(a) & (b) In October 2017, Government of India through Ministry of Power launched “Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana” - Saubhagya to achieve universal household electrification across the country. The scheme envisaged last mile connectivity and electricity connections to all remaining un-electrified households in rural and all poor households in urban areas. ‘Saubhagya’ scheme included provision of solar based standalone systems to provide electricity to un-electrified households in remote & inaccessible villages/habitations, where grid extension was neither feasible nor cost effective. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy was earlier implementing Remote Village Electrification Programme for electrification of remote villages/habitations, including through solar energy, which was discontinued from 2012-13. (c) & (d) Maharashtra Energy Development Agency (MEDA) has reported that 30,538 off-grid Solar Home Light Systems (SHLs) were installed in Maharashtra under Saubhagya Scheme during 2017-18 & 2018-19 (up to Dec 2019). The off-grid works under the scheme were completed in December, 2019. The District wise number of Solar Home Light Systems (SHLs) installed is given at Annexure.(e) & (f) As reported by the State of Maharashtra all the willing un-electrified households in the State stand electrified as on 31.03.2020.*****
