                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????		 	  (SHRI NARENDRA  SINGH TOMAR)(a) to (f):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House. STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (f) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 130  DUE FOR REPLY ON 11TH FEBRUARY, 2020.(a) to (d): 	Government of India has been promoting organic farming in the states through dedicated schemes namely Mission Organic Value Chain Development North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER) and Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) since 2015-16. Both the schemes aim at promotion of cluster/ Farmers Producer Organization (FPO) based chemical free, low input cost sustainable organic farming and support farmers from input procurement to market linkages.  Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) certified organic production is promoted under PKVY for domestic markets while MOVCDNER aims at 3rd party certified production of niche crops of north east region for exports.  Third party certification of organic farming is promoted by Agriculture Processed Food and Export Development Authority (APEDA), Ministry of Commerce.   The pattern of assistance to promote organic farming under the schemes is given at Annexure I. The state wise detail of area covered under organic farming is at Annexure ll. (e) & (f):	The  research studies under ICAR-All India Network Programme on Organic Farming indicates that comparable yield or slightly higher yield to that of conventional management can be obtained in kharif and summer crops in 2 to 3 years even in intensive agricultural areas under organic farming, while in rabi crops, the yield stabilizes after 5 years. Continuous practice of raising the crops organically has improved the soil fertility and has good potential to sequester the carbon with higher soil organic carbon (22 % increase over bench marks in 6 years). Further, organic farming can be successfully practiced through Integrated Organic Farming Systems (IOFS) where in use of external inputs can be minimized to a great extent through recycling thereby reducing input costs to the farmer and increasing returns.
