ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION(SMT. ANNPURNA DEVI)(a) to (d) :The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country for providing good quality modern education to the talented children predominantly from rural areas. All the districts (as on 31st May, 2014) of the States / UTs, which have accepted the scheme, have been covered under this scheme. The State/ District-wise details where JNVs have not been established so far, as on date, are annexed.Opening of new JNVs is a continuous process which depends on the willingness of the concerned State Government / UT administration to make available requisite suitable land free of cost for construction of the permanent building and making available required temporary building, free of rent, to run the Vidyalaya till the permanent building is constructed. However, actual sanction and opening of new JNV depends on the availability of funds and approval by the Competent Authority. All the 75 districts of Uttar Pradesh State have already been covered under Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme. *****
