ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) : Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY) was launched on 11 October 2014 with the aim of creating holistically developed model Gram Panchayats across the country. The salient features of SAGY are placed in the Annexure-I. (b) : The Hon’ble Members of Parliament have identified 2477 Gram Panchayats across the country under SAGY since its launch. The State/UT wise number of GPs identified under SAGY since its launch is given in Annexure-II. (c)  : Under the SAGY Framework of Guidelines, the development of Gram Panchayats is envisaged through effective convergence and implementation of existing development schemes of Government under the administrative control of respective Ministries without allocation of any additional fund. (d) : The scheme Guidelines have been distributed to all the stakeholders with the view to achieve its intended objectives and also for the development of institutional infrastructure of the villages under the said scheme. As per the Guidelines, the responsibility of implementing the SAGY largely depends on the functionaries concerned at different levels. As the entire programme will be implemented in convergence model, the District Collector plays a significant role. In the SAGY guidelines, as per component 10 (d) ‘the District Collector will be the nodal officer for implementing SAGY. The District collector conducts a monthly review meeting with representatives of the participating line departments. The Members of Parliament concerned will chair the review meetings. The heads of the GPs concerned will also be invited for these monthly meetings’. Also, the Ministry has provided training on SAGY implementation process to the Gram Panchayat heads.  The Ministry has prepared a compendium on SAGY containing supporting materials to help various stakeholders in the implementation of SAGY and distributed the same amongst the participants of the said training programme. (e) : The steps taken by the Government to give impetus to the efforts of Members of Parliament for the successful implementation of the SAGY in their adopted Gram Panchayats are placed in Annexure-III. ******
