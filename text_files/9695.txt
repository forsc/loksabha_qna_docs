                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (c): 	The Government of India is implementing “Strengthening of Tertiary Care Cancer facilities Scheme” to assist States/UTs in setting up of State Cancer Institutes (SCI) and Tertiary Care Cancer Centres (TCCC) in different parts of the country. Till date, proposals for setting up of 18 SCIs and 20 TCCCs have been approved in different parts of the country including Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The State/UT wise list of approved SCIs/TCCCs is at Annexure. Oncology in its various aspects is at the focus in case of new AIIMS and many upgraded institutions under Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojna (PMSSY). Setting up of National Cancer Institute at Jhajjar (Haryana) and second campus of Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata are also steps in this direction. All these will enhance the capacity for treatment of cancer in the country.
