ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF ROAD TRANSPORT AND HIGHWAYS (SHRI NITIN JAIRAM GADKARI)(a) to (d) In order to augment budgetary support with the objective of facilitating faster pace of development of National Highway network, participation from the private sector is found to be necessary. A road project involves construction and tolling risk. To harness the support of private sector, depending upon the risk appetite of the private investors, whether they are willing to take construction and/ or tolling risk, a number of PPP modes have been devised. These modes include BOT(Toll), BOT(Annuity), HAM, ToT etc. The mode of delivery of a project is decided keeping in view the size of the project, financial viability, capacity of the bidders in the segment and the overall financing plan. With the assistance of these schemes, the Ministry has been able to achieve a construction rate of 37 km per day and in the period 2014-2021, the NH network has increased from 91,287 km  (March, 2014) to 1,39,299 km (present).  *****
