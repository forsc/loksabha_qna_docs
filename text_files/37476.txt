                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND  ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW)(a) to (d) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.****** STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 4497 BY SHRI RANJEETSINGH HINDURAO NAIK NIMBALKAR AND SHRI ARUN SAO TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 30.03.2022 REGARDING EXTENSION OF RAILWAY SERVICES IN CHHATTISGARH AND MAHARASHTRA(a) & (b) Indian Railways do not run train services on State-wise basis as Railway network straddles across State boundaries. However, introduction of train services is an ongoing process on Indian Railways, subject to traffic justification, operational feasibility, availability of resources, etc.  (c) The Railway Projects are sanctioned Zonal Railway-wise and not State-wise as the projects may span across State boundaries. Since 2014, there has been substantial increase in Budget allocation and commensurate commissioning of projects across Indian Railways. However, in these two states Budget allocations are as under:1.  Maharashtra: Average Budget allocation for Infrastructure projects and safety works, falling fully/ partly in Maharashtra including Solapur and Pune, during 2014-19 has been enhanced to `4,801 crore per year from `1,171 crore per year (during 2009-14) which is 310% more than average allocation during 2009-14 (`1171 crore/year). These allocations have been increased to `7,281 crore in Financial Year 2019-20 (522% more than the Average Annual Budget allocation of 2009-14) and `6,700 crore in Financial Year 2020-21 (472% more than the Average Annual Budget allocation of 2009-14). For Financial Year 2021-22, highest ever budget outlay of `8,547 crore (Original BE `7,277 crore and additional outlay `1,270 crore) has been provided for these projects, which is 630% more than the Average Annual Budget Outlay of 2009-14 (`1171 crore per year). 2. Chhattisgarh: Average Annual Budget allocation for Infrastructure projects & safety works, falling fully/ partly in State of Chhattisgarh including Bilaspur, during 2014-19 has been enhanced to `2,274 crore per year from `311 crore per year during 2009-14, which is 631% more than the Average Annual Budget allocation during 2009-14.  These allocations have been increased to `3,269 crore in Financial Year 2019-20 (951% more than the Average Annual Budget allocation of 2009-14) and `3,874 crore in Financial Year 2020-21 (1146% more than the Average Annual Budget allocation of 2009-14). For Financial Year 2021-22, a budget outlay of `3,730 crore {Original Budget Outlay BE `3690 crore and additional allotment `40 Crore} has been provided for these projects, which is 1,099% more than the Average Annual Budget outlay of 2009-14 (`311 crore per year).(d) For provision of passenger amenities, railway stations are categorized based on the annual passenger earnings (reserved and unreserved) and number of outward passengers handled at the station. At the time of construction of station, Minimum Essential Amenities (MEA) is provided as per norms based on the category of station. Recommended and Desirable Amenities are further escalated from time to time with growth in passenger traffic at stations, based on needs and expectations of the travelling public and availability of funds.However, augmentation/upgradation of Railway station is a continuous and on-going process and works in this regard are undertaken depending upon need, volume of the passenger traffic and inter-se priority subject to availability of funds.                                               ******
