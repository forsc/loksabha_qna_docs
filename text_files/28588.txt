An airspace map of the country segregating the entire airspace into green, yellow and red zones is available on the digital sky platform to facilitate the operation of drones. Operation of drones in yellow and red zones is subject to the approval of Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Central Government respectively. No approval is however required for operation of drones in green zones which means the airspace upto a vertical distance of 400 feet.;;(c) & (d) Digital Sky Platform seeks to regulate the entire gamut of operation of drone in the country. The airspace map of the country segregating the entire airspace into green, yellow and red zones is available on the digital sky platform to facilitate the operation of drones.
