                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES(SHRI PRAHLAD SINGH PATEL) (a) to (c): There has been decline in export of marine products from the country, including from the State of Kerala, during last three years.  However, as per export data of current year up to November 2021, the exports have increased compared to the same period last year. The reasons for the decline is thus not attributable exclusively to COVID-19 pandemic situation.  However, government is aware that alike other sectors, food processing sector including seafood processing sector, also went through several hitches during the lockdown because of issues such as reduction in processing capacity due to plant shutdowns, disruption in logistics and movement of workers, labor availability, drop in demand, etc.  In order to facilitate food processing units to resume their operations, the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) had established a dedicated Grievance Cell and a Task Force during outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic to liaison with State authorities. A total of 649 industry related issues were resolved by this Cell.  In addition, advisory was issued to all States/UTs about exemptions given to food processing industries from lockdown restrictions, and request was also made to allow functioning of all food business operations, subject to adherence of prescribed COVID norms. (d) & (e): As a part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiatives, the Government has launched following scheme which has components for supporting fishery sector and food processing sector in the country, including in the State of Kerala: (i)	Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) by the Department of Fisheries with an estimated investment of Rs.20,050 crores for implementation in all the States/Union Territories including Kerala over a period of 5 years from FY 2020-21 to FY 2024-25. (ii)	Production Linked Incentive scheme (PLIS) by the MoFPI with an outlay of Rs.10,900 crores to support creation of global food manufacturing champions and support Indian Brands of food products in international market.(iii)	PM Formalisation of Micro Food Processing Enterprises Scheme (PMFME) for providing financial, technical and business support for setting up/upgradation of 2 lakh micro food processing enterprises across the country during five years from 2020-21 to 2024-25 based on One District One Product (ODOP) approach with an outlay of Rs.10,000 crore.*****
