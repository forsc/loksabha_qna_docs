                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a) to (d):	Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare conducts counselling for admission to undergraduate and postgraduate medical/dental courses for All India Quota seats and all the seats of Deemed Universities. DGHS informed that it had issued a public notice that the Deemed Universities should ask only for annual fee and also not insist upon Bank Guarantee by candidates during admission to avoid harassment of the candidates. DGHS received complaints from students regarding demand of Bank Guarantee at the time of admission in MBBS/BDS courses by some Deemed Universities. Accordingly, a letter was issued by the DGHS to the concerned Deemed Universities requesting them not to insist on Bank Guarantee in NEET (UG) counselling.  Further, in the case of Private Medical/Dental Colleges, the respective States are conducting counselling for admission in MBBS/BDS seats.  The complaints against the private medical/dental colleges with regard to charging of fee, as and when received are forwarded to the concerned State Government for appropriate action. However, no data of such complaints is maintained centrally.
