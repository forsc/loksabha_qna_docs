                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE????????????????????????		(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) &(b) :   The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) introduced in the country from Kharif 2016 season is voluntary for States and farmers. Comprehensive risk coverage for crops of farmers against all non-preventable natural risks from pre-sowing to post-harvest stages of the crops at very minimum premium for the farmers is provided under the scheme. The PMFBY is successfully fulfilling the objectives of the scheme including providing financial support to stabilize income of farmers especially in natural calamity hit seasons/years/areas.   Since inception of the scheme in 2016-17 till 2020-21, against premium of Rs. 24,966 crore paid by farmers, claims of Rs. 1,15,369  crore have been paid to about 10.21 crore farmer applications.	District-wise details of farmer applications who got the benefit of Government subsidy under the scheme in Odisha for the year 2020-21 are annexed.(c) :	The scheme is being regularly reviewed in consultation with stakeholders especially to address the challenges faced in its operational implementation.  Accordingly, after detailed discussions with various stakeholders, the operational guidelines of the scheme were revised and revamped with effect from Rabi 2018 season and Kharif 2020 season respectively. The major improvements made include making the scheme voluntary for all farmers, compulsory use of atleast 0.5% of the gross premium collected by insurance companies for Information, Education and Communication (IEC) activities; penalty provision for delay in settlement of claims by insurance companies & late release of share by States; intensive use of technology, change in financial sharing pattern from 50 : 50 between Central and State Government in NER to 90 : 10; long term i.e. 3 year contract to insurance companies; freedom to States to choose risk cover as per requirements; use of technology etc. (d) : Being a Central Sector Scheme, State-wise allocation/release is not made under the PMFBY.  Claims payment as per provisions of the scheme is the responsibility of the concerned insurance companies.  Details of budget/allocation and actual release under the scheme since inception of the scheme till 2021-22 are given in following table :(Rs. in Crore)Year	Revised Estimates	Actual Release2016-17	13240.04	11054.632017-18	10701.26	9419.792018-19	12983.1	11945.38862019-20	13640.85	12638.322020-21	15307.25	13902.792021-22	15989.39	9719.2479 (as on 20.03.2022)
