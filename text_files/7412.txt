ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):	The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare conducted National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-4 (2015-16) and NFHS-3 (2005-06) wherein inter-alia information was collected on full immunization coverage for children of age 12-23 months. As per the NFHS-4, the percentage of children (of age 12 to 23 months) who were fully immunized in Uttar Pradesh and India were 51.1 percentage and 62.0 percentage respectively. However, while comparing with NFHS-3, the percentage of children (of age 12 to 23 months) who were fully immunized in Uttar Pradesh and India were 23.0 percentage and 43.5 percentages respectively. The details are at Annexure. The low coverage of Uttar Pradesh as per the National Family Health Survey 2015-16 is largely due to partially immunized children. The reasons for partial immunization are mainly awareness gap, migration of parents, service delivery gap/refusal and apprehension due to adverse events following immunization (AEFI) like fever, irritability etc. (b) & (c):	Immunization program in the country including in Uttar Pradesh is being strengthened by increasing awareness through enhanced Information Education and Communication (IEC) activities to make the immunization programme more successful.Uttar Pradesh had conducted a special drive known as ‘Mission Indradhanush’ in 6 phases across all the districts wherein a total of 1.76 crore of children and 49.04 lakh of pregnant women were vaccinated. Uttar Pradesh had also conducted ‘Gram Swaraj Abhiyaan’ in 3387 villages across all the districts and ‘Extended Gram Swaraj Abhiyaan’ in 5130 villages across all the districts.
