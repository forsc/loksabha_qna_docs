                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE(DR. BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR)(a)	to (d):“Public Health and Hospitals” being a State subject, the primary responsibility of strengthening public healthcare system, including for strengthening the provision of primary healthcare services in public healthcare system and regulation of hospitals including those in metro cities, lies with the respective State Governments.  However, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare provides technical and financial support to the States/UTs to strengthen the public healthcare delivery at public healthcare facilities. Support under National Health Mission (NHM) is provided to States/ UTs to supplement the efforts of the State/UT governments, for setting up of new facilities as per norms and upgradation of existing facilities for bridging the infrastructure and human resource gaps, based on the requirements posted by them in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) and within their overall resource envelope.Under NHM, States are supported for several interventions towards strengthening the primary healthcare services in the country and the same is given in the Annexure.  Ayushman Bharat, a flagship scheme of Government of India, is an attempt to move from sectoral and segmented approach of health service delivery to a comprehensive need-based health care service. This scheme aims to undertake path breaking interventions to holistically address the healthcare system (covering prevention, promotion and ambulatory care) at the primary, secondary and tertiary level. Ayushman Bharat adopts a continuum of care approach, comprising of two inter-related components, which are –(i)	Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs) (ii)	Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY)As part of Ayushman Bharat, the Government is supporting the States for transformation of Sub Health Centres and Primary Health Centres into 1.5 lakh Health and Wellness Centres across the country by December, 2022 for provision of Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) that includes preventive healthcare and health promotion at the community level with continuum of care approach. Under this programme, CPHC services of an expanded range of services, that are universal and free to users, with a focus on wellness, are provided, closer to the community. As on 4th August 2021, 77,673 HWCs are operational across the country. Delhi is not implementing the scheme. As reported by the States/UTs in the HWC Portal, cumulatively, these HWCs reported a total of 56.86 Cr footfalls and a cumulative 32.99 Cr Screenings for common Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs). A total of 76.39 lakh wellness Sessions have been reported from these functional HWCs. Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), aims at providing a health cover of Rs. 5 lakhs per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization to over 10.74 Crores poor and vulnerable families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries)as per Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) and at reducing out-of-pocket expenditure on healthcare services. 33 States and UTs are currently implementing the scheme except West Bengal, Odisha and Delhi. The implementing States/UTs have expanded the beneficiary base to cover 13.44 Crore families.  As on date, more than 1.98 Cr. hospital admissions worth Rs.24,683 Cr have been authorized under the scheme.
