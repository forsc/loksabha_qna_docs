                                                        ANSWERMINISTER FOR MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND MINISTRY OF EARTH SCIENCES(DR. HARSH VARDHAN)(a)	Yes Sir, Considering the recorded history of earthquakes in the country, a total of ~59% of the land mass of India is prone to earthquakes of different intensities. As per the seismic zoning map of the country, the total area is classified into four seismic zones. Zone V is seismically the most active region, while zone II is the least. Approximately, ~ 11% area falls in zone V, ~18% in zone IV, ~ 30% in zone III and remaining in zone II.(b)	The cities of the country falling under very high-risk zone V/highly vulnerable zone, state/UT wise, are given below:State:  CitiesAndaman and Nicobar Island: All citiesBihar: Araria, Sitamarhi, Darbhanga, Madhubani, Motihari, Saharsa, Kishanganj, Madhepura, Saharsa, SupaulGujarat: BhujHimachal Pradesh: Hamirpur, Dharamsala, Chamba, Mandi, KulluJammu Kashmir: SrinagarNE states: All cities of Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram and NagalandUttarakhand: Pithoragarh, Chamoli, Rudraprayag, Bageswar, AlmoraWest Bengal: Cooch Behar (c).     NDMA has been conducting regular awareness campaigns every year through print, electronic   as well as social media from time to time, on earthquakes that include precautions for building safety from earthquakes. Also, Guidelines have been published by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), Building Materials & Technology Promotion Council (BMTPC) and Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) etc. for design and construction of earthquake resistant structures to minimize the loss of life and damage to property caused by earthquakes. These guidelines are in wide circulation amongst the public and the administrative authorities responsible for the design and construction of earthquake resistant structures in earthquake prone areas. (d), (e) and (f)Presently, no proven system exists in the country to provide the early warning of earthquakes. Moreover, there is no scientific technique available anywhere in the world to predict an earthquake precisely in terms of time, location and its magnitude.****
