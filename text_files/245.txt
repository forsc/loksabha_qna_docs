                                                        FINANCE MINISTER(Smt. NIRMALA SITHARAMAN)(a) to (c): The Central Government is receiving requests for grant of Special Category Status from Odisha, Rajasthan, Bihar, Telangana, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh. Special Category Status for plan assistance has been granted in the past by the National Development Council (NDC) to some States that are characterized by a number of features necessitating special consideration. These features include: (i) hilly and difficult terrain (ii) low population density and / or sizeable share of tribal population (iii) strategic location along borders with neighbouring countries (iv) economic and infrastructural backwardness and (v) non-viable nature of state finances. Special Category Status for plan assistance to any state has been granted based on an integrated consideration of these criteria. However, there is no proposal under consideration of the Central Government for grant of Special Category Status.(d) & (e): The Special Category Status for plan assistance granted by the National Development Council does not provide for any specific measure for growth of industries.                                         ******
