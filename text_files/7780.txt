ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES & PENSIONS AND PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR.JITENDRA SINGH):    (a)	Yes, Sir.  Nuclear power is clean and environment friendly, apart from having a huge potential to ensure the country’s long term energy security.  A large nuclear power expansion programme is being implemented towards this end. The present installed nuclear power capacity of 6780 MW is expected to reach 22480 MW on progressive completion of projects under construction and sanctioned projects.(b)	The tariffs of electricity generated by nuclear power are comparable to those of the contemporary conventional base load power generating units like coal based thermal power located in the area/region.(c)	To increase the share of nuclear power generation, the government has taken several steps to increase the nuclear power capacity and to provide adequate quantity of fuel. These include:i.	Accord of administrative approval and financial sanction of - ten (10) indigenous 700 MW Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) to be set up in fleet mode & two (02) units of Light Water Reactors (LWRs) to be set up in cooperation with Russian Federation.ii.	Creation of Indian Nuclear Insurance Pool (INIP) in the context of implementation of Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act.iii.	Amendment of the Atomic Energy Act to enable Joint Ventures of Public Sector Companies to set up nuclear power projects.iv.	Entering into enabling agreements with foreign countries for nuclear power cooperation including supply of fuel.In the next four years, a capacity of 5300 MW comprising of Seven (7) reactor units under construction is expected to be added, taking the installed nuclear power capacity from 6780 MW to 12080 MW.(d)	The power generated by nuclear power plants is allocated by the Ministry of Power (MoP) to the various beneficiary States / Union territories in the region. As per the extant MoP guidelines, 50% of power is allocated to the Home State, 15% is retained as unallocated power for allocation by the Government for meeting the urgent/overall requirement and the remaining 35% is to be allocated to other beneficiaries (except home state) in accordance with the pattern of central plan assistance and energy consumption during the previous five years, both factors having equal weightage.*****
