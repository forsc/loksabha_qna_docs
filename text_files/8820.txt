ANSWER




(a) & (b) Bureau of Pharma PSUs of India (BPPI) is the implementing agency of Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) which works under the administrative control of the Department of Pharmaceuticals, Government of India. It operates Janaushadhi Kendras on franchisee like a model where stores are opened and operated by private entrepreneurs and NGOs. The Opening of an outlet depends upon application received from private entrepreneurs and NGOs for any particular area. Further, BPPI has no role in the allocation of space in Government Hospitals. Only one complete application has been received from Darbhanga with drug license and the said store is functional at Ramdhani Seva Sadan General Hospital, Lohna Road, Ujjan, Manigachhi. Further, no new application is received from Darbhanga.(c) & (d) Department of Pharmaceuticals has written request letters to Hon’ble Chief Minister & Chief Secretary, Government of Bihar to open Janaushadhi Kendras in maximum number of government hospitals in Bihar. Continuous efforts are made by requesting district magistrate to expedite opening of Janaushadhi Kendras to make available quality generic medicines at affordable prices to the citizens. BPPI’s Marketing Officers are also organizing various workshops and seminars to encourage private entrepreneurs, NGOs and unemployed pharmacists for opening of Janaushadhi Kendras.*****
