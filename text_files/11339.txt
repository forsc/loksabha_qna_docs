The Ministry releases funds periodically in two tranches with each tranche consisting of one or more instalments based on agreed to Labour Budget (Persondays), opening balance, pace of utilization of funds, pending liabilities of the previous year, if any, and overall performance.(d) & (e): The expenditure under the Scheme by all States/UTs are annually audited and after receipt of audited report of the previous financial year, the second tranche of funds are released.
