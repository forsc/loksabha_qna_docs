ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):    The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) was launched during the year 2015-16 with the motto of ‘Har Khet Ko Paani’ for providing end-to-end solutions in irrigation supply chain, viz. water sources, distribution network and farm level applications. The scheme is being implemented in various States of the country including Maharashtra. The components of PMKSY are as under: i.	Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP): To focus on faster completion of ongoing Major and Medium Irrigation projects including National Projects. Implemented by Ministry of Jal Shakti.  ii.	PMKSY-Har Khet Ko Pani (HKKP): Source augmentation, distribution, ground water development, lift irrigation, diversion of water from water plenty to water scarce areas, repair, restoration, renovation of traditional water bodies.  Implemented by Ministry of Jal Shakti.  Contd..2/--2-           During 2016-17, ninety-nine (99) on-going Major/Medium irrigation projects under PMKSY- (AIBP), having ultimate irrigation potential of 76.03 lakh ha. have been prioritized in consultation with States, for completion in phases up to December, 2019 along with their Command Area Development & Water Management (CADWM) works. Out of these 99 prioritized projects, AIBP works of 34 prioritized projects have been reported to be completed/almost completed. Cumulative Irrigation Potential of about 54.45 lakh ha has been created through these 99 prioritized projects as on 31.03.2018.   iii.	PMKSY-Watershed Development (WDC): Focuses on development of rainfed portions of the net cultivated area and culturable wastelands. Activities include ridge area treatment, drainage line treatment, soil and moisture conservation, rain water harvesting, nursery raising, afforestation, horticulture, pasture development, livelihood for asset less persons, etc. Implemented by Department of Land Resources.  iv.	PMKSY-Per Drop More Crop (PDMC): Focuses on enhancing water use efficiency at farm level through Micro Irrigation technologies viz. Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation. Implemented by Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare.             State wise achievements made under the components of PMKSY including Maharashtra are given at Annexure-I to VI.(b):   The Group of Secretaries (GoS) has recommended a target of 10 Million ha for Micro Irrigation from 2017-18 to 2021-22. The Department encourages the farmers to take advantage of PMKSY-PDMC by wide publicity through press & print media, publication of leaflets/booklets, organization of workshops, exhibitions, farmer fairs, information on State/Government of India web portals etc.  In addition, Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) imparts training and organizes  field demonstrations through Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVK) to educate farmers for promotion of Micro Irrigation. 	The Government provides financial assistance @ 55% for small and marginal farmers and @ 45% for other farmers for installation of Drip and Sprinkler systems under the scheme. In addition, some States provide additional incentives for encouraging farmers to adopt Micro Irrigation.   Further, 25% higher amount have been taken into calculation of subsidy for the North Eastern and Himalayan states and 15% higher for States with low penetration of Micro Irrigation for larger adoption of systems by the farmers under the scheme.(c) & (d):   The Government had constituted an Inter-ministerial Committee to examine issues relating to “Doubling of Farmers Income” and recommend strategies to achieve the same in April, 2016.  The Committee has submitted its Report to the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare in September, 2018.            To achieve this, the Committee has identified seven sources of income growth viz., improvement in crop productivity; improvement in livestock productivity; resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; increase in the cropping intensity; diversification towards high value crops; improvement in real prices received by farmers; and shift from farm to non-farm occupations.   Several initiatives have already been taken among each of the above mentioned strategies which inter-alia  are given at Annexure VII.        The initiatives would impact large numbers of farmers of the country in doubling their income by the year 2022.
