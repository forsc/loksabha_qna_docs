                                                        MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU)(a) to (g) The aim and objective of setting up Fast Track Courts (FTCs) is for fast tracking the disposal of cases of heinous crimes; civil cases involving senior citizens, women, children, disabled and litigants affected with HIV-AIDS and other terminal ailments and civil disputes involving land acquisitions and property/rent disputes pending for more than five years.        Setting up of FTCs and its functioning fall within the domain of the respective State Governments in consultation with the respective High Courts.  FTCs were created during 11th Finance Commission for disposal of longpending casesbased on the findings of a study that one such court disposes up to 168 cases in a year.  Central funding has been discontinued after 31.03.2015.  Subsequently, 14th Finance Commission had recommended that the number of FTCs to be established should be 10% of the sanctioned strength of Judicial Officers of the State.  The 14th Finance Commission had recommended the setting up of 1800 FTCs during 2015-2020 and had urged State Governments to utilize enhanced fiscal space available through tax devolution (32% to 42%) for this purpose.  The details of funds allocated by State/UT Governments and their expenditure on these courts from 14th Finance Commission period onwards is not maintained at Central Government level.  Presently, there are 956 functional FTCs including Jharkhand and Karnataka.  The number of FTCs proposed and functional in the country including Jharkhand and Karnataka is given at Annexure-I.  Information on the number of cases disposed of during the last three years and current year alongwith the number of cases pending in these FTCs, as made available by the various High Courts is given at Annexure-II.ANNEXURE-ILOK SABHA UNSTARRED QUESTION NO.2571 TO BE ANSWERED ON 4.8 2021NO.
