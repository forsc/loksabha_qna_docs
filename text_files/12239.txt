(i) Nagar Van Yojana and (ii) School Nursery Yojana.Nagar Van Yojana aims to create/ develop at least one City Forest in each city having Municipal Corporation/ Class I Cities for providing wholesome healthy living environment, and contributing to growth of Smart, Clean, Green, Sustainable and Healthy cities. The School Nursery Yojana aims at involving school students in raising plant nurseries to bring them closer to natural environment, help them understand the natural processes of germination and feel the joy of watching saplings grow.*****
