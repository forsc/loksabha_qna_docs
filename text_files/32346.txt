ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a): The estimation of poverty using poverty line had been done by the erstwhile Planning Commission based on the large sample surveys on household consumer expenditure carried out by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) whereas, the Ministry of Rural development conducted Below Poverty Line (BPL) censuses in 1992, 1997 and 2002 only to identify the poor households in the rural areas, who could be potential beneficiaries under various programmes of the Government of India. According to the last poverty estimates released by the erstwhile Planning Commission following the methodology recommended by Tendulkar Committee for the year 2011-12, the poverty line was defined on the basis of monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) as the criterion. For the year 2011-12, the poverty line at all India level has been estimated as Rs. 816 for rural areas and Rs.1000 for urban areas. The number of persons living below the poverty line in 2011-12 were estimated at 27 crore (21.9%). State/UT wise BPL population  for the year 2011-12 is at Annexure-I. (b) & (c):  Recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of poverty, Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011 (SECC 2011)  was conducted in place of erstwhile BPL censuses. SECC-2011 provides data of households on various aspects of their socio-economic status viz., housing, landholding/ landlessness, educational status, status of women, the differently abled persons, occupation, possession of assets, scheduled caste/ scheduled tribe (SC/ST) households, income, etc. Beneficiaries under several schemes of Government of India as well as many State Governments are selected based on the (i) “automatically excluded households”,(ii) “ automatically included households” and (iii) “ deprived households” data of SECC-2011. SECC-2011 data is being used for selecting beneficiaries in Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G), Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana- National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM), Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana(PMUY), Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana, etc. *******
