ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI KAPIL MORESHWAR PATIL)(a) & (b) ‘Panchayats and Municipalities’, being ‘Local Government’, are State subjects and part of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. ‘Panchayats’ are governed by Part IX of the Constitution and ‘Municipalities’ by Part IXA which contain mutually exclusive provisions. Powers, authority and responsibilities of Panchayats emanate from Article 243G of the Part IX which provides that the Legislature of a State may, by law, endow the Panchayats with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as institutions of self-government. Accordingly, executive powers of village sarpanch and district Panchayat chairman are governed by Panchayati Raj Acts of respective States/Union Territories. As these powers vary from State to State, such details are not maintained centrally. (c) In terms of Article 243A of the Constitution of India, a Gram Sabha may exercise such powers and perform such functions at the village level as the Legislature of a State may, by law, provide.  Accordingly, Panchayati Raj Acts of respective States provide for holding of minimum number of meetings by the Gram Sabhas. Gram Sabhas play a pivotal role in promoting social sustainability and strengthening grassroots level democracy including implementation of various government schemes, ensuring transparency and accountability in Panchayats. However, the details regarding number of meetings of Gram Sabhas to be held every year are not maintained centrally as these are guided by the respective Panchayati Raj Acts and vary across States/Union Territories._____
