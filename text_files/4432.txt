JITENDRA SINGH)(a) to (c ):  So far as CBI is concerned, it has registered 61 regular cases relating to corruption and disproportionate assets  against 86 number of  IAS/IPS/IRS officers during the last three years i.e. 2016, 2017, 2018 & 2019 (upto 30.06.2019). During the last 3 years i.e. 2016, 2017, 2018 & 2019 (up to 30.06.19) 26 numbers of IAS/IPS/IRS Officers figuring in 20 regular cases have been convicted.

Therefore, it is not correct to say that    overall corruption has increased in the country.(e) & (f):  As per CVC, the Commission as part of a multi-pronged strategy has been stressing on preventive, participative and punitive vigilance measures for effectively tackling corruption. The Commission over the years has been emphasising on preventive vigilance initiatives to be undertaken by organisations seeks to fulfil the objective of pre-empting corrupt practices, while enhancing organisational efficiency. The Commissions’ emphasis has led to various successful initiatives by many organisations to undertake systemic improvements in areas prone to corruption. (g): “The Central Government is committed to its policy of “Zero Tolerance Against Corruption” and has taken several measures to combat corruption. The steps taken by the Central Government to combat corruption, inter alia, include:(i)	Systemic improvements and reforms to provide transparent citizen-friendly services and reduce corruption. These, inter alia include:a)	Disbursement of welfare benefits directly to the citizens under various schemes of the Government in a transparent manner through the Direct Benefit Transfer initiative.b)	Implementation of E-tendering in public procurements.c)	Introduction of e-Governance and simplification of procedure and systems.d)	Introduction of Government procurement through the Government e-Marketplace (GeM).(ii)	Discontinuation of interviews in recruitment of Group ‘B’ (Non-Gazetted) and Group ‘C’ posts in Government of India.(iii)	Invocation of FR-56(j) and AIS (DCRB) Rules, 1958 for prematurely retiring officials whose performance has been reviewed and found unsatisfactory.(iv)	The All India Services (Disciplinary and Appeal) Rules and Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules have been amended to provide for strict timelines in the procedure related to disciplinary proceedings.(v)	The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 has been amended on 26.07.2018 to bring a paradigm shift in tackling corruption in as much as clearly criminalizing the act of giving bribe, checking big ticket corruption by creating a vicarious liability in respect of senior management of commercial organizations where the act of giving of bribe is with their consent or connivance.(vi)	Issue of instructions by the CVC asking the organizations to adopt Integrity Pact in major procurement activities and to ensure effective and expeditious investigation wherever any irregularity/misconduct is noticed.(vii)	The institution of Lokpal has been operationalised by appointment of a Chairperson and eight Members, including four judicial Members.
