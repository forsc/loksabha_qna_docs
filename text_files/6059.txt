ANSWER




                                                        ANSWERTHE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE(SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a):	Public health and hospitals being a State subject, the primary responsibility to provide ambulance services lies with the respective State Governments/UTs. However, under the National Health Mission (NHM), technical and financial support is provided to States/UTs to strengthen their healthcare systems including support for emergency medical transport of patients under Dial 108, Dial 102/104 ambulance services, and other patient transport vehicles, based on the proposals made by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) within their overall resource envelope.  Under Dial 108, States are supported for both Basic Life Support (BLS) and the Advanced Life Support (ALS) Ambulances. Norms for support include one ALS Ambulance for an average five Lakh population and one BLS Ambulance for over one lakhpopulation. However, if the average utilisation per ambulance per day is higher than 4 trips (or 120 kms travelled) for densely populated areas and 3 trips (or 80 kms travelled) for Hilly areas, then the states can be supported for additional ambulances. As per NHM-MIS, State/UT-wise number of Dial-108 and Dial-102/104 ambulances and empanelled vehicles operational under NHM as on 31st March,2019 is given at      Annexure - I. (b):	The data on number of death of patients reported due to failure of ambulances to reach the hospitals in time, is not maintained centrally.(c):	A statement showing State-wise approval of funds for National Ambulances Service for Financial Year 2019-20 including Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, is at Annexure-II.
