Once the proposed scheme is approved and modalities decided, location of mega textile parks may be selected under Challenge Method.

The scheme is scaled up upto 31.03.2021. The primary objective of the Scheme is to provide financial assistance to a group of entrepreneurs to establish stateof-the-art infrastructure facilities in a cluster for setting up their textile units, common infrastructure, factory building, building for common facilities like testing laboratory, design centre, ware-housing facilities, raw material depot, packaging unit, workers’ hostel and marketing support system(backward/forward linkages) etc. conforming to international environmental and social standards and thereby mobilize private investment in the textile sector and generate fresh employment opportunities.
