State-wise average annual production of garlic for the years 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20 and current year 2020-21 (3rd Advance Estimates) is given at Annexure-I.	Minimum Support Price (MSP) is extended to 25 crops which have significant production/ consumption and which have longer shelf life on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), after obtaining the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/ Departments concerned and other relevant factors. The Government implements Market Intervention Scheme (MIS) for procurement of agriculture and horticulture commodities including garlic, which are perishable in nature, on the request of States/ UTs. The MIS is implemented in order to protect the growers of these commodities from making distress sale in the event of bumper crop during the peak arrival period when there is at least 10% increase in production or 10% decrease in the ruling market prices compared to the previous normal year. In the recent past, MIS has been extended to the farmers growing garlic in the state of Rajasthan during the periods 2017-18 and 2018-19. (d) & (e):     The Government is implementing the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) for promoting cultivation of horticulture crops, including garlic, in the country. Under MIDH, assistance is provided for area expansion of Rhizomatic spices including garlic at a rate of 40% cost norms of Rs. 30,000 per hectare (i.e. a maximum of Rs. 12000/Ha) for cultivation of a maximum area of 4 hectares per beneficiary in single instalment. State-wise utilization of funds for Rhizomatic spices (including garlic) out of fund provided under MIDH for the three years is at Annexure-II.  (f):    The Government is implementing MIDH Scheme, which envisages promotion of cultivation of horticulture crops, including garlic and onion, through activities such as area expansion, protected cultivation, integrated pest management/integrated nutrient management, organic farming, creation of water resources structures, post-harvest management, development of market yards, setting up of cold storage, human resource development, etc.  For sugarcane, the Government is implementing Sugarcane Development Programme under National Food Security Mission (NFSM) in 13 major sugarcane growing States for enhancing production and productivity. Besides, States can also support Sugarcane Development Programme under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) with the approval of State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC).           Besides, through the Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), implemented since 2015-16, the Government aims to promote, develop and disseminate micro irrigation technology for horticulture and agriculture development, increase productivity of crops and income of farmers through precision water management; promote micro-irrigation technologies in water intensive/consuming crops like sugarcane, banana, cotton etc. including horticulture crops.            Further, to enhance the production and productivity of Garlic, Onion and Sugarcane, Indian Council of Agricultural Research(ICAR) is undertaking flagship projects to promote research in different areas such as crop improvement, crop production and Post Harvest Technology through its institutes such as Directorate of Onion and Garlic (DOGR), Rajgurunagar, Pune, Indian Institutes of Horticulture Research, Bengaluru for garlic and onion and Indian Institutes of Sugarcane Research, Lucknow and Sugarcane Breeding Institutes, Coimbatore for Sugarcane.
