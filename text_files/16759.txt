ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR MINISTRY OF PLANNING AND MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) FOR MINISTRY OF STATISTICS & PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION  (RAO INDERJIT SINGH)(a)	As per report of the study on “KVKs’ impact on dissemination of improved practices and technologies” conducted by National institute of Labour Economics Research & Development (NILERD); about 80 percent of the villages covered by KVKs were more than 10 km away from the KVK campus;(b)	Studies on performance and impact of KVKs have been done by NILERD twice in 2015 and 2018. The main recommendations of these studies are as follows: •	KVKs should be strengthened by adding more number of staff.•	To make KVKs effective, adequate budget should be allocated.•	There needs to be a provision for alternative power supply through generators.•	KVK should initiate awareness programmes through advertisements using print and electronic media, mobile phones etc.•	Generally training programmes are organized in the premises of KVKs. There is a need to organize such training at village level to have a better outreach and targeted farmers.•	Training material needs to be distributed in local language.•	KVK should organize regular village level meetings, demonstration camps, crop oriented and need-based on-farm training.•	KVK should organize more relevant training programmes, workshops, conferences, demonstrations for various stakeholders, namely, agriculture officers/ supervisors, dealers/ distributors of seeds, banking personnel, Anganwadi women, school students, etc., on seed treatment, crop storage and packaging practices, techniques of hi- tech horticulture, fruit preservation, etc.•	There should be provision of regular in -service training of KVK scientists and other technical support personnel.•	The career advancement promotion and transfer policy for the staff of KVK needs a relook.(c)	&(d) KVK is a district level unit and there is no proposal to set up sub centres of KVKs at tehsil, block or panchayat levels. However, to enhance the outreach, the KVKs train the extension officials of different Development Departments of States on new technologies for its dissemination to the farming community. KVKs are also being mapped with the Common Service Centers (CSCs) established at Nyaya Panchayat level. The farmers visiting CSCs can contact the KVK experts electronically and get solution for technological problems. Besides, KVKs are using the services of mKisan Portal of Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers’ Welfare to send the advisories and alerts to large number of farmers. KVKs have also formed WhatsApp groups to reach large number of farmers.                                                  *****
