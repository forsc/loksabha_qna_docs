ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS, COAL AND MINES(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a):     The details of the production, consumption, import and export quantity of coking and non-coking coal in India in last ten years is attached at Annexure-A.(b):         The detailed scenario of the Coal Stock/Inventory in India along with the Coal Production and Dispatch during past 5 years are given in the following table,Figures in Million TonnesFinancial year	Opening Stock of Coal	Production	Offtake	Closing Stock2015-16	 59.389	639.230	632.442	65.3612016-17	 65.362	657.868	645.978	76.8892017-18	 76.889	675.400	690.003	62.0362018-19	 62.036	728.718	732.794	57.6402019-20	 57.640	730.873	706.770	81.4312020-21(upto Jan-21)	81.431	545.458	555.552	72.748 (c): 	The Government controlled PSUs can export coal. Coal India Limited (CIL) can use its Special Spot e-auction / Spot e-auction windows to sell coal for the purpose of export. Coal India Limited can also participate in the tenders floated by the neighboring countries to export coal after meeting the domestic coal demand.(d):    Competitiveness of a product is dependent upon various factors like consumer preference, desired quality, landed cost, logistical and financial benefits etc. For Nepal and Bhutan, Indian coal is competitive against coal of other countries. For Bangladesh, landed cost of Indian coal is comparable to the coal being received from other countries(e): 	Due to Drift Origin, Indian coal resources, by nature, mostly consist of   poor quality non-coking and coking coal containing high inherent ash. As  such there is very limited availability of high quality coal in India, yet it is made competitive through pricing as pricing of coal by the Government companies is most competitive.For improving quality of produced coal from available resources,  PSUs like CIL have taken various initiatives:•	As around 95% of the coal production of CIL has been envisaged to come from Opencast mines & remaining 5% from underground mines, CIL has planned to deploy surface miners in various open cast mines for selective mining, wherever geological conditions permit. At present, production from surface miners contribute around 45% of the total production of CIL and shall further increase in future.•	Further, Coal beneficiation in washeries/deshalers is also a process by which the quality of raw coal is improved. At present, CIL has a total coal washing capacity of 34.63 million tonnes per year (Mty) through 12 existing washeries, of which 10 are coking coal and 2 are non-coking. CIL shall set up further 9 washeries in 1st phase & 3 in 2nd phase with an aggregate throughput capacity of 60 Mty. (f):     Law & Order is a State subject, hence primarily, it is the responsibility of the State/District administration to take necessary deterrent action to stop/curb theft / pilferage of coal. First Information Reports (FIRs) are lodged whenever any incident of theft / pilferage of coal comes to the notice of the coal companies. State/District administration take further action against the lodged FIR.FIRs lodged in cases of theft / pilferage of coal during 2019-20, company-wise and State-wise is given below:(Provisional)Name of the Company	State	2019-20		FIR LODGEDECL	WB	228 	Jharkhand	82 	 Sub Total	310BCCL	Jharkhand	12 	WB	0 	 Sub Total	12CCL	Jharkhand	13NCL	MP	0 	UP	0 	Sub Total	0WCL	Maharashtra	18 	MP	0 	 Sub Total	18SECL	MP	1 	Chhattisgarh	2 	 Sub Total	3MCL	Orissa	2NEC	Assam	27 Coal India Limited	385  In the case of SCCL, one Police complaint was lodged.
