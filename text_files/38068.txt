The State/ UT – wise details of Projects sanctioned / finalized under CRIF scheme during last three years and current year is placed at Annexure-V. The State/UT wise details of projects sanctioned under EI&ISC schemes during 2018-19 is placed at Annexure-VI; no projects under EI&ISC scheme has been sanctioned / finalized during 2019-20, 2020-21 and 2021-22 so far.The criteria inter alia provides that the period of completion of projects sanctioned under CRIF and EI&ISC Schemes shall not exceed 36 months for Hill States, North Eastern States and 24 months for other States unless permitted by the State Government/ UT.
