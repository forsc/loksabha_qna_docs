ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF JAL SHAKTI(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b) All 36 States/UTs have declared themselves Open Defecation Free (ODF) as on 2.10.2019 under Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin). The Government has further advised all the States to ensure that no one is left behind under SBM(G) and to identify the missed out rural households, if any, and support them to construct toilets under the programme.(c) & (d)  Sanitation primarily is a behavioral issue. This involves changing the mindset amongst people to stop open defecation and to adopt safe sanitation practices. Under Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) [SBM(G)], the preferable approach is to adopt Community Approaches to Sanitation (CAS) focusing heavily on triggering entire communities and on achieving collective behavioral change with emphasis on awareness generation. Up to 5% of the programme funds can be spent on Information, Education and Communication (IEC) and capacity building at the State and District level, and up to 3% at the Central level.  Massive media campaigns have been carried out at national level using Audio Visual (TV) and Audio (Radio) aids. States have also carried out IEC campaign including interpersonal Communication (IPC). Cleanliness drives and awareness campaigns are also held at regular intervals.  Besides conventional IEC tools, social media are also used for spreading the mass awareness.  A Facebook page for SBM(G) has been created and twitter handles are also active. Media celebrities have been roped in as brand ambassadors.All the States/UTs have been advised to set up an ODF-sustainability Cell at the State level. Further, there is a robust ODF verification mechanism to ensure sustainability of ODF status. Awareness is being created for the households to retrofit their toilets, whenever required, to ensure their long term usages. Swachhagrahis and Nigrani Samitis are also engaged for regular follow up with the villagers to ensure that no one is defecating in the open. The States have also been advised to set up training management units at State and district level to strengthen the capacity of the Panchayats and field level functionaries towards sustainability measures.
