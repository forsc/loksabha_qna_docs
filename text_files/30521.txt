                                                        MINISTER OF STATE					(SHRI AJAY BHATT)IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE   (a) The number of posts lying vacant in the Armed Forces are as under:Service	Vacant Posts	Officers	JCOs/ORs/Airmen/SailorsIndian Army	7476(including AMC/ADC/MNS)	97177Indian Air Force*	621	4850Indian Navy	1265	11166*  Excluding Medical and Dental personnel(b) The details of  recruitment rallies conducted by the Indian Army across the country in the last five years are as under:Year	Number of rallies conducted2015-16	1282016-17	1022017-18	1062018-19	922019-20	95The details of State-wise recruitment by the Indian Army during the last five years is at Annexure.(c) There is no quota for any State for the recruitment of Armed Forces personnel.  However, the recruitment is carried out on the basis of ‘Recruitable Male Population’ (RMP) of respective States.(d) Army Recruiting Office located in all States carry out awareness programs throughout the year in their area of responsibility with an endeavour to reach out to maximum youth in the State.  Four Army recruitment rallies out of 87 rallies have been carried out in Recruiting Year 2021-22 and balance will be conducted based on COVID-19 situation.The selection of Airmen into Indian Air Force is through Scheduled Tests and Recruitment Rallies.  Scheduled Test for Airmen Recruitment (STAR) is conducted twice in a year wherein aspiring eligible candidates from all across the country get the opportunity to appear for the test.  In addition, recruitment rallies are conducted with a view to cover low represented, low response, remote areas to maintain demographic balance in the IAF and candidates only from designated districts covered in the rally are permitted to appear.The Indian Navy has fully migrated to an online application based process.  Therefore,  no recruitment campaigns are organised in any State/UT.(e) Yes, Sir. The recruitment rallies by the Indian Army are presently on hold. However, various steps have been taken to fill up vacant posts of Officers and Junior Commissioned Officers/Other Ranks (JCOs/ORs) in Indian Army.  Young Leaders Training Wing has been established at Officers’ Training Academy, Chennai with effect from September 2019 to groom prospective service candidates for selection through In-Service entries viz. Army Cadet College (ACC), Special Commission Officers (SCO) & Permanent Commission (Special List).  The rallies by IAF were stopped due to COVID-19 restrictions initially.  Still, 11 rallies have been conducted by IAF during the year 2020 adhering to COVID-19 protocols and the vacancies have been filled in the airmen cadre through rally as well as Scheduled Test for Airmen Recruitment (STAR) online examination conducted Pan-India.The COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on recruitment of officers and sailors into the Indian Navy.  The pandemic and associated lockdowns and travel restrictions necessitated a ‘Batch Holiday’ which resulted in non recruitment of 02/2020 sailors batch.  However, various measures have been undertaken by the Indian Navy to fill vacancies which, inter-alia, include enhanced emphasis on improved Image Projection/Publicity in audio, visual, print, internet, social media, holding of career fairs, exhibitions, motivational lectures in schools and colleges, computer-based online application filling etc.*****
