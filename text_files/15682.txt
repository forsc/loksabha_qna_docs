ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                            (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a) : Urban sanitation is one of the many aspects of urban development. Urban sanitation means that there is no defecation in the open and that all fecal matter is processed in a safe and scientific manner. (b) : Urban sanitation has no direct link with the achievement of the target of becoming a US$ 5 trillion economy.  However, as per an independent survey conducted by UNICEF across 10,000 households in 12 Indian States, a single rupee invested in  sanitation allows a  family to save Rs.4.30 by averting medical costs.  As per this report a family that invests in toilet will save Rs.50,000 a year in terms of medical cost. (c) : 	Steps taken by the Government for addressing the issues of sanitation in urban areas include, launching of Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban, under which all Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) in 28 States and 8 Union Territories (UTs), except 48 ULBs of West Bengal, have declared themselves Open Defecation Free (ODF).Till now 61.4 Lakh units of Individual House Hold Latrines (IHHL) against the Mission Target of 59 Lakhs and 5.82 Lakh Community/Public toilets (CT/PT) seats against the Mission target of 5.08 Lakh seats have been constructed. Government has also launched ODF+ protocol (to ensure that all CT/PT are clean and usable), ODF++ protocol (which stipulates various requirements regarding safe containment, transportation and scientific disposal of the septage and sludge). Till now 1304 cities have been certified ODF+ and 481 cities certified as ODF++.                                             *****
