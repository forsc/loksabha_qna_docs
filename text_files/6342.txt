ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of Finance in the Ministry of Finance(a)	to (e): As per extant guidelines dated 18.5.2017 on rationalisation of Branch Authorisation Policy, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has granted  general  permission  to domestic  Scheduled  Commercial  Banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks), to  open banking outlets  at  any place  in the country, without  seeking  prior  approval of  RBI  in  each  case, subject  to at least  25 percent  of the total  number  of  banking outlets  opened  during a  financial  year being in  unbanked  rural centres i.e. centres having population less than 10,000 (Tier 5 and Tier 6 centres). Further, ten Small Finance banks and seven Payments Banks have been licensed by RBI for providing banking services across the country including the rural centres. Under Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), all villages were mapped by banks into 1.59 lakh Sub-Service Areas (SSAs) where one SSA catering to 1,000 to 1,500 households. While 0.33 lakh SSAs have been covered with bank branches, 1.26 lakh SSAs, have been covered by deployment of interoperable Business Correspondents (BCs).	In pursuance of RBI guidelines, rolling out of banking outlets in uncovered areas is a continuous process and looked after by SLBC, in consultation with the concerned State Government, member banks and other stakeholders. Banks, inter-alia, consider proposals for opening banking outlets in the light of RBI’s instructions, their business plans and their commercial viability. To further assess the viability for opening a banking outlet, banks carry out survey as required.As apprised by RBI, as on 30.06.2019, there are 1,45,632 functioning branches of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) in the country, of which 51,658 branches are in rural areas. The number of branches of SCBs in the state of Maharashtra, as on 30.06.2019, is 12,786, of which 3,166 are in rural areas. As apprised by SLBC Maharashtra, no report regarding increase in workload due to increasing population and increase in the accounts of Central Schemes has been received from any of the nationalized banks in Maharashtra or Lead District Manager, Osmanabad. *******
