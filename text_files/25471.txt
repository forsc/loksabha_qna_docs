ANSWER




                                                        A N S W E R  MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a) & (b):    To address anaemia and micro-nutrient deficiency in the country, Government of India approved Centrally Sponsored Pilot Scheme on "Fortification of Rice & its Distribution under Public Distribution System" for a period of 3 years beginning in 2019-20 with total outlay of Rs 174.64 Cr. The scheme is funded by the Government of India in the ratio of 90:10 in respect of North-Eastern, Hilly and Island States and in the ratio of 75:25 in respect of the rest of the States. The Pilot Scheme focuses on 15 districts across 15 states, preferably 1 district per State. Fifteen State Governments i.e Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand& Madhya Pradesh have consented and identified their respective Districts (1 District Per State) for implementation of the Pilot Scheme.  ........2/--2-So far, six states namely Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh & Uttar Pradesh have started distribution of fortified rice under the Pilot Scheme in their selected districts. Further, four more States have completed the requisite processes to start distribution of fortified rice under the Pilot Scheme. The Government of Maharashtra through its Development Partner had conducted an evaluation study regarding effectiveness of Rice Fortification and it has been found it to be useful. The slow pace of distribution by the States is primarily due to less availability Fortified Rice Kernel (FRK), blending infrastructure and other related issues. As on date, nine States/UT have constituted Steering Committee under the Chairmanship of respective Chief Secretary for better coordination/monitoring and effective implementation of the Pilot scheme in the state, as advised by Government.        Being a new initiative, the Government has taken steps to build an ecosystem for supply of fortified rice under the scheme. Implementation requires all necessary infrastructure like blending of normal rice with FRK, which contains micronutrients. Meetings related to FRK availability, blending infrastructure, standardization of testing/quality and participation of all stakeholders/industry-players/research institutes/Development Partners in the fortified rice ecosystem has been organized. With continuous intense and sustained effort, the availability of FRK has now gone up from approximately 7000 MT to 50000 MT. The Rice Mills which have blending capacity for fortified rice have been increased to 3292 from initially less than 50. (c): 	With the gradual strengthening of the ecosystem for production and distribution of fortified rice as stated above, FCI is also involved in the supply chain management of the procurement & supply of fortified rice for Integrated Child Development Service (ICDS) &Mid Day Meal (MDM) schemes. So far, FCI has procured 6.60 LMT of fortified rice.  ***
