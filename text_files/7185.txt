ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b) 	The National Perspective Plan (NPP) was prepared by the then Ministry of Irrigation (now Ministry of Jal Shakti) in August 1980 for water resources development through inter basin transfer of water, for transferring water from water surplus basins to water-deficit basins. Under the NPP, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) has identified 30 links (16 under Peninsular Component and 14 under Himalayan Component) for preparation of Feasibility Reports (FRs). The details of above river linking projects viz., rivers, States concerned is given at Annexure-I.Under the NPP, four priority links have been identified for preparation of Detailed Project Reports (DPR) under the Peninsular Rivers Component viz; Ken-Betwa link project (KBLP), Damanganga-Pinjal link project, Par-Tapi-Narmada link project and Godavari-Cauvery link project. The DPRs of KBLP, Damanganga-Pinjal link project and Par-Tapi-Narmada link project have been sent to the concerned States.Contd…P/2//2//Further, draft DPR of Godavari-Cauvery link project consisting of three links viz; Godavari (Inchampalli/Janampet) – Krishna (Nagarjunasagar), Krishna (Nagarjunasagar) – Pennar (Somasila), Pennar (Somasila)-Cauvery (Grand Anicut) link projects has been completed and circulated to party States in March 2019.The details of the estimated cost of the four priority links of the inter-linking of rivers (ILR) projects under NPP is given at Annexure-II.Government of Karnataka, Telangana and Tamil Nadu have furnished suggestions/comments on the draft DPR of Godavari-Cauvery link project which have been taken into consideration.(c)	  No fund has been allocated/released/spent as no ILR project has reached the stage of execution.(d)  At the time of preparation of DPR of individual inter-linking of river projects, detailed Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies as per Terms of Reference approved by Environmental Appraisal Committee (EAC) of Ministry of Environment and Forests & Climate Change are carried out. The environmental impacts and issues arising out of the EIA studies are addressed in Environmental Management Plan which forms a part of DPR.Socio-economic impact assessment including Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) Plan in respect of project affected persons is an integral part of implementation of any link project and is included in the DPR.(e)	  The implementation of river link projects involves various steps such as preparation of Pre Feasibility Reports/ Feasibility Reports of links, negotiation and consensus among concerned States, preparation of DPRs of the projects, clearances from Ministry of Environment and Forests and Climate Change, Ministry of Tribal Affairs, techno-economic clearance by Advisory Committee on Irrigation, Flood control & multipurpose projects of Ministry of Jal Shakti and investment clearance.The stage of implementation of a project would be reached after its DPR is prepared with the consensus of concerned States and the requisite statutory clearances are obtained.The implementation of NPP would give benefit of 25 million ha of irrigation from surface water, 10 million ha by increased use of ground water, raising the ultimate irrigation potential from 140 million ha to 175 million ha and generation of 34 million KW of power, apart from the incidental benefits of flood control, drought mitigation, navigation, water supply, fisheries, salinity and pollution control etc.***** ANNEXURE-IANNEXURE REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) & (b) OF UNSTARRED QUESTION NO. 906 TO BE ANSWERED IN LOK SABHA ON 21.11.2019 REGARDING “INTER-LINKING OF RIVERS”.Names of Inter Basin Water Transfer Links, the States involved, name of rivers and status of Feasibility Reports/Detailed Project ReportSl.
