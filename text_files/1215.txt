Under the Information Education and Communication (IEC) Scheme, numerous activities have been taken up to reach out to people and to create awareness about Yoga. These activities duly cover Assam and other North Eastern States also. IEC activities include programs on TV, Radio, Print-media, Arogya Fairs, Seminars/ Conferences/ Workshops to create awareness about Yoga among the people.Central Council for Research in Yoga & Naturopathy (CCRYN), New Delhi,an autonomous institution of Ministry of AYUSH has been conducting one-month Yoga training programs for International Day of Yoga (IDY) through selected collaborating institutions. The details are as follows:S. No.	Year	Total Number of Districts covered	Districts covered in North Eastern States1.	2015	537	732.	2016	537	733.	2017	473	424.	2018	421	34CCRYN has also facilitated to set up 50 Yoga parks across the country to conduct regular Yoga training programme for the general public and to manage the park as a hub of Yoga. One such Yoga park has been set up in Imphal, Manipur. Another activity that is relevant in this context is the financial assistance provided by CCRYN for establishing and running Naturopathy & Yoga Clinics/ Hospitals. Out of 30 such Clinics/Hospitals across the country, 5 are in North Eastern States.  The aim of this activity is to assist the establishing Naturopathy Clinics/ Hospitals in different parts of the country and to strengthen the existing Naturopathy & Yoga Clinics/ Hospitals. This also helps to increase awareness levels about Yoga across the country.	As a part of observation of International Day of Yoga (IDY) on 21st June, this Ministry reached out to about 2.5 lakh Gram Pradhans with suggested plan of action for Yoga promotion in villages. Common Service Centres (CSCs) of the Ministry of Electronics & IT were also roped in for promotion of Yoga in rural areas. Various promotional efforts of IDY over print and electronic media extensively covered Assam & North Eastern States also.	In addition to the above, under National AYUSH Mission (NAM), financial assistance is provided to States and Union Territories for setting up AYUSH Wellness Centres, in which Yoga is an important component. Yoga is also integrated into the Health & Wellness Centres of the flagship AYUSHMAN Bharat Scheme, thus making it accessible to the common people in different corners of the country.	Though there is no such “Special scheme/program” for promotion of Yoga dedicated to Assam and other North Eastern States, the above activities have covered these States significantly. A list of National & State Arogya Fairs (which includes coverage of Yoga) organised in North Eastern States is given at Annexure.
