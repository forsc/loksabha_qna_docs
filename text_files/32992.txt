                                                        MINISTER FOR HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE AND CHEMICALS & FERTILIZERS ( DR. MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a)	to (e):  A statement is laid on the table of the House.XXXXXX-2-STATEMENT REFERRED TO LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 54* FOR 04.02.2022 REGARDING “ AVAILABILITY OF CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS” TABLED BY SHRI SANJAY SETH.--------(a):    The quantum of chemical fertilizers provided to Jharkhand during the last three years is at Annexure-A.(b) & (c):  As such, there is no harmful effect of chemical fertilizers on soil health with balanced and judicious use. However, investigations carried out under All India Coordinated Research Project on ‘Long Term Fertilizer Experiments’ over five decades at fixed sites have indicated that continuous/over use of nitrogenous fertilizer alone had  deleterious effect on soil health and crop productivity showing deficiencies of other major and micro nutrients. Even with recommended doses of NPK, deficiency of micro and secondary nutrients has become yield limiting factor over the years. Deficient nutrients may also affect plant growth and cause plant physiological disorders. The council is recommending soil test based balanced and integrated nutrient management through conjunctive use of both inorganic and organic sources (manure, bio-fertilizers etc.) of plant nutrients for judicious use of chemical fertilizers to improve soil health. In addition, growing leguminous crops and use of Resource Conservation Technologies (RCTs) are also advocated. ICAR imparts training, organises Front Line Demonstrations (FLDs) to educate farmers on all these aspects.(d) & (e):  Government is promoting Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) which includes soil test based balanced and integrated use of chemical fertilizers in conjunction with organic sources of nutrients like Farm Yard Manure (FYM), city compost, vermi-compost and bio-fertilizers that leads to saving in use of chemical fertilizers.INM is being promoted through implementation of Soil Health Card (SHC) scheme since 2015. Soil health card provides nutrient status of the soil along with prescription about balanced and integrated use of inorganic and organic fertilizers to maintain good soil health that results in increase in production.Demonstrations about balanced use of fertilizers based on soil health card recommendations and training to the farmers on proper and integrated use of fertilizers are integral part of the scheme.  Financial assistance is provided to State governments for   training of farmers, demonstrations on farmer fields and organizing farmer melas.
