ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR PERSONNEL, PUBLIC GRIEVANCES & PENSIONS AND PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE (DR.JITENDRA SINGH):    (a)    The design of the Away From Reactor (AFR) spent fuel storage facility for Kudankulam Units 1&2 has been completed and the process of obtaining environmental clearance from the MoEF&CC is underway.(b)	The AFR is designed for storing spent fuel discharged by two reactors (KKNPP 1&2) over a period of 40 years. However, the actual storage at any given time would depend on the amount of fuel discharged from the reactors and drawn from the AFR for reprocessing.(c)	The AFR facility is designed with a comprehensive approach to safety to withstand extreme natural events like earthquakes and tsunamis with provisions of large operational safety margins for safe, sound and reliable performance. It is designed to ensure that there would be no adverse impact on plant personnel, general public or the environment.(d)	India is pursuing a closed fuel cycle, where the quantity of radioactive waste generated is very less.  Further technologies for separation, partitioning and burning of waste are being developed in the country, which will further bring down the quantity of radioactive waste.  Considering the small quantity of radioactive waste, there is no need for Deep Geological Repository in near future.*****
