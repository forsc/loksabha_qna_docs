ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF RAILWAYS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY    (SHRI ASHWINI VAISHNAW) (a) to (c) Haryana Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd. (HRIDC), a Joint Venture Company of Government of Haryana (51%)  and Ministry of Railways (49%)  has carried out the feasibility study of Farukhnagar-Jhajjar-Charkhi Dadri railway project (72 Km) in October 2019. Project is financially unviable as abstract cost of the project has been worked out as Rs 989.96 Cr. with IRR of (-) 2.16 %. HRIDC is considering to initiate re-survey and study of this project up to Loharu. Time frame for  operationalisation of any project depends on various factors like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities, statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical condition of area, law and order situation in the area of the project site, number of working months in a year for particular site due to climatic conditions, etc., therefore it cannot be ascertained at this stage.       	        *****
