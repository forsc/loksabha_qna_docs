ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING; AND MINISTER OF YOUTH AFFAIRS AND SPORTS (SHRI ANURAG SINGH THAKUR)(a) Prasar Bharati is having 500 All India Radio Broadcasting Centres across the country. State/UT-wise numbers of these centres are given at Annexure.  	 (b) to (d)	No, Sir. Prasar Bharati is not closing any Akashvani radio station in India. Obsolete analog transmitters are phased out from time to time with the availability of alternate transmission technologies such as FM, Satellite Radio through DTH and Internet Streaming.Further, Content Reforms are undertaken from time to time to ensure that the National, Regional and Local Services of Akashvani serve diversity of content, while optimally leveraging the scarce resources, giving opportunity to local talent and improving quality without duplication of content. The operational expenditure of these services is being met through the Internal and Extra-Budgetary Resources (IEBR) of Prasar Bharati. (e)	No, Sir. Prasar Bharati has not closed AIR FM Radio Channel at 100.1MHz in Bengaluru. Instead, its broadcasting transmission hours have been increased to about 17 hours by incorporating programmes from the Raagam 24x7 National Radio Service dedicated to Indian Classical Music.Multiple Akashvani stations including AIR Bengaluru contribute several hours of classical music content daily to Raagam 24x7 thus providing opportunities to artists from respective cities/regions.
