ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) Under the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP)/Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) regime, four bidding rounds have been finalized in which 94 exploration blocks have been awarded covering an area of approx. 1,36,790 sq. km. Under Bid Round- I & III of HELP, 19 exploration blocks were awarded in the state of Assam.(b) During drilling of wells, Extended Well Testing (EWT) is performed to assess field size, well flow rates, and produced fluid properties before designing and constructing permanent production facilities. This is usually done to reduce the economic risk of the development as well as to construct facilities that are better matched to the production characteristics of the field. EWT may necessitate the flaring of gas. However, as per Good International Petroleum Industry Practices (GIPIP) EWT tests are designed in a way that the gas flaring is kept to the minimum.********
