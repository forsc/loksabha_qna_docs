ANSWER




MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ‘NISHANK’)(a): As per National Education Policy 2020, implementation of the Policy requires multiple initiatives and actions, which will have to be taken by multiple bodies in a synchronized and systematic manner. Therefore, the implementation of this Policy will be led by various bodies including Ministry of Education, CABE, Union and State Governments, education-related Ministries, State Departments of Education, Boards, NTA, the regulatory bodies of school and higher education, NCERT, SCERTs, schools, and HEIs. The Policy recommends smooth, timely, and appropriate flow of funds, and their usage with probity for which administrative processes will be suitably amended and streamlined so that the disbursal mechanism may not lead to a high volume of unspent balances. National Education Policy 2020 unequivocally endorses and envisions a substantial increase in public investment in education by both the Central Government and all State Governments. The Centre and the States will work together to increase the public investment in Education sector to reach 6% of GDP at the earliest. Accordingly, Ministry and other implementing agencies under its purview have started taking initiatives towards implementation of NEP 2020. (b) and (c): NEP 2020 has recommended that a mechanism of performance-based funding to States / HEIs may be devised.*******
