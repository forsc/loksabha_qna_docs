ANSWER




                                                        The MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE(SHRI KIREN RIJIJU) (a) to (d) : A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (d) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 82 FOR THE 3RD DECEMBER, 2021 REGARDING ‘ONLINE DISPUTE RESOLUTION’(a)     The concept of Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) in India is at a nascent stage.  The NITI Aayog had constituted a high level committee to take it forward and the report of the committee titled “Designing the future of dispute Resolution: the ODR Policy Plan for India” was released on 29.11.2021 It inter-alia recommends for mainstreaming of ODR in India, as a cost effective, convenient, efficient process which can be customised to the specific needs of the parties, considering the nature of the dispute. (b)     Public utility services do not fall exclusively in the realm of the Central Government as these services are provided by State Governments also.  Introduction of any policy in this matter requires widespread consultations.  Since, at present the ODR ecosystem is yet to take off formally in the country, no proposal to introduce ODR in public services is presently under consideration of the Government. (c)   Yes.  The proposal for a standalone law on mediation provides for pre-litigation mediation before filing any suit or proceedings of civil or commercial nature by any party in any court. Such pre-litigation mediation can be undertaken online also. (d)  The ODR policy plan for India released by NITI Aayog on 29.11.2021 recommends various steps to spread awareness for ODR. However, since no legal framework has so far been brought out, measures to increase awareness regarding ODR do not arise at the level of Govt., for the present.***
