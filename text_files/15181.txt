ANSWER




                                                         MINISTER OF STATE FOR MINISTRY OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FOOD & PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION(SHRI   DANVE  RAOSAHEB   DADARAO)(a) to (d): 		Public Distribution System (PDS) is operated under the joint responsibility of the Central and the State/UT Governments, wherein the operational responsibilities pertain with  the State/UT. As and when complaints including Jharkhand are received in this Department from individuals, organizations as well as through media reports regarding any irregularities in the functioning of the PDS, including leakages & diversion of subsidized foodgrains thus not reaching to the intended beneficiaries, etc., they are forwarded to the concerned State/UT Government for inquiry and appropriate action at their end. ..........2/--2-An offence committed in violation of the provisions of PDS (Control) Order, 2015 is liable for penal action under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Thus, the Order empowers State/UT Governments to take punitive action in case of contravention of relevant provisions of these Orders. In the year 2017, 35 complaints, in 2018, 33 complaints and in 2019, 17 complaints were received and forwarded to State Government of Jharkhand for necessary action at their end.  Also, the institutional mechanism for the monitoring and grievance redressal under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) provides setting up of Vigilance Committees, District Grievance Redressal Officers and independent State Food Commission for making the system more efficient and transparent.*****
