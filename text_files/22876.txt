ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE (SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) and (b):	As per the 2019 Environmental Report of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the aviation sector accounts for approximately 2% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions, including international and domestic aviation.  The aviation sector, accordingly, contributes to that extent to global warming and subsequent rise in earth’s temperature. (c) and (d):	The Governmenthas been assessing climate change over the years through various Ministries and Agencies. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) brings out the publication ‘Annual Climate Summary’ at the end of every year that features highlights of climate patterns including temperature and rainfall over the country, and long term changes since the year 1901 in all-India temperature and rainfall at annual and seasonal scales. As per the report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the average global temperature rise for 2015-2019 is currently estimated to be 1.1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels (1850-1900). According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences, the surface air temperature over India has risen by about 0.7 °C during 1901–2018.Since global warming is a global collective action problem, India firmly believes in global cooperation to deal with the challenge through multilateral processes. India is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and its Kyoto Protocol (KP), and the Paris Agreement (PA). Independent studies rate India’s efforts highly and compliant with the requirements of achieving its Nationally Determined Contributions under the PA. The Government of India stands committed to combating climate change through its several programmes and schemes including the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) which comprises missions in specific areas of solar energy, energy efficiency, water, sustainable agriculture, Himalayan ecosystem, sustainable habitat, green India, and strategic knowledge for climate change. The NAPCC provides an overarching framework for all climate actions. Thirty-three States /Union Territories (UTs) have prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) in line with NAPCC taking into account the State-specific issues relating to climate change. These SAPCCs outline sector-specific and cross-sectoral priority actions, including adaptation.The Government is also implementing National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change to support adaptation measures of States/UTs in areas that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. ***
