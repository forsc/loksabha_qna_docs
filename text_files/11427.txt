                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) & (b) : 	As per prescribed guidelines of present procurement mechanism, Government, through Central Nodal agencies, procures notified farm produce of Fair Average Quality (FAQ)  at Minimum Support Price (MSP) in consultation with the concerned State Government when market price of these farm produce goes below the MSP. However, if farmers gets better price in comparison to MSP, they are free to sell their produce in open market. The details of States for which procurement at Minimum Support Price (MSP) was sanctioned by Government in  2019-20 are at Annexure. Contd…2/--2-(c) to (e) : 	Chhattisgarh is a Decentralised procurement (DCP) State wherein procurement of food grains is carried out by State Govt. through its agencies. FCI assists the State Govt. in procurement operations in DCP states only on specific request of State Govt. In order to ensure MSP to the farmers, sufficient numbers of procurement centres are opened by State Government agencies before onset of procurement season, keeping in view the procurement potential and geographical spread of the State concerned. Large number of temporary purchase centres in addition to the existing Mandis and depots/godowns are also established at key points for the convenience of the farmers. Review is made from time to time on the need for additional procurement centres, if any, during the procurement season and if required additional procurement centres are also opened. Adequate dunnage materials such as wooden crates, bamboo mats, polythene sheets etc. are made available in purchase centres to save the crop (paddy). Technical Staff posted in procurement centres are well equipped to ensure that procured stocks are lifted to the linked depots on the same day. In case the purchased stocks are kept at the mandi premises for overnight, proper stacking, covering with polythene covers and security arrangements are ensured.
