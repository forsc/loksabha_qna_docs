ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE(DR BHARATI PRAVIN PAWAR) (a) to (e)   Detailed guidelines for reporting and certifications of deaths due to COVID-19 have been issued by Union Health Ministry to all States/UTs. ICMR on 10th May 2020 issued ‘Guidance for appropriate recording of COVID-19 related deaths in India’  (Available at: https://www.icmr.gov.in/pdf/covid/techdoc/Guidance_appropriate_recording_of_related_deaths_India.pdf). Further, Government of India through National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued ‘Guidelines to provide for ex-gratia assistance to kin of the deceased by COVID-19’. NDMA has recommended an amount of Rs. 50,000/- per deceased person including those involved in relief operations or associated in preparedness activities, subject to cause of death being certified as COVID-19. The ex-gratia assistance shall be provided by States from State Disaster Response Funds. All States have been advised to constitute Grievance Redressal for redressal of issues related to payment of ex-gratia in case of any dispute.In addition to the above, life insurance cover of Rs. 50 lakhs is being provided to health professionals, including front line workers and ASHAs, involved across the country in COVID-19 management, under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana.In order to provide comprehensive support for children who have lost both their parents due to COVID 19 pandemic, the Ministry of Women and Child Development under PM CARES for Children Scheme provides for health insurance, empowers such children through education and equips them for self-sufficient existence with financial support on reaching 23 years of age.National Health Authority (NHA) is collaborating with the Ministry of Women and Child Development to extend the benefits of Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) to children under the age of 18 who have been orphaned due to COVID-19. The costs related to extending the benefits of AB PM-JAY to such children shall be borne by the Prime Minister''s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM-CARES) Fund.As of 30th November 2021, 1.59 Crore hospital admissions have been authorized under AB PM-JAY from March 2020 till date. State / UT details under Annexure – I. The National Health Authority (NHA) has been providing necessary support to States/UTs for ensuring free COVID-19 testing and treatment to all eligible beneficiaries under AB-PMJAY. When COVID-19 pandemic started, initially existing treatment packages were used for providing Covid related treatment. Later, special packages for treatment and testing of COVID-19 were introduced. Many State Governments decided to make COVID-19 testing & treatment free for all residents. While some of them used Ayushman Bharat PMJAY ecosystem including the NHA’s IT platform, others made it free but without recording the transaction on NHA’s IT platform. Therefore, COVID-19 treatments have been captured in both general and COVID-19 specific packages of AB PM-JAY.As of 14th November, a total of 8.3 Lakh hospital admissions have been authorized towards COVID-19 treatment under AB PM-JAY from March 2020. The State / UT details can be found under Annexure – II.
