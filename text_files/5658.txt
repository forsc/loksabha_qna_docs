Under the e-Panchayat MMP, a suite of Core Common Applications collectively called – Panchayat Enterprise Suite (PES) Applications, has been developed that cater to various aspects of Panchayat functioning viz. planning, budgeting, implementation, accounting, monitoring etc.  Panchayat being a State subject, governance of Panchayats is the primary responsibility of concerned State Government / Union Territories (UTs) Administration.

The State of Maharashtra is a prolific user of the PES Applications.*******
