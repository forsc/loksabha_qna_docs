National Health Programmes support the NGOs through the State Government.  As such, the financing of NGO activities under the NHM is through the State Programme Implementation Plan (PIPs) only by the State Governments.In case of Revised National Tuberculosis Contro Programme (RNTCP), the National Guideline on Partnership has been available for engagement of NGOs and Private Providers. However, the Agencies for RNTCP are also engaged at decentralized level by State and District Health Society depending on the gap assessment in the services.  In addition, Ministry is engaging NGOs under the Global fund supported projects at the central level for Tuberculosis related activities. Under the current global fund grant, Southern Health Improvement Samity (SHIS) and Tibetan Voluntary Health Association (TVHA) are engaged.(b) & (c):	Engagement and performance assessment   of NGOs are conducted by the State and Districts at local level. For the NGOs engaged under the Global Fund supported projects, their financial management is assessed by the Local Fund Agency (LFA) as per the Global Fund guidelines.  (d):	The Ministry communicates advisories to respective States regarding blacklisted or restrained NGOs from time to time.
