                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (c) With the objective of assessment of impact of climate change on the coastal areas of the country, the National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), Ministry of Earth Sciences is carrying out work on developing a decision support system for climate change impact assessment on geographical areas and socio economic impact in the coastal areas. A national strategy for coastal protection along with guidelines for coastal protection measures have been framed for all Coastal States and Union territories by the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change. The Ministry under the Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project (ICZMP) have demarcated the hazard line along the entire coastal belt of the country, including the inter-tidal areas. The hazard line is indicative of the shoreline changes, including the sea level rise due to climate change and is a projection of impact due to sea level rise, and shoreline changes over a long period of time viz. over 100 years. This line is required to be used by the Coastal State agencies concerned as a tool for Disaster Management for the coastal environment, including planning of adaptive and mitigation measures. (d) to (e)	The Ministry under the ICZMP prepared shoreline management plans for five (05) identified coastal stretches in Gujarat, Odisha and West Bengal. To protect the coastal areas from erosion, initiatives such as mangrove plantation of about 16000 ha, shelter-belt plantation of 1900 ha and installation of Geo-Tubes in 500 m have been taken up as representative activities. The expenditure incurred in last five years for above noted activities is as follows:(Rs. in Cr.)State 	2014-15	2015-16	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19Gujarat	7.99	0.15	0.16	0.40	0.41Odisha	7.52	12.52	16.57	0.87	0.05West Bengal	0.3	0.48	0.82	--	--  ****
