However, Railway Protection Force (RPF) supplements the efforts of GRP to provide better protection and security of passenger areas and passengers and for related matters. States are having different mechanisms for lodging of FIR and registration of crimes. However, to facilitate travelling passengers in running trains to report a crime, First Information Report (FIR) forms are available with TTE, Guard of RPF/GRP train escorting staff. After filling it up, the Form may be handed over to one of the said officials for registration of the case at the next Police Station irrespective of the jurisdiction for taking cognizance on it. If the place of occurrence does not fall in their jurisdiction, the case is registered under Zero FIR and transferred to the concerned Government Railway Police Station having jurisdiction. Further course of action is taken by the Police as per extant legal provisions. Regular coordination is made with the State Police/GRP authorities at all levels for prevention of crime, registration of cases, their investigation and maintenance of law and order in Railway premises as well as on running trains. RPF is committed for safe and secure journey of passengers and leaves no stone unturned to ensure it.Further, the following steps are being taken by the Railways in coordination with Government Railway Police for safety and security of passengers in trains and at stations:-1.	On vulnerable and identified routes/sections, trains are escorted by Railway Protection Force in addition to trains escorted by Government Railway Police of different States daily.2.	Railway Help Line number 139 is operational (24x7) over Indian Railways for security related assistance to passengers in distress.3.	Through various social media platforms viz. twitter, facebook etc., Railways are in regular touch with passengers including women to enhance security of passengers and to address their security concern.4.	Frequent announcements are made through Public Address System to educate passengers to take precautions against theft, snatching, drugging etc.5.	Drives are conducted against entry of unauthorized persons in trains and railway premises.6.	Station Security Plan is being implemented at major stations in a phased manner to enhance access control, improve surveillance and achieve synergy between deployment of various security agencies on the station. 7.	CCTV cameras have been provided in 4010 coaches and 814 Railway stations for enhancing security of passengers.  8.	Emergency Talk Back System and Closed Circuit Television Surveillance Cameras have been provided in ladies compartments/coaches of all newly manufactured Electrical Multiple Unit (EMU) and Air-conditioned rakes of Kolkata Metro.  9.

An Pan-Indian initiative “Meri Saheli” was launched by RPF on 17.10.2020 with objective to provide enhanced safety and security to lady passengers travelling by trains for their entire journey i.e. from the originating station to destination station. The focus is to provide the security to lady passengers especially those travelling alone and to develop a sense of security among them. Teams of lady officers and staff have been formed who are well trained and briefed about the objective.10.
