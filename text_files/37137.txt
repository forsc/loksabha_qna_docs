ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF MINES, COAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI)(a) to (c): No, Sir. There is no uncertainty in the future of mining in the country due to various reasons such as legal frame work, overuse of resources and environmental issues.The Government has taken up major amendments in mineral laws since 2015 to meet the changing need of the mineral sector. The Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) (MMDR) Act, 1957 was amended in 2015 to remove discretion and bring in utmost transparency for the grant of mineral concessions; simplification of procedures and removal of delay; and for ensuring enhanced revenue from the mineral resources for the Government. Through the said amendment, the auction regime was introduced for grant of mineral concessions. Further, in order to ensure that benefit of mining reaches the persons, and areas affected by mining related operations, provision was incorporated for establishing District Mineral Foundation. Provision was also incorporated for establishing National Mineral Exploration Trust for the purposes of boosting exploration in the country.The Ministry of Mines has further amended MMDR Act, 1957 with effect from 28.03.2021. The objectives of the MMDR Amendment Act, 2021 inter alia are increasing mineral production and time bound operationalization of mines, increasing employment and investment in the mining sector, maintaining continuity in mining operations after change of lessee and increasing the pace of exploration and auction of mineral resources. These reforms will ensure self-sufficiency in mineral requirement of the country.*****
