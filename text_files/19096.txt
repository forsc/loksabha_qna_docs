THE MINISTER OF STATE (INDEPENDENT CHARGE) OF THE MINISTRY OF HOUSING AND URBAN AFFAIRS                                     (SHRI HARDEEP SINGH PURI)(a)       No, Sir.(b)	Does not arise.(c) 	    The selection process of Smart Cities was conducted through a competition in two stages. In the first stage, States/Union Territories(UTs) shortlisted potential Smart Cities based on predefined scoring criteria. In the second stage, competing cities prepared their Smart City Proposals (SCPs) as per guidelines and submitted them as part of the National competition. A total of 100 cities were selected as Smart Cities in Four Rounds of National Challenge from January, 2016 to June, 2018. (d)   	No, Sir.(e)  	As per the first stage of the selection process, the Government of Tamil Nadu conducted the intra-State competition and shortlisted eleven Smart Cities, viz., Chennai, Coimbatore, Erode, Madurai, Salem, Thanjavur, Thoothukudi, Tiruchirappalli, Tirunelveli, Tiruppur & Vellore . The city of Karur was not part of the initial shortlist prepared by the Government of Tamil Nadu. All the eleven cities shortlisted by Government of Tamil Nadu have been selected for development as Smart Cities by the Central Government through a nation-wide second round of challenge. As the Smart City Challenge has been completed with the selection of Shillong as the 100th city in June, 2018, it is not possible to add any more cities under SCM.                                        ……
