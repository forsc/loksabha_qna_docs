Institutional strengthening in district and states has been the major focus of this scheme till now. However, Ministry is now planning special programs/projects for skill development of youths in aspirational districts, backward districts, tribal districts, LWE and Border area districts. In addition, Ministry has also launched Adarsh Gram Skill Camp under SANKALP for Recognition of Prior learning (RPL) in identified villages across 11 States including State of Tamil Nadu. Five villages of State of Tamil Nadu have been identified to certify up to 120 candidates per village. Standard Training Assessment and Reward (STAR) Scheme, 2014 -15, was implemented by Ministry of Finance with an objective to encourage youths to take up short duration skill development training by providing monetary reward on the successful completion of training. Under this scheme about 14 lakh candidates were trained across the country and 8.6 lakh were reported placed. In this scheme 1.2 lakh and 1.1 lakh candidates were trained in the States of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, respectively.‘Udaan’ (2011-18) was a special skill development program, of Ministry of Home Affairs, for the youth of the Jammu & Kashmir, implemented with active support of industry. Under this scheme 38,942 candidates have been trained and jobs were offered to 24,193 candidates by the industry.  (c)        Under PMKVY, placement opportunities are being provided to candidates certified in short term training (STT). Since the implementation of PMKVY 2.0, i.e., 2016 as on 31.12.2021, 40.56 lakh candidates have been certified under STT; out of which, 21.17 lakh candidates have been provided with the placement including 2.95 lakh self-employed candidates in various sectors across the country.

Further, under PMKVY 3.0, placement is being facilitated through the involvement of District Skill Committees and Sector Skill Councils. In addition, Ministry has launched Aatmanirbhar Skilled Employees Employer Mapping (ASEEM) portal, which acts as a central directory of skilled workforce registered and certified under Skill India
