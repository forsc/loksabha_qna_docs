                                                        THE MINISTER OF  COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY  (SHRI PIYUSH GOYAL) (a)	& (b) CBIC, Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance on its own does not set up any Inland Container Depot (ICD) in the country.  The various proposals for setting up of ICDs received from developers are put before the Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC), which issues Letter of Intent to the developers in case the proposals are approved.  There is no proposal pending before IMC for setting up of ICD in Rohtak and Jhajjar.  Further, the Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme (TIES) is being implemented by Department of Commerce under which financial assistance is provided to Implementing Agencies of the Centre and States for setting up and up-gradation of infrastructure projects with overwhelming export linkages like the Border Haats, Land customs stations, quality testing and certification labs for exports, trade promotion centres, Export Facilitation Centre etc. There is no proposal pending under TIES for setting up of Export Facilitation Centre in Rohtak and Jhajjar. ********
