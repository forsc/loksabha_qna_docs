Buyers are being encouraged to adopt GPA payment method progressively.Department of Expenditure vide OM no.F.6/18/2019-PPD dated 3rd July, 2020 has also issued instructions related to prompt payment to suppliers against GeM Contracts. In order to bring more discipline amongst buyers for timely payments, the OM also has provision of charging of penal interest on payments delayed beyond prescribed timelines (https://assets-bg.gem.gov.in/resources/pdf/prompt-payment.pdf). The OM provides that the amount collected in this regard shall be deposited in an account maintained by GeM. GeM has also started provision for automatic generation of Provisional Receipt Certificate (PRC) and Consignee’s Receipt and Acceptance Certificate (CRAC) if buyers do not take actions on time.All above steps are expected to bring about more discipline amongst buyers and ensure timely payment to sellers.*****
