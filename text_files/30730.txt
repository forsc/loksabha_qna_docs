ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (c):    A statement is laid on the Table of the House.  Statement referred to in reply to Lok Sabha Starred Question No.*205 for answer on 13.12.2021(a) & (b): As per extant Guidelines, funds are provided to the States by Ministry of Tribal Affairs under the Scheme ‘Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS)’ and ‘Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution’ for development of tribals that includes areas under Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP), Modified Area Development Approach (MADA), Clusters etc. As informed by Government of Uttar Pradesh, there is no ITDP in Jhansi and Lalitpur Districts. Works / activities / projects approved by the Ministry under the Scheme / Programme during 2018-19 to 2020-21 were related to Education, Health, Agriculture, Horticulture, Animal Husbandry, Drinking Water & Sanitation, Road Connectivity, Skill & Entrepreneurship Development, Livelihood & income generation activities etc. The amount of fund released to the States under the Scheme ‘SCA to TSS’ and ‘Grant under Article 275(1) of the Constitution’ during 2018-19 to 2020-21 and utilization thereof reported by them is at Annexure 1.State Governments also utilize funds earmarked under State Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) for the development of STs in the Integrated Tribal Development Projects (ITDP) area. The amount of fund allocated as State TSP by the States is at Annexure 2. As informed by Government of Uttar Pradesh, details of expenditure made for tribal development in Uttar Pradesh including ITDP Areas is at Annexure 3.(c): NITI Aayog has conducted evaluation study to examine the impact of implementation of SCA to TSS under which funding is given to States for various development projects. Major findings are as follows:i.	The evaluation recommended needs assessment study followed by a saturation plan to develop each village in a phased manner and funds should be allocated accordinglyii.	Measurable indicators that can help understand the level of inclusion and development of tribals in project activities should be clearly defined in the guidelines.  iii.	SCA to TSS scheme can create a portal similar to AWSC’s ‘e-utthaan’ which captures all relevant information starting from progress status to geotagging of projects being implemented.iv.	The SCA to TSS is a gap-filling scheme and hence, adopting a sector-wise approach can lead to concrete outcomes. Based on observations and suggestions in the evaluation report, Ministry has asked all States take proposals for key sectors namely Health, Education and Livelihood based on gap analysis so that Infrastructural gaps in key areas can be saturated.   Ministry has developed ADIGRAMS (Grant Management System) to monitor the physical and progress of grants released to States for various development projects.  Ministry has adopted the mechanism of appraisal and approval of projects submitted by the States through Project Appraisal Committee (PAC). While considering proposals received from State Government for funding, the PAC reviews the progress of projects already sanctioned during previous years.  Concurrence for release of funds is accorded keeping in view the following: (a) Availability of funds under the relevant scheme(s).(b) Submission of UC by the State Government of the funds released during previous years.(c) Physical progress report of already funded projects.(d) Data uploaded on ADIGRAMS portal.
