                                                    (a)	whether the Government would contemplate to add the provision in the Act to have Planning Board for every Panchayat by involving some technocrats and local elected representatives and non-elected officials to make perspective plans for villages, as Panchayats are vital organs of our democratic process and development and a significant part of funds are allotted to them? (b)	whether the Government would organise a study to explore the need for such Boards as mandatory? and (c)	if not, whether the Government is content with the present State of developmental planning by Panchayats?
