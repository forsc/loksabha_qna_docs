                                                        THE MINISTER OF MINES, COAL AND PARLIAMENTARY AFFAIRS(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a) & (b):  Granite being a building stone comes under Minor Mineral, as defined under clause (e) of section 3 of the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act, 1957 (MMDR Act). As per section 15 of the MMDR Act, 1957, State Governments have been empowered to make rules for regulating the grant of mining leases or other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith.  Therefore, the administration of mining of minor minerals including granite is completely within the domain of the respective State Governments.             However, the Granite Conservation and Development Rules (GCDR), 1999  has been framed by Central Government which aims at bringing uniform rules for conservation, systematic development and scientific exploitation of granite resources. Further, Ministry of Mines vide order dated 23.04.2021 has constituted a Granite and Marble Development Council for a period of three years to prescribe a uniform framework with regard to systematic and scientific exploration of Granite and Marble minerals throughout the country. (c): As per National Mineral Inventory data, the total reserves/resources of Granite (Dimension Stone) as on 01.04.2015 is attached at annexure-I. (d) : As per the information furnished by Indian Bureau of Mines (a subordinate office of Ministry of Mines), details of the quantum of Granite exported during the last three years are as under:(Value in Rs. ‘000)Commodity	Unit	Export		2018-19	2019-20(P*)	2020-21(P*)		Quantity	Value 	Quantity	Value 	Quantity	Value GRANITE	TON	6811728	102014060	6678131	102248504	7514833	113169599 *P-provisional (e):   In the year 2019-2020, export has decreased by 1.9% and in the year 2020-21increased by 12.5% on year basis.
