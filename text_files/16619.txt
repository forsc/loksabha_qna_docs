ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????            ( SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)  (a) to (d) :  Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) is being implemented since Kharif 2016 in the country on area approach basis for wide-spread calamities like drought, flood etc.,  which affect large areas.  However, to lower the basis risk the unit for assessment of crop loss for major crops has been reduced to village/village Panchayat level. Further, the scheme also envisages coverage of    localized risks such as hailstorm, landslide, inundation, natural fire and cloud burst and post-harvest losses  due to cyclonic rains, unseasonal rains and hailstorm, which affects comparatively smaller areas/plots and assessment of crop losses is made on individual farm level.  It is the endevour of the Government to lower the insurance unit for assessment of crop yield/losses with use of technology.As per scheme provisions, farmers are indemnified to the extent/percentage of crop losses against the defined Threshold Yield multiplied by sum insured as decided by the State Government.   Claim amount for wide spread calamites are calculated based on the yield data arrived from requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) conducted by the concerned State Government.  Claims per hectare are worked out as per following formula:  Threshold Yield (TY) – Actual Yield (AY)  --------------------------------------------------------  X  Sum Insured            Threshold Yield (TY)Where Threshold Yield for a crop in a notified insurance unit is the average yield of best 5 years out of past seven years multiplied by applicable indemnity level for that crop.Further, there  is also a provision to pay claims towards prevented sowing/failed germination and adhoc claims in case of mid season adversity to the insured farmers.  Major part the scheme is being implemented on Area Approach basis and claims are worked out as per above formula based on the season end yield data submitted by the concerned State Governemnt, therefore, reasons for crop loss/ claims are not looked into. Hence, reasonwise details i.e. due to flood, drought, excessive rainfall,  etc., of claims are not maintained for wide spread calamities under the scheme.    However,  separate data for losses due localized calamities including hailstorm as stated above is maintained separately.  Year-wise details of claims paid to insured farmers on account of crop losses due to natural calamities including hailstorm, excessive rains and storms under PMFBY since 2016-17 in the country and Maharashtra State are given  as under  : (Rs. in crore)Year	Claims Paid (All India)	Claims Paid in Maharashtra2016-17	16751	23172017-18	22054	32872018-19 (Provisional)	26672	59492019-20*(Provisional)	13893	5726* Most of the claims for Rabi 2019-20 and some claims for Kharif 2019 not fully reported.As per provisions of PMFBY admissible claims are generally paid by the insurance companies within two months of completion of Crop Cutting Experiments/ harvesting period subject to availability of yield data and total State share of premium subsidy from concerned State Government within time. However, settlement of claims in some States get delayed due to reasons like delayed transmission of yield data;  late release of their share in premium subsidy by some States, yield related disputes between insurance companies and States, non-receipt of account details of some farmers for transfer of claims and National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) related issues, etc.  However, DAC&FW is regularly monitoring the implementation of PMFBY including timely settlement of claims.*****
