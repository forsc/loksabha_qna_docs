ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER   OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (SHRI ASHWINI KUMAR CHOUBEY)(a)	No Sir. Government has not estimated the monsoon to be below average during the current year. Both the first stage Long Range Forecast issued on 15th April and the second stage updated Long Range Forecast issued on 31st May 2019 suggest that themonsoon seasonal rainfall 2019 for the country as whole is likely to be near Normal. Quantitatively, the monsoon seasonal rainfall 2019 is likely to be 96% of the Long Period Average (LPA) with a model error of ± 5%; the LPA of the seasonal rainfall over the country as a whole for the period being 89 cms. Copies of the press releases issued by IMD in this regard are attached as Annexure for ready reference.(b)	The monthly rainfall for the country as whole is likely to be 95% of the Long Period Average (LPA) with a model error of ± 9% during the month of July. The monthly forecast for July does not contain forecast for different parts of the country.(c)	The current weak ElNino conditions are likely to continue for some time and then to turn to neutral ENSO conditions during the second half of the monsoon season. Moreover, expected positive Indian Ocean Dipole conditions are likely to compensate the negative aspects (if any) of the unfavourable El Nino conditions, making the seasonal rainfall for the country to be near normal as predicted. (d)	Does not arise.
