                                                    (a) whether the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers has objected to the Ministry of Agriculture’s ban on three basic insecticides-Monocrotophos, Methomyl and Carbofuran which are declared extremely toxic/hazardous by WHO and European Union (EU);(b) whether it is a fact that inspite of recommendations of Anupam Verma Committee’s report constituted in 2013 which reviewed 66 insecticides and pesticides which were barred or restrictions were put on their use in 112 countries, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers ignored the extreme toxicity and potentially fatal nature of these pesticides and insecticides; and(c) if so, whether short-term profits for the industry should be the reason to take away the right to life of agricultural workers and farmers, or to do irreparable harm to the environment?
                                                





ANSWER




                                                        (a). No. Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers has requested Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare to hold wide-ranging stakeholder consultation before finalizing the Draft Order called the “Banning of Insecticides Order, 2020” notified on 14/05/2020, wherein 27 pesticides are proposed to be banned for import, manufacture, sale, transport, distribution etc.(b) & (c). Banning of a particular pesticide by a few countries based on some studies somewhere may not provide enough ground to take similar action in India without having adequate scientific evidence in Indian context. If a chemical poses unmanageable and unacceptable risk to human and animal safety or the environment, it may be banned after due socio-economic impact assessment. Anysuch chemical evaluation should be done using risk-based (not hazard based) approach which considers exposure for assessing risk to the human and animal health & environment due to specific use of the chemical.******
