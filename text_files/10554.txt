ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) to (d)   Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD) under Department of Atomic Energy collects environmental baseline data including ground water samples around the Uranium deposits, before mining is taken up.  As part of environmental baseline data collection around the Lambapur – Peddagattu region, Nalgonda district, Telangana, AMD has collected ground water samples from 25 private tube wells / hand pumps during the period November, 2018 to July, 2019. Out of the 25 samples, four are from hand pumps used for domestic purposes and balance 21 are from tube wells used for irrigation purposes. The four hand pump sample locations (from which the water is used domestic purposes) have Uranium values in the range of 6 to 48 ppb which is below the prescribed safety limit (60 ppb) by Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB). The Uranium values in the balance water samples vary from 1 to 2,618 ppb. Thirteen out of the twenty-five water samples have Uranium content less than 60ppb. The data has been shared with Government of Telangana.Most of the sample locations with high Uranium contents fall in cultivated land where the water is used for irrigation purposes. High uranium content in the ground water from granitic country rock is a common occurrence in such type of terrain. Further as per information received from Department of Drinking Water & Sanitation, the supply of safe drinking water in Lambapur-Peddagattu area of P. A. Pally Mandal in Nalgonda district is by surface drinking water through ‘Akkampally Balancing Reservoir’ under mission Bhagiratha and the area no longer depends on ground water sources.In addition, Rural drinking water is a State subject and Government of India supplements the efforts of State government by providing financial and technical assistance to provide potable water to rural population through the centrally sponsored scheme Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM). While allocating the funds to States/UTs under JJM, ten percent weightage has been given to the population residing in habitations affected by chemical contaminants. The funds provided under JJM can be utilized for taking up schemes in water quality affected areas on priority.*****
