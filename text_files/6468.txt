As per the reports available in the market, about 30% of the existing workforce would require re-skilling/ upskilling to stay relevant and about 50-60% of the workforce would require re-skilling/ upskilling on continual basis in emerging technologies to retain the edge that India has in the IT sector due to growing automation, emergence of disruptive as well as new technologies, etc.To align the IT industry of India with the dynamic world market, NASSCOM - a Sector Skill Council under aegis of Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) has launched FutureSkills platform on 19.02.2018.

As on date, FutureSkills has offered training to approximately 6 lakh candidates. Further, to reskill and upskill IT-professionals to be adept with the emerging technologies National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) under the aegis of MSDE has established ‘Future of Work’ initiative.
