ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE (DR. MANSUKH MANDAVIYA)(a)	to (e) A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO LOK SABHASTARRED QUESTION NO. 91* FOR 3RD DECEMBER, 2021(a) to (d) Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) are estimated to account for 63% of all deaths. 3% overall mortality is attributable to diabetes. In a report “India: Health of the Nation’s States” by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), it is found that there is an increase in proportion of deaths due to NCDs (among all deaths) from 37% in 1990 to 61% in 2016 and decrease in proportion of deaths due to Communicable Diseases (CDs) (among all deaths) from 53% in 1990 to 27% in 2016.  This shows an epidemiological transition with a shift in disease burden to NCDs. The exact number of patients suffering from Diabetes in India is not known. As per 10th edition of Diabetes Atlas 2021 of International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the estimated number of patients of diabetes between the age group of 20-79 years is 74.2 millions in year 2021 and it is estimated to be increased to 124.8 millions in year 2045. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) conducted a study “The ICMR INDIAB Study – A Compendium of Type 2 Diabetes in India: Lessons Learnt for the Nation” and published in 2017. The prevalence of diabetes is more in urban area as compare to rural areas in the country. The incidence of diabetes is higher in the metro cities and lower in the smaller cities and still lower in the villages. (e) Health is a State subject. The Department of Health & Family Welfare, however, provides technical and financial support to the States/UTs under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS), as part of National Health Mission (NHM), based on the proposals received from the States/UTs. Diabetes is an integral part of the NPCDCS. Under the program, all age-groups, including children, are covered. A population-based initiative for prevention, control and screening for common Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) i.e. Diabetes, Hypertension and common Cancers has been rolled out in the country under NHM and also as a part of Comprehensive Primary Health Care. Under the initiative, persons more than 30 years of age are targeted for their screening for common NCDs. Screening of these common NCDs is an integral part of service delivery under Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres.Furthermore, healthy eating is also promoted through Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). Fit India movement is being implemented by Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, and various Yoga related activities are being carried out by Ministry of AYUSH. In addition, NPCDCS gives financial support under NHM for awareness generation (IEC) activities for Diabetes to be undertaken by the States/UTs as per their Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs).Under Free Drugs Service Initiative of NHM, financial support is provided to States/UTs for provision of free essential medicines including insulin for poor and needy people including children. Furthermore, quality generic medicines including insulin are being made available at affordable prices to all, under ‘Jan Aushadhi Scheme’, in collaboration with the State Governments. The details of State/UT-wise funds allocated and utilized for last three years for National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) are enclosed at Annexure.
