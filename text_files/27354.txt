(d) to (f) : Due to superannuation, death, Voluntary retirement etc. of doctors and other staff, some posts in CGHS remain vacant.In order to ensure that the healthcare facilities to CGHS beneficiaries are not impacted, contractual Staff including services of retired Doctors and other staff are engaged against vacant posts as an interim measure till the posts are filled up on regular basis.
