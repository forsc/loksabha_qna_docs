                                                        ???????  ??? ?????? ???????? ??? ????? ?????? (???? ??? ??????)  THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE & INDUSTRY(SHRI SOM PARKASH) (a) & (b): 	Yes, Sir. Government of India has undertaken several reform measures to cut down number of approvals required and reduce procedures while setting up shops and eateries. Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), through the Business Reforms Action Plan, has been encouraging  States and Union Territories (UTs) to undertake reforms to eliminate the requirement of renewal under The Shops and Establishment Act  and remove the need for inspection prior to registration. Timelines for grant of registration has also been mandated to be minimized under the Public Service Delivery Guarantee Act (or equivalent) legislations at State-level, along with implementation of a Single Window System for online submission of applications. (c) & (d): 	DPIIT is spearheading the exercise for improving overall business regulatory environment in the country by streamlining and reforming existing regulations and processes and eliminating unnecessary requirements and procedures through the Business Reforms Action Plan (BRAP) exercise across many reform areas. For e.g., Ministry of Corporate Affairs has introduced SPICe+ and AGILE PRO form which combines various applications for PAN/TAN/Director Identification Number/GSTN, etc. into a single form, leading to reduced time and procedures required for a company''s incorporation. DPIIT is also coordinating with Ministries/Departments and States and UTs since January 2021 to reduce/minimize compliance burden for business. The objective of this exercise is to improve Ease of Doing Business by Simplifying, Rationalizing, Digitizing and Decriminalizing Government to Business Interfaces. The key focus areas of the exercise are:a.	Rationalization/Auto-renewal of licenses / certificates / permissions.b.	Risk-based / Third-party Inspections and Audits.c.	Standardized and simplified return filing.d.	Rationalized maintenance of registers.e.	Minimize / eliminate display requirements.f.	Digitization and simplification of manual forms and records.*****
