                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a): Yes, Sir. Few airports of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) are facing congestion during certain periods of the day, when  the flow of passengers shoots up and exceeds the existing capacity of the airport terminals. The detail of airport wise capacity with passenger handled during 2019-20 at AAI airports is at Annexure.(b) to (e): Development / upgradation of airports is a continuous process and is undertaken by Airports Authority of India (AAI) from time to time depending on the availability of land,  commercial viability, socio-economic considerations and traffic demand / willingness of airlines to operate to/from such airports.  To meet the demand,  AAI has embarked upon a Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) plan of Rs. 25,000 crores in next 5 years for development / modernisation / upgradation of AAI airports in the country. The timeline for completion of airport upgradation works depends upon many factors such as land acquisition, availability of mandatory clearances, financial closure, etc.
