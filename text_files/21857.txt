MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI RAMESH POKHRIYAL ''NISHANK'')(a) & (b): Department of School Education and Literacy, Ministry of Education is implementing the scheme of Samagra Shiksha, effective from 2018-19. Under Samagra Shiksha, there is a provision of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas (KGBVs), which are residential schools from class VI to XII for girls belonging to disadvantaged groups such as SC, ST, OBC, Minority and Below Poverty Line (BPL). KGBVs are set up in Educationally Backward Blocks (EBBs) of a State/UT where the female rural literacy rate is below the national average. The Girls’ Hostels sanctioned in earlier scheme of Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) have been merged/converged with KGBVs under Samagra Shiksha.  	A total of 587 KGBVs have been sanctioned in the State of Andhra Pradesh as on 11.01.2021. Out of it, 499 KGBVs are operational. (c): 	The Samagra Shiksha scheme supports States for strengthening of school infrastructure including toilets. Under norms for intervention for infrastructure development defined in the framework of Samagra Shiksha, there is a provision of adequate number of toilets with water facilities in each school separately for boys, girls, staff  and teachers and differently-abled children. The scheme also envisages an annual recurring composite school grant varying up to Rs. 1,00,000/- per annum depending upon the number of students, for all Government Schools. Each school is required to spend at least 10% of the composite school grant on activities related to Swachhata Action Plan for maintenance and repair of school building including toilets and other facilities to keep the infrastructure in good condition.The Department of School Education & Literacy launched the Swachh Vidyalaya Initiative (SVI) in 2014 in collaboration with States/UTs, Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) and Private Corporates for provision of separate toilets for girls and boys in all government schools. Under this initiative, 4,17,796 toilets including 1,90,887 girls’ toilets were constructed/made functional in 2,61,400 government schools (in the one year period) upto 15th August, 2015.*****
