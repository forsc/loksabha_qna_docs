ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????      (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a):  the percentage increase in Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for Kharif crops since 2019-20 is given at Annex.(b) to (d):   Government fixes MSPs on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP), after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned.           While recommending MSP, CACP considers various factors viz. cost of production, overall demand-supply situations of various crops in domestic and world markets, domestic and international prices, inter-crop price parity, terms of trade between agriculture and non-agriculture sector, likely effect of price policy on rest of economy and a minimum of 50 percent as the margin over cost of production.            Each mandated MSP crop has different cost of production on account of difference in input used, yield, rainfall, resource endowment etc. However, while recommending MSP, CACP ensures that’s all mandated crops at least get a minimum of 50 per cent return over its cost of production.
