                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF HOME AFFAIRS(SHRI NITYANAND RAI)(a): As per data on Police Organisations compiled by Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D), out of the actual strength of 20,91,488 police personnel in States/UTs as on 01.01.2020, the strength of women police personnel is 2,15,504 which is 10.30%.(b) & (c):  “Police” is a State subject falling in List-II (State List) of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. It is primarily the responsibility of the State Governments/UT Administrations to recruit police personnel including improvement   of   gender   balance   in   police   force.   The  Centre  also  issues advisories to the States for increasing number of women in the police forces. The Ministry of Home Affairs has issued advisories dated 22.04.2013, 21.05.2014, 12.05.2015,   21.06.2019 and 22.06.2021 to all the State Governments to increase the representation of women police to 33% of the total strength. All the State Governments have been requested to create additional posts of women Constables/Sub-Inspectors by converting the vacant posts of male constables. The aim is that each police station should have at least 3 women Sub-Inspectors and 10 women police Constables, so that a women help desk is manned round the clock.States have also been advised to strengthen welfare measures for women police personnel such as provision of housing and medical facilities and conducive work environment.*****
