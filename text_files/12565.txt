ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF PANCHAYATI RAJ(SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a)	Under Article 243 G of Constitution, Panchayats have been mandated for preparation and implementation of plans for economic development and social justice. Thus, Panchayats have a significant role to play in the effective and efficient implementation of flagship schemes/programmes on subjects of national importance for transforming rural India. With this aim, People’s Plan Campaign titled ‘Sabki Yojna Sabka Vikas’, for inclusive and holistic preparation of Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) was launched from 2nd October, 2019 to 31st December, 2019 as was done in 2018-19 as well from 2nd October, 2018 to 31st December 2018. In this endeavor, convergence is sought with all Departments relating to 29 devolved subjects listed in XIth Schedule of the Constitution.  The objectives of ‘Sabki Yojna Sabka Vikas’ broadly include strengthening of elected representatives and Self Help Groups, evidence based assessment of progress made in 2019-20 and proposals for 2020-21 in all 29 subjects of XI Schedule, public disclosure on Schemes, finances etc. and the preparation of inclusive, participatory and evidence based GPDP for 2020-21 through structured Gram Sabha involving front line workers/ supervisors of all 29 sectors of XI schedule.(b)	The campaign seeks to help Gram Panchayats (GPs) in preparation of convergent and holistic GPDP through identification of sectoral infrastructural gaps in respective areas. The approval of GPDP for the year 2020-21, well in advance, will provide GPs full year for implementation and effective monitoring of works. The States will, thus, be in full readiness for effectively utilising the resources available with them and other schematic interventions under GPDP during 2020-21.(c)	Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas is an effective strategy for ensuring the preparation of GPDP in a campaign mode by endeavouring to converge all resources available at Panchayat level related to 29 subjects listed in the Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution. As such no separate allocation has been earmarked for Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas to States/UTs including State of Andhra Pradesh.*****
