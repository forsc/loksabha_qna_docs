                                                        THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR JAL SHAKTI & SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EMPOWERMENT(SHRI RATTAN LAL KATARIA)(a) & (b) Vamsadhara Water Disputes Tribunal (VWDT)  permitted Andhra Pradesh on 13.09.2017 to construct Neradi Barrage across the river Vamsadhara with ancillary structures which  as per the agreed resolution dated 04.09.1962, is between the two States. VWDT also permitted Andhra Pradesh to construct the Side Weir along with ancillary structures as proposed. As per VWDT order 23.09.2019, joint survey in supervision of Superintending Engineer, Planning Circle, Central Water Commission, Faridabad for identification of 106 acre land in Odisha territory on the left side of the Vamsadhara river for the proposed Neradi Barrage was planned from 11.11.2019. Principal Secretary to Government, WRD, Govt. of Odisha was requested to depute their Engineers. However Joint Survey could not be started  as an Special Leave Petition, Diary number 38986 of 2019, has been intimated by Govt. of Odisha as filed in Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, challenging the VWDT order dated 23.09.2019. (c)  VWDT has discussed and concluded that there would not be any meandering of river Vamsadhara due to construction of Side Weir at Katragada.*****
