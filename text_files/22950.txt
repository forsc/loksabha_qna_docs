Instances of sale/supply of labelled genetically modified (GM) food came to the notice of FSSAI through survey report titled ‘qPCR-based Detection of Genetically Modified Processed Foods in India ‘by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).On receipt of survey report, FSSAI issued notices in the month of August, 2018 to the concerned Food Business Operators.Food Business Operators responded that their products did not contain any GM ingredients and also supported their claim by providing test reports from NABL accredited labs.
