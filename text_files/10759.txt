ANSWER




                                                        (a) to (e):	A statement is laid on the Table of the House.STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) TO (e) OF THE LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. *367 TO BE ANSWERED ON 13.12.2019.(a):	The production of cotton in Andhra Pradesh State declined from 2014-15 due to bifurcation of the state in 2014, as major area under cotton cultivation went to Telangana State. Further, the downward trend of cotton production is mainly due to decreasing of cotton cultivation area in Andhra Pradesh. The drought like situation, deficient & erratic rains, dry & hot weather and soil moisture stress conditions could attribute to lower cotton production. The details of cotton production and area from the cotton year 2014-15 to 2018-19 are as under:- (Production in lakh bales of 170 kgs each)(Area in lakh hectare)Cotton Year (October- September)	2014-15	2015-16	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19(P)Production	26.50	23.75	19.00	21.26	14.50Area	8.21	6.66	4.72	6.46	6.21Source: Cotton Advisory Board     (P) - Provisional(b):	The textile mills in Andhra Pradesh do not pay higher taxes to procure cotton or cotton bales from Telangana.  However, the ginners and the traders have to pay 1% of cotton value towards market cess, if they purchase cotton or cotton bales from outside of Andhra Pradesh. (c) to (e):	The Government is implementing several schemes to support the Textile Industry which include the Amended Technology Up gradation Fund Scheme (ATUFS); Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITP); SAMARTH etc. The industries are availing benefits under these schemes for upgrading/reviving their textile units.  Further, to safeguard the interest of cotton farmers and to give them remunerative price of their produce, Government has  nominated Cotton Corporation of India (CCI), as a nodal agency to undertake Minimum Support Price (MSP) operations of seed cotton (kapas) in all cotton growing States. During the crop year 2018-19, CCI procured 0.50 lakh bales of seed cotton (kapas) under MSP in Andhra Pradesh.***
