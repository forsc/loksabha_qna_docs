                                                        (a)	  Dhubri to Sadiya (891 km) stretch of the river Brahmaputra was declared as National Waterway-2 (NW-2) and is operational for cargo and passenger movement.   Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) maintains the NW-2 for ensuring navigability.  Biswanath Chairali is located at chainage 470 km on north bank and Kaziranga National Park is located on south bank of the River Brahmaputra.  (b) & (c)  The Ministry of Tourism has taken the initiative of identifying, diversifying, developing and promoting niche tourism products including Waterways Routes in the country.   The inland waterways have enormous potential to develop cruise tourism.   To develop river cruise tourism on NW-2, Ministry of Tourism has sanctioned Rs. 12.45 crore (including GST) for development of 4 tourist jetties at Neamati, Pandu, Jogighopa and Biswanathghat.                                            *****
