                                                        THE MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE; AND MINISTER OF INFORMATION AND BROADCASTING {SHRI PRAKASH JAVADEKAR}  (a) Instances of  fake news in media have come to the notice of Government from time to time. Press Council of India (PCI) received 447 complaints regarding fake news in 2018-2019. Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology has taken note of media reports about spread of fake news, misinformation/ disinformation on Internet particularly using WhatsApp platform.(b) & (c) : The Press Council of India (PCI) has framed “Norms of Journalistic Conduct” for adherence by the media of publishing news which is accurate and fair. The PCI also has an institutional mechanism for redressing any complaints received by it, in accordance with the Press Council (Procedure for Inquiry) Regulations, 1979, and enables it to warn, admonish or censure a newspaper, news agency, editor or journalist, etc.With regard to electronic media, the Cable Television Networks (Regulations) Act, 1995 and the Rules made thereunder inter alia provide that no programme shall be carried out which contains anything obscene, defamatory, deliberate, false and suggesting innuendoes and half truths. Monitoring is done through a system of self-regulation by the News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) and the National Broadcasting Association (NBA) and the Broadcasting  Content  Complaints  Council  (BCCC) of the  Indian Broadcasting  (2)Foundation (IBF). The NBA has also formulated a Code of Ethics in broadcasting standards. The NBSA had issued an advisory dated 12.05.2016   to   its  members  that  manufacturing,  drawing,   tailoring  and   tutoring or creating any kind of false or fake news or an attempt to do so will be considered as a serious misconduct on the part of the broadcaster, irrespective of whether any ‘feed’ or ‘report’ so generated/created is aired or not. For Digital/Social Media, Information Technology Act, 2000 administered by Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology provides for action against fake news.   *****
