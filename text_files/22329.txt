MINISTER OF COAL, MINES AND PARLIAMENT AFFAIRS(SHRI PRALHAD JOSHI) (a) The rates of royalty on coal was last revised w.e.f. 10.05.2012 on the recommendation of a Study Group constituted under the Chairmanship of Additional Secretary, Ministry of Coal after due consultation with all the stakeholders. As per the Gazette notification dated 10.05.2012, the rate of royalty on coal (except the State of West Bengal) was revised at 14% ad-valorem.(b) Under Section 9(3) of the Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, the Central Government is empowered to amend the Second Schedule of the Act so as to enhance or reduce the rate of royalty on minerals, provided that the Central Government shall not enhance the rate of royalty in respect of any mineral more than once during any period of three years.(c)  A study Group was constituted on 21.07.2014 to consider revision of royalty on coal and lignite under the chairmanship of Additional Secretary, Ministry of Coal comprising of members from various stakeholders.
