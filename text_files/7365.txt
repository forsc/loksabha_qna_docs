                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)& (b) The Section 62 of the   Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 provides that the Central Government may, by notification, declare any wild animal other than those specified in Schedule I and Part II of Schedule II to be vermin for any area and for such period as may be specified therein and so long as such notification is in force, such wild animal shall be deemed to have been included in Schedule V. The Central Government on receipt of proposals from the State Governments, giving justification for declaring any wild animals as vermin, is competent to notify such wild animal as vermin. The Ministry in the past has notified some of the wild animals as vermin on receipt of the request of the State Government.   (c)  & (d) As per the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 hunting including  capturing, coursing, snaring, trapping, driving or baiting any wild or captive animal  is prohibited under Section 11 of the Wildlife protection Act 1972.  (e)  The measures taken by the Government to reduce human-wildlife conflicts are as follows:i.	Ministry through its Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) namely ‘Project      Tiger’, ‘Project Elephant’ and ‘Development of Wildlife Habitats (DWH)’ provides funds to States and UTs for carrying various activities for habitat improvement works namely restoration of natural water bodies, creation of artificial ponds, waterholes, augmenting food/fodder sources at various places within Protected Areas to minimize the human wildlife conflict.ii.	A network of Protected Areas namely viz., National Park, Sanctuaries, Conservation Reserves and Community Reserves covering important wildlife habitat have been created all over the country under the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 to conserve wild animals and their habitats.iii.	Construction/erecting of physical barriers, such as barbed wire fence, solar powered electric fence, bio-fencing using cactus, boundary wall etc. to prevent the entry of wild animals into crop field.iv.	The Ministry has approved a project for undertaking ‘Immuno-contraceptive measures’ for population management of wild animals.v.	The Ministry has issued guidelines in context of human-wildlife conflict to the Chief Wildlife Wardens of all the State Governments/Union Territory Administrations dated 24th December, 2014 and 1st June, 2015.vi.	To mitigate wildlife conflict along the linear infrastructures like rail tracks, roads/highways and power transmission lines passing through the Protected Areas and other wildlife rich areas, Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife has recommended that all linear infrastructure development Agencies, shall submit wild animals passage plan based on the WII Guideline “Eco-Friendly Measures to Mitigate Impacts of linear infrastructure on Wildlife”. These guideline suggest for modification in the designs of the linear infrastructures by way of providing eco-friendly structure which will ensure safe movement of wildlife across these linear infrastructures.vii.	Periodic awareness campaigns to sensitize guide and advise the general public on man-animal conflict, including dissemination of information through various forms of media.****
