ANSWER




                                                        THE MINISTER OF STEEL			   (SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a)to(c): The Government has not formulated any specific scheme for the disinvestment of Steel Plants.  However, the Government has recently introduced new Public Sector Enterprise (PSE) Policy for Atmanirbhar Bharat, which contains details including scope, classification and procedure etc. for future disinvestments.  As per the policy, steel production falls in non-strategic sector.  The revenue / disinvestment proceeds expected to be generated from disinvestment of Steel Plants cannot be assessed at this stage as it is dependent on the market conditions and investor interest at the time of the transaction.  (d)	Steel is a de-regulated sector.  Setting up of new Steel Plants is the commercial decision of the individual company both public as well as private sector, based on market dynamics. ********
