ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a) to (c)	The National Forest Policy, 1988 is the main policy document containing guiding principles for conservation, protection and management of forests in the country.  After wide consultations with all major stakeholders and incorporating their feedbacks, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has prepared a draft to update the existing National Forest Policy, 1988, and amongst other objectives, to give added focus on improving livelihoods of people based on sustainable management of forests for ecosystem services, increasing productivity of plantations, forest management for water and ecological security, addressing Climate Change issues, etc. The Government has not set any time limit to update the National Forest Policy, 1988.The draft National Forest Policy provides for promotion of tree plantation in degraded areas which will help in reducing the dependency on import of timber and other forest products by the country. Afforestation/reforestation may be taken up through Multi Stakeholder Public Participation only in (i) areas outside forests, (ii) revenue land recorded as forests but not notified as Forest, (iii) scrub/ degraded forest areas which are not wildlife habitats or of substantial ecological importance and (iv) areas managed by various local community organisations, after taking their explicit consent and also ensuring their participation. It will be ensured that no community rights of the communities are undermined and no provision of “the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006” and “the Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Area) Act, 1996”, etc is infringed.  ***
