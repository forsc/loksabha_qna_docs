                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, FOREST AND CLIMATE CHANGE(SHRI BABUL SUPRIYO)(a)	Under the Paris Agreement, India submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change outlining eight targets, including (i) to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33 to 35 percent by 2030 from 2005 level, (ii) to achieve about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel based energy resources by 2030 with the help of transfer of technology and low cost international finance including from Green Climate Fund (GCF), and (iii) to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. The other targets pertain to sustainable lifestyles; climate friendly growth path; climate change adaptation; climate finance; and technology and capacity building. These targets are for the period 2021-2030. (b)	The Government is implementing National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), which provides the overarching framework for all climate actions in the country. NAPCC comprises eight missions in specific areas of solar energy, enhanced energy efficiency, sustainable habitat, water, sustaining Himalayan ecosystems, Green India Mission, sustainable agriculture and strategic knowledge for climate change. These missions outline a number of steps to simultaneously advance India’s development agenda and climate change related-objectives of adaptation and mitigation. 33 States and Union Territories have also prepared State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) consistent with the objectives of NAPCC. The line-Ministries have been requested to revise the Missions based on NDC targets. The States have also been requested to revise their SAPCCs consistent with NDC targets. (c)	The SAPCCs indicate capacity building, education and awareness initiatives on climate change at different levels including communities, civil society, etc. in the State. National Mission on Sustainable Habitat (NMSH) is one of the eight Missions under NAPCC. NMSH is being implemented through three flagship missions/programmes namely Swachh Bharat Mission, Smart Cities and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). The aim is to adapt and mitigate green house gas (GHG) emission to achieve sustainability. All these mission/programmes emphasize on capacity building at various levels of Government i.e. national, state and urban local bodies.*****
