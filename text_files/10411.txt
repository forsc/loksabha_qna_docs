Out of which, 494 Km length has been commissioned and an expenditure of `8,246 crore has been incurred upto March 2019. The timely completion of any Railway project depends on various factors, like quick land acquisition by State Government, forest clearance by officials of forest department, shifting of infringing utilities (both underground and over ground), statutory clearances from various authorities, geological and topographical conditions of area, law and order situation in the area of project site, number of working months in a year for particular project site, due to climatic conditions, cooperation and zeal of State Government for early completion of project, encountering unforeseen conditions like earthquake, flooding, excessive rains, strikes of labour, orders of Hon’ble Courts, situation and conditions of working agencies/contractors etc.  All these factors affect the completion time of the project, which is finely worked out at the completion stage.(b) and (c) Railway has taken up work of Khurda Road-Bolangir New Line (289 Km), costing `3798.80 crore. Expenditure incurred upto March, 2019 is `1327.09 crore and an outlay of `350 crore has also been provided in the Budget 2019-20. This Project is of 289 km length and divided into two parts. 1st part is from km 0 to km 112 and 2nd  part is from km 112 to km 289. 1st part (km 0 to km 112) is fully funded by Railway, while, 2nd part (from km 112 to km 289) is on cost sharing, in which, the land is to be provided free of cost by Government of Odisha along with sharing 50% cost of construction. So far, 92 km length of the project has been completed and commissioned. Land acquisition and forestry clearance have been taken up in balance section and work taken up in available land.In the overall interest of the nation and for smooth execution of work a lot of monitoring is done in Railways at various levels (field level, divisional level, zonal level and Board level) and regular meetings are held with the officials of State Government and authorities concerned to resolve the issues that are obstructing the progress of projects.*****
