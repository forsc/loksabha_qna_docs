These Gulf countries have already been granted upto 13 points of call in India including three points in Kerala alone viz.Trivandrum, Kozhikode and Kochi. Further, these three airports of Kerala have also been designated under 18 tourist destinations and are allowed to the designated airlines of SAARC(excluding Pakistan and Afghanistan) and ASEAN countries for operations of unlimited frequencies. The Indian carriers are free to operate any number of flights from any airport in India including Kannur to international destinations available under the bilateral Air Services Agreements. With regard to operation of Cargo flights of foreign designated carriers, India has adopted a policy of Open Sky for Cargo which permits the foreign airlines to operate any number of cargo flights to/from any airport in India including Kannur International Airport.
