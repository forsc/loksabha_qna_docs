ANSWER




MINISTER IN THE MINISTRY OF CHEMICALS AND FERTILIZERS(SHRI D. V. SADANANDA GOWDA)            (a),(b),(c) & (d):	No, Sir.(e):	 The primary responsibility of ensuring access to essential medicines to people lies with the State Governments as Public Health and Hospitals are State subjects. However, under the National Health Mission (NHM), financial and technical support is provided to the States/UTs for strengthening of their healthcare delivery system including for provision of free essential drugs to those who access public health facilities, based on the requirement posed by the States/UTs in their Programme Implementation Plans. All the States/UTs have reported that they have notified free drug policy in their respective States/UTs. Government of India has taken several other initiatives to increase accessibility and affordability of medicines. Some of these are Ayushman Bharat, promotion of generics, PradhanMantriBhartiyaJanaushadhiPariyojana (PMBJP) and Affordable Medicines and Reliable Implants for Treatment (AMRIT) stores, etc.	Under the PMBJP scheme, quality medicines are sold to the public at very affordable prices through dedicated retail outlets.  The Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of a medicine sold under this scheme is fixed at such a level that it is 50%-90% below the average price of top selling three brands of that medicine. As on 17.07.2019, 5447 such retail outlets are opened in the country. Out of this, 4042 retail outletshave been opened in rural areas of the country. In the State of Bihar, 154 retail outlets are opened, of which 123 are opened in rural areas.*******
