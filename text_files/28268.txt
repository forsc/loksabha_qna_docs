ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance(a) to (e) State Bank of India (SBI) has apprised that as per Reserve Bank of India (RBI) policy, Bank engages Business Correspondents (BCs)/nominated agencies for financial inclusion activities, who in turn engages Customer Service Point(s)/Centre(s) (CSPs). The commission for CSPs is decided by the BCs through an agreement between BCs and CSPs wherein sharing pattern for commission differs from BC to BC. SBI pays the commission amount directly into the account of CSPs through automated process by Centralized Commission Payment Module (CCPM) Portal. There is no nexus between SBI and the BCs (nominated agencies) as all the transactions are done in a transparent manner governed by a Service Level Agreement between the Bank and BCs.*****
