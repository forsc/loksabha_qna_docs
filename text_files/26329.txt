MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a) to (d): A Statement is laid on the Table of the House.*****STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (a) to (d) OF LOK SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 197 RAISED BY SHRI RATANSINH MAGANSINH RATHOD, HON’BLE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT TO BE ANSWERED ON 2.8.2021 REGARDING JAWAHAR NAVODAYA VIDYALAYAS(a) & (b): The Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme envisages opening of one Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV) in each district of the country. As on date, 661 JNVs have been sanctioned, out of which 580 JNVs are functional from permanent campus, construction work is in progress at different stages in 64 JNVs and 17 JNVs could not be constructed due to non-receipt of land from concerned State Government. The list of 17 JNVs is given below:<pre>S. No.StateName of JNV1Arunachal PradeshCapital Complex (Itanagar)2AssamKamrup Metro3BiharKhagaria4ChhattisgarhKondagaon5DelhiEast Delhi6West Delhi7North Delhi8South Delhi9North East Delhi10Shahdara11South East Delhi12Jammu & KashmirSrinagar13Kulgam14JharkhandPalamu-I15West BengalMalda16Cooch Behar17South 24 Paragana-I</pre>(c) & (d): Construction of permanent buildings for JNVs is a continuous process, which depends upon the willingness of the concerned State Government/UT administration to make available requisite suitable land free of cost in favour of Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) for construction of the permanent building. For opening of JNVs, the concerned State Government/District Administration has to provide 30 acres of land free of cost and free from all encumbrances along with sufficient temporary accommodation to run the Vidyalayas for 3-4 years or till own permanent buildings are constructed. Regular follow-up is being made with the concerned State Government for providing suitable land, free of cost for construction of the 17 JNVs mentioned above. Further, the progress of construction work is also monitored regularly with construction agencies to expedite the on-going construction work.*****
