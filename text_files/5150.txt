US$ 737 million has been incurred on carrying out these exploration activities.(c) The production from an oil well depends on various factors such as reservoir profile, location, geological conditions etc. Over a period of time, the production from a well declines due to multiple reasons including aging/maturing of the well. In India, most of the production under nomination regime is from matured/aged fields/wells. In mature fields production declines over a period of time and subsequent revival of these wells is a continuous and dynamic process and is an intrinsic characteristic of any oil field. Exploration & Production (E&P) companies make efforts to revive such wells by using techniques such as periodical well intervention, workover jobs, well simulation jobs including hydro-fracturing, installation of suitable artificial lift systems and side-tracking of wells etc.***********
