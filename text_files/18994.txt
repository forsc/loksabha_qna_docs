ANSWER




                                                        The MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(SHRI RAVI SHANKAR PRASAD)(a)	to (c):	Currently, Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) is not governed by any legislation. As far as alternate dispute resolution mechanism is concerned, at present arbitration and conciliation is governed by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. As far as mediation is concerned, there is no stand-alone law on mediation. However, the Commercial Courts Act, 2015 provides for Pre-Institution Mediation and Settlement Mechanism (PIMS) in all commercial cases wherein no urgent relief is contemplated.In order to create an effective implementation framework for ODR in India, NITI Aayog in June 2020, had set up a Committee under the Chairmanship of Justice A.K.Sikri, Retired Judge, Supreme Court of India to develop an action plan that can aid in mainstreaming ODR and thus promote access to justice through ODR.	  The Committee has placed  the first draft of the report in public domain in November 2020, which also contain steps to spread awareness like running a comprehensive campaign utilising multimedia platforms to guide the public on the ways to use ODR processes, leverage social media presence to highlight ODR success stories to encourage people to adopt ODR etc.*****
