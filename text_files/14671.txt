State Governments have been entrusted with the responsibility for earmarking industrial space for e-waste dismantling and recycling facilities, to undertake industrial skill development and establish measures for protection of health and safety of workers engaged in dismantling and recycling facilities of e-waste. (c):  The approximate estimated generation of e-waste in the financial year 2017 -2018 for twenty-one electrical electronic equipment as listed in the schedule – I of the E-waste (Management) Rules, 2016 based on the sales data of 244 producers is 7,08,445 tonnes.
