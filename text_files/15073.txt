Instances of violation of law and involvement in illegal activities by some illegal immigrants have also been reported. All State Governments/UT Administrations have been advised to sensitize the law enforcement and intelligence agencies for taking appropriate prompt steps for identification of illegal migrants, their restriction to specified locations as per provisions of law, capturing their biographic and biometric particulars, and cancellation of fake Indian documents. They have been further advised to start legal proceedings including initiation of deportation proceedings as per provisions of law and to share with UIDAI the particulars of those illegal migrants who have wrongfully obtained Aadhar Cards for appropriate legal action.Detection and deportation of illegal migrants after due process of nationality verification is a continuous process.
