ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER  OF AGRICULTURE AND FARMERS WELFARE???? ??? ????? ?????? ??????     (SHRI NARENDRA SINGH TOMAR)(a) & (b):	 The prices of agricultural produce are determined by supply and demand conditions in the market on a day-to-day basis. Apart from demand and supply conditions, quality of produce, weather condition, seasonality, availability of stocks and international prices are also affecting the prices of agricultural produce. Price of agricultural produce tends to fall during and after harvesting season due to increase in market arrival of new crops. 	The annual average wholesale prices of major pulses for the last five crop years are given below:Pulses	Annual Average Wholesale Prices (Rs. per Qtl.)	2014-15	2015-16	2016-17	2017-18	2018-19	2019-20 (upto Jan ‘20)Arhar 	5082	8226	5824	4275	4727	5631Moong 	7226	7690	5755	5282	5742	6549Urad 	5938	9852	8107	5328	5104	6067Gram	3641	5194	7504	5123	4630	4658Masur 	5794	6863	5816	4362	4411	4997                Source :Directorate of Economics & Statistics, DAC&FW	     The Government ensures fair prices for farmers through Minimum Support Price (MSP) and procurement of pulses under Price Support Scheme (PSS) and Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF).(c):	      The details of State/UT wise production of major pulses in the country for the last three years are given at Annexure I.(d)&(e):    The recently launched Umbrella Scheme “Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan” (PM-AASHA), comprising the Price Support Scheme (PSS), provides for a holistic arrangement for assurance of a remunerative and stable price environment for farmers.	      The Government fixes Minimum Support Price (MSP) of 22 mandated agricultural crops, including five major pulses, on the basis of recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) after considering the views of State Governments and Central Ministries/Departments concerned and other relevant factors. The Union Budget for 2018-19 had announced the pre-determined principle to keep MSPs at levels of one and half times the cost of production. Accordingly, Government had increased MSPs for major pulses in 2018-19 and 2019-20.  The MSP for pulses for the Crop years 2014-15 to 2019-20 is given at Annexure-II. (f):	      The Government has allowed export of all varieties of pulses, including organic pulses, without any quantitative ceilings in November 2017. However, for export through non-EDI (non-Electronic Data Interchange) Land Customs Stations (LCS), the exporter will have to do prior-registration of quantity with Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT). Till date, no export restriction has been imposed on pulses.
