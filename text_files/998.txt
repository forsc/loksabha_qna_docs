ANSWER




                                                        The Minister of State (IC) in the Ministry of CIVIL AVIATION      (Shri Hardeep Singh Puri)(a) & (b): Government of India, Ministry of Civil Aviation has granted ''site clearance'' approval to Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor Development Corporation Limited (DMICDC) for setting up of a Greenfield Airport for public use near Bhiwadi, District Alwar, Rajasthan on 18.11.2015. However, any new Greenfield Airport requires two stage clearances i.e. ''Site Clearance'' and ''in-principle'' approval. In case of proposed airport at Bhiwadi, the site clearance has been granted and further development would depend on submission of application for ''in principle'' approval alongwith Detailed Project Report (DPR) and other information such as economic viability, financial closure, etc. relating to the airport project. DMICDC has informed that DPR for the proposed Greenfield Airport at Bhiwadi has been prepared by Airports Authority of India (AAI) and further State Government is yet to notify the land and initiate steps for acquisition of land for the airport project.
