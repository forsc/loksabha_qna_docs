                                                        ANSWERMINISTER OF STATE FOR FISHERIES, ANIMAL HUSBANDRYAND DAIRYING(SHRI PRATAP CHANDRA SARANGI)(a) to (e) :  The Department of Fisheries, Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying has taken various steps over the years for development of fisheries in the country including in the coastal regions in a sustainable and responsible manner and the steps taken include the followings: (i)	Implementation of the Centrally Sponsored Scheme: Blue Revolution: Integrated Development and Management of Fisheries during the past 5 years from 2015-16 to 2019-20 with a central financial outlay of Rs. 3000 crores to catalyze the “Integrated, Responsible and Holistic Development and Management of the Fisheries Sector”. (ii)	Launching of a flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY)- A scheme to bring about Blue Revolution through sustainable and responsible development of fisheries sector in India with highest ever investment of Rs. 20,050 crores in the fisheries sector, for implementation over a period of five years from FY 2020-21 to FY 2024-25 in all States/Union Territories including Andhra Pradesh. The PMMSY intends to address critical gaps in fish production and productivity, quality, technology, post-harvest infrastructure and management, modernisation and strengthening of value chain, traceability, establishing a robust fisheries management framework and fishers’ welfare. PMMSY inter-alia provides financial supports for setting up of cold storages for fisheries, purchase of boats and other fishing related equipments.(iii)	 The Government of India, in 2018-19, extended the facility of Kisan Credit Card (KCC) to fisheries and animal husbandry farmers to help them meet their working capital needs. (iv)	Creation of Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) at a total outlay of Rs. 7522 Crores to address the infrastructure gaps in the fisheries sector, which contains provisions for concessional financing to Eligible Entities (EEs), including State Governments/UTs and State entities for development of identified fisheries infrastructure facilities including cold storage, processing and introduction of deep sea fishing vessels. (v)	Creation of dedicated Department of Fisheries under the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying with a view to provide sustained and focused attention towards the development of fisheries sector including welfare of fishermen and other fisher-folk & strengthening of their livelihoods.    The Government of Andhra Pradesh has reported that no cold storages for fisheries and fish processing units have been set up by the Government of Andhra Pradesh. However, there are several cold storages and fish processing units have been established in the State by the private entrepreneurs either on their own or by availing assistance under various schemes/programmes of Government.  (f):  The new Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) and other schemes implemented by the Government all these years have been primarily aimed at overall development of fisheries sector and fishermen and fish farmers’ welfare. Further, the PMMSY has several activities/interventions for fishermen and fish farmers’ welfare. Therefore, establishing a dedicated Fishermen Welfare fund does not arise.                                *****
