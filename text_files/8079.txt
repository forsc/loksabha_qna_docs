The major contributors in the operating loss of Rs. 4685 Crore in FY 2018-19 were the increase in fuel costs and the impact of foreign exchange rate variation. Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) costs increased from Rs 7363 Crore in FY 2017-18 to Rs 10034 Crore in FY 2018-19 i.e an increase of almost  28.9% in fuel rates over previous year. The impact of exchange rate variation led to an increase in expenses from Rs.31 Crore in FY 2017-18 to Rs.772 Crore in FY 2018-19. (c): Air India has accumulated losses and the Government is committed to the disinvestment of Air India. In order to effectively prepare Air India for disinvestment, the Government has prepared a plan to bring operational and financial efficiency in Air India. This plan focuses on the financial and operational efficiencies so that substantial increase in revenue or cost saving could be achieved. Also, operational and financial performance parameters and milestones fixed are regularly being reviewed by the Government.
