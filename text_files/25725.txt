ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS (SHRI DEVUSINH CHAUHAN)(a) 	With Government’s constant endeavor, the opportunities of digital services including e-Governance through various projects/ programmes are increasing in rural areas. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India has initiated the ‘Digital India’ programme with the vision to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge-based economy by ensuring digital access, digital inclusion, digital empowerment and bridging the digital divide. A large number of initiatives have been undertaken by Government for promotion of digital technology application across the country. Under e-Kranti, a total of 44 Mission Mode Projects (MMPs) are being implemented by various Central Ministries/Departments, States, and State Departments. These MMPs are providing services in the areas such as education, healthcare, agriculture, justice, land records, social benefits, local governments, rural development, women & child development, legislature, local language, transport, financial services, Income Tax (IT), Passport, Posts, etc.	MeitY is also implementing Common Services Centres (CSCs) scheme. CSCs are internet enabled centres operated by local entrepreneur, called Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs). Presently, the operational CSCs are transacting the various digital services by using the presently available mode of connectivity, such as, 2G/3G/4G, VSAT and wired broadband etc. As on 30th June, 2021, there are 3,99,675 CSCs functional in the country (including rural & urban areas), out of them, 3,00,955 CSCs are functional at Gram Panchayat or Census Village areas.	The installation of telecom towers, especially where 4G services are provided, increase the opportunity for digital services and e-Governance.Further, the statistics of e-transactions on e-Taal platform (https://etaal.gov.in/) gives an indication of increase in digital penetration and usage of e-Government tools in India. More than 7203 crore e-transactions have been recorded in year 2020 in comparison to 761 crore e-transactions in year 2015 for various services integrated with e-Taal portal.(b) 	The total number of villages where mobile towers have been installed till date State/UT-wise including Maharashtra is attached as Annexure-1. 	Telecom companies explore opportunities to expand their network coverage by installing new towers. The number of mobile towers in India has increased from 4,15,724 (as on 31-12-2015) to 6,63,411 (in 22-07-2021). Expansion of mobile towers is dynamic in nature and undertaken by the Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) and Infrastructure Providers Category-1 (IP-1) based on their CAPEX capacity, techno-commercial assessment and other parameters. Telecom Companies for most of the States/ UTs have expressed their inability to provide their future plan. However, for some of the States/ UTs they have provided the number of towers proposed to be installed in villages in the next financial year which is attached as Annexure-2.(c) 	The total number of towers installed in Ahmednagar, Kolhapur, Nandurbar, Jalgaon and Thane districts of Maharashtra during each of the last three years, telecom company-wise is attached as Annexure-3.(d) 	The total number of mobile towers installed across the country during the same period, State/UT-wise and telecom company-wise is attached as Annexure-4.
