                                                        (a)          To encourage women entrepreneurship, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) is implementing a pilot project named ‘Economic Empowerment of Women Entrepreneurs and Startups by Women’ in collaboration with Deutsche Gesellschaftfür Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) Germany. The project pilots incubation and acceleration programmes for women micro entrepreneurs to start new businesses and scale up existing enterprises in Assam, Rajasthan and Telangana. The project has the target to pilot the incubation programme with 250 women and the acceleration programme with 100 women. The first cohort of the support programme ended in April-May, 2020 and the second cohort has commenced in July, 2020.              Further, Govt. of India through Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) is implementing the Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), which has the target to generate self-employment opportunities through establishment of micro enterprises for non-farm sector. The maximum cost of projects is Rs. 25 lakh in the manufacturing sector and Rs. 10 lakh in the service sector. Benefit can be availed under PMEGP for setting up of new units only. Women are covered as special category under PMEGP and are entitled to higher rate of subsidy. Under the programme, 35 to 40% of the total margin money subsidy is disbursed to women.              Furthermore, Government of India through Department of Financial Services has launched the Stand-up India Scheme to facilitate Bank loans from Scheduled Commercial Banks between Rs. 10 lakh and Rs. 1 crore to at least 1 Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe borrower and at least 1 women borrower per bank branch for setting up a Greenfield enterprise in trading services or manufacturing sector.  (b)          Under the flagship scheme of MSDE, Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) (2016-20), of the 35 lakh women who have been skilled, 1,73,343 have been reported as self-employed. Of these, 2,355 women are from the state of Jharkhand. The district-wise break-up of these 2,355 women is available at Annexure-I. Besides, under the Stand-up India Scheme, out of a total of 95,765 loan accounts upto 14th September, 2020, 77,638 loan accounts (81.07%) have been extended to women entrepreneurs across the country. In the state of Jharkhand, out of 1,874 loan accounts, 1557 loans (83.08%) have been extended to women category entrepreneurs under the scheme. Further, Govt. of India through Ministry of Rural Development is implementing Skill development Training programmes through Rural Self Employment and Training Institutes (RSETIs) which has the provision of Bank Credit facility for setting-up micro enterprises by the skill trainees. RSETI program is currently being implemented through 585 RSETIs by 23 Leading Banks (both Public Sector and Private Sector as well as few Gramin Banks) in 33 States/UTs covering 566 Districts in the Country including 25 districts of Jharkhand.
