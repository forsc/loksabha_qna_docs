ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF EDUCATION(SHRI DHARMENDRA PRADHAN)(a): The Department of School Education and Literacy launched the National Mission onFoundational Literacy and Numeracy called National Initiative for Proficiency in Reading withUnderstanding and Numeracy (NIPUN Bharat) on 5th July 2021 under the aegis of CentrallySponsored Scheme of Samagra Shiksha. The mission aims to achieve universal foundationalliteracyand numeracy in primary classes.The Mission Guidelines lays down priorities and actionableagendas for States and UTs to achieve the goal of proficiency in foundational literacy and numeracyfor every child by grade 3. Detailed guidelines for the mission have been developed which includesthe codification of development goals and learning outcomes for age 3 to 9 years and Lakshya orTargets for Foundational Literacy and Numeracy starting from Balvatikato Grade III. The guidelinesfor implementation of the NIPUN Bharat mission has been uploaded on the Department’s websiteunder the link mentioned below:https://dsel.education.gov.in/sites/default/files/NIPUN_BHARAT_GUIDELINES_EN.pdf(b): As per the NIPUN Bharat implementation guidelines, assessment during the foundationallearning can be broadly categorized into two major areas, namely:1. School Based Assessment (SBA) through qualitative observation based on performance ofthe child in a multitude of experiences and activities. Various tools and techniques likeanecdotal records, checklist, portfolio, and interactions (through a holistic 360-degreeassessment with teacher, peers, family and friends) have been recommended to be used forassessment. Thus, the teachers at the foundational stage need to observe children as theyplay, work on their task, perform or interact among themselves, to assess children’s interestsand learning.2. Large-scale standardised assessmentfor assessment of the processes and functioning of theeducational systems (such as NAS, SAS, and Third-Party Assessments). The assessmenttools commonly used in conducting large scale assessment studies are multiple choicequestions (MCQ) and constructed responses are usually avoided to bring in objectivity in theprocess. These assessments are a mechanism to gauge how well learning is happening intheir state, districts, and blocks. In this regard, the National Achievement Survey (NAS)2021 has been carried out for assessing learning outcome of children in Grade III.(c) to (e): A specialized National Initiative for School Heads’ and Teachers’ Holistic Advancement(NISHTHA 3.0) for the foundational literacy and numeracy covering about 25 lakh teachers at theprimary level across all states and UTs has been launched in September, 2021.*****
