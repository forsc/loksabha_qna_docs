KVs are opened primarily to cater to the educational needs of the wards of transferable Central Government Employees including Defence & Para-Military personnel, Central Autonomous Bodies, Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) and Central Institute of Higher Learning (IHL) by providing a common programme of education. Proposals for opening of new KVs are considered only if sponsored by Ministries or Departments of the Government of India / State Governments / Union Territories (UTs) Administrations and committing resources for setting up a new KV. The proposals received from various sponsoring authorities found fulfilling the mandatory pre-requisite for opening of new KVs have to compete with other such proposals under the “Challenge Method”. Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan has not received any proposal for opening of additional new Kendriya Vidyalaya at Nasirabad, district Ajmer either from the State Government of Rajasthan or from the Defence Authorities.*****
