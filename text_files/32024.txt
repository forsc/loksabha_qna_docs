Key Infrastructural gaps identified in such villages with respect to various sectors of development in the State is given at Annexure. The STC mechanism envisages provision of Central Schedule Tribe Component and State Tribal Sub Plan budget for development of tribal and tribal areas.  Ministry has developed STC-MIS portal (stcmis.gov.in) for monitoring expenditure of all Central Government Ministries as per frame work designed by NITI Aayog.  The States have been  advised to submit their proposals as per gap analysis and utilize the State TSP and Central STC components so as to ensure infrastructural development of tribal villages.  (c & d):  Besides the schemes being implemented by the Central Line Ministries and State Governments, MoTA has also provided funds to the Government of Telangana under the schemes of ‘Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS)’, ‘Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)’ and ‘Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution of India’ as a gap filling measure for welfare and development of ST people including infrastructure development in tribal villages, as detailed below: (Rs. in lakh)Name of scheme	2018-19	2019-20	2020-21Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub Plan (SCA to TSS)	2850.32	5361.29	4191.00Development of PVTGs 	533.00	538.50	1460.50Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution 	3248.89	9973.28	2517.00   AnnexureAnnexure referred to in reply to the part (a) to (c) of the Lok Sabha Unstarred Question No. 3678 due for reply on 20.12.2021 Tribal Dominated Village wise infrastructure gap analysis - TelanganaS.
