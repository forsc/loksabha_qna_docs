The details of the schemes/ programmes are indicated  below: (i)  Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme(MGNREGS): MGNREGS is a demand driven wage employment programme which provides for the enhancement of livelihood security of households in rural areas of the country by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. It is a demand driven wage employment programme. There are 262 works which are permissible under MGNREGS, out of which 182 works are related to Natural Resource Management (NRM) and out of the 182 NRM works, 85 are water related. Out of total works, 164 works relate to agriculture and allied activities. Many works under the Scheme pertains to rural infrastructure like rural connectivity, rural sanitation related works, unskilled wage component for construction of Community Sanitary Complexes in convergence with Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), solid and liquid waste management, play fields, construction of buildings for Gram Panchayats, women self-help groups’ federations, cyclone shelters, anganwadi centres, village haats and crematoria, food grain storage structures etc. The permitted works under the Scheme promote planned and sustainable development of rural areas. The Ministry is also encouraging the States/UTs for preparation of GIS based plans following ridge to valley approach using Remote Sensing technology for NRM. Till now, such plans have been drawn for 1,20,723 out of 2,69,402 Gram Panchayats.(ii)    Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana–National  Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM): The  Ministry  is  implementing  DAY-NRLM,  to  tackle  the  problem  of unemployment,  especially  among  women,  in  a  mission  mode  with  the  objective  of organizing  poor  rural  women  into  Self  Help  Groups  (SHGs),  and  continuously nurturing  and  supporting  them  to  undertake   economic  activities  till  they  attain  appreciable  increase in income over a period of time to improve their quality of life and come out of abject poverty. Besides, Start-up Village Entrepreneurship Programme (SVEP), the sub scheme  under  DAY-NRLM,  has  the  objective  of  helping Self  Help  Groups  (SHG)  and their family members to set-up small enterprises in the non-farm sector. DAY-NRLM is working in the areas of Institution Building & Capacity Building, Financial Inclusion, Livelihoods (Farm & Non-Farm) and social inclusion and social development related issues for holistic development of the poor rural households. Keeping in view the development requirements for the program outreach and benefitting the   rural poor to a larger extent, the Ministry has proposed the following changes in the existing schemes-i.	Institution Building & Capacity Building: a.	Institution Building Cost to be increased from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 15,000 per SHGb.	Revolving Fund from Rs.10000-15000 to Rs. 20000-Rs. 30000 per SHGc.	Provisioning for Viability Gap Fund of Rs. 20 lakh (Max. ceiling) per Cluster Level Federationd.	Professional support cost at district level as part of IB/CB costii.	Financial Inclusion:a.	Interest subvention for SHGs across all districts in the country b.	Creation of a dedicated ‘Women Enterprise Acceleration Fund’ in order to facilitate financing to women entrepreneurs from financial institutionsiii.	Livelihoods:a.

Separate line of funding for the Aajeevika Grameen Express Yojanad.	Introducing One Stop Facility (OSF) Centers @ Rs. 3.5 Cr. per blockse.	Promotion of Clusters of non-farm entrepreneurs @ Rs. 5 Cr. per cluster(iii)   Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen KaushalyaYojana (DDU-GKY) and Rural Self Employment and Training Institutes (RSETIs): The  Ministry  of  Rural  Development   implements two  skill  development initiatives for poor rural  youth under the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM). These schemes are aimed at increasing employability of poor rural youth either for wage or self employment leading to economic and social development of youth in the rural areas by removing the hurdles of the rural livelihoods and by strengthening rural economy and income. DDU-GKY  is the placement  linked  skill  development  programme  for  poor rural   youth  under  NRLM which has been  in operation since September, 2014.  Skill development through Rural Self Employment and Training Institutes (RSETIs) is also being undertaken to enable a trainee to take bank credit and start his/her own Micro-enterprise. Some of these trainees may also seek regular salaried jobs.  (iv)    Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G): In order to achieve the objective of “Housing for All”, the erstwhile rural housing scheme Indira Awaas Yojana (IAY) has been restructured into Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana- Gramin (PMAY-G) w.e.f. 1st April, 2016.  Under PMAY-G, the beneficiaries are identified based on the housing deprivation parameters and 13 point exclusion criteria in Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011 and a new survey Awaas 2018 to identify the left out eligible households subject to due verification by Gram Sabha and completion of Appellate Process. Thus, the system generated/ Auto generated priority lists were circulated to the States/UTs for conduct of Gram Sabha verification and preparation of the GP/Village wise Permanent Wait List (PWL) of PMAY-G.(v)      Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY): PMGSY was started in the year 2000 with the objective to provide all-weather road connectivity to eligible unconnected habitations. The mandate of the scheme was subsequently widened and new interventions viz.  PMGSY-II  and  PMGSY-III  were  added  for  upgradation  of  the  existing  rural  road network  which  connect  habitations  to   various  facilities  and  services.  The implementation  of  the  ongoing  PMGSY  has  immensely helped  in  lifting  the  socio–economic condition of rural masses by providing them access to the various services and facilities, market place and employment opportunities in various forms. (vi)     Shyama  Prasad  Mukherjee  Rurban  Mission  (SPMRM): The  SPMRM launched  in  February 2016, has been formulated  with  the objective to stimulate local economic  development,  enhance  basic  services,  and  create well planned Rurban clusters. The mission takes cluster as a unit for development. 300 Clusters from all the States/ UTs are selected in the first phase of the Mission in Tribal and Non-Tribal categories. SPMRM provides the Critical  Gap Funding to the  projects which directly or indirectly bring economic growth. SPMRM aims to provide amenities in four categories viz Basic, Economic, Social and Digital and promotes economic growth through integrated and balanced investments with social inclusion. (vii)   Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY): SAGY was launched on 11th October, 2014 with the objective of creating model Gram Panchayats in different parts of the country. Primarily, the goal was to develop three Adarsh Grams under each Hon’ble Member of Parliament (MP) by March 2019.Thereafter, five such Adarsh Grams (one per year under each Hon’ble MP) were to be selected and developed by 2024. Under the Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana framework, the development of Gram Panchayats is envisaged through convergence and implementation of existing Government Schemes and Programmes under the administrative control of respective Ministries without allocating additional funds.  The GPs adopted prepare a Village Development Plan which is a roadmap for the holistic development of GP. The Hon’ble Members of Parliament (MPs) have adopted 2172 GPs for development under SAGY across the country till 28 July 2021, since 2014. Further, 51112 projects have been completed under the Village Development Plans (VDP).Frequent consultations and review of the schemes are carried out with the States through regular VC meetings, Performance Review Committee (PRC) meetings which are held twice a year in which all Rural Development programmes are reviewed by the Honorable Minister of Rural Development and Secretary, Rural Development. All the implementing departments (Rural Development/Panchayati Raj etc.) in the States/UTs participate in the Performance Review Committee meetings under the Chairmanship of their respective Principal Secretaries/Additional Chief Secretaries. Ministry of Rural Development also organizes a Common Review Mission (CRM) each year wherein States are visited to assess the performance of the programmes of the Department of Rural Development. The suggestions given by the States during these meetings are duly considered for improvement of implementation of these schemes.*****
