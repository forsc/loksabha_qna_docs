The guidelines, inter- alia, provide for due diligence before investment decisions including in matters of deposits with scheduled commercial banks by the CPSEs. The guidelines, apart from laying down broad contours/principles of investment of surplus funds by CPSEs put certain obligations on the Board of the CPSEs on matters relating to investment of surplus funds, including safety of fund, risk on yield, requirement of liquidity and applicable laws.   Further, the DPE guidelines stipulate putting in place proper system of regular reporting in such matters to the Board.  (c)to(e): Both Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL) have been dealing with Scheduled Commercial Banks listed in the 2nd Schedule of the Reserve Bank of India Act, for conducting financial transactions.   As informed by SAIL and RINL, investment of surplus funds, if any, is regulated within the framework of the DPE guidelines and policy/methodology approved by SAIL and RINL Boards.  All investment decisions are audited by Internal Audit, Statutory Auditors as well as the Government Auditors.********
