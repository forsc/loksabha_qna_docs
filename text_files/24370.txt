ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT (SADHVI NIRANJAN JYOTI)(a&(b)   The erstwhile Planning Commission  defined poverty line and estimated the number of people coming under poverty line, for both all-India and states (including Rajasthan), based on the large sample surveys on Household Consumer Expenditure carried out by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. Number and percentage of population below poverty line  by the States in 2011-2012 is given at Annexure-1.          The last BPL Census was conducted in 2002.   Recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of poverty, Socio Economic and Caste Census 2011 (SECC 2011) was conducted which  provides data of households on various aspects of their socio-economic status viz., housing, land-holding/landlessness, educational status, status of women, the differently abled, occupation, possession of assets, scheduled caste/ scheduled tribe (SC/ST) households, income, etc. The beneficiaries under several schemes of Government of India as well as many state governments are selected based on the (i) “automatically excluded households”, (ii) “automatically included households” and (iii) “deprived households” data of SECC-2011.       (c)     Development of rural areas  is being steered  through generation of employment, strengthening of livelihood opportunities, promotion of self-employment, skilling of rural youth, provision of social assistance and development of rural infrastructure. The Ministry of Rural Development has been implementing schemes such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana–National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), Deen Dayal Upadhyay–Gramin Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY),  Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana–Gramin (PMAY-G), Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY), Shyama Prasad Mukherjee National Rurban Mission (SPMRM) and National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) for the said purpose. ******
