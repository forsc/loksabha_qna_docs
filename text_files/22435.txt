ANSWER




                                                        MINISTER OF STATE FOR COMMUNICATIONS, EDUCATION AND ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (SHRI SANJAY DHOTRE)(a) 	BharatNet project is being implemented in a phased manner to create network to connect all the Gram Panchayats (approximately 2.5 lakh) with broadband in the country. The Phase-I of the BharatNet project has been implemented through three Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs) namely Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) and RailTel Corporation of India Limited and the execution of this Phase is almost complete. BharatNet Phase-II is being implemented through State-led Model, Private Sector Model and Central Public Sector Undertaking (CPSU) led Model by using an optimal mix of media (OFC, Radio and satellite). As on 08.03.2021, a total number of 1,54,596 Gram Panchayats (Including Block Headquarters) have been made Service Ready and 5,08,328 km Optical Fibre Cable has been laid.As regards the pendency of the work for providing Gram Panchayats (GPs) with satellite telecommunication facility under the project, it is mentioned that only about 5,200 GPs, located in remote and hilly locations with poor connectivity, are to be connected over satellite media so as to provide broadband connectivity to these GPs expeditiously. Installation has been completed at 3667 GPs, out of which 3652 GPs have been made Service Ready. It is further indicated that BharatNet is a challenging project of mega nature and the Gram Panchayats (GPs) are widely dispersed across the country in rural and remote areas. Since March 2020, pursuant to Lockdown and movement restrictions due to COVID-19 in the country, the project progress is affected. However, with the beginning of unlock phase, all efforts are being made to speed up the project implementation. (b) 	The State/UT-wise details are given in Annexure.(c)	As per the Union Cabinet approval dated 19.07.2017, the total estimated cost of BharatNet Project is Rs. 42,068 crore and it is to be funded from Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF). As on 31.01.2021, a total of  Rs. 26,431.10 crore has been disbursed by USOF for this project.
